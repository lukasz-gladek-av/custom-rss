              <p>As much as we all like to joke that “the PS5 has no games,” that’s simply not true. Mine has plenty of PS4 games on it! Ba-dum-tiss. Anyway, there are some awesome PlayStation 5 exclusives. The amazing and cute platformer <em>Astro Bot </em>won Game of the Year last year. <em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>is dropping in under a week. Plus people are still sleeping on 2021’s incredible third-person shooter roguelike <em>Returnal</em>. And then yes of course there really are a bunch of good PS4 games to check if you missed them last generation. A lot of them have great-looking updates too like everything going on with <em>The Last of Us </em>remakes and remasters. Point is there are lots of good games to play, but do you have enough storage space for all of them?</p>
<p>Expand you PS5 storage with the help of Seagate’s officially-licensed game drive for PlayStation consoles. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">This external hard drive connect to your system over USB 3.2 and will&nbsp; let you boost your capacity to store games by a full 2TB</a>. Right now, Amazon has the drive discounted down from $90 to just $80. A $10 savings may not sound like much, but that’s already halfway to getting you <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The PS5 base model only comes with 800GB of internal space (1TB on the Slim), and some of that isn’t even usable to you as it’s got all the system stuff on it that makes the console work. Really you’re working with roughly. The base model really has about 667GB while the Slim has a bout 842.2GB for you to work with, saving your games. This Seagate drive will more than triple your ability to store your game data. nor more deleting and redownloading.</p>



<h2>One Small Caveat</h2>
<p>There is a catch though. You can’t actually&nbsp;<em>play</em> you games off this external drive. The PS5 requires much faster read/write speeds than this supports. You might be thinking, “Okay, then what the heck is the point?” Well, this drive is still helpful because you can move you games from it to your internal drive when you want to play them. This is a much, much faster process than redownloading a game over the internet. Think of it like the digital version of taking your disc off the shelf and popping it into your console. The good news is you can play your PS4 games directly off of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">Unlike the internal SSDs available to expand your PS5 storage, this drive requires no tools to install as it just connects over USB.</a> That makes it totally portable so you can bring it over to a friend’s house and fire it up on their PS5 if you wish. Have your whole gaming library on the go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will<em> Resident Evil 9</em> struggle on Switch 2? Is the new <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch really broken or do players just need to be better at compiling their shaders? And where the hell is the next <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection</em>? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. While all the big gaming showcases have wrapped up, there are still a few more days of Tokyo Game Show proper until the last big gaming festival of the year wraps up. Then it’s on to the fall’s next batch of big game releases. Yes, I’m talking about you <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p> <h2>PlayStation boss touts PS5 as Sony’s most lucrative gaming box yet</h2> <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was the keynote speaker at Tokyo Game Show 2025 and his topic was the PlayStation Store. Covering its evolution and current financial dominance, he flashed a chart showing how revenues have kept climbing with each new console. What’s interesting is that this is happening despite PS5 sales tracking only slightly ahead of the PS4. So where is the growth coming from? In part its the explosion in microtransactions in free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nishino-san says PlayStation 5 is the most successful generation in PlayStation history. <a href="https://t.co/E5feupYHGr">pic.twitter.com/E5feupYHGr</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1971034274536272100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also the expansion of subscription services like PS Plus. And then there’s the fact that people are still playing on PS4, so even though the install bases are similar, the overall footprint of active PlayStation players spending money is seemingly larger. Plus the consoles keep getting more expensive. With graphs like this, did Sony really need to raise the price of the PS5 another $50 nearly five years after it launched? Either way, it’s an interesting data point amid debates about console makers going platform-agnostic. Will PS6 just be a PC with a PlayStation logo on it, or is Sony, like Nintendo, married to the hardware business long-term?</p>

 <h2><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next 2D action game is out in November</h2>  <p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is Heart Machine’s first stab at the Metroidvania formula and arrives the same year its loot shooter, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, entered Early Access. There’s a new trailer showing off more of the game about a high school student who forms a pact with a demon to uncover the mystery behind a catastrophe that’s befallen Sanzu city. It’s out on PS5 and PC on November 11.</p>

 <h2>One of the last significant updates for <em>The Witcher 3</em> has been delayed</h2> <p>CD Projekt Red’s fantasy RPG was supposed to get cross-platform mod support across PC and consoles before the end of the year. The update will <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewitcher.com/post/3lzochplzqc2h">now arrive in 2026</a>, but with no clear window for when players can expect it. Once it finally arrives, PS5 and Xbox Series X players will finally get to experience all of the extra fan-made content modders created for the PC version.</p>

 <h2>Gearbox has some advice if <em>Borderlands 4</em> is running poorly for you <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">after the latest patch</a></h2> <p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1971285941194195311">blames some initial reports</a> of even worse performance following the new update on shader compilation. Basically, the game has to recompile all of the shaders again, which can mess things up while running in the background. “Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing,” the studio wrote on X. “If you’re still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer’s approved method.”</p>

 <p>One fan offered <a href="https://x.com/Ki11ersix/status/1971286391964434615">their own tip</a>: “quit the game once after launching and relaunch it. Now travel into a zone and back out (Idolator Sol’s or a Vault will work) this should compile a BUNCH of shaders and start improving the smoothness.” Big-budget gaming in 2025 folks!</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 9</em> looks pretty decent in first Switch 2 hands-ons</h2>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is the first game in the survival horror series to come day-and-date to a Nintendo platform. Early impressions seem to be that while the game looks and runs best on PC and high-end consoles, the Switch 2 version still performs admirably, especially in hand-held mode. So far both <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have both been better than expected on Nintendo’s new console. Hopefully other third-party ports can continue the trend.</p> <h2>A <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster will arrive eventually</h2> <p>Fans waiting for news on the status of the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em> got an update via a panel at Tokyo Game Show. According to <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">a translation by X user Kuwabara357</a><span>, it will still take a little longer for the next batch of games to get ported. “The project is moving forward properly, and we believe it’s shaping up to be something enjoyable really,” Konami producer Noriaki Okamura reportedly said. “So please wait just a bit more, more information is coming.”</span></p> <h2><em>Payday 2</em> dev apologizes for price-gouging fans</h2> <p>The<em> Payday 2</em> Infamous Collection bundle, which contains every piece of DLC the multiplayer heist shooter has ever received, recently jumped in price from $118 to $170. Starbreeze also announced a new $5-a-month subscription option for players to access all of it. Fans obviously thought the timing of this was a bit cynical.</p> <p>“The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch—and they’re not wrong, it’s terrible timing,” Starbreeze’s Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/starbreeze-says-sorry-reverses-price-increase-on-payday-2-dlc-bundle-we-definitely-didnt-handle-this-right/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We definitely didn’t handle this right, and we’ll be apologizing to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-leaves-nintendo-of-america-2000628868">Nintendo is shaking things up at Nintendo of America with the retirement of Bowser</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-israel-palestine-gaza-phone-calls-xbox-cloud-2000628764">Microsoft has taken the first step toward addressing the Xbox BDS boycott over Israel</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s open world take on Japan will be the game’s biggest map yet</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>One of the big upcoming first-party PlayStation Studios titles is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-is-returnal-developer-housemarques-new-game-starring-rahul-kohli/1100-6529469/" data-ref-id="1100-6529469">Saros</a>, the next game from developer Housemarque. A spiritual sequel to Returnal, Saros builds on the foundation of that roguelike action game and is described as the "ultimate evolution" of the company's approach to gameplay-first adventures. Here's everything we know about the game so far, ahead of its upcoming release in early 2026.</p><h2 id="When_will_Saros_be_released_">When will Saros be released?</h2><p>Housemarque has set a release window of March 20, 2026, for Saros.</p><h2 id="Preorder_Saros">Preorder Saros</h2><p>Preorders are not yet available for Saros.</p><h2 id="Saros_trailer">Saros trailer</h2><p>The first trailer for Saros was released during the February State of Play event--check it out below. The trailer spotlights the setting, tone, and story. We think it looks pretty great.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-uBOF0T2FY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S-uBOF0T2FY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="Saros_platforms">Saros platforms</h2><p>Saros will launch on PS5, but Housemarque hasn't mentioned a PC release yet. Its previous game, Returnal, did come to PC two years after it first arrived on PS5, and with Sony adopting a multiplatform release strategy, it's likely that Saros will eventually find its way to this platform in the future.</p><h2 id="Will_Saros_be_PS5_Pro_Enhanced_">Will Saros be PS5 Pro Enhanced?</h2><p>Creative director Gregory Louden did confirm during State of Play that Saros will be PS5 Pro-enhanced, although what those exact enhancements are remains to be seen. Housemarque makes some of the best-looking games around, with Returnal being one of the more graphically impressive games on PS5 when it first launched. If that game is any indication, you can probably expect some terrific monster designs and particle effects for days when Saros launches.</p><h2 id="Saros_story__setting__and_characters">Saros story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Set on the planet Carcosa, Saros puts you in the boots of Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer who ison the hunt for answers on this lost off-world colony that is currently caught in the shadow of a very ominous eclipse. Housemarque says that it has crafted a haunting story for the game, one full of nightmarish monsters judging by the teaser trailer.</p><p>The studio also added that the game will feature a grounded voice-over, cinematics, audio logs, and conversations with several non-playable characters. There are also Soltari Holograms detailing what happened on Carcosa as you explore the planet, and collecting them will reveal what exactly happened on that planet. Housemarque added that there'll also be more surreal and mysterious storytelling sequences, but it won't be sharing details on them just yet.</p><h2 id="A_familiar_face">A familiar face</h2><p>Your eyes are not deceiving you, that is indeed actor Rahul Kohli lending his voice and likeness to Devraj. According to Housemarque, the Midnight Mass actor delivers a "grounded" performance in Saros. "Every time the sun dies, madness reigns, then everything begins again. "But after every death, I <em>always</em> come back stronger," Devraj says in the trailer.</p><h2 id="Saros_gameplay">Saros gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQiQC16w86I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JQiQC16w86I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Saros looks to be a game where aggression pays off, as Arjun wears an advanced combat suit that gives him several enhanced abilities. Every time you start a run, you can select your loadout from a mix of Soltari human weaponry and Carcosan alien weaponry. The September 2025 State of Play deep dive showed Arjun wielding the Soltari Phosphorous Shotgun, a weapon that can melt through enemies.</p><p>The other big difference between Saros and Returnal is that Arjun can charge straight into danger, thanks to the Soltari Shield. By holding R1, Arjun can absorb the energy from lethal projectiles and charge up a Carcosan Power Weapon to hit hard. Essentially, you can harvest the attacks of your enemies and throw it right back at them. The catch here is that Power Weapons also transform Arjun's right arm into an eclipse-fueled weapon, corrupting him in the process. It's a double-edged sword, but one that he can swing to gain an edge in combat.</p><p>If Arjun does fall in battle, he will have a "second chance" to cheat death and get right back into the thick of things. After discovering how to use eclipse corruption energy to rise back up on first death, Arjun can come back stronger and future runs will give him the option to upgrade his Soltari advanced combat suit and abilities.</p><p>"After every death you will face a changed world, but in Saros you will be able to choose and permanently upgrade your loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades to 'come back stronger' to overcome the challenges you face on Carcosa," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/announcing-saros-the-next-game-from-housemarque-coming-2026/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Housemarque explained</a>.</p><h2 id="Saros_screenshots">Saros screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443632-saros-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443632" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443632-saros-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443632"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443632-saros-6.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443633-saros-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443634-saros-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443635-saros-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443636-saros-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443637-saros-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443633,1300-4443634,1300-4443635,1300-4443636,1300-4443637" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443633-saros-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443634-saros-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443635-saros-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443636-saros-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443637-saros-5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443633-saros-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443634-saros-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443635-saros-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443636-saros-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443637-saros-5.jpg"></figure>

The update doesn't fix everything, though, and now developer Gearbox has given players some advice about how to addresses ongoing stability issues.</p><p>The developer said it's aware of players experiencing stuttering issues following installation of the new update, impacting performance. This is due to shader compilation that's occurring in the background during gameplay, which it said should clear up after 15 minutes of "continuous play." That's an unusual note, as shader compilation is typically handled during start-up, before you begin playing, in order to avoid just these sorts of issues.If the stuttering doesn't clear up after 15 minutes, Gearbox advised clearing your shader cache, which is a process specific to your graphics card's manufacturer.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The technical issues with Borderlands 4 prompted Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">post through it</a>, but he's since moved on to <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1970925490556002363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting a lot about the upcoming Now You See Me movie sequel</a>. Pitchford contributed to the magic elements of the movie and says he was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-more-involvement-now-you-see-me-borderlands-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more involved with that film that the Borderlands movie.</a></p><p>The September 25 patch for Borderlands 4 also added an FOV slider on console, which is something fans had asked for (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-notes-add-fov-slider-on-console-stability-and-performance-improvements-and-more/1100-6535022/" data-ref-id="1100-6535022">and something that can reduce performance</a>). The patch also made some balance changes to Vault Hunters, and even more are coming in another update that's planned for next week.</p><p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">Switch 2 edition has been delayed indefinitely and all digital preorders are being refunded.</a> Gearbox delayed the game to help add more polish and to support cross-saves.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4 review</a> and our roundup of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/" data-ref-id="1100-6533833">all the Shift codes.</a></p>

                <p>Despite heaps of critical praise at launch, Square Enix revealed in investor briefings that 2024's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/1100-6526552/" data-ref-id="1100-6526552">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth did not meet sales expectations</a>. Those disappointing sales figures shouldn't be of concern to you, though, as director Naoki Hamaguchi has stated that Part 3 will be a "proper, high-quality" series ender.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a> (and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-director-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-rebirth-sales-insists-the-trilogy-ender-will-be-a-proper-high-quality-send-off" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by IGN</a>), Hamaguchi said that although sales didn't meet Square Enix's marks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" data-ref-id="5000-566271">Rebirth</a> has picked up steam. Quite literally, too, as the game is performing well on PC, which will allows the team to do the third installment justice.</p>

<p>"The second entry, FFVII Rebirth, has been doing very well on both PS5 and PC," he said. "I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we'll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third installment."</p><p>Hamaguchi couldn't give specifics about the game or its name--since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-438559">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Part 3 is currently referred to as just that for now--however, he did tell Automaton that development is progressing smoothly.</p><p>“Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely," he said. "A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything."</p><p>As reported by IGN, Hamaguchi told German outlet <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/hamaguchi-ueber-das-schluesselwort-zum-dritten-teil-der-remake-trilogie-zu-final-fantasy-vii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JPGames</a> on September 25 that this third and final entry in the Remake trilogy will be a "suitable finale."</p><p>"In terms of development [of Part 3], we're working on that right now," he said. "We've got builds running where you can actually experience what that theme is through the gameplay. And we know where we're going with it. It's looking like it's going in the right direction, and we'll keep working on it and make it even better. So hopefully in the near future we'll be able to reveal some of that. And yeah, this is going to be the climax, the finale of the series. And we're going to make it a suitable finale, a really great send-off for the game. It will be something ideally we hope will please fans, will delight the fans of this much-loved series, and really reward everyone for sticking with us to the end. So look forward to that. More information in the not too distant future. It's all in safe hands!"</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launched on February 29, 2024, to rave reviews from fans and critics alike, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">GameSpot's review</a> scoring it an 8/10.

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The president of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) has signed a ban on loot boxes for under 18s into law. This ban is set to go into effect in March 2026.</p>
<p>This ban comes as part of <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2025/lei/L15211.htm">a wider digital protection law</a> aimed at protecting young people from abuse and exploitation online. Chapter seven of the law focused on electronic games prohibits loot boxes aimed at children or adolescents for games without an 18+ age rating.</p>
<p>In addition, the law requires games that are likely to have adolescents interact with other people through text, audio, or video messages to adhere to <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2024/Lei/L14852.htm#art16">legal safeguards.</a> These include a report system, information on the progress of said reports, and instruments to request review and reconsideration of imposed penalties.</p>

<p>Debates surrounding a loot box ban have been widespread and global for years now. Back in 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dutch-political-parties-back-gaming-loot-box-ban">Dutch political parties backed a loot box ban</a>, however after some deliberation there was no outright ban. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43906306">Loot boxes were declared illegal in Belgium back in 2018</a>, though in the following years<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-study-claims-belgiums-loot-box-law-isnt-being-enforced"> it's become clear this hasn't been strictly enforced</a>. The UK has slapped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-jagex-and-miniclip-broke-loot-box-advertising-rules">some game companies on the wrist due to not declaring loot boxes in advertisements</a>, but a ban has been far from reach.</p><p>As such, this Brazilian ban for under 18s is a big step forward for those against loot boxes, putting up barriers between what many consider gambling mechanics and younger people. It's been a long time coming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brazilian-authorities-to-investigate-loot-boxes">with investigations into loot boxes starting in 2021</a>. There remain two larger questions: will clear age ratings for games actually prevent young people from buying loot boxes in games they want, and will this law's implementation in a strong market for video games influence change in the industry at large?</p>

		<p>Krafton are teaming up with YouTube series Skibidi Toilet, pitting players against an invasion of sentient toilets. That’s a thing, it’s live now in PUBG Mobile and will launch on PC and consoles later in October.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG MOBILE X Skibidi Toilet | Collaboration Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEWqww6iCK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you are unaware of Skibidi Toilet, it was a viral short-form series “that has expanded into a global franchise spanning animation, consumer products, publishing, gaming, and more.” It has not, however, reached the part of South London I am currently working from, so here’s more from the press release as I have no bloody idea about Skibidi Toilet, it looks very silly.</p>
<p>“Set in an alternate reality, the series follows humanity’s struggle against the Skibidi Toilets, a powerful alien species of mechanized toilet hybrids. Their only hope lies with the Alliance, a coalition of humanoid warriors with cameras, speakers, and TV screens for heads,” say Krafton.</p>
<p>“The new Arcade mode will be available for two weeks on PC and consoles, where players take on the role of the Alliance to defend the world against the powerful Skibidi Toilets and Astro Toilets in a PvE boss battle,” they add. “Through the Event Pass, players can also unlock Alliance-themed outfits inspired by the Skibidi Toilet universe.”</p>

<p>You may be surprised to learn that sentient shitters have a long history of antagonising gamers, the elderly amongst you may recall being chased by munching water closets in the seminal 1984 classic, Jet Set Willy. They have been more useful in recent years with the crappers in Suda 51’s No More Heroes doubling up as a save point whenever you decide to do a number two.</p>
<p>In 2022 an entire horror game was set in a public bathroom, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCrw10P2hA8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Toilet Chronicles</a>. It has a “very Positive” rating on Steam although most comments are along the lines of “What the hell did I just play?”</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're excited to dive deep into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a> on 30th October, well, you'll be able to do that quite literally, as Square Enix has shown off a brand new region, added to Dragon Quest II specifically, in this remake (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-details-new-content-seabed">Gematsu</a>!).</p>
<p>The Seabed is (as you'd expect) an underwater region that you'll be able to access as soon as you get the boat. And it's here where you'll meet the merfolk, who live in the aptly-named Mersea. But there's no time to relax, as they're being threatened by monsters.</p>
<p>There are new dungeons and enemies to encounter, including Mariella, who is one of Hargon's (the big bad, in case you're new to DQII) Champions.</p>
<p>New story content will also be part of this new region; yesterday, during the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/roundup-all-the-reveals-from-the-xbox-showcase-at-tokyo-game-show-2025">Xbox Tokyo Game Show Showcase</a>, producer Haysaka Masaaki shared a small snippet of gameplay from the Seabed, which you can watch up-top.</p>


<p>We've been getting a lot of DQ I&amp;II news lately, which makes sense given that the game is out next month. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-trailer-showcases-the-remakes-fresh-features">Square Enix gave us a little peak at some other new content</a>, and this is where the Seabed was last teased. It was also shown off briefly during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x60H0alsB5w">Nintendo Direct on 12th September in Japan</a>.</p>

<p><em>Are you excited to check out the Seabed? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-%E2%80%9Cis-moving-forward-properly-%E2%80%9D-says-producer.1309749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Now that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">is out and in players' hands</a>, besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/">another Metal Gear Solid game being remade</a>, what players are looking for next from Konami, is Vol. 2 of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection.</p>



<p>Which is why it wasn't a surprise that during the Metal Gear Production Hotline at Tokyo Game Show 2025, the topic of where Vol. 2 is and when we'll get to see it came up. Translated by <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">X (formerly Twitter) user Kuwabara357</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/">VGC</a>), series producer Noriaki Okamura stepped up to be the one to try and satisfy players curiosity, but could unfortunately only add that Konami is still working on it.</p>



<p>"<em>It has certainly taken quite a while now,</em>" Okamura began. "<em>Since we called the first installment 'Vol.1,' it's only natural to expect a second one, and that's what we said years ago.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But, as we've repeated several times, we are making it. We've been working on it properly while also producing Metal Gear Solid Delta. At the right timing, we'd like to share with you all not only about its progress but also the direction going forward. I'm sorry, it feels like I always have to say this, but please wait just a little longer. How long 'a little longer' actually means, well, it's hard to say.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But the project is moving forward properly, and we believe it's shaping up to be something enjoyable really. So please, wait just a bit more, more information is coming</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="METAL GEAR - PRODUCTION HOTLINE at TGS2025(メタルギア公式) | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQMxcCpkI44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Vol. 1 of the Master Collection <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-release-october/">launched almost two years ago at the time of this writing</a>, and though, as Okamura points out, Konami has previously confirmed that a Vol. 2 is in the works, we've heard next to nothing about it, and which games will be included in the collection.</p>



<p>We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">seen rumours pointing to</a> Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain being the three games in the collection, but nothing concrete. If those are indeed the three titles going to be included, then it's not difficult for fans of the series to understand why Konami is taking its time with Vol. 2. </p>



<p>It's no small task to untangle MGS4 from the PlayStation 3's CELL architecture, which it was initially made on, and then improve it in all the ways players would expect from a game that's 17 years old now running on modern console and PC hardware. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-latest-updates-bring-major-performance-improvements-for-metal-gear-solid-4-red-dead-redemption-and-persona-5/">RPCS3 figured out how to get MGS4 running on a PC years ago</a>. If they can do it, surely Konami can. </p>

If that doesn’t work, Gearbox suggested manually clearing your shader cache via your video card manufacturer’s approved method.

Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.” This latest advice reads much the same to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, some players are recommending traveling to certain zones in the game to brute force shaders to compile before moving on to what they actually want to do in-game. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To expand on this: quit the game once after launching and relaunch it.

<p>It's no big deal, right? I'll be able to play just fine with the sound off, I told myself.

<p>Reader, at the time, it was the end of the world.</p>
<p>I was on this plane on 5th September, a mere 24 hours after finally getting my hands on Silksong — one of my most-anticipated games <em>ever</em>. I had put maybe three hours into it the day before, but I was saving myself for the big flight because, well, I'm pretty terrified of air travel and there's nothing like a bit of bug depression to take your mind off being in a pressurised tin can, thousands of feet in the air.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that I decided to bravely soldier and play the damn game regardless. I knew how sound worked in Pharloom at this point, and I knew that it would probably hurt my exploration as a consequence of being without it. But my options were to plough on sans headphones, or read the safety information booklet for the eleventh time and do some breathing exercises.</p>
<p>I returned to my save file and prepared myself for four hours of non-ideal playtime. Three steps into the rainy streets of Greymoor, and all of my stresses dissipated. Why? Because Team Cherry knows how to rumble. HD Rumble, that is.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1bb206182b5d0"><a title="Silksong Rumble" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1bb206182b5d0/silksong-rumble.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As my beloved Hornet stepped out from the area's initial cover and into the downpour, I felt the faint pitter-patter of the drops rumbling in my Joy-Con. Of course, HD Rumble 2 itself is far from news to me — yeah, I paid attention in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> — but these raindrops immediately drew my attention to it in a way that I hadn't noticed it on the console so far.</p>
<p>It wasn't the big buzz I felt when getting punched by a Pilgrim Groveller or Binding that made me perk up and pay attention to the rumble, but these tiny, inconsequential raindrops. Why? Because I hadn't even noticed it was raining in the area.</p>
<p>Without the distraction of sound, I suddenly became acutely aware of how HD Rumble 2 was being used to tell me something I might have otherwise missed. It's easy to tell when a pesky Pharlid is going to pop up from underground once you learn the rumble that announces its arrival. Likewise, that one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/i-have-no-words-silksong-fans-are-losing-their-minds-over-one-bench">nasty trap bench</a> in Hunter's March is far easier avoided if you feel for the click of the spikes before they come swinging down.</p>
<p>Pleasantly pleased with my discovery, I started dashing around Pharloom, taking great joy in the initial <em>BZZT</em> and ensuing mini-<em>bzzts</em> that mark Hornet's initial boost and subsequent speedy steps. I might have been missing out on the odd map thanks to my inability to hear Shakra's singing, but I was exploring in a whole new way.</p>

<p>My tactile travels led me to the Chapel of the Beast in Hunters March, where a series of ever-growing vibrations signposted that something very big and very scary was stomping about inside. As all those who have ventured into this area can attest, there is indeed something very big and very scary inside, and I only wish that I had listened to the intensity of the rumble and taken it as a message to <em>steer clear</em>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I kept on playing in such a manner, guiding my movements via the rumble. The big boss at the end of Act 1 was a pain in the butt, but my soundless attempts would have taken me days was it not for the gradually-increasing rumble letting me know when an off-screen shock attack was heading my way.</p>
<p>Before I had a chance to feel even more like Aragorn tracking an army of Uruk-hai by placing my palm to the ground and feeling out the footsteps, the plane landed and I packed my Switch away.</p>
<p>I had a lovely holiday, thanks for asking. It was mainly spent reading books in the sun and trying to think about anything other than the dark depths of Pharloom. But, rest assured, I made a point to charge my headphones for the flight back.</p>
<p>There's no denying it; the Silksong soundscape is <em>fantastic</em>. Larkin's strings have damn near brought me to tears on several occasions, I grin like a fool whenever I hear Shakra's "Ooshka-ah-aah-ro, kai-lai-lai-lai, ooshka-ro", and the singe of heat or chill of cold comes with its own little aural pang that really sells the '<em>I need to move right now</em>'. I wouldn't want to play the game in its entirety without it, but good grief, it's <em>still</em> a wild ride for those brave enough to reach for the mute button.</p>
<p>So go on, take those headphones out, turn the volume down to zero, or otherwise plug your ears up for a second and take a quick tour around the rumbling roads of Pharloom. Trust me, it's not a feeling to be missed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo of America president and COO Doug Bowser (yes, really) has announced he will step down from the company at the end of the year, and his replacement has already been appointed by the Japanese gaming giant.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Bowser, who has spent "more than a decade in multiple leadership positions" at Nintendo, will retire from the studio on December 31st. He'll be replaced by current marketing executive VP Devon Pritchard, who will also be joining the NOA board of directors.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo's American division will gain Satoru Shibata as its CEO, although he'll be continuing to serve as managing exec and corporate director of Nintendo as a whole as well. That's a heck of a lot of plates to juggle.</p>

<p>Fils-Aime was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-inducted-into-video-game-hall-of-fame" rel="nofollow">inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame</a> in October that same year, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-joins-gamestops-board-of-directors" rel="nofollow">join GameStop's board of directors</a> shortly before the pandemic began (and around ten months before the whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-stock-trading-halted-due-to-sudden-spike" rel="nofollow">GameStop stock debacle</a> kicked off).</p>

<p>Bowser hasn't revealed what he's intending to do next, but he did express pride in what he'd achieved during his time with Nintendo, "in both business results and the experience we've created for consumers".</p>

<p>He also praised his replacement, Devon Pritchard, calling her "exceptional" and pointing to her promotion as "a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to [Nintendo's] growth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-doug-bowser-switch-2.jpg?itok=KYmDAiFJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-doug-bowser-switch-2.jpg?itok=lMpM2seN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Doug Bowser's final major launch at Nintendo was the Switch 2 earlier this year.</figcaption></figure><p>During his tenure with Nintendo, the company says Bowser "deliver[ed] on the promise of the Nintendo Switch" and "helped establish [the Switch 2] as the best-selling video game console of all time", which isn't a bad track record.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Bowser does next, but given the way corporate America works, I'd be very surprised indeed if we don't see him popping up on another board of directors somewhere. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Over the past decade or longer, game file sizes have really started to balloon larger and larger. Some titles even clock in over 100GB. So get yourself a solid internal SSD like the Kingston NV3 drive. It’s available in sizes up to 4TB and is currently on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">Breaking down the different models and discounts, let’s start with the smallest. Kingston has 500GB option for its Gen 4×4 SSD</a>. That one normally goes for $54, but it’s now down to just $39 — saving you $15. Going up, we have the 1TB model. That’s usually $80, but the sale has it to just $58 — a savings of $22. The 2TB is $43 off, bringing it from&nbsp; $158 to just $115. Then lastly we have the massive 4TB model going for $230. That’s a $91 discount off of the starting price of $320. All discounts work out to between 27-28%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Load Times</h2>
<p>The Kingston NV3 SSD has remarkable read and write speeds, coming in at up to 6,000 MB/s for read speeds and up to 5,000 MB/s for write speeds. That means quick load times in all your games. Hope you’re good at them because you’ll have hardly any time to read those quick tips that appear while waiting for levels to load. Those speeds will also help with plenty of non-gaming tasks ranging from video editing to working with large datasets — really any kind of hardware intensive workflow.</p>
<p>Check the specs of what you’re looking to install it on. So long as your laptop, tower, or mini PC has support for PCle 4.0, you’ll be good to go.</p>



<p>If you’re not a PC gamer and are instead looking to expand to storage of your PlayStation 5, it is compatible but with a catch. You will have to separately pick up a heatsink. These little metal casings are used to help dissipate heat to prevent overheating. They’re pretty easy to install into your PS5. You can just follow any number of video tutorials on YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">For a limited time, you can save up to $91 on this internal SSD from Kingston</a>. Choose between four different capacities, starting at just $39.</p>

And it's the adorable papercraft puzzler, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paper_trail">Paper Trail</a>.</p>
<p>Developed by Newfangled Games, Paper Trail is a cute little puzzle game where all the solutions involve folding paper to create pathways and solutions. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paper-trail">We absolutely loved it</a> when it launched back in May 2024, and we're so glad to see it get a rather gorgeous limited edition.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the EDITION releases, Paper Trail will come with a custom collectible mailer box, a developer interview and essay booklet, slip case artwork from Moy Lee, a gorgeous poster, a colour-thematic inner slipcase, four art cards, an authenticity card, and a second poster with unique artwork and checklist on the back.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vgyptu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>So far, EDITIONS has been on a roll with its wonderful physicals of hit indie titles.The most recent releases, prior to Paper Trail, were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arco">Arco</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Norco</a> (the latter isn't on Switch; one day, we hope!). Plus, the company has repeatedly committed itself to game preservation, partnering with DoesItPlay.</p>
<p>Marketing Director at Lost in Cult Ryan Brown <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">has spoken with us about the issue</a>, and with yesterday's announcement, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/toadsanime.lostincult.co.uk/post/3lzohix27vn2h">reiterated the pledge</a> that "We test all of our Nintendo Switch physicals on the Switch 2, ensuring they also run fine on there, too" to ensure that no release requires the internet to start playing.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-development-difficulties/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-ix-remake-development-may-be-going-through-some-difficulties-new-insider-information-suggests.1309695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake revealed via <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/">a massive NVIDIA GeForce Now leak a few years ago</a> is the only leaked Square Enix game that has yet to be officially announced, and if the information shared online by an insider with a solid track record is any indication, its official announcement will probably still take some time.</p>



<p>A few days ago, Reddit user TomAto314, whose claims of having access to insider information are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lkhd4k/comment/nepsfts/?context=3">backed by their reveals</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-website-remake/">Timeless Tale record released in time for the Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary celebrations</a> ahead of official announcements, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lkhd4k/comment/nepsfts/?context=3">claimed</a> that the game has been in their company's database for three years, they have never received a build for testing, and all updates on it only mention a delay until 2024, which doesn't sound very promising.</p>



<p>While the user has a solid track record to date, we have to take the information they have provided with a huge grain of salt. Nonetheless, it does <span>align with what other known insiders, such as Nate Drake, previously said&nbsp;regarding the project's status, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-trouble-canceled/">development troubles and even cancellation</a>, so there's a high chance it&nbsp;</span>is still a long way from release, if development is still proceeding.</p>



<p>Although the status of the rumored Final Fantasy IX remake is uncertain, PC players can enjoy the ninth entry in the series with vastly improved visuals and new features thanks to the Moguri Mod. The 9.0 version of the mod, released last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-moguri-mod-9-0-download/">introduces improved field backgrounds, reworked battle backgrounds, and more</a> for a vastly improved experience.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/recettear-and-trails-localizer-andrew-dice-passes-away.1309692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Andrew Dice, perhaps better known as one half of the localization studio Carpe Fulgur, has passed away, and his partner has declared that the studio is ceasing operations as a result of his untimely death.</p>

<p>News of Dice's death was <a href="https://x.com/BlondRobin/status/1971245608184000738" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shared on social media</a>&nbsp;by fellow Carpe Fulgur founder Robin Light-Williams, who simply announced that their "friend and business partner Andrew Dice...has passed away", and that "pursuant" to Dice's death, "Carpe Fulgur will be ceasing operations".</p>

<p>Light-Williams didn't share any cause of death for Dice, and there hasn't been an official announcement regarding his death from anyone else close to him either (at least, not a public-facing announcement).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-localizer-andrew-dice-passes-away-game_0.jpg?itok=RLLg80nd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-localizer-andrew-dice-passes-away-game_0.jpg?itok=4NCUO5Zd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Andrew Dice, together with partner Robin Light-Williams, was responsible for the localization of 2010's&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't heard Dice or Carpe Fulgur's name, you'd probably know them from some of their work. Their first foray into localization was 2010's&nbsp;<em>Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale</em>, which marries dungeon exploration with shop management in a similar way to 2018's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter" rel="nofollow"><em>Moonlighter</em></a>.</p>

<p>Following&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, developer EasyGameStation released&nbsp;<em>Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters&nbsp;</em>in 2011, and Carpe Fulgur provided localization services for that game as well, in addition to Japanese developer Lizsoft's game&nbsp;<em>Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone</em>.</p>

<p>You may also know Carpe Fulgur from its assistance with the translation of 2015's worldwide release of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC</em>, although personal struggles prevented Dice and Carpe Fulgur from seeing the project through to its conclusion.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>project manager <a href="https://x.com/Hatsuu/status/1971367628389351701" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leona Renee</a>, he and Carpe Fulgur were also engaged in translating that game, so it sounds like Carpe Fulgur might have been ramping things back up prior to Dice's passing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-carpe-fulgur-andrew-dice.jpg?itok=MP0pam6p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-carpe-fulgur-andrew-dice.jpg?itok=6o5A77Ym 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dice and Carpe Fulgur apparently worked on&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>prior to the former's death.</figcaption></figure><p>As far as we know, Dice, Light-Williams, and Carpe Fulgur were not involved in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>remaster</a> (at least, not in a capacity beyond their involvement in the original), and it's unclear whether the game will use their original translation or sport a new one.</p>

<p>It's fair to say Dice and his studio were extremely influential in the localization of hitherto-underexposed Japanese games, so his passing will likely be felt in the industry for some time to come. My thoughts go out to his friends and family at this difficult time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>When Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility">announced the launch date</a> of its first Asus-powered handhelds <em>without</em> announcing prices, I had hoped it was a sign the <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">leaked prices</a> were too high. I had hoped Microsoft would subsidize them the same way <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial">it subsidized the Xbox itself</a>. Maybe it would send a shockwave through the handheld market <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">like the Steam Deck’s console-like $399 price</a> did in 2021!</p></div><p>I was too optimistic. Instead, Microsoft’s flagship handheld “Xbox” is a $1,000 portable — or $599 if you opt for a far weaker model.</p><div><p>On Thursday, Microsoft and Asus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784286/xbox-handheld-ally-x-price-preorder">opened preorders for the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally at $999 and $599</a>, respectively, or €599 and €899 in Europe, £499 and £799 in the UK, and $799 AUD and $1599 AUD in Australia.</p></div><p>One way to think about this is that they’re priced like PCs instead of consoles, which makes sense because they literally are Windows PCs! Here, “Xbox” is only a layer of games, services, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak">a new full screen experience</a> on top of a Windows machine.</p><p>But though “priced like a PC, not an Xbox” might make sense today, it may not make sense tomorrow. This could be the new normal for Xbox, and possibly for consoles period.</p><p>Everything we know about video game consoles is being flipped on its head. It used to be each console got cheaper and cheaper — but not anymore. As my colleague <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">Andrew Webster put it last week</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Established wisdom used to be that buying a game console at launch was a bad idea. It was the worst-possible version of the experience: launch consoles cost more and had fewer games, and often these consoles got not only cheaper but better over time, through revisions that made them smaller or added features. For the current generation, though, those who bought at launch look like geniuses — video game consoles just keep getting more expensive.</p></blockquote></div><p>Microsoft and Sony also often used to subsidize their game consoles, selling them at a loss and making their money back on games and services; Microsoft’s Lori Wright <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial">admitted in 2021</a> that’s how the Xbox worked. But it isn’t necessarily working that way anymore. This year, an Xbox Series X <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">costs $150 more than it did last year</a> — likely because of tariffs — Microsoft has sold fewer Xboxes in recent generations despite the subsidies, and the Xbox Game Pass subscription apparently isn’t doing the numbers that Microsoft hoped for.</p><p>So Xbox is no longer about the box; to maximize game sales, Microsoft’s biggest franchises are no longer exclusive to the Xbox or even the PC. They now appear on rival PlayStation, as well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636178/microsoft-playstation-store-ps5-xbox-games-preorder-chart">where they sometimes even top the charts</a>! They appear in the cloud, where Microsoft is trying to bring them to your phone, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case">if or when Apple and Google make it easier</a>.</p><p>It’s quite possible that the next Xbox will literally be a series of PCs, rather than a traditional console. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/781303/microsoft-sony-playstation-xbox-future-of-gaming-console">It’s been its trajectory for over a decade</a>, ever since the Xbox effectively became a Windows-running x86 AMD PC.</p><p>None of this means the box goes away, but it may become more of a luxury than ever. Luxuries cost. And now, Microsoft may be testing the waters to see just how much its Xbox fanbase is willing to pay for a future console.</p><div><p>In some ways, people can afford less than ever these days, as the prices of food and other basic necessities go up, thanks at least partially to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">President Donald Trump’s deeply confusing trade war</a>.</p></div><p>But we also live in an era of nostalgia and escapism, in which people want opportunities to retreat from the chaos, tune it out, and try to return to a simpler and happier time. That means riches in niches for companies selling pricey toys. You can now buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770770/lego-ucs-death-star-price-release-date">a $1,000 Lego Death Star</a>, the most expensive Lego set ever, because when Lego tested the waters with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588895/lego-rivendell-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-pictures-price-release-date">pricier</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16234244/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-set-7541-pieces-800-dollars">pricier sets</a>, it failed to find a limit to how much its deeper-pocketed fans would spend. You can buy a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24138325/transformers-robosen-megatron-self-converting-robot-toy-hasbro">$1,500 walking, talking, and transforming Transformers Megatron</a>, too.</p><p>Historically, gamer outrage has kept console and game prices low. Even as inflation and game development costs continued to rise, no game company wanted to be the one to rock the boat. Many remember the moment when Sony revealed the 60GB PS3 would cost <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/e3-sony-2006-giant-enemy-crab">“$599 US dollars”</a> and console makers have been shy of crossing that threshold.</p><p>But shortages and tariffs have given the industry an opportunity to blame higher prices on external factors, and they’re not likely to go down again now that they’re going up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">Nintendo now sells $80 games</a>, and while gamer outrage has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712371/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change-microsoft-xbox">momentarily kept Microsoft from doing the same</a>, that may not last long.</p><div><p>Just how much might the next Xbox cost, or the next PlayStation, now that the barriers have cracked? It might partly depend on how well the Xbox Ally sells. But I somewhat doubt that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073723/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-hardware-phil-spencer-handheld">“the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation”</a> will wind up being easily affordable.</p></div><p>Last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer told <em>Bloomberg</em>, “We’re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles,” and I think that rings true. But selling consoles <em>at all</em> may not be about growing the market. Perhaps Microsoft will grow the Xbox market by putting games everywhere it can, while collecting a licensing fee from partners who’ll build niche hardware for its most devout fans.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The video game industry has been a tumultuous place of late, with mass layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures, not to mention ongoing fears about the role of artificial intelligence. These issues have affected developers big and small. One smaller developer that has endured and thrived is Supergiant, which just launched Hades 2 this week.</p><p>Supergiant was formed in 2009 with seven people and has grown to 25 today. The seven original members all remain at Supergiant today, and the company has never done a major layoff, all while never taking in outside funding, according to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/hades-supergiant-games-studio-21057611.php" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The San Francisco Chronicle.</a> How has Supergiant achieved this? In an interview, the developer discussed that and dug into how the company will choose the next game to come after Hades 2.</p><h2><strong>What's the secret?</strong></h2><p>Creative director Greg Kasavin, the former executive editor of GameSpot, said there is no "magical explantation" for why Supergiant has endured while others have not. However, one theory he has is that Supergiant has focused on staying modest instead of pursuing massive growth.</p><p>"I do attribute it to the value that we place on sticking together as a team, on keeping our ambitions relatively modest. We don't have an ambition to grow big for its own sake," he said.</p><p>This runs in contrast to numerous other companies in the gaming space. During the COVID-19 pandemic, video games flourished, due in part to stay-at-home orders, and many companies ramped up hiring as a result. Some of the companies that staffed up are now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">drawing back to pre-pandemic levels, resulting in mass layoffs.</a></p><p>The privately owned Supergiant has released five games to date, including Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, Hades, and now Hades 2. The company's founders--Amir Rao and Gavin Simon--are former Electronic Arts employees.</p><h2><strong>What's after Hades 2?</strong></h2><p>Hades 2 only just released this week, but people always want to know what's coming next. Kasavin didn't give anything away, but said the team will collectively work out "what that thing is that's gonna make the most of us the most excited." He said Hades 2 took about 4.5 years to make, so "we don't have 30 games left or something like that."</p><p>"(We) just try to make each one count and learn from the experience each time and take that forward and try to do it again--that's good enough for me," Kasavin said.</p><p>Hades 2 is Supergiant's first sequel, and given the positive response to the game so far, it would seem fans might want to a see a third game. But we'll just have to wait and see what Supergiant makes next.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">Hades 2 review</a> scored the game a 10/10. "Hades 2 is a game that is essential to experience, with all of its parts coalescing into a memorable adventure that you will likely lose dozens of hours to without regret," reviewer Alessandro Barbosa said.</p>

            <p>In May this year, despite being deep in development on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>, CD Projekt revealed that they'd be whipping out one more patch for The Witcher 3 in honour of its tenth birthday. Said update was originally set to drop in 2025, but has now been pushed back into 2026.</p>
<p>It's a little bit of an extra wait for cross-platform mod support, and given what the studio have been like witch Cyberpunk 2077's seemingly never-ending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-disengages-autodrives-sticky-handbrake-and-gives-it-a-pass-to-run-every-red-light">string of last updates</a>, I'm not ruling out them having secretly decided to add more new stuff to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> masterpiece while they're at it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We originally planned to introduce cross-platform mod support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S later this year, but the rollout is now shifting to 2026," the studio announced in a tweet. "We apologise for the delay and will share more details as we get closer to the release. Thank you for your patience!"</p>
<p>While the update's arguably bigger news for console players who'll be getting access to Witcher 3 mods for the first time, as we saw with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heed-the-dark-urge-and-check-out-baldurs-gate-3s-patch-7-which-adds-13-new-evil-endings-plus-official-mod-tools">built-in mod support</a>, having another way for us PC folks to mod up our games is never a bad thing. As in that case, this official Witcher modding support will be done via Mod.io, which might be a preferable route for some, especially for relative modding newbies.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We originally planned to introduce cross-platform mod support for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, but the rollout is now shifting to 2026.</p><p>We apologize for the delay and will share more details as we get closer to the release.… <a href="https://t.co/klXCkudiz1">pic.twitter.com/klXCkudiz1</a></p></div>— The Witcher (@thewitcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/thewitcher/status/1971240482941362445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Obviously sticking to established modding setups will still be an option on PC. Odds are a lot of the most popular works will end up on both Mod.io and Nexus Mods, with more advanced mods likely remaining PC exclusive due to the added restrictions console modding entails. PC'll also remain the sole place you can fire up the REDkit tools CD Projekt released a little while ago to create mods.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the full FAQ CD Projekt released alongside their initial announcement of the update a read or re-read, you can find it <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support">here</a>.

              <p>How could a game with a name as fluffy as&nbsp;<em>PuffPals: Island Skies</em> ever do anything wrong? How could a company called Fluffnest be anything other than the cuddliest love-bunnies on the internet? It’s too implausible to even consider. Except… Launched on Kickstarter in April 2022, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies"><em>PuffPals: Island Skies</em></a> promised to bring the experience of a game like&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>to the PC, with the very modest goal of just $75,000. But people were excited, the project got a lot of buzz, and in the end it raised an incredible $2.6 million (kinda). Today, the website for the game is gone, backer refund requests are being ignored, and multiple lawsuits against the company behind the project have been lodged.</p> <p>Two people, David Pentland and artist usLily, started Fluffnest—also via Kickstarter—in 2020. As superbly documented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZjvRwjxacY">Mujin on YouTube</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/puffpals-island-skies-a-cosy-game-that-earned-usd2-5-million-on-kickstarter-has-been-slammed-with-refund-requests-after-its-website-and-online-store-disappeared/"><em>PCG</em></a>), it became an instant success, creating gorgeous plushies that developed a large fanbase, with hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, and a drop-based store that meant each plush was only available for a limited time. In 2022, the pair began the project to create a game set in the world of their plushies, an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like cozy game with all the fishing, farming and friendship that cozy gamers crave.</p>  <p>That $75,000 figure may seem like a warning sign from the start. It’s not enough to develop the loading screens, let alone a game. But over the years, that’s kinda how Kickstarter’s become. Projects don’t receive any funds at all if their target isn’t met, so if you put your actual forecast costs, say $5 million, as the target, you’ll almost definitely not raise and it not get a penny. So developers come in very low, ensuring that they get <em>something</em>, with stretch goals in place to encourage more pledges that could actually deliver the game. And that’s obviously a disastrous model, meaning games that need $5m might raise $100,000 and then clearly be unable to deliver, resulting in abandoned projects and furious backers. It happens all the time.</p>

 <p>But in the case of&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em>, it seemed to work. $75,000 became $2.56 million, more than double their top stretch goal figure. As Mujin reveals, however, a lot of that figure was extremely fudged: You could back the project for $20 to get the game on release, but afterward there were “add-ons,” where you could pay another $40 or so to get a plush toy too, and those plushies were ones that had sold out and were highly sought after by collectors. The money still counted toward the Kickstarter total, but a significant portion of it was going toward the toy and its shipping. Which is to say, that $2.6m figure did not remotely reflect what they actually had to spend on the game.</p>

 <p>The project then began to follow the failing Kickstarter playbook to the letter. Updates started to slow down, promises would be forgotten or explained away, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4309530">wild excuses would be given for why communication had been bad</a>, all always accompanied by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4324878">new promises that all these things would improve</a>. You’ll always get the six-month silence, followed by the “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4163760">Sorry we’ve been so quiet, we’ve been working so hard!</a>” update accompanied by scant few gifs and a bunch of concept art to “prove” it. And then, of course, a promised alpha build will get <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4335798">delayed</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4364462">delayed</a>, each missed milestone accompanied by an excuse that contradicts the last. Next you get the heartfelt apologies and promises to improve communication, along with a boast that the build is just moments away, before another stretch of silence ending in claims that the build, due years before, is “on track.” It’s all so painfully common.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629156"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629156">© Kickstarter / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But the&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em> debacle took it all to a new level, by seemingly not only messing their Kickstarter backers around, but customers of their main business too.&nbsp;During the waits, Reddit sleuths spotted that <em>PuffPals </em>trademarks had expired a year ago, and that the game was seemingly being entirely created by outsourcing company Room 8, while the plushies side of the business started having its own major troubles, with customers not receiving shipments, claiming they had been overcharged, and delivery prices being almost tripled. It then became apparent the company was being sued for failure to pay back business loans.</p>

 <p>Then things got even worse. Fluffnest was going out of business. Blaming rising shipping costs, the company declared it was coming to an end. And yet even here, in this statement, it said, “<em>Island Skies</em> production is secured and will not be affected.” Which, given it hadn’t given any substantial proof of life in years, and it had already been revealed that the entire game was being created by outsourced companies, was quite the claim.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4390672">last update on <em>PuffPals</em> appeared on May 21 this year</a>, and it was an extraordinary screed of excuses and blame laid at the feet of the company they’d paid (and then not paid) to develop the game. And, of course, every word of it contradicts the promises made in previous posts, even as recently as a month earlier.</p> <p>Today, the game’s pre-order page is an&nbsp;<a href="https://expireddomains.com/domain/fluffnest.games"><em>Expired Domains</em> landing page</a>, the Kickstarter has been abandoned for four months, and people who worked on the game have reported going unpaid. And obviously no one is getting refunds—but it’s important to remember that Kickstarter backing doesn’t guarantee a delivered project, so that’s always murky ground.</p> <p>Various lawsuits reported by Mujin show judgments being made against Fluffnest, ordering the company to repay owed money totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, the company hired to actually make the game, Room 8, is now suing Fluffnest and David Pentland for $1.9 million.</p> <p>While the various litigations drag through the courts, it’s impossible to know how a super-cute cozy game became such a multi-million dollar disaster. Was this begun in good faith, before collapsing around their ears? Was it a deliberate scam? Was Alpha 2 ever actually a thing that existed? We don’t know, and given court dates stretch as far away as summer 2027, we likely won’t know for a very long time. Either way, it’s astonishingly unlikely anyone will get any of their money back, whether a backer or a developer hired on the project, or even a bank providing one of the many loans. Meanwhile, people will just have to play one of the other 72,482 cozy village life games on PC instead.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is news. You can bet your bottom it was news to me when I loaded up Nexus Mods for my daily look this morning and found that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s adult section had tripled in size overnight. It's the sexy Hornet mods, they've broken containment, truth-telling hips and all.</p>

<p>Up until today, my searches for story-worthy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> mods had returned only the benign, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-multiplayer-mods-are-already-starting-to-arrive-and-its-not-even-been-a-skonging-week">multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mod-lets-you-immediately-load-up-any-boss-fight-when-you-want-to-get-some-practice-in">boss practice</a> add-ons that you could comfortably show an elderly relative. No more. Last night saw a pair of sexy Hornet mods, the first to hit the Nexus to my knowledge, arrive.</p>
<p>Shot first was '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/427">Curvier Hornet</a>' from modder Sandinsoda. "It was bound to happen," they wrote, pointing would-be sexy Skongers to requirements <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26">BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/142">Silksong Customizer</a>. As you'd imagine, the mod makes the capeless version of Hornet you play as at one point in metroidvania a bit more, er, voluptuous in terms of figure.
</p>
<p>Mere hours later, the chaser, a second mod. This time, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/429?tab=description">Curvy naked hornet</a>' by modder foureye5. Sandinsoda marched straight into its <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/429?tab=posts">comments section</a>, bellicosely bellowing "I wonder what prompted this". Tension ensued for several hours, only to be broken by a third party, who replied: "Honestly it looks different enough to warrant it being a serious alternative. Like this one has better thighs. But yours has a better chest."</p>
<p>"Fair enough," responded Sandinsoda.</p>
<p>That's the torrid tale of why if you pull up <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong/mods?showAdultContent=true">Silksong's Nexus Mods page</a> right now and filter so that only ones tagged adult show up, you'll find three things. These two mods - the nude Hornet equivalent of Beavis and Butthead - and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/383">another mod</a> that adds a swear to the text prompt for binding.</p><p>Are these curvy Hornet mods the first ever sexy Silksong works ever created? Almost certainly not, since it has a <a href="https://www.loverslab.com/topic/255454-hollow-knight-silksong-nude-mods/">Loverslab page</a> I refuse to verify my age in order to access, because I still have some shreds of dignity left. However, they are the first to emerge into what I'd deem the modding mainstream. Unrepentant. Insolent. Aimed a target audience of jokesters and probably at least one serious craver of Skong sexuality. Took them long enough, given they've even been preceded by a mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/283">makes Hornet disappear altogether</a>.</p>
<p>What times in which we live.</p>
