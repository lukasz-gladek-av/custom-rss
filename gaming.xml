<p>The free-to-play MOBA <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_unite">Pokémon Unite</a> has experienced all sorts of updates since arriving on the Switch eShop and mobile devices in 2021, but this latest announcement appears to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonUnite/comments/1ovrgay/aeos_coins_are_gone/">a lot of the community talking</a> about the title's future.</p>
<p>In an in-game notification, it's been revealed as of <strong>4th December 2025</strong>, Aeos coins will no longer be distributed. Nintendo Life can confirm the following in-game message. Here's the part of this notice focused on Aeos coins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of <strong>December 4, 2025</strong>, Aeos coins will no longer be distributed, and the Unite Battle Comittee will no longer offer Unite licenses in exchange for Aeos coins. If you would like to obtain Unite licenses via Aeos coins, please do so by that date.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fqyomkh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>Aeos coin boost cards will become unusable starting December 4, 2025. We plan to allow remaining ones to be exchangeable for Aeos coins. This will be implemented at a later date.</p>
<p>After December 4, 2025, the Unite Battle Committee will, however, continue to offer Unite licenses in exchange for Aeos gems.</p>
<p>Aeos Coin Exchange</p>
<p>An Aeos Coin Exchange will become available December 4, 2025. Here, players will be able to exchange previously earned Aeos coins for license points or various items.</p>
<p>Aeos coins and the Aeos Coin Exchange will remain in-game <strong>until May 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>This discontinuation of Aeos coins will take place alongside the introduction of License Journeys on the same date (4th December 2025). These will give players a new way to obtain Licenses in Unite by playing the game and accumulating License points. These can be obtained as battle pass rewards, from random boxes, or as rewards from future events. Here's a bit more about this new feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Typically, each time the player selects a Unite license to work toward, they'll choose from five available licenses. However, there will also be times players can choose from all the Unite licenses in the game. Unite licenses for newly released Pokémon may also become available via License Journeys at the same time they're released in the shop."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2025 marks the fourth anniversary of Pokémon Unite. Over the years it's been expanded with new playable Pokémon, maps, modes and much more, and is also playable on the Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Several’ Tier 1 Counter-Strike 2 Events Won’t Happen in 2026, It’s Confirmed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/several-tier-1-counter-strike-events-not-happening/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98several%E2%80%99-tier-1-counter-strike-2-events-won%E2%80%99t-happen-in-2026-it%E2%80%99s-confirmed.1352164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent post on social media, the CEO of PGL, Silviu Stroie, confirmed that ‘several’ high-tier Counter-Strike 2 tournaments won’t take place in 2026. This is because an announcement pathway wasn’t followed, which unfortunately violates Valve’s tournament operation requirements.</p>



<p>The post on social media confirmed that <strong>none of the Starladder events </strong>in 2026 will take place, and two of the three Fissure events in 2026 have also been struck from the schedule.</p>







<h2 id="h-cs2-events-slashed-from-the-schedule">CS2 Events Slashed From the Schedule</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ssilviu/status/1988490449951015313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The post</a> from Silviu Stroie, CEO of PGL, reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Several CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 won’t take place, as they missed the deadline for announcing the additional details. None of the Starladder CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 will take place. The same applies to two of the three Fissure CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 (Playground 4 and Playground 5). So far, there has been no Starladder announcement for any Tier 1 event in 2027.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one of the most important comments under the post, a user wrote, ‘How can this happen? Like, if you know that this is a requirement, there’s like a 0% chance of missing the deadline if it’s your main business.’</p>



<p>Valve’s tournament operation requirements demand that organizers provide ‘additional information’ within a certain timeframe after an initial announcement. That deadline was missed by some, and therefore, these tournaments will not be allowed to go ahead.</p>







<p>Neither of the organizers impacted by this confirmation have provided a statement to say what’s happening, but Stroie also mentioned that no Starladder events have been announced (at Tier 1) going into 2027, which is cryptic to say the least. This was later refuted by Starladder, as the company revealed that ‘the next Tier-1 Starladder event comes in October 2027’.</p>



<p>Are you bothered about the loss of these events, or do you feel that there are already enough Counter-Strike tournaments lined up? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This weekend, Escape from Tarkov hits a 1.0 state after a <strong>decade </strong>in testing and development. It’s a monumental time to be a fan of the spearhead extraction shooter, and the release comes as the genre is experiencing something of a boom, spurred onwards by the recent arrival of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games confirmed that Escape from Tarkov will have a new Twitch Drops campaign that’s kicking off to celebrate the launch of the game on November 15, this coming Saturday.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-twitch-drops-coming">Tarkov Twitch Drops Coming</h2>



<p>From November 15 to December 6, Tarkov fans will be able to watch their favorite streamers exploring the new 1.0 update that brings the game into an entirely new world. The drops will reward players with different reward crates, containing some loot that could be considered highly exclusive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hideout Targets</li>



<li>Tarko Figuring</li>



<li>Nikita’s PMC Voice</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a split between the rewards coming to the Escape from Tarkov Twitch Drops campaign, and that’s between <strong>free </strong>and <strong>paid-for </strong>rewards. If you dish out subscriptions during the event, you’ll unlock even more content in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 Subs – Cap, M-2 Brown &amp; Secure Container</li>



<li>3 Subs – PMC Dogtag (Twitch)</li>



<li>1 Sub – Hideout Decor</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p><a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was stressed</a> that the split is timed differently, too. The free drops run until November 28, while the paid rewards will stay live until December 6.</p>







<p>More content will be added, per a graphic published by Battlestate Games, so expect plenty of rewards to flow going into Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release – provided you watch those streaming the game. The 1.0 update is highly anticipated and will bring a new map, story, and many other quality-of-life improvements and upgrades.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-north-line-update-release-time%E2%80%94stella-montis-unlock.1352155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has a new supersized update inbound called North Line, and it introduces a new map, new ARC enemies, weapons, quests, and more. It will be made accessible via a community event that requires all users to contribute to a project to bust open a tunnel leading to the new map, Stella Montis.</p>



<p>Many are wondering when the North Line update will be released. It’s coming out today, but the release time for the update isn’t clear. Read on to learn what we know about the ARC Raiders North Line update release times.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-north-line-releasing-on-arc-raiders">When is North Line Releasing on ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The North Line update for ARC Raiders will be released today, November 13, at 09:30 AM GMT / 04:30 AM ET / 01:30 AM PT.</strong> This timing convention is to allow for a unified launch of the update across all platforms and territories.</p>



<p>Fans of the post-apocalyptic extraction shooter will be able to enjoy some of the trappings of the North Line update when it drops, but the bulk of it will come after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/">the Breaking New Ground event</a> has been completed.</p>



<p>This is where players must contribute Metal Parts, Fabric, Chemicals, Plastic Parts, and Rubber Parts to the centralized project to open up the tunnels to Stella Montis. Here, players will be able to explore a new path in ‘Staking Our Claim’, digging deep into Stella Montis, facing new ARC threats, and preparing for the <strong>next </strong>major ARC Raiders update – Cold Snap.</p>







<p>There’s a busy roadmap ahead, and Embark Studios has promised to support ARC Raiders for the next decade, so expect plenty more maps, modes, weapons, and more to be added in the coming months to make way for that lifecycle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is finally being ‘released’ this week after a decade in alpha and beta stages. It brings an end to years of development that have culminated in Escape from Tarkov being the most popular extraction shooter ever made. It’s a paradigm shift of a title that’s evolving into a 1.0 state this coming Saturday.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, suggested that a drastic balancing mechanic might be put into play for Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform.</p>







<h2 id="h-they-might-wipe-the-pve-flea-market">They Might Wipe the PvE Flea Market</h2>



<p>Nikita suggested in a recent interview with Pestily that the team at Battlestate Games might wipe the Flea Market <strong>specifically on the PvE platform </strong>when 1.0 drops. Pestily addressed the Flea Market being ‘filled with stuff’ that PvE players have collected over many months, impacting the mode’s economy.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We will see. Maybe we will wipe the Flea Market, for example.</p>



<p>Nobody said that we can’t do that. We can wipe the Flea Market, and nobody will say anything to us, because the Flea Market is just a sub-system that we can wipe.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I laughed out loud at this clip <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nikgeneburn</a>.  Glad you are keeping your humor!</p><p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Pestily?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Pestily</a>'s interview today, Nikita says they might wipe the flea for PvE to keep people from snowballing with 1.0…</p><p>BUT…. if this is all you guys have planned It's not enough, you are going to… <a href="https://t.co/VZCegXIYsE">pic.twitter.com/VZCegXIYsE</a></p></div>— Airwingmarine (@Airwingmarine1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Airwingmarine1/status/1988718220728234146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p><br>Escape from Tarkov players focused on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-players-need-to-wipe-for-full-release-quest/">PvE will need to wipe their accounts</a> to access the new story being introduced with 1.0. This story will finally allow players to <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, presenting them with a branching campaign with multiple endings.</p>



<p>This is bad news for the PvE players (like myself) who have spent the last year racking up a phenomenal stash and building the strongest character they’ve ever made, simply because PvE <strong>doesn’t automatically wipe</strong>.</p>







<p>The economy that has been created because of that is a little skewed, so pushing for a reset of this kind might be a neat balancing tactic.</p>



<p>Do you think that Battlestate Games should better balance the PvE platform? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-13-886/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-886-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-thursday-november-13.1352149/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The week is almost over, but before the final days arrive, you’ve got a few more NYT Connections puzzles to solve. Today’s puzzle is pretty interesting, as at first blush, very few things seem to relate to one another, but that’s why I’m here to provide the best NYT Connections hints around.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections solutions that I know you’re here for.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-13">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 13)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #886:</p>



<ul>
<li>FIRE EXTINGUISHER</li>



<li>AIR PURIFIER</li>



<li>MICROSOFT</li>



<li>INSTAGRAM</li>



<li>CIGARETTE</li>



<li>BOX</li>



<li>OVAL</li>



<li>THREADS</li>



<li>FIT</li>



<li>POST</li>



<li>COFFEE MAKER</li>



<li>BEER</li>



<li>SHAVING CREAM</li>



<li>GETUP</li>



<li>SEA</li>



<li>DUDS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Stylish slang for what you’re wearing.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Bubbly, frothy, and sometimes messy.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Filtered for freshness, flavor, or flair.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Fill in the blank to find the workplace.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 13</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-13-886">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 13 (#886)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DUDS, FIT, GETUP, THREADS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BEER, FIRE EXTINGUISHER, SEA, SHAVING CREAM</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – AIR PURIFIER, CIGARETTE, COFFEE MAKER, INSTAGRAM</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BOX, MICROSOFT, OVAL, POST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

That's not all, though! If you only watched the trailer and didn't actually catch the Nintendo Direct, you might have missed two other scenes.</p>
<p>During the short presentation by Shigeru Miyamoto, Illumination's Chris Meledandri (and the voice of Bowser, Jack Black), Mario fans got a teaser of a Rosalina and Bowser Jr. scenes. In the main trailer, Rosalina doesn't speak, so this is technically the first scene we've seen of her talking.</p>
<p>The cosmic protector will be voiced by the "academy award winner and Nintendo super fan" Brie Larson. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/12-details-you-might-have-missed-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">we noted in our recent feature</a>, this scene gives us a brief look at some Luma (including a little one with a dummy) listening to Rosalina's story as well as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a>-style storybook scene. Here it is in full:</p>

<p>Next up, we've got a look at Bowser Jr. - the new villain in the Mario Galaxy Movie, voiced by Benny Safdie. This "uncut gem" (Jack Black's words) co-directed the award-winning crime-thriller Uncut Gems, and can be seen as Bowser's son in this first look, plotting his family's rise from the ashes.</p>

<p>So, there you go - a little more footage to enjoy until the next update or trailer drop. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will arrive in theatres in <strong>April 2026</strong>. You can find out more about everything in the main trailer as well as our feature and guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-ps5-trailer-2000643663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-reveals-secret-horizon-mmo-that-looks-like-monster-hunter-but-isn%E2%80%99t-coming-to-ps5.1352122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony has officially revealed the long-rumored <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-open-world-7th-anniversary-1851293448"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> MMO spin-off</a> it’s making with <em>Guild Wars</em> publisher NCSoft. It’s called <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, it looks a lot like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and it’s not coming to PlayStation 5.</p>

 <p>Announced during South Korea’s G-Star gaming convention, <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> was developed in partnership with PlayStation studio Guerrilla Games and centers around big, raid-like boss fights against the franchise’s detailed assortment of futuristic prehistoric robots. Instead of following the story of franchise protagonist Aloy, players will create their own custom characters and team-up to take down their mechanical quarries across PC and mobile.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date yet but we did get a 10-minute deep-dive into the RPG’s gameplay and development backstory:</p>  <p>You play as a machine hunter in the Deadlands (inspired by Arizona and New Mexico) who hails from one of four tribes: the Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram. It’s unclear exactly how many other players you’ll be able to team up with or how seamless the world will be as you explore, but early footage teased several different biomes, from fire-ravaged deserts to icy tundra. Players have ground and aerial mounts they can utilize for exploration and combat and there’s one moment in the trailer where players are galloping across a field alongside a mechanical herd as well as one of the series’ iconic Tallnecks.</p>

 <p>I have no idea how it’s supposed to run on phones but it looks great.</p> <p>“<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> is a full-fledged MMORPG that NCSoft has built specifically for mobile,” Guerilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said during the video. “You’re sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines and other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources, and that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments that you could never script.”</p>

  <p>A gameplay trailer gives a better sense of how exactly combat will work and it certainly looks a lot like <em>Monster Hunter</em>. Players will hack away at enemies, targeting weaknesses and damaging specific parts of them over the course of battle. But it’s not just mashing buttons. Players will also be able to make use of carefully placed traps and grappling hook-like pullcasters to sling-shot themselves around the battlefield and onto enemies’ backs. Based on the UI, it looks like there might even be some sort of stagger mechanic.</p>

 <p>NCSoft executive producer Sunggu Lee said during the developer interview that <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em><em>‘ </em>emphasis will be on teamwork and strategy. As an MMORPG coming out of South Korea built primarily for smartphones, I also expect it to be a heavily monetized XP grind. If the company can make it feel more like a coop Horizon adventure than a second job min-maxing spreadsheets, <em>Horizon</em> meets <em>Monster Hunter</em> has the potential to be really cool. But a lot of that will come down to how smooth and rewarding the moment-to-moment combat looks and feels.</p> <p>Sony is currently all-in on the <em>Horizon</em> franchise. In addition to Guerrilla teasing a third mainline entry in the existing open-world RPG series, there were rumors of a live service multiplayer spin-off based on project footage from 2020 that <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-aloy-sequel-burning-shores-ps5-1850369063">leaked several years ago</a>. It’s unclear whether that was abandoned, became <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, or remains another multiplayer project in the mix at Sony. There’s also the <em>Horizon</em> movie that’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-movie-date-sony-tencent-lawsuit-last-us-2000636587">slated to begin filming next year</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Death Stranding Anime is in the Works at Disney+]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-isolations-anime-disney-kojima/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works-at-disney.1352107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Death Stranding is becoming an anime series thanks to the folks at Disney+. Furthermore, creator Hideo Kojima will executive produce while animator Takayuki Sano (Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) will direct the show.</p>







<p>The Death Stranding series is the first new IP from Kojima Productions, led by Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima. With two entries, with On the Beach releasing in 2025, the post-apocalyptic strand game has become a hit for PlayStation fans. It helps that it bolsters an all-star cast, led by The Walking Dead’s Norman Reedus, and some great visual and narrative storytelling. A few months ago, Kojima announced more projects based on Death Stranding, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-anime-confirmed-by-hideo-kojima/">an anime movie</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film adaptation from A24</a>. Now, it seems there’s another project in the works and at Disney+, of all places.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The official poster for Death Stranding Isolations, streaming on Disney+</figcaption></figure>



<p>The news comes from Disney at the Disney APAC Showcase, currently going on in Hong Kong. There, the company revealed that it’s releasing Death Stranding Isolations (title not final), a 2D hand-drawn anime, in 2027. The animation will be handled by E&amp;H production, led by Jujutsu Kaisen director Sunghoo Park. Directing the show is Takayuki Sano, whose resume includes anime like Attack on Titan, Banana Fish, and Promare. A short synopsis was also provided by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-unveils-death-stranding-isolations-from-game-creator-hideo-kojima-1236616004/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. It can be found in full below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set in the same world as the video game,&nbsp;Death Stranding Isolations<em>&nbsp;</em>follows Sam Bridges as he attempts to save America, and those trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. </p>



<p>An old man is trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior is trying to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy holds a grudge against Bridges, and a girl has embraced her loneliness. On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p> In attendance at the Disney APAC Showcase was creator <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wishes-to-scan-real-ghosts-for-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a>, who will executive produce the show. Speaking on behalf of the team at the event, Kojima stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I grew up loving Japanese anime, and it has shaped my worldview,” said Kojima. “I’ve always been a fan of Disney, since I was small, and I was glad that they showed my documentary on the platform. When they approached me, I decided to work with them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly enough, this isn’t the only anime of Death Stranding we’re getting. Death Stranding: Mosquito, an animated film by ABC Animations, is currently in the works, as well. However, it seems like Sam Porter Bridges is going to be in Isolations and not Mosquito, as far as we know. We’ll likely learn more about both as 2026 comes around, but at least we have a look at the title through the artwork, shown above.</p>







<p>What do you think about Death Stranding Isolations? Did the series need an anime? When do you think it’ll come out in 2027?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-steel-frontiers-how-the-new-mobile-mmorpg-changes-machine-combat.1352104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A brand new Horizon game has been announced, but it’s not the sequel to Forbidden West that you may have been expecting. It’s not a single-player game, nor is it even a PlayStation game. Horizon Steel Frontiers is a MMORPG developed by NCSoft for mobile and PC. Confused? Don’t worry, we’re here to break down everything revealed in the debut trailer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the idea of an online multiplayer Horizon game sounds familiar, then you’ve likely been paying attention to the rumours that began as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remaster-reportedly-in-the-works-alongside-a-multiplayer-game">far back as 2022</a>. At first glance, it’s clear that this is very much a Horizon game you can play with a team of co-op buddies. The world looks very similar to what we’ve explored before, however this time we’ll be headed to the Deadlands, a brand new region inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. Within that location are plenty of recognisable elements, from destroyed remains of humanity’s past, to the real stars of Horizon: its giant mechanical beasts. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-sword-1762959243816.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But let's start with something less familiar. It’s clear that Steel Frontiers has a different approach to combat compared to its predecessors. Where the single-player games largely focus on ranged combat, using weapons like bows to shoot enemy weakpoints, this new take on the universe seems to be predominantly focused on melee. The trailer’s focal character uses a huge sword, while other characters can be seen using dual blades to slice and dice their way through machine armour. That’s not to say archery has been eliminated – a bow still features throughout the trailer – but blade combat appears to be front and center. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There seems to not just be a change in distance between you and your foe, but a dramatic re-think of combat fundamentals. The trailer demonstrates a charged blade ability that can be used to deflect an incoming attack, a type of defensive strategy that’s brand new to Horizon. When it comes to the offensive, you can now, after destroying a specific part of a machine, use the Pullcaster grapple hook to climb onto your target and place a status-inflicting trap on the damaged part. NCSoft has said that elements like this are part of a new approach that tailors Horizon’s existing ideas to suit an MMORPG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear that lots of Horizon’s combat DNA still remains – we can see machine parts detach in every fight, such as when the main character shoots off a Blaze canister in the trailer’s opening battle. And later, we can see that destroyed machines leave behind resources to pick up. But from what’s shown in this trailer, it seems like Steel Frontiers may feel more like Monster Hunter than traditional Horizon. Executive producer Sung-Gu Lee explains that at the core of the experience is “cooperation and strategy”, and that “players must take on their roles,” ideas that form the basis of Monster Hunter’s multiplayer expeditions. Furthermore, we even see some characters cooking a meal in a cutscene that resembles the chef montages from Monster Hunter’s own meal prep system. Perhaps all this shouldn’t come as a surprise, though: there’s certainly more than a little of Capcom’s series in Horizon already.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other combat additions we can see in the trailer include some kind of sticky bomb that can be used to deal massive damage to machines – perhaps this is one of those aforementioned traps? You also now have the ability to pack machine weapons on your mount, allowing you to transport heavy artillery from one battle to another.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-mount-1762959265554.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of mounts, we see almost all of the tameable machines from Forbidden West being used in this trailer. It opens with a Bristleback being Overridden and claimed as a mount, and later we see characters riding Sunwings and Chargers. We also see confirmation of a brand new mount: the trailer’s protagonist rides on the back of a Stalker, the stealth camo-equipped, Panther-like machine. Considering Forbidden West expanded the number of mounts available, and MMORPGs are typically known for their range of mounts, it seems likely that even more machines will be available for taming. With any luck, this is the game where we can finally pilot a Thunderjaw. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t actually see Horizon’s iconic, metallic T-Rex in this trailer, but there are over a dozen other machines on display here, from the tiny all the way up to the gigantic. The most impressive fight sees a group take on a Slaughterspine, which uses many of the abilities it did in Forbidden West, including its rain of munitions. Other examples of “Oh god please don’t kill me” machines include the fearsome Fireclaw, a napalm-spewing robo-bear, and a huge snake-like machine that looks like a Slitherfang crossed with a Rockbreaker, which is very likely our first glimpse of a new variety of metal monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest creature, though, is the Tallneck, and we can see a group of machine hunters attempting to bring one down in the desert. Once again, these look like they’ll be large climbing puzzles, judged on the way the characters climb its neck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the smaller side, we can spot a Watcher, some Grazers, a Plowhorn, a Trampler, a Ravager, and a Shellwalker… whose shell is whisked away into the sky by a Glinthawk. It seems like NCSoft understands the mission when it comes to enemy variety.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-dungeon-1762959281074.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, the world looks suitably like Horizon’s signature vision of the future. Lush green foliage has overtaken the ruins of human skyscrapers, people live in villages that take inspiration from Native American tribes, and below the ground lie giant vaults filled with advanced technology . These “Cauldrons” return from the single-player Horizon games, but can now be explored with a team of allied players. It seems sensible to guess that these Cauldrons may be Steel Frontiers’ equivalent to the classic MMORPG dungeon.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, a great deal of what we’ve seen looks very close to what we’d expect of a Horizon game. Steel Frontiers has been developed in collaboration with original developer Guerrilla, and so no doubt many efforts have been made to keep the visual style and many gameplay ideas consistent. However, with the Korean-based NCSoft being the lead developer, you can also see some more Eastern elements finding their place in this universe. All the characters have an anime-like aesthetic, looking more like folks from Final Fantasy or NCSoft’s own Lineage games, rather than the characters from the original Horizon series. There’s even a bit of a cutesy thing going on with a character’s wearing metal cat ears – something we’d never see the serious Aloy wear in a thousand years. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-cat-ears-1762959611713.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you're a Horizon purist, you may be able to create a character that’s more in-line with the original games’ aesthetic in the character creator. This being an MMORPG, you won’t be playing as Aloy or any other pre-written protagonist, but a character of your own design. The character creator seems reasonably in-depth, and also allows you to choose which tribe you’ll join: the Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram – all groups previously established in Horizon lore. The trailer’s narration hints at competitive PvP as well as co-op machine hunting, so it may be that your tribe also acts as your “team” in such scenarios.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Steel Frontiers looks to contain much of what we’d expect from Horizon, from RPG dialogue sequences to giant metal monster fights, this is certainly set to be a new and different take on the universe we’ve come to love over the last couple of PlayStation generations. Not to mention, it’s a Horizon game we’ll be playing on our phones, not our PS5s. But did you spot anything new and interesting in the trailer that we missed? Let us know your sharp observations in the comments below, as well as what you think of this new MMO direction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-trailer-breakdown]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>And here are some comments from NCSOFT chief corporate officer Taekjin Kim, Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek, and NCSOFT executive producer Sung-Gu Lee, via the announcement video:</p><div><p><strong>Taekjin Kim, NCSOFT Chief Corporate Officer</strong></p><p>“When I fist experienced <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> in 2017, I was instantly drawn into its vibrant and captivating world. The battles against colossal machine lifeforms were exhilarating and the mysterious narrative sparked my curiosity, urging me to explore every corner of that universe. Yet I couldn’t help but feel a little wistful that such an incredible world had to be experienced alone. I imagined how thrilling it would be to meet others, to team up and face these massive machines together.</p><p>“From the beginning, I was convinced: battling machine lifeforms would be far more exciting than facing any fantasy monster. That vision inspired us to create an MMO set in this extraordinary universe. And today, I’m proud to present <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>—a dream realized. <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> represents a new challenge for NC, and the start of an exciting journey ahead. We hope you look forward to this new <em>Horizon</em> born from the collaboration between NC and Guerrilla.”</p><p><strong>Jan-Bart van Beek, Guerrilla Games Studio Director</strong></p><p>“I was the one who originally came up with the concept of the <em>Horizon</em> franchise. The <em>Horizon</em> franchise is incredibly special to me and to everyone at Guerrilla. It’s a world we’ve poured our hearts and souls into. It’s a place where humanity, nature, and technology are constantly colliding. It’s become a vibrant and living world full of stories, tribal cultures, and of course, those incredible animal-like machines that rule the land.</p><p>“From the very beginning of creating this franchise, we’ve imagined the <em>Horizon</em> universe as one that could be experienced in many different ways. <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> is a full-fledged MMORPG that NCSOFT has built specifically for mobile. With <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, you can step into this world, anywhere, anytime.</p><p>“Players take on the role of machine hunters, chasing opportunity in a region called the Deadlands, which is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. You’re sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines, and other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources. And that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments you could never script.</p><p>“At the heart of the <em>Horizon</em> story is the search for the balance between humanity, nature, and technology. Sometimes that’s harmony, sometimes that’s conflict. But it always creates a world filled with mystery and beauty. What we want players to feel is the world’s resilience and its hope. And that even when everything seems overwhelming, humanity can adapt, can survive, and find meaning in the world.</p><p>“We already had groups at Guerrilla playing <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> together at the office, and it’s really amazing. Whenever I get a chance to jump in on an early gameplay test, what really stands out is <em>Steel Frontiers</em>‘ distinct tone and atmosphere. It has a unique identity of its own, and has been brought to life by NCSOFT’s developers. But it fits perfectly with the Horizon universe, and that balance with the essence of <em>Horizon</em> and something fresh is what really excites me about this project.”</p><p><strong>Sung-Gu Lee, NCSOFT Executive Producer</strong></p><p>“I’m a bit nervous to present this project to the world for the first time, but at the same time, I’m extremely excited. The core concept of <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> can be summed up in one phrase: the thrill of taking down colossal machines. Hunting massive machines was one of the greatest appeals of the original&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> series. And now, we’re expanding that experience into the world of MMORPGs.</p><p>“Our main focus is designing a new combat experience tailored for an MMORPG. In <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, we’ve added unique, original gameplay elements to the process of taking down giant machines. For example, after destroying a specific part of a machine, you can quickly approach and climb onto it using a Pullcaster, set traps on the damaged part, and inflict status effects. During battle, you can even pick up weapons dropped by the machine, carry them on your mount, and use them in subsequent fights. At the heart of giant machine hunts are two core values. cooperation and strategy. Players must take on their roles, act strategically, and work together seamlessly. These combat mechanics truly shine in large-scale battles, offering the scale and dynamism that only an MMORPG can provide.</p><p>“In <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, every player is a hero. We’ve put great care into customization, allowing you to fully express your individuality—even down to the smallest details. During character creation, we’ve incorporated the tribes from the original <em>Horizon</em> world. You can choose from diverse tribes such as Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram, and create your character based on your preferred tribe. Our system provides a high degree of freedom, so you can design your character exactly as you envision—from facial features, body type, and hair, to makeup and finer details. The characters you create can be shared with other players, allowing you not only to show off your own style, but also draw inspiration from others to further customize your hero. Step into <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> as a truly unique machine hunter, crafted entirely by you, and explore a world where your individuality matters.</p><p>“In the world of <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, you’ll be able to develop your own character, team up with friends to hunt colossal machines, and live the story of a machine hunter in the Deadlands. We can’t wait to see you all become the heroes of this adventure, and we’re doing our best to make that day come as soon as possible.”</p></div><p>Watch the announcement video and gameplay trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/ncsoft-announces-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers-for-pc-ios-and-android]]></content:encoded>

<p>As it expands into mobile gaming with a major IP</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>In recent years, Nintendo has been able to grow its brand and expand its IP with mobile game apps. To date, the cumulative number of unique downloads for Nintendo apps has now surpassed 950 million, and it's banked a lot of coin in that time.</p>
<p>It's a market that's ripe for the picking, and in some industry news this week, Sony's PlayStation Studios has now announced it will be stepping up its game with the release of a new "free to download" <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ratchet_and_clank_rift_apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> multiplayer mobile title. As our colleagues at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/new-ratchet-and-clank-game-announced-but-not-for-the-platform-you-want">Push Square</a> note, although Sony has been dabbling with mobile games for a while, this is seemingly "one of the first real attempts" to bring its IP to this platform.</p>
<p>The game is officially titled <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/new-ratchet-and-clank-game-announced-but-not-for-the-platform-you-want">Ratchet and Clank: Ranger Rumble</a></strong>, and it's notably drawn some comparisons to games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a> and even the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>. The Metroid comparison has been spurred on by a mode called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_blast">Blast Ball</a>, which you might remember was a dedicated competitive multiplayer experience on the 3DS.</p>

<p>Much like Nintendo with Super Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> and other IP like Fire Emblem, PlayStation appears to be following up this Ratchet &amp; Clank title with a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/the-next-horizon-game-is-an-mmo-by-ncsoft-for-pc-mobile">new Horizon MMO for mobile (and PC)</a> that's already leaked.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a huge audience on mobile, so Nintendo and PlayStation can easily co-exist, but this is a notable development on the PlayStation front. And it's easy to see why Sony might have also considered this market after the success Nintendo has had in this space. After all, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/sony-once-again-takes-a-leaf-from-nintendos-playbook-in-japan">always kept a close eye on Nintendo</a>.</p>
<p>As for Nintendo's mobile expansion, it most recently launched the new title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> on Android and iOS devices in September. Earlier this month, it also released a new mobile application in select regions, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-releases-a-storefront-app-for-android-and-ios">allows users to access its storefront</a>. In some other industry news, Valve has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/random-steams-brand-new-game-console-sure-looks-awfully-familiar">a new Steam Machine this week</a>, and Nintendo dropped a trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/12-details-you-might-have-missed-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">the new Mario Movie</a>.</p>

It will be free to play, <a href="https://hsf.plaync.com/en-us/conts/teaser#platform">according to the game’s website</a>.

Players take on the role of machine hunters, chasing opportunity in a region called the Deathlands. This is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An MMORPG based on PlayStation and Guerrilla Games’ Horizon series has been leaked before its official reveal. We now know several details surrounding the game, now called Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p>







<p>While a newer IP, the Horizon series, consisting of 2017’s Zero Dawn and 2022’s Forbidden West, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-franchise-32m-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-received by critics</a>. The third-person post-apocalyptic shooter is known for its gorgeous graphics and intuitive open-world gameplay. With hulking mechanical monsters and a lush environment, Horizon’s iconic settings make for the perfect setup for games outside of the main series. We did see LEGO Horizon Adventures and a VR spinoff, but it’s stayed in its lane for a bit. However, rumors of an MMORPG had surfaced over the past years, but it was thought to be cancelled. However, according to new information, it seems it’s here and, most likely, will be revealed quite soon.</p>



<p>UPDATE: Horizon Steel Frontiers is, indeed real, as PlayStation and NCSoft announced the project soon after publication. The video mentioned in the article <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiogVFtmchg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>. Most of the details regarding gameplay and such can be found below.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-minute-video-of-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers-coming-soon-according-to-leak">10-Minute Video of MMORPG Horizon Steel Frontiers Coming Soon, According to Leak</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leaked key art from Horizon Steel Frontiers </figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819657/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-sony-ncsoft-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, which supposedly saw a 10-minute video of the Horizon MMORPG, called Horizon Steel Frontiers. It even included key art, which we have above. Supposedly, the game is set to be revealed at the G-STAR 2025 event, but information came out early. </p>



<p>In the article, it mentions that the game is a collaboration between PlayStation and Korean developer NCSoft. The video, planned to be shown there, showcases gameplay, both complete and in development. As it is an MMORPG, instead of playing as Aloy, you’ll create your own character and join others in the world, called the Deathlands. It also says that the title will release on PC, iOS, and Android. No mention of a release date or if it will go to PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As the game is not yet confirmed, take the news with a grain of salt for now. However, given the content leaked, it’s safe to say it’s only a matter of time before it’s announced. Either way, it will be interesting to see how Horizon fits into the MMORPG genre and the differences between it and the main series.</p>







<p>What do you think of Horizon Steel Frontiers? Does Horizon need an MMORPG? Excited to see gameplay? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

                <p>Valve has unveiled its first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">its new gaming machines</a>, including Steam Frame, a virtual reality headset that can handle VR and non-VR games. Apparently, Steam Frame is also being used as a way to bring Android games directly to Steam users.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Valve will support and encourage developers to bring Android apps to Steam. As part of this initiative, Valve will release a Steam Frame developer kit for developers who already use Android APKs for apps and VR headsets on Android phones.</p><p>"From the user's perspective, our preference is that they don't even have to think about it," explains Valve engineer Jeremy Selan. "They just have their titles on Steam, they download them and hit play ... They're really VR developers who want to publish their VR content, and they're porting a mobile VR title where they're already familiar with how to make those APKs. They are now free to bring those to Steam, and they'll just work on this device."</p><p>This seamless transition from Android to Steam is possible because Steam Frame uses an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, which can run the apps directly. That will allow the Android games and VR apps to be easily accessed on Steam Frame.</p><p>In addition to Steam Frame, Valve announced a Steam Machine that can bring PC games to living rooms like a console, as well as a new Steam Controller. Valve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">hasn't disclosed pricing for any of its new Steam hardware</a> yet, but hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Steam Machine will likely be competitively priced to be an affordable alternative to consoles.</p><p>"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it," said Aldehayyat.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-buds-3-pro-with-ai-features-are-going-for-pennies-amazon-sets-a-new-all-time-low.1351990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium wireless earbuds have become one of those purchases where the options feel endless and the prices keep climbing higher. You’ve got Apple’s AirPods Pro at $249, Google’s Pixel Buds Pro at similar pricing, and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro normally sitting at the same $249 mark. The specs all start to blur together after a while, and trying to figure out which pair actually delivers the best value can feel overwhelming. Price becomes a major factor when everything seems comparable on paper, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">right now Amazon has dropped the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to just $174, down from their usual $249</a>. This is a new all-time low that you won’t even find on Samsung’s official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro <strong>pack AI-powered features</strong> that are constantly adapting to your environment throughout the day. Samsung’s sound optimization technology analyses the shape of your ear canal to adjust audio output for balanced sound that matches your unique anatomy. This happens automatically in the background, so you’re not always tweaking equalizer settings and wondering if you’re missing out on certain frequencies. The <strong>AI continuously monitors ambient noise levels and adjusts the intensity of active noise cancellation</strong> to match and ramps up when you step onto a busy street and dialing back when you’re in quieter spaces.</p>



<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro works through a <strong>combination of external and internal microphones</strong> that capture ambient sound and generate inverse sound waves to cancel unwanted noise. The technology proves especially effective at eliminating low-frequency rumble from airplane engines, subway cars, or air conditioning units. You’ll notice the difference immediately on your commute as traffic noise fades into the background and you can finally hear podcast dialogue clearly without cranking the volume to dangerous levels.<strong> Transparency mode</strong> flips this system around and pips in external sounds when you need to hear announcements, have quick conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings while walking.</p>



<p>Samsung redesigned the fit for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to address one of the most common complaints in its predecessors: This <strong>new ergonomic contour sits more securely in your ear</strong> without creating pressure points that cause discomfort after an hour or two of wear. You get three different ear tip sizes in the box, and the companion app includes a fit test that plays audio to verify you’ve created a proper seal. Getting this seal right is enormously important for both sound quality and noise cancellation effectiveness, since even small gaps let sound leak in and bass frequencies escape.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> maintains stable connections for the typical range you’d expect from modern wireless earbuds, staying paired reliably when your phone is in your pocket or bag. Pairing happens quickly through Samsung’s ecosystem if you own a Galaxy phone, as the earbuds pop up automatically on screen when you open the case near your device. Android users outside the Samsung ecosystem and <strong>even iPhone owners can still pair these earbuds</strong> through standard Bluetooth settings, though they’ll miss out on some of the deeper integration features that Galaxy phone users enjoy.</p>
<p>Battery life gives you about six hours of continuous playback with active noise cancellation enabled, which will cover most daily use scenarios, like commutes, work sessions, or gym visits. With the charging case included, y<strong>ou get about 26 hours of total listening time</strong> before you’ll need to find an outlet; it also supports USB-C wired charging and wireless charging via Qi-compatible pads. With just a five-minute charge, you can attain about an hour of playback in case you are in a hurry and forget that your earbuds are dead.</p>
<p>This is one of the best deals on Samsung’s earbuds so far in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding a laptop that can handle everything from pro-level video editing to more casual gaming means spending upwards of $3,000, and that’s something most people simply can’t justify. Everyone wants a powerful machine that doesn’t chug when the work starts to get serious but the budgetary reality most are faced with compromises. Until now. This early Black Friday deal on Amazon completely upends that equation by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">the Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM, etc) from its usual $3,299 price all the way down to just $995</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 70% discount on a true performance powerhouse</strong>, and the deal isn’t even available on Dell’s own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Intel Core 7 150U processor powers this machine with the kind of processing muscle you would expect from significantly more expensive laptops. This chip has speeds up to 5.4 GHz and boasts a hybrid architecture, with <strong>10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, all working across 12 threads</strong>. You get three separate engines inside: CPU tasks, GPU graphics, and NPU AI acceleration. In other words, it handles everything from complex spreadsheets to AI-powered applications with ease.</p>



<h2>Ideal for Daily Tasks</h2>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM changes the way you work as slowdowns that plague machines with less memory are gone. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple Adobe Creative Suite apps at once, have multiple Excel workbooks processing data, and still switch between everything instantly. Compared to DDR4 found in older laptops, DDR5 provides faster data transfer rates which means your processor spends less time waiting for information and more actually processing your work.</p>



<p>The touchscreen features a 16-inch WQXGA display with 1920 x 1200 resolution and offers more vertical real estate compared to the usual 1080p panel. That extra height makes a difference when you code, read long documents or deal with a spreadsheet that requires a few more rows visible at once. The 300-nit brightness is sufficient for you to comfortably work in well-lit offices or near windows while the anti-glare coating prevents reflections from turning your screen into a mirror.</p>
<p>The Thunderbolt 4 port delivers transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps and means you can transfer whole project folders to external drives in seconds, rather than minutes. This same port supports dual 4K displays or a single 8K monitor, turning your laptop into a multiscreen workstation when you’re at your desk. Combined with traditional USB 3.2 ports for peripherals, HDMI for presentations, and WiFi 6E for lightning-fast wireless connections, this laptop connects to everything you need without requiring a drawer full of adapters.</p>
<p>This is one of the best laptop deals you can get right now, and it’s exclusively available at Amazon.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/runescape-3/" data-ref-id="5000-174981">RuneScape's</a> Treasure Hunter microtransactions will soon be no more, after the game's community overwhelmingly voted to see it and other similar microtransactions removed. Developer Jagex is calling it a "new era" for the MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">In a video announcing the decision, Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy (known to the community as Mod North) said "the community has spoken," and as such, Treasure Hunter will be removed on January 19, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature sees players granted keys each day that can be used to open what are effectively loot boxes containing XP, gold, and more. While players are granted a number of keys for free each day, keys can also be bought for real money. More than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/runescapes-future-may-be-radically-reshaped-after-fan-vote/1100-6535811/" data-ref-id="1100-6535811">120,000 players voted</a> to see Treasure Hunter and other microtransactions removed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjHVGbFwr4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JCjHVGbFwr4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, just the start of Jagex's plans. Bellamy said on the same day Treasure Hunter is removed, Jagex will also significantly reduce the amount of "gameplay-impacting MTX across the board." That includes the ability to purchase items that grant direct XP, as well as other items like Proteans, Dummies, and more, North said.</p><p dir="ltr">"January 19 is the start of a new era for RuneScape, powered by a shared desire to see this game grow for decades to come," North said.</p><p dir="ltr">Next year, Jagex will release an "integrity roadmap" that will address core issues surrounding the game, including the user interface and user experience, the game's visual identity, and more. Additional details will be shared on January 19.</p><p dir="ltr">Removing Treasure Hunter has been a long time coming. In June, Bellamy noted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbIXekZocI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> that its approach to microtransactions was "harming RuneScape" and stated "it's time that we took action. Jagex then experimented with a number of different changes to in-game purchases. In September, Bellamy said in an <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/jagex-prepared-to-take-financial" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> that Jagex "probably won't maintain the revenue that we currently are" when making changes to microtransactions.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the truth," Bellamy said. "But equally, if we're taking a 10 or 15 or 25-year view, some short-term pain is probably worth the restoration of the game if we can get to that point."</p><p dir="ltr">Jagex's adherence to a community vote for the removal of Treasure Hunter is similar to how it handles the much less microtransaction-heavy Old School RuneScape. Released in 2013 and based on the 2007 version of RuneScape, Old School Runescape is now far more popular than the more modern RuneScape (aka RuneScape 3). New features are only added to Old School RuneScape if 70% of its community votes for them.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/old-school-runescape-is-more-popular-than-ever-breaks-concurrent-player-record/1100-6533697/" data-ref-id="1100-6533697">Old School RuneScape is more popular than ever before</a>, and even broke player number records earlier this year with more than 241,000 concurrent players. The MMO's first new skill as voted on by the community, <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/sailing-launches-on-november-19th?oldschool=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sailing</a>, is set to release November 19.</p>

Undoubtedly the only thing anyone in the PC world will be talking about for the next week is Valve's trio of hardware announcements, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, and their new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>. But don't forget about the old Steam Deck just yet! While Valve didn't announce anything handheld related today, they have commented on where they're at when it comes to anything like a Steam Deck 2.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">IGN</a>, Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais shared that there are plans for an upgraded version of the Steam Deck somewhere along the line, it's just that the technology just isn't there yet. "Obviously the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck… the thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product," Griffais  said.
</p>
<p>
He noted how Valve isn't interested in marginal improvements of performance at the same battery life, and that they "want something a little bit more demarcated than that… and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC [System on a Chip] landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck."
</p>
<p>
Not that we should be encouraging hours upon hours of playing games, but battery life is one thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">even the Steam Deck OLED struggles with</a>. It does run better than the original Steam Deck, it just also isn't necessarily all that suited for taking on the go, which is kind of the point of these things. Hopefully Valve have plans bigger than just better battery life. I dislike that new generation of consoles offer uniformly the same experience as their predecessors but with slightly fancier graphics, and don't want to see that in a hypothetical Steam Deck 2.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678">Superhero workplace comedy game <em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit this year, already selling over a million copies since launching in October. And the fandom around the game is ravenous, with many players deeply invested in the narrative-driven adventure game’s romances. This caught the devs off guard, and might lead to some cut sex scenes returning in some form.</p> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">In a new interview with <em>Inverse</em>,</a>&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em> writer Pierre Shorette talked about how the game came together over the last few years and was asked about fans going wild over the few relationship and romance options in the superhero game developed by some former Telltale folks.</p>  <p>“I don’t know that I anticipated it to be as ravenous as it’s been,” said Shorette of the fan reaction. “It’s probably why we didn’t plan for more romance options, because we didn’t know it was going to be such a meaningful part of the experience for folks.” Shorette explained that he often defaults to romantic comedy when writing and has tried to resist this tendency, but romance was never an intentional focus of <em>Dispatch.</em> Rather, it was just one of the many parts of the game. Still, seeing the fans react to the romance and sex that exist in the game has Shorette wondering if they made a mistake.</p> <p>“We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn’t have,” Shorette told the outlet. “Maybe folks will get to see those one day.”</p> <p>“There isn’t anyone on the development team that wouldn’t have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way. We’re still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it’s doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often, with these games, is branching too.”</p> <p>Regardless, <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-dialogue-options-chair-episode-3-golem-choice-2000640791"><em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit, with fans begging the devs for another season. And that might just happen. But for now, Shorette and the team at Ad Hoc Studios are just happy people like <em>Dispatch</em> so much.&nbsp; All eight episodes of <em>Dispatch</em> are out now on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

                <p>Even former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime was surprised by the somewhat sparse launch lineup of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>"I wouldn't be completely honest if [I didn't say] from a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit," said Fils-Aime--who served as Nintendo of America's president and chief operating officer from 2006 until he retired in 2019--during an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about?triedRedirect=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "But I think certainly what I underestimated was the enhanced performance, the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, I think has been compelling. The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly Bananza was a key driver for them."</p><p>When the original Switch launched in 2017, it was accompanied by The Legend of Zelda: Breathe of the Wild and joined later in the year by Super Mario Odyssey. Switch 2's big launch title was Mario Kart World in June 2025, followed by Donkey Kong Bananza a month later. But while many didn't consider those games to be system sellers, they were both hits with players and critics alike.</p><p>Fils-Aime attributed the success of the Switch 2 launch to Nintendo's global team and noted that "being able to successfully launch a new system after you've had historical success with the prior system is quite a challenge." He pointed to several examples of that, including Nintendo following the Wii with the less successful Wii U.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alum-reggie-subtly-roasts-switch-2-welcome-tour-price/1100-6530775/" data-ref-id="1100-6530775">Fils-Aime appeared to disagree</a> with Nintendo's decision to charge $10 for the Switch 2 Welcome Pack. As a contrast, he compared it to his decision to release Wii Sports as an included title for Wii consoles in North America. In 2022, Fils-Aime predicted that the large number of studio acquisitions by Sony and Microsoft would lead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-of-america-boss-reggie-fils-aime-reacts-to-microsoft-and-sonys-acquisition-sprees/1100-6507374/" data-ref-id="1100-6507374">to senior designers breaking away</a> and launching their own innovative games. There have been some high-profile directors and designers that left larger companies, but Fils-Aime noted a lack of innovation during his new interview.</p><p>"I do hope that this industry doesn't stagnate," said Fils-Aime. "There are, at times, signs that the innovation isn't there. The breakthrough new type of content seems to be a little bit further and far between. That concerns me, and I hope that doesn't stop."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/as-arc-raiders-takes-off-developer-embark-defends-its-use-of-ai-tools">Embark caught some flak for this approach</a> (which was also used in the company's other major release, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/finals">The Finals</a>), to the extent that our friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer</a> took a stand and marked the game down for its use of GenAI.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">Automaton Media</a>, ARC Raider publisher Nexon has now added its voice to the mix, with CEO Junghun Lee telling Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game*Spark</a> that "it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI."</p>

<p>While Lee goes on to clarify that human creativity is the key ingredient even in a world dominated by AI, his initial statement has triggered a frosty reception from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> developer Necrosoft Games.</p>
<p>"Not only do we not use AI we would rather cut off our own arms than do so," says the studio in a post on social media. "Demonschool is 100% human made."</p>
<p>Demonschool is a tactical RPG with a focus on swift combat that takes inspiration from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-persona-games-on-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Persona</a> series. It launches on November 19th. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-demonschool-is-a-love-letter-to-ds-games-and-italian-horror-movies">We previewed it back in 2022</a>, so give that a read if it sounds like it's up your street.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve a penchant for collecting things and not stopping, then <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> is either your best friend or your worst nightmare. Though it’s a shooter through and through, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ crafting and loot system is rich with <i>stuff</i> to gather and is an essential part of the game. From deflated soccer balls to high-powered weaponry and everything in between, there’s so much junk in this game that it’s easy to trip yourself up in the labyrinthine layout of its various menus.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>So I thought it only natural, from one hoar–<i>collector</i> to another, to help you out by sharing some of my approaches to managing the endless gathering in this otherwise action-packed adrenaline rush of a game.</p>

 <p>I’m taking a three-pronged approach here, addressing what I feel are the three most common pain points in inventory management.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-stella-montis-community-shredder-matriarch-2000643465#comments"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is Getting A New Map But Players Have To Work To Unlock It</a></p>

 <p>Because here’s the secret: The inventory management and crafting meta game of <i>Arc Raiders</i> is what propels the action out there on the maps. It’s what you’re here to do: find stuff to make stuff. And so an overflowing inventory is actually an opportunity to create a little task list for yourself and thus find yourself out there in the field, possibly getting into some good fights.</p>

 <h2>Shit, my inventory’s full</h2> <p>Maybe you just got back from a raid, and you can’t accept any new materials from Scrappy because your inventory’s full. Maybe you got something cool from completing a quest and can’t use it because your inventory’s full. Maybe you can’t even use a Free Loadout because, you guessed it, your inventory’s full.</p>

 <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Field Depot In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>If this is the case, I’m going to guess that you’re not paying that much attention to the details of your inventory’s contents. But with so many items, the idea of scrolling through that massive grid of icons might seem laborious. Fear not, for with some simple steps, we can sort this mess.</p>

 <h3>Step one: Manage your inventory stacks</h3> <figure id="attachment_2000643640" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643640"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643640">© Gif: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You may not’ve noticed this, but <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ inventory system isn’t the most efficient at clearing space for you. For a game that’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436#comments">catching flack for its use of AI</a>, your inventory isn’t very artificially intelligent or well automated.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Publisher Defends Generative AI And Says You Should Assume Everyone’s Using It</a></p> <p>Take Shotgun ammo. Everything’s arranged in a grid, with some icons representing stacks. You can stack 20 shells in a single icon. If you have more than that, you’ll end up with multiple stacks maxing out at 20 shells each. But it’s not uncommon to have multiple grid spaces taken up by stacks lower than the 20-count max. You might have a single stack of 20, then a stack of 12, then a stack of 2, taking up three spots in your inventory grid. Inefficient!</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>All you have to do here is drag the lower-count stacks on top of each other to free up extra grid space. Go through your items and see if there are any excess stacks taking up space and you’ll be surprised how many spaces on your grid you’ll clear.</p>

 <h3>Step two: Sell valuables and break down recyclables</h3> <p>If your inventory’s overflowing because you have a habit of collecting every damn thing you see, you might have some valuables in your inventory you need to get rid of. Honestly, I’m surprised at how many times a random valuable like a music cassette tape, rubber duck, or set of rosary beads are just chilling in the Misc. category.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-skins-cosmetics-decks-battle-pass-duos-2000643456"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Lowering Skin Prices And Issuing Refunds After Backlash</a></p> <p>These have got to go–<i>unless</i> you need them to craft something. Once again, the inventory system of <i>Arc Raiders</i> fails us. Not everything that is labeled as either recyclable or sellable is inherently made to be discarded. Pillows, for example, are valuables you can sell. But you also need them to upgrade Scrappy at the Workshop. Be sure to track any crafting projects you’re working on so you don’t accidentally sell the necessary items for it.</p>

 <p>Likewise, you should sift through your inventory in the Crafting submenu indicated by the wrench icon to recycle any junk that isn’t immediately useful to you. Like with valuables, some of these are secretly needed for Workshop upgrades, so be mindful of what you’re breaking down. Sometimes clearing out a handful of camera lenses, candle holders, radios, and rusted tools is all you need to free up space.</p> <h3>Step three: Repair and upgrade existing gear</h3> <figure id="attachment_2000643636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643636"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643636">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You really shouldn’t have too many duplicates of the same piece of gear in your inventory. Your guns and shields, for example, have durability meters that need to be maintained. And guns can also be upgraded to improve their functionality.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">So Much Happens In A Single Hour Of <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>One way to start clearing up space in your inventory is to tend to these needs. Repair all existing shields, make sure your guns are either at max durability or are on their way to their top upgrade tier. I also recommend crafting weapon mods and slapping them on your weapons as soon as you can.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643637" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643637"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643637">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>All of these actions cost crafting supplies, so by tending to your existing arsenal, you very well may shrink your total inventory as craftables get consumed.</p> <h3>Bonus tip plus a cheat sheet: Craft Quick Use items and take them with you</h3> <p>This is similar to the previous tip, but I heartily recommend taking the time to craft things like smoke grenades, noisemakers, door blockers and more. Not only are these items a lot of fun and very useful on the battlefield, but crafting them consumes materials and taking them out with you frees up your inventory.</p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has a ton of loot and junk to collect.
