Some are worried that it simply means Bandai Namco is planning to dole out each new style over months and years through a relentless drip-feed of microtransaction add-ons as it’s done with <em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>. <em>Sparking</em>&nbsp;<em>Zero </em>seems destined to be the ultimate <em>DBZ</em> sim, but no <em>DBZ</em> sim is complete without more robust dress-up options. </p><p>Enter modders who are at least bringing some of these costume changes to the PC version of the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Piccolo Postboy outfit</a></span> was added to the GameBanana mod repository yesterday.

Of course, there are plenty of other outfits still missing, like Goku and Vegeta’s “SAB” winter jackets from the <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly </em>movie and Gohan’s Kai outfit from the Buu Saga. </p><p>I can forgive some of these missing from the game at launch, but too many of the best alternate costumes seem MIA at the moment. I’m not above paying for them all if they get rolled out later. It would have felt more satisfying if they were all late-game unlockables, though. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you're a live service game, you're lucky if you can keep your returning and new player numbers steady long-term. But The Sims 4 is currently dealing with the exact opposite of that trend: ten years after launch, it just brought in over 15 million new players in a year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from EA's Q2 earnings, which released today. The 15 million figure is fairly shocking for a ten-year-old game, even given that the base game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-base-game-will-soon-become-totally-free">has been free-to-play since 2022</a>. For some perspective, it took The Sims 4 four years after launch to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/02/04/how-sims-navigated-20-years-change-become-one-most-successful-franchises-ever/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach 20 million unique players</a> (this was back when it was a premium game). When it first went free-to-play, it gained a whopping 31 million new players out of the gate, and reached a total of 85 million as of May 2024. It's not clear how exactly the 15 million gained lines up with the last count of 85 million to give us a new, current total, but that's still a heck of a lot of people.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/21/sims4010829141280jpg-ed62e1-160w-1710983188147.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Sims 4 is still going strong more than 10 years after its original release. Image source: EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that the game has improved significantly since its initial launch, which got a lukewarm reception for being rather thin on expected features at the time. In our re-review of The Sims 4 this year, we noted that while it's starting to feel its age, "a strong community and frequent updates have kept it at the top of the life simulator genre." And indeed, a regular cadence of expansion packs and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-promises-more-bug-fixes-performance-improvements-in-response-to-community-frustration">ongoing commitment to technical and community support</a> have helped it grow massively since its shift to free-to-play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, it seems there's no clear upcoming successor to replace The Sims 4 and slow this growth down. EA has clarified it has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no plans for The Sims 5</a> at this time, and while its mysterious Project Rene is holding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-project-rene-will-get-another-small-invite-only-playtest-this-fall">another invite-only playtest this fall</a>, it still seems to be quite a ways off...and perhaps <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-community-is-blowing-up-amid-project-rene-leaks-suggesting-big-changes-are-in-store">undergoing some pretty big changes</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA also reported that the Madden and College Football franchises combined are on track to cross $1 billion in net bookings for the fiscal year ending March of 2025. For the quarter, EA reported $2.08 billion in net bookings, setting a new Q2 record, and $2.02 billion in net revenue. The company's shared its outlook for the full year to be between $7.4 billion and $7.7 billion in net revenue, while its revenue outlook for Q3 is between $1.87 billion and $2.02 billion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Contributing to that outlook is Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which launches at the end of this week and which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">we gave a 9/10</a>, saying it "refreshes and reinvigorates this storied series with enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of companions, and moving character writing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA expects to release one more game this year after Dragon Age, but it hasn't announced it yet. Per its earnings slides, this is an "unannounced partner title." Though there's no way of knowing what this will be, it's possible this will be the project <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-crosses-20-million-copies-sold-as-creator-teases-next-project">recently teased by Hazelight Studios' Josef Fares</a>, a "new IP" under the EA Originals label that we only know to be an "all-new co-op adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>For anyone who has ever watched an Indiana Jones movie, there's no question about where the title character stands on Nazis. He's been punching them in the face ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark hit theaters in 1981. Nazis have also been recurring villains in two of the four films that followed. But Bethesda's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, will further emphasis the franchise's anti-Nazi stance with an in-game statement.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-includes-warning-denouncing-nazis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, The Great Circle's developer, MachineGames, added the following disclaimer: "The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity."</p><p>This statement comes amidst <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-scholz-says-dark-neo-nazi-networks-are-rise-2024-01-26/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a resurgence in neo-Nazi activity</a>, in both Europe and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/27/neonazis-ai-hitler-videos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in America</a>. The Indiana Jones movies have never really dealt with the weightier real-world implications of the Nazi atrocities, and the game will follow in those footsteps with some history mixed with fantasy elements. But rest assured, Dr. Jones will be dealing with the game's Nazis in the same way he's always done for the last 43 years.</p><p>GameSpot's Kurt Indovina recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">his early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which he favorably compared to Dishonored. He also said that the game "understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to be Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole."</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9. A PlayStation 5 port will follow in 2025.</p>

This year, the Blood Moon is back and bigger than ever," the game's website explains in <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-crimson-eye" rel="nofollow ">a recent blog post</a>. "Paranormal energy has drastically increased in several locations, resulting in a new weather type, The Blood Moon. Enter these cursed locations and complete investigations, optional objectives and photograph any Blood Altars you may find to earn Blood Points. Work together with the Ghost Huntin' Community to collect Blood Points and earn brand-new rewards. Be warned, during the Blood Moon, ghosts will be empowered and stronger than ever."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post noted that accessing Blood Moon (and all "future seasonal or temporary events") will require an online connection, even when playing solo. This is due to the fact that temporary in-game events bring with them "a lot of technical changes," so keeping players online when interacting with live/seasonal events "will allow [Kinetic Games] to keep track of the event progress and make live changes on our cloud servers, if needed."</p><p dir="ltr">The Crimson Eye update also adds an Event Board to the Warehouse. The Event Board features "leaflets for current in-game events and challenges," which allow players to individually track their progress for each event they're taking part in. The game's photo cork board has been moved to the truck parked inside the Warehouse to make room for the Event Board, which is located between the truck and the Warehouse's door. The Event Board currently features two new challenges: Ranger Challenge and Sunny Meadows Survival.</p><p dir="ltr">Other improvements include a physics upgrade that makes doors <em>much</em> less frustrating. Moving doors can no longer push players out of the way (great for those moments when one's teammates can't seem to decide if they're coming or going), and doors can no longer be pulled off their hinges. Additionally, players can no longer be pushed through walls or other solid objects, and players suffering low frame rates can finally cross "accidentally clipping through the floor of Point Hope" off their list of totally rational fears, as the floor has evidently been reinforced with low-FPS-proof wood.</p><p>Phasmophobia's Crimson Eye update patch notes are listed in full below.

Sony then published <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an internal email</a> from CEO Hermen Hulst confirming that it’s actually shutting down two studios: Firewalk and Neon Koi, a mobile developer made up of veterans from Rockstar and Wargaming and formerly known as Savage Games. Sony purchased the former in 2023 and the latter in 2022. Now they’re both victims of what has proven to be a tumultuous year for the purveyor of all things PlayStation, which also <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off 17 percent of Bungie</a> and, of course, took <em>Concord </em>offline after the game <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crashed and burned</a> at launch after a <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1851326669513953344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy, expensive development cycle</a> resulted in a game that was competently made but felt immediately dated.</p><p>"We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.

		<p>Following its aborted launch in early September, Sony has decided to permanently shut down <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> and also close down developer Firewalk Studios. They are also closing mobile developer Neon Koi as they reevaluate the approach to mobile gaming, cancelling the studio’s “mobile action game”.</p>
<p>Taking the unusual step of self-publishing an internal email about the business decisions – to be fair, they would have just leaked, so this is far neater –&nbsp;CEO of Studio Business Group, Hermen Hulst said:</p>


<p>“After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset [Concord] and close the studio.   I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.</p>
<p>“The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.</p>
<p>“I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.&nbsp; Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization.&nbsp; Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible.”</p>

<p><a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/">You can read the full statement here.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/FirewalkStudios/status/1851327043956592781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851327043956592781%7Ctwgr%5Eceedb39da2ddf519e667819c6b45a3e65245ea62%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F10%2F29%2F24282900%2Fsony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Firewalk also had a public farewell</a>, taking to Twitter to tell the tale of the studio and game’s development. In it they reveal that following the studio’s founding in 2018, they didn’t really grow and enter full production on the game until 2022 – a two year turnaround is actually fairly respectable from that point. They also underwent the always tricky process of integrating following their acquisition by Sony.</p>
<p>“We took some risks along the way,” they wrote, “marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters – and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward. The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them. Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way.”</p>
<p>We certainly share that sentiment for both Firewalk and Neon Koi, with the last couple of years making for bleak reading across the game’s industry. Hopefully people can land on their feet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Concord will go down as one of the biggest entertainment flops of all time, the game having reportedly cost hundreds of million of dollars to produce – including Sony’s acquisition of Firewalk mid-development. Despite aspirations to rival the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/valorant">Valorant</a>, the game barely got out of the starting blocks upon its launch in August. With a £35 price tag instead of being free-to-play, it drew a concurrent player count that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">maxed out at 697 players on Steam</a> and barely scraped three figures on PC after the first couple of days.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Sony took the decision to pull the game from sale</a>, suspend online service, and issue refunds to all players, while Firewalk was given time to “explore options” for a potential return. This was widely expected to be a pivot to free-to-play or a subscriber tie in for PlayStation Plus, but Sony has decided that writing the game off (and potential tax benefits from doing so) is the better path financially.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord review</a> we scored it an 8/10 and were admittedly saddened to see the axe fall so soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Sony announced they are shutting down two of the studios that they have acquired over the last few years.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="An Update from PlayStation Studios  ">email</a> that was originally distributed internally to Sony owned companies, Hermen Hulst (the CEO of the Sony Studio business group) shared that they had decided to shut down Neon Koi, and Firewalk Studios. Both of these studios were acquired by Sony over the last few years, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studios-mobile-announced-alongside-new-acquisition" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" PlayStation Studios Mobile Announced Alongside New Acquisition">Neon Koi</a> (then going by Savage Games) acquired in 2022, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-acquiring-firewalk-studios-to-help-grow-live-services" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Sony Acquiring Firewalk Studios to Help Grow Live Services">Firewalk Studios </a>being acquired in 2023.</p>

<p>Firewalk Studios acquisition was part of a push towards live service games, with the company working to create <em>Concord</em>, which released this year to dismal reception. Infamously, <em>Concord</em>'s reception was so bad that within weeks <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Concord Shutting Down, Sony Offering Full Refunds">Sony was offering refunds</a> to everyone for the game, and taking it off shelves while they pondered what to do. The decision seems to be to shutter the doors on <em>Concord</em>, and the people who made it completely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from <em>Concord </em>and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area. - Herman Hulst</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Hulst's letter mentions taking lessons from <em>Concord</em>, it is notably far from PlayStation's first issue with the attempted push towards live service. There's been a variety of issues with Bungie leading to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Bungie Lays Off Over 200 Staff as Part of &quot;New Path&quot;">repeated layoffs</a> including only a few months ago, and them reducing the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-revised-its-live-service-ganes-plans-with-only-6-games-coming-by-fy-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" PlayStation Revised Plans for Live Service Games With Only 6 Titles Coming by FY 2025">number of live service games </a>that they aim to release in the next while.</p>

<p>Firewalk Studios <a href="https://x.com/FirewalkStudios/status/1851327043956592781" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Firewalk Studios Statement">released a statement </a>on the social media outlet formerly known as Twitter about the closure, saying in part,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We took some risks along the way – marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters – and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward.</p>

<p>The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them.&nbsp; Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neon Koi's acquisition was aimed at helping grow their mobile games business, an area that the company has been struggling to break into for a long time now. Consistently outshined by the Sony Music division in mobile games, which famously publishes <em>Fate/Grand Order</em> and set up it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-new-publishing-label-unties-is-publishing-pc-and-switch-games" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Sony's New Publishing Label Unties is Publishing PC And Switch Games">own publishing label</a> called Unties. Meanwhile, Sony Interactive Entertainment had issues with Forwardworks, and with the shutting down of Neon Koi, it seems that the PlayStation Studios Mobile effort is off to similar issues. Sadly, Neon Koi never got to ship a game either under it's original name or rebranding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts.&nbsp; To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.&nbsp; - Herman Hulst</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even while Sony has sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" PS5 Sales Pass 54.7 Milion Units, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Has Sold 10 Million Copies">record numbers of games</a>, we are seeing them continue a disturbing trend of video game layoffs. By May we were already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" This Week in Gaming Business - 10k Layoffs So Far This Year">over 10k layoffs</a>, and the hits have only kept coming. Following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Microsoft Shuts Down Redfall and Hi-Fi Rush Creators">earlier shutdowns by Microsoft</a> of Arkane Austin, and Tango Gameworks (among others), it serves as a reminder that an acquisition doesn't mean the team is safe.</p>

Originally released in Japan in September 2023, <em>Ys X</em> now at last has a worldwide English-language release. And yet, despite all this, you’ve never played a <em>Ys</em> game! Let us convince you this is the perfect place to start.</p><p>Before I say anything to you about <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>, I need to level with you for a second: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135">I’m a huge fan of Nihon Falcom’s <em>Ys</em> series</a></span>. This long-running action-RPG series has captivated me since I first played <em>Ys I&amp;II </em>on the TurboGrafx-CD, and my casual blogging about the series eventually turned into my professional writing career. Every writer has inherent biases to consider when recommending a video game on the internet, and it’s only fair that you know that my biases are especially strong in this case.</p><p>With that said, after pouring roughly 50 hours into the official English version of <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>, I’m here to tell you that I <em>really</em> loved playing this game. This is easily the biggest evolution the series has seen in its core gameplay since <em>Ys Seven</em>, and I eagerly sought out every side quest and optional boss I could find just to make the experience last. Despite the absolute deluge of quality RPGs released this year, <em>Ys X</em> is one of my favorite games of 2024.</p><p>If you’ve never dipped your toes into <em>Ys</em> before, know that <em>Ys X</em><strong> is a mostly self-contained story early</strong> in the overall series canon. You can jump right into this game without feeling like you’re missing the plot from the other games. With that said, is <em>Ys X</em> really the best way to get into the series, or should you opt for one of the earlier entries instead? To answer that, I’ll break down my biggest pros and cons about <em>Ys X</em> below, and I’ll give my firm opinion on who I think would most enjoy playing <em>Ys X</em> first at the end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cf161af2f3d15d324c12620c787c63e" data-recommend-id="image://5cf161af2f3d15d324c12620c787c63e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A boy with red hair swings his sword to hit the leg of a giant golem.

Other recent <em>Ys</em> games played as fast-paced hack-and-slash action-RPGs, with an emphasis on perfectly timed dodging and switching between party members to exploit enemy weaknesses. In <em>Ys X</em>, the party system has been minimized, and there are no more enemy weaknesses. Protagonists Adol and Karja now fight in tandem as you rapidly switch between the two to barrage enemies with quick strikes and build huge combos. Similarly, the dodge mechanics have mostly coalesced into Adol and Karja’s block function, with perfectly timed parries resulting in the series’ trademark “Flash Guard.”</p><p>These changes transform the combat of <em>Ys X</em> so much that my muscle memory from past <em>Ys</em> games completely failed me at first. However, once I got the hang of it, I couldn’t believe the colorful flurries of quick sword strikes I was pulling off on screen. Since Adol and Karja have separate SP meters which their special attacks consume, combat felt like a dance where I constantly looked for the right moments to tag the two in and out of battle to maintain a functionally endless stream of special attacks. Meanwhile, by activating the “Duo Mode,” Adol and Karja fight as a singular unit to deliver weighty attacks that I used to generously dispatch huge groups of foes and lay the smack down on bosses whenever they left themselves open.</p><p>Duo Mode pairs perfectly with <em>Ys X</em>’s block, as perfectly timed parries cause Adol and Karja to lock steel with their foes until they push them back and inflict damage-boosted counter attacks. Make no mistake, this is still a very fast action game, just like previous series entries—it’s just that <em>Ys X</em> isn’t afraid to slow the action down at times, to let you build up to those moments of sheer speed the previous games were known for. Falcom basically created a battle system that embodies the feeling of a well designed <em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em> level.</p><p>I could go on, but at this point, you can just look at combo videos uploaded from the Japanese release of <em>Ys X</em> and see how cool it looks in motion yourself. It’s just good, man.</p><h3 id="h10306"><a id=""></a>The cast of characters is lovable</h3><figure id="" data-id="e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-recommend-id="image://e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-recommend-id="image://e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Ys</em> games generally aren’t known for gripping storylines. However, this series excels at creating warm atmospheres where virtually every NPC has a name and their own personal stories that advance in the background of the main plot. <em>Ys X</em> especially excels on this front, featuring an emotive crew that supports Adol and Karja as they sail the seas in their boat. However, in a surprising twist for the series, it’s the protagonists that steal the show this time around.</p><p><em>Ys X</em> is a coming of age tale, in which teenagers Adol and Karja are literally bound together by a thread of fate (it’s literally wrapped around their wrists like cuffs) as they join forces to figure out why they’re so attached, and rescue the residents of the town Carnac. While Adol is typically a silent protagonist, he’s surprisingly expressive in <em>Ys X</em>. He’s a flighty goofball with a mischievous streak, but his boundless thirst for adventure and his penchant to run headfirst into danger makes him easy to root for when the chips are down. Meanwhile, while Karja comes off as a stereotypical tsundere at first, her calculated demeanor endeared me to her as she grew into the leader that the people of Carnac needed. Make no mistake, though; Karja’s just as much the badass fighter that Adol is, and it’s a joy to see how well together they work as a team</p><p>Even as soon as the game’s second chapter, Adol and Karja establish a genuine, earnest bond with each other as they share stories of their lives and support each other through their hardships. Whenever they defeat a major boss together, they celebrate with a fistbump or a highfive in exactly the same way you might rejoice after beating a tough challenge with a friend in a video game. They have disagreements and get into nasty arguments, but if anything, these moments further drive home just how authentic their bond together feels. <em>Ys X</em> feels surprisingly personal, and it’s one of the best ways to get to know series protagonist Adol. It’s a low-stakes story by RPG standards, but the overarching themes of realizing your potential and finding meaning in life resonated with me thanks to how well the characters were written.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-recommend-id="image://c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-recommend-id="image://c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Ys X</em> naturally isn’t perfect, and these were my biggest nitpicks throughout my playthrough.</p><h3 id="h10307"><a id=""></a>It’s a surprisingly slow burn</h3><p>In the past, <em>Ys</em> games were generally no-nonsense action-RPGs. After only a handful of minutes to set up the story, the older entries generally threw you headfirst into adventure and carried that energy until you reached the end credits. By comparison, <em>Ys X</em> spends much more time establishing its cast and setting the stage for its story. To its credit, it sprinkles in combat throughout its introduction, and does at least make its tutorials go by pretty fast. Still, the game doesn’t quite hit its stride until Chapter 4, even though I still had fun up until that point.</p><h3 id="h10308"><a id=""></a>The enemy variety is a bit weak</h3><p>As much as I loved the combat system of <em>Ys X</em>, I did wish it had more unique challenges to test my mettle. The pool of common enemies is surprisingly limited, with the same foes popping up in almost every single dungeon in the game. One miniboss appears a double digit number of times before the game ends. You could argue this is a good thing for action game newbies, since you’ll have several opportunities to learn how to perfectly parry each enemy’s attacks. Still, I did feel corners were cut in the enemy design.</p><p>The game does give its enemies some new attacks as you progress, so it’s not all the same from start to finish. I also never felt a feeling of repetition sink in thanks to just how quickly Adol and Karja unlock new special attacks to level up. Still, once I saw some of the crazy bosses that pop up in the final act, I wished I’d seen those kinds of challenges throughout the entire game.</p><h3 id="h10309"><a id=""></a>It’s visually a little bland</h3><p><em>Ys</em> games generally operate on modest budgets, so cutting-edge graphics were never on the table for <em>Ys X</em>. Still, as I sailed from island to island, I found locations started to blend together, since they mostly looked the same. I can’t say for sure if <em>Ys X</em> recycles textures from <em>Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana</em>, but I did consistently feel I wasn’t looking at anything new.</p><p>To be fair to <em>Ys X</em>, the characters themselves are wonderfully expressive. There are some really fun cutscenes that endeared me even more to the main cast of characters, so the graphical budget was invested wisely overall. Again, this just felt like an area where corners were cut. Given the state of the game industry right now, I personally can’t hold this too hard against Falcom.</p><h3 id="h10310"><a id=""></a>Older <em>Ys</em> games had stronger soundtracks</h3><p>I want to be very clear here: <em>Ys X</em> has very good music. This is the first <em>Ys</em> game to feature Shuntaro Koguchi, and his contributions capture the catchy hooks and energy that have made past entries in the series so memorable. There are several tracks in the game that I have repeated nonstop since I finished the game, which includes an absolute banger of a final boss track.</p><p>Still, the soundtrack of <em>Ys X</em> doesn’t quite evoke that sense of awe that past games in the series consistently captured. That “<em>Ys</em> moment” where the adventure kicks off while some of the best video game music you’ve ever heard in your life plays never really came to me, even though I still enjoyed the tunes. Bafflingly, some of the strongest songs in the soundtrack are criminally underutilized. One song that could have easily evoked that “<em>Ys</em> moment” was relegated to the end credits! Again, this is a very good soundtrack by RPG standards, just a weaker one by <em>Ys</em> standards.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-recommend-id="image://03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-recommend-id="image://03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is neither good nor bad in my book, but this piece wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t talk about arguably the most divisive part of <em>Ys X</em>. For the first time in the series, <em>Ys X</em> features a classic RPG-style world map that Adol’s group traverses via a boat. These segments are a game within a game, as you can get into battles with enemy ships and upgrade your vessel with materials you find on your journey. This is conceptually similar to the airship traversal from the Dreamcast classic RPG <em>Skies of Arcadia</em>, which means I can finally check “talk about <em>Skies of Arcadia</em> this year” off my to-do list.</p><p>I enjoyed this seafaring side of the game, but it doesn’t make the best first impression. Boat combat is wildly different from the game’s core battle system, and at the start of the game, your vessel is <em>very</em> slow. Pro tip: <strong>Wait to focus on traveling to marked locations on your map until you’re about halfway through Chapter Four</strong>. This is when you can start purchasing speed upgrades that make the boat way easier to handle, and you’ll actually start to spot points of interest in the distance that are worth traveling to. There’s no need to frustrate yourself trying to fill in your map and beat ship battles in the early game.</p><p>Funny enough, there is a toggle in the options menu to instantly max out your boat’s stats. So if you <em>really</em> hate the boat sections, you can at least circumvent it quite a bit.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-recommend-id="image://43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-recommend-id="image://43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Again, I want to stress that I <em>really</em> liked <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>. I’d rank it as a top five <em>Ys</em> game. As far as whether you should start with <em>Ys X</em>, I’d specifically recommend it for two groups of people.</p><p><strong>1: If you’re an action game enthusiast, <em>Ys X</em> should be your starting point</strong>. The combat mechanics are so enthralling and expressive once you get a handle on the controls, and even on the Nightmare difficulty I never felt like <em>Ys X</em> demanded grinding to win. If you enjoyed the gameplay of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, you should enjoy <em>Ys X</em>.</p><p><strong>2: If you already know you want to play the rest of the <em>Ys</em> games, <em>Ys X</em> is an excellent starting point</strong>. It’s one of the earliest games in the overall series timeline, and the ending literally segues right into 2012’s <em>Ys: Memories of Celceta</em>. From there, you can follow the Chronology of <em>Ys</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitalemelas.com/index_ys.php&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitalemelas.com/index_ys.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as laid out by Digital Emelas</a></span>, and you can take a detour to play <em>Ys I&amp;II</em> and <em>Ys Origin</em> whenever you feel ready for them.</p><p><strong>For everyone else, <em>Ys X: Nordics</em> is a good starting point for the series, but the “best” starting point is debatable</strong>. While <em>Ys X</em> moves the series forward in important ways, it stumbles a bit in areas that fans especially value in these games. The music and consistent high energy has always been the soul of <em>Ys</em>, so a lesser showing on these fronts does make <em>Ys X</em> land slightly weaker than other past games have. <strong>If you’d like to learn about other starting points I’d personally recommend, you can check </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135"><strong>my <em>Ys</em> starter guide here</strong></a></span>.</p><p>Regardless, <strong>I do recommend you play <em>Ys X: Nordics</em> in one way or another, especially if you’ve bothered to read this far</strong>. A <strong>demo</strong> for the game is out now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, which does allow you to transfer your save file to the full game. By the time you approach the end of the demo content, you should hopefully see what makes <em>Ys X</em> so special. Or maybe you won’t—I don’t know what life is like for someone who never owned a TurboGrafx growing up.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to the publisher, the start of Black Ops 6 Season 1 will add a “colossal amount of free content like all-new Multiplayer maps and modes, a terrifying new in-season Zombies map, as well as the introduction of Omnimovement and&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;weapons and Loadout features to&nbsp;Call of Duty: Warzone!”</p>

<p>“Built by Veteran Treyarch Map designer Adam Hoggatt and released as part of&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops&nbsp;in November 2010, this remaster remains extremely faithful to the original design and layout of the map, even down to the precise placement of parked vehicles and other scenery harking back to the original three-lane design,” Activision said. </p>



<p>“This is Nuketown in its most original form, with a bright and bleached desert landscape, and even a double rainbow to gaze at, taking you all the way back to where it all began.”</p>

                <p>It seems like Arachnophobia--the fear of spiders--is becoming more prevalent in the video game realm. Earlier this year, BioWare confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fear-not-dragon-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-0-spiders/1100-6527078/" data-ref-id="1100-6527078">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is completely spider-free</a> despite the eight-legged arachnids' presence in the series' previous titles. Now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been revealed to include spiders, but it has an option to replace them entirely.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-preloading-is-live-for-some-but-finding-it-is-tricky/1100-6527422/" data-ref-id="1100-6527422">Monster Hunter Wilds beta has launched</a>, and as reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-features-an-accessibility-mode-for-players-who-fear-spiders-and-insects/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, sharp-eyed players have noticed that it has an Arachnophobia Assistance feature. There are spiders in the game, including some giant spiders that may prove to be challenging boss fights. But once the Arachnophobia Assistance feature is turned on, all of those spiders will be gone.</p><p>However, that doesn't get the players off the hook for those battles. It only means that the spiders will be replaced by something else. For example, the common spiders in the game will become blob-like slime creatures that are just as difficult to fight as the spiders. Presumably the giant spiders will also be transformed when they appear in the game as well.</p><p>Not every gamer suffers from Arachnophobia, and some may even enjoy the chance to battle against the arachnids in the game. But perhaps the sight of realistically rendered spiders--complete with hairy legs and multiple eyes--may be too much for some players. Either way, the players get to decide whether they want to cathartically face those fears or simply pretend that the creatures aren't there with the flip of a switch.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 28, 2025. PS Plus subscribers currently have early access to the beta, which will expand to non-subscribers on PS5 on October 31, the same day the beta launches for PC and Xbox Series X|S. But the beta will only last until November 3.</p>

            <p>
Fntastic, the developer behind last year's widely derided zombie shooter The Day Before, is - having already been embroiled in controversy over its use of hundreds of unpaid vounteers - now asking community members to design maps to put in its next game as part of a newly announced "contest", but it won't be paying winners for their work.
</p>
<p>
Fntastic's erratic history stretches back a fair distance, but the studio is perhaps best known for the debacle surrounding last year's The Day Before. Fntastic's open-world zombie MMO first made headlines with a striking reveal trailer back in 2021 - catapulting the game to the top of Steam's most wishlisted titles - but its lustre soon began to fade amid repeated (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/calendar-app-company-confirms-the-day-before-trademark-dispute">sometimes bizarre</a>) delays, alongside frequent accusations it was a scam.
</p>
<p>
While Fntastic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-dev-insists-zombie-mmo-is-not-a-scam-following-latest-delay">repeatedly denied those claims</a>, The Day Before's eventual early access launch last December didn't exactly do much to dispel player concerns. The game that launched bore little resemblance to Fntastic's initial trailer and, with Steam reviews soon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-befores-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-seem-deserved">tipping into Overwhelmingly Negative</a>, Fntastic suddenly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-fntastic-suddenly-announces-its-shut-down">announced it was shutting down</a> just four days later, saying it had "failed financially".

<p>
But somewhat amazingly, that wasn't the end of the whole saga. In January, Fntastic resurfaced, blaming The Day Before's failure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-resurfaces-to-blame-games-failure-on-hate-campaign">on a "hate campaign"</a>, and February brought word of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-the-day-before-report-alleges-employees-fined-for-making-mistakes">toxic management practices</a> at the studio. But despite all this, Fntastic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-returns-with-fntastic-20-and-is-asking-for-your-money-again">returned in September</a> to announce a "2.0" launch promising more "honesty", "transparency" and "professionalism" - alongside a Kickstarter campaign for a physics-based multiplayer game called Escape Factory. A month later, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-studio-simultaneously-scraps-failed-kickstarter-and-announces-yet-another-game-instead">Kickstarter was dead</a> due to a lack of interest, but Fntastic still wasn't done and immediately announced a new "action-horror prop hunt" game called Items.
</p><p>
And all of that lengthy pre-amble finally brings us to the present, where Fntastic has - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delayed-steam-pre-order-hit-the-day-before-developer-defends-use-of-unpaid-volunteers">not for the first time</a> - decided it wants other people to help develop its game for free. Although, unlike its previous dalliance with "unpaid volunteers", the studio is dressing this particular opportunity up as a competition. "We're thrilled to announce our first-ever contest," the developer wrote on its Discord (as spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-day-before-asking-community-to-work-on-their-new-game/">The Gamer</a>), "Design a Map for ITEMS!".
</p>
<p>
"This contest is a chance for you to unleash your creativity," it continued, "by designing a map card that, if it wins, will be added to the game in future updates!"
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Fntastic says it's happy to accept entries as a 2D drawing, 3D model, or "any other style", but there's more participants are expected to do. Submissions must include images or artwork, a map name and description, its theme, layout, even balance considerations. Despite that small shopping list of requirements, Fntastic won't be paying anyone for their work, but winners <em>will</em> see their map "fully designed and playable in the game", with their name displayed on it "somewhere", and - assuming it ever materialises - a free copy of Items itself.
</p>
<p>
A little over 24 hours after announcing the competition, four entries have been submitted.

The tabletop miniatures company known for producing beloved wargames is selling this miniature, based on their co-founder, in order to support brain tumor research.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://us.warlordgames.com/products/sergeant-sawyer-charity-figure?_pos=1&amp;_sid=c4b8c214d&amp;_ss=r">official store page</a>, the Sergeant Sawyer miniature is based on Warlord Games' co-founder Paul Sawyer. The miniature is equipped with a light machine gun, a red beret and a hearty salute. He stands ready to lead the British Airborne on their next daring mission, ready to dispense advice and hot lead as needed.</p>

He has recently stepped away from the company due to a serious illness. The miniature's British Airborne origin is in honor of Sawyer's fondness for painting Red Devils&nbsp; The miniature is unpainted metal with a 25 mm round plastic base.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sergeant Sawyer is our tribute to a man without whom Warlord Games would simply not exist, and our lives be far the poorer. Proudly bearing Paul’s smiling face, Sergeant Sawyer is an essential figure for every collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All proceeds from the sale of the Sergeant Sawyer miniature will go towards the <a href="https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/">Brain Tumour Charity</a>. This charity, chosen by Sawyer himself, is the world's leading brain tumor charity and the largest dedicated funder of brain tumor research globally.</p>

Every year they’ve got a new line of merch for every holiday and occasion. It’s a collector’s dream and their wallet’s nightmare. This year is no different, because The Pokémon Company has revealed some adorable plushies for its 2024 holiday line, and these little guys are so cute, it makes me want to decorate for the holidays before Halloween is even here.</p><p>The Holiday Poké Plush line includes a handful of the cutest, cuddliest little shits you’ve ever put in a Poké Ball and dresses them up in winter wear. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10060-101/pikachu-pokemon-holiday-plush-10-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10060-101/pikachu-pokemon-holiday-plush-10-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu</a></span> is the clear centerpiece with a light blue sweater with a shining Staryu smack dab in the middle, and a big Santa hat hanging off the side of his head. But the standout, in my opinion, is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10062-101/maushold-pokemon-holiday-plush-14-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10062-101/maushold-pokemon-holiday-plush-14-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maushold</a></span> plush. The Pokémon made up of a family of three or four mice could have given us each of the rodents separately with individual winter outfits, but The Pokémon Company knows how to commit to a bit, and Maushold’s whole schtick is that it’s treated as one Pokémon despite seemingly being multiple critters. So Maushold has a long scarf stretching around the entire family of mice and wrapping them together. And hey, the family of three is the same price as Pikachu, so that’s three plushies for the price of one.</p><p>While the bigger plushies are the draw, the Holiday line also includes smaller keychains that are just as adorable. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10058-101/dedenne-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10058-101/dedenne-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedenne</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10059-101/cubchoo-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10059-101/cubchoo-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cubchoo</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10057-101/espurr-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10057-101/espurr-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espurr</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10056-101/pawmi-snowman-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10056-101/pawmi-snowman-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pawmi</a></span> are each featured as part of the line, all dressed in winter clothes.

<p>Team Quadrant, a UK-based esports organisation founded by Formula One driver Lando Norris, has announced a sudden withdrawal from the Halo Championship Series and, by extension, the esports industry in general. This news comes mere days after Quadrant finished in seventh place at the Halo World Championship in Seattle, Washington.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-quick-comedown">Quick Comedown</h2>



<p>In January 2024, Quadrant announced a massive seven-figure investment round and partnerships with some sizeable content creators. In 2023, the organisation was able to secure a streak of positive financial updates following strong collaborations and apparel sales, and it was soaring in the esports space.</p>



<p>That quickly soured, though.</p>



<p>On October 1, it was reported that Quadrant had ‘slumped into the red’ after reporting negative total equity in a company filing. Now, the organisation has reported a complete withdrawal from the esports industry to instead focus on creative content, fashion, and motorsport culture, leaning still on Lando Norris for brand recognition.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As of today, Quadrant announces that we are departing the Halo Championship Series and wider direct involvement in esports to continue with full focus on our exciting mission of being a brand rooted at the intersection of motorsport culture, fashion, and creative content.</p>



<p>We are deeply proud of whwat we have achieved during our time in esports and would like to share a special thank you to our HCS players, 343 Industries <em>(now Halo Studios)</em>, and Microsoft for theiur devotion and commitment to the game we love – we wish you the best moving forward.</p>



<p>To our fans, we thank you for your incredible and unwavering support. You have been a constant and passionate reminder of why we wntered into this space in the first place, and we hope we have given you as many memories as you have provided us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the second UK-based esports organisation to suffer on a financial front of late. Recently, Guild Esports, which is represented by David Beckham as a brand ambassador, was acquired in full by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guild-esports-acquired-by-dcb-sports-for-just-130000/">a US-based firm for just $130,000</a>.</p>



<p>In recent months, the UK has also withered in the gaming space as two of the region’s biggest gaming and esports events disappeared into nothing.</p>

The news was first reported by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firewalk Studios' closure follows the reported departure of director Ryan Ellis, who stepped down after Concord was taken offline. Sony Interactive Entertainment publicly posted the internal email from Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst with a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement on the closure</a>, which you can read below. Hulst wrote that SIE had "spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options," but ultimately decided to sunset the studio, which it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">had acquired in April 2023</a>. The email also announces SIE's decision to close Neon Koi, a German studio working on a mobile action game.</p><blockquote>Dear Team, </blockquote><blockquote>Today, I want to share some important updates from Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Studio Business Group.   </blockquote><blockquote>We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.  </blockquote><blockquote>Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and crafting engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams.  We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognize when our games fall short of meeting player expectations.   </blockquote><blockquote>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts.  To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.  </blockquote><blockquote>With this re-focused approach, Neon Koi will close, and its mobile action game will not be moving forward. I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate.   </blockquote><blockquote>Regarding Firewalk, as announced in early September  (<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Important Update on Concord</a>), certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.  We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </blockquote><blockquote>After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.  I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.  </blockquote><blockquote>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.   </blockquote><blockquote>I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.  Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible. </blockquote><blockquote>I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.   </blockquote><blockquote>While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams.  I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organization driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players.   </blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for your continued support.  </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/firewalkstudios_firewalk-is-signing-off-one-last-time-firewalk-activity-7257092832086089729-20Uf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post on LinkedIn </a>from Firewalk Studios said that the studio "began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience." It notes that it began as a new startup in 2018, built a customized FPS engine, and more. The post goes on, "We took some risks along the way – marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters – and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's called Champions Tactics and it sure looks like...something.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Three years ago, Ubisoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-plans-create-blockchain-games-enable-pay-to-earn">promised it would start making its own blockchain games</a>. Now it appears to have done it, having stealth-launched a full-blown web3 game last week called Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Champions Tactics is billed as a "PVP tactical RPG game on PC", and is both developed and published by Ubisoft. It involves collectible figurines of various warriors from the in-game fantasy world of Grimoria, which players assemble into squads of three and then battle in turn-based combat that looks oddly reminscent of Darkest Dungeon, of all things. It's not evident from the trailer that this is a web3 game at all, but a quick glance at the game's website or even its official <a href="https://twitter.com/ChampionsVerse" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter page</a> reveals this immediately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The web3 comes into play as a method of collecting figurines to battle with. When you first start the game, you're given some temporary figurines to play with, but you'll eventually need to either purchase actual figurines, aka NFTs, from other players using either in-game gold or cryptocurrency, or craft your own using the "Forge" system which also requires either in-game currency or crypto. At the time of this piece, five days after launch, the in-game marketplace has figurines for sale ranging from around $7 to a whopping $63k for something called a "Swift Zealot". That said, just because a figurine is listed for that much doesn't mean people are paying that much. The next-highest listed champion currently runs around $25k, and while a handful more cost thousands the high-end stuff mostly appears to be capping around $335.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Champions Tactics is free to download, though you have to have a Ubisoft account and a supported blockchain wallet to actually play it. While it appears you can technically play the game entirely for free without ever engaging with NFTs using in-game currency, the viability of this strategy is likely going to be dependent on how the prices for actually powerful characters fluctuates over the game's lifespan. It's a PvP game, with no campaign and no PvE beyond a "Training" mode, so free-to-play players will inevitably be at the mercy of people willing to engage with the NFT marketplace and spend real money to buy or forge the absolute best champions — a real pay-to-win dilemma. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One other limiting factor in playing Champions Tactics is its age rating. Ubisoft lists the game as Adults Only, and restricts players who have not confirmed they are 18 or older from playing. Oddly, while Ubisoft is using the ESRB's rating category, Champions Tactics doesn't appear in the ESRB's online database listing all games with ratings and why those ratings were issued. IGN has reached out to the ESRB for comment and clarity on what's happening here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the fact that Ubisoft is doing basically exactly what it said it was going to do, it seems odd that the company is going all-in on web3 like this now. Whatever gamer enthusiasm for NFTs and blockchain there was in 2021 has died down significantly, with companies like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-will-not-allow-nfts-or-blockchain-technologies">Mojang</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gabe-newell-nft-steam">Valve</a> outright rejecting them, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-not-driving-hard-direction-nfts">backpedaling on an initial enthusiasm</a>, Sega <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-scales-back-blockchain-plans" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">determining it's boring</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestops-nft-marketplace-closes-next-month">GameStop's own efforts outright failing</a>. Even <a href="https://quartz.ubisoft.com/Game:7c788439-f696-4362-8848-d719eeb3e9d2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft's own past efforts with NFTs</a> have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/ubisofts-first-nft-experiment-was-a-dumpster-fire/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely failed to resonate</a> and subsequently gone quiet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which maybe explains why Ubisoft has been, not necessarily secretive, but not exactly loud about this game in front of what most would consider mainstream gaming audiences. Champions Tactics was announced back in June of 2023 and various news items have floated out over the last year about its progress, largely reported at outlets focused on web3 and NFT news. But it wasn't exactly headlining with this game at Ubisoft Forward or anything.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-nft-blockchain-web3-elixir">companies who are still pushing the technology</a> have yet to answer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-were-passing-on-blockchain-pitches" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing concerns</a> about its frequent use in and as scams, its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/01/13/why-blockchain-nfts-and-web3-have-a-sustainability-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially massive environmental impact</a>, and perhaps most critically for gaming, how blockchain technology is good or useful for video games in the first place. Ubisoft, to its credit, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-quartz-nfts-reconsider-environmental-impact">expressed concerns before</a> about the environmental impact of NFTs, and the blockchain that Champions Tactics uses (Oasys) claims to be "<a href="https://docs.oasys.games/docs/whitepaper/solution/ecosystem-design%20copy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">environmentally friendly</a>". But fundamentally, Ubisoft's perspective on the tech seems surprisingly bullish; the vice president of its Strategic Innovation Lab  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-exec-says-gamers-dont-get-it-when-it-comes-to-nfts">seems to think gamers just "don't get it." </a>Whether or not they can be made to "get it" via games like Champions Tactics remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to Ubisoft for comment on the game ahead of this piece's publication. We asked them for any information on the Adults Only rating and its absence from the ESRB website, as well as for general comment on why Ubisoft is continuing to pursue a web3 strategy and if it intends to continue to do so in the future. Francois Bodson, studio director at Ubisoft Paris, responded as follows:</p><blockquote>The team inside the Ubisoft Paris studio developing Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles partnered with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab and Oasys to ensure that our use of blockchain was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players. Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership. Champions Tactics offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations. These include millions of procedurally generated figurines, each with distinct stats, assets shaped directly by players' choices, and an open marketplace letting players compose their teams on a peer-to-peer basis —much like a physical trading card game. For months, we have collaborated closely with our community through events and beta phases to build and refine Champions Tactics. We’re excited to keep expanding and enhancing the experience together.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft as a whole has been having a rough several years, weathering a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-has-officially-stopped-development-on-ghost-recon-frontline">steady</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-for-the-sixth-time">cadence</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-for-the-sixth-time">game</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices">three</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-hit-by-more-layoffs-in-customer-service-and-elsewhere">rounds</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-lays-off-124-employees-to-enhance-collective-efficiency">layoffs</a> in the last year, a series of AAA releases <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">failing to meet expectations</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump">general investor frustration</a>.

			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle developer MachineGames has shared new details about the game's story and world structure. In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-devs-interview-machine-games-lucasfilm-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>, Creative Director Jens Andersson said:</p>
<p><em>Well, in a way it's obviously a linear, very driven story that takes you around the world. We are doing this game a little bit differently than previous games that we worked on, where we're allowed to go back to previous locations and continue playing from there. It's almost like a time jump back. So you will be able to 100 percent the game on a single save lot. And the reason why we're doing it like that is that we have these really wide, big areas like Giza, and then we have stretches of more linear rollercoaster rides, and there's a lot of optional content in there... a lot of hidden mysteries and things like that. So we want players who focus on the story to be able to play through it, and if they really love an area, they can go back and just finish up everything without having to replay the more linear sections. It doesn't fit into the narrative story, but from a gameplay perspective, you can do it.</em></p>
<p><em>It's more of a linear story, to be honest. It's really well-told, well-acted by our amazing cast with a proper conclusion. And then you can keep going and discover everything that the world has to offer.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Andersson also talked about giving players the option to tweak combat and puzzle difficulty separately in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Understandably, there are more options for combat (Light, Moderate, Hard, and Very Hard), while there are only two versions of the puzzles.</p>
<p>By the way, we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> our own hands-on preview of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle based on a play session from a recent press event. Here's what Amy had to say:</p>
<p><em>Overall, I had a great experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and I can't wait to dive back into the world once more when the game officially releases. It was highly immersive, the characters were well-designed, the world design was stunning, and it was a really well-polished experience. It's perfect for those who are new and returning to the Indiana Jones franchise, or want a game that feels similar to what Tomb Raider and Uncharted offer</em></p>
<p>The game is out on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, and in Spring 2025 for PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-qa-team-strike-over-activision-blizzards-return-to-office-mandate/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The QA workers for Activision Blizzard have recently been on strike in protest of the company's return-to-office (RTO) mandate, as stated by the Communications Workers of America (CWA). On October 25, the QA team who worked on <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> rallied to make sure that there were work-from-home (WFH) accommodations for those who needed them. In this strike, they claimed that Activision and Microsoft had not granted any accommodations for employees with ADA-certified medical conditions. In addition to the QA team striking, over 300 Activision employees signed a petition earlier in the month to ask for the return of work-from-home options. This led to workers in Texas and California joining the Eden Prairie team in striking.</p>
<p>In a statement from the CWA, they wrote: "Despite multiple requests from the Union representing the video-game workers, Activision and Microsoft have been unable to articulate why specifically they are insisting workers must work in the office, even those with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home."</p>
<p>In addition to the CWA writing a statement, the pro-worker group A Better ABK also published their <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own statement</a> on October 25 on X, which stated that RTO was decided on the staff's behalf without their input or needs being considered. "We've also learned that the company is unwilling to provide people with remote work accommodations, even when it's the only option that meets an employee's needs, due to this alienating policy," says A Better ABK. It's not a surprise that those working for Activision Blizzard are consistently having to fight for better conditions, as A Better ABK has been working on improving the quality of life of ABK employees for a number of years.</p>
<p>Just shortly after they put out a statement, it was announced that the CEO of Microsoft got a pay raise of 63%, raising his salary to $73 million, despite there being an excessive amount of layoffs at the company and Microsoft subsidiaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard made a statement to Eurogamer</a>, saying that it understood "returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum."</p>
<p>Whether this means that they will make the accommodations needed for their staff is uncertain as of right now, but they are also far from the only company that is trying to push for RTO. For example, other huge companies such as Ubisoft and Rockstar have also been trying to get their staff back into the office to work on big releases, which has also led to protests from Ubisoft staff.</p>
