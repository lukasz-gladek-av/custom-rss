		<p>Another week is in the books, and we’re just a month away from Gamescom, so I’ve spent a good bit of time cleaving through emails and trying to put a sensible schedule together for previews and hands ons. Still some more to do on that front, but my calendar is pretty packed…</p>
<p>But enough about that, because with the cooler, wetter, windier weather, it’s been a good time for a game like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/le-mans-ultimate-v1-0-can-fill-my-endurance-racing-void-this-summer/">Le Mans Ultimate</a> to come out, luring me to put on my fancy hat to check out a game dedicated to one of my favourite sports. It’s pretty darned good!</p>
<p>With a poorly baby in the house, <strong>Nic</strong> hasn’t played much this week, but did give the new Pokémon puzzle game a quick try –&nbsp;“It’s not worth downloading…” So let’s move swiftly on to <strong>Jason</strong>, who’s been playing an awful lot of the “basically perfect” Monster Train 2, but has also jumped back into Final Fantasy XV after losing his enjoyment for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>It’s been a busy old week for <strong>Steve</strong>, as usual, and he’s been playing an unholy mix of Hellclock, Once Upon a Puppet, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/s-p-l-i-t-review-hacking-horror/">s.p.l.i.t</a>, while also having another two indie horror games on his forthcoming review list. We can also add in the Chibi-Robo spiritual successor Misc. A Tiny Tale, the classic CRPG A Necromancer’s Tale and a certain 2D Ninja platformer. It’s lucky it’s not term time right now!</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> week has been filled with Neverwinter Nights 2 Remaster and Peglin for review, but he’s also been playing Death Stranding, Civ VI, Smash Bros Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Horizons, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, and Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>Having been able to sneak a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes/">EA Sports FC 26</a>, <strong>Aran</strong> has also had Birdigo and Atomic Owl on the go for review. It’s a rather different sci-fi zombie and horror future for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, though, who’s been reviewing Killing Floor 3, and sinking back into The Callisto Protocol: “I think I’m on the last boss battle I’ve kinda enjoyed the whole thing. However I never ever, ever, ever, ever want to see a character stand on a platform only to have it give way under the so they are separated from their partner, ever again. The game does it about ten times!”</p>
<p>While he’d been looking forward to playing it, <strong>Ade</strong> was thoroughly underwhelmed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review/">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> –&nbsp;“Maybe I’m just all soulsliked out?” –&nbsp;so it’s good that he’s been able to move swiftly along to Achilles Survivor for review, which offers an Ancient Greece twist to the Vampire Survivors formula.</p>
<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been continuing his car combat quest with Twisted Metal World Tour, where he grabbed the platinum trophy. “It’s a shame the genre has been left behind – Sony’s Destruction All-Stars was a fun time even if it had some glaring flaws.” He’s also been playing Wildgate, which has a rough onboarding, but which he’s enjoying for its spaceship extraction shooter shenanigans.</p>

<p>And we come to <strong>Dom</strong> to wrap things up, and he’s been playing a mix of Donkey Kong Bananza, Wild Hearts S and the recklessly titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/super-mario-party-jamboree-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>. There’s also been some CarX Street, and some real life chess, which I assume means he dressed up as a bishop, went to a field, and moved diagonally when someone told him to.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>, the latest game in the long-running JRPG series' Calvard arc, has finally received a Western release date, and it won't be too long before you can check this one out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;</em>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>) will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch consoles on January 15th.</p>

<p>The game will follow on from the previous titles in the Calvard arc, namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date" rel="nofollow">Trails through Daybreak</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">its sequel</a>. You'll play as three protagonists with intertwining stories:&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel</em>'s Rean Schwarzer,&nbsp;<em>Daybreak</em>'s Van Arkride, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-heroes-trails-in-sky-3rd" rel="nofollow"><em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>'s Kevin Graham.</p>

Rean, Kevin, and Van are drawn into intrigue when Marduk invites them to "co-operate in a high-tech training exercise", setting them on a "collision course with the secrets that lay at the very core of Zemuria".</p>

<p>The game will feature an adapted and enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak</em>'s battle system, allowing you to swap between the action-based Field Battle mode and the more strategic Command Battle system.</p>

<p>New features include the ability to slow time with the Z.O.C. system, boosting your damage and allowing for devastating chain attacks, as well as new Shard Commands to grant your party "a range of benefits during battle".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Techland has announced that upcoming zombie sandbox parkour-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>While the game was originally intended to launch on August 22nd, Techland now says it needs extra time "to make&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>the best&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>game [it's] ever released", which is why the latest title in the series will now be launching on September 19th.</p>

<p>Techland says it understands the delay "may be disappointing", but that its "experience has shown how important the first impression is", and that four extra weeks of development will help the studio "address final details that make all the difference between good and great".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-parkour.jpg?itok=Y6RIMyVL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-parkour.jpg?itok=FaYlAqVJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>needs a few more weeks before it can be unleashed.</figcaption></figure><p>Areas that Techland will be working on between now and the new September release date include gameplay balance, "clarity of UI", physics quality, and animation tweaking, as well as the addition of "last little details".</p>

<p>Additionally, Techland will be releasing more information about&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>regularly until September, so if you're disappointed you won't be able to play the game in August, the new reveals should tide you over.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, it's a standalone followup to 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em></a>&nbsp;in which you'll once again take on the mantle of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">originally intended</a> to be a DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, but after plot details for that DLC were leaked by hackers in 2023, Techland decided to turn&nbsp;<em>The Beast&nbsp;</em>into a full standalone followup instead.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>when it launches on September 19th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dying-light-the-beast/9p7zg9mqkkln" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

        <p>A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an "enigma of success"</p>

            <p>
Microsoft have published a memo recently sent to staff by CEO Sayta Nadella, which addresses the strange fact of Microsoft reporting net income in the ultrabillions while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laying off thousands of supposedly "treasured colleagues"</a>. Most of the blog is a gusty, jargony paean to generative AI technology, in which Microsoft have made vast investments, and how it is going to "empower everyone to create their own tools" and create a "local surplus" of Ability To Do Stuff in Microsoft dominions worldwide.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>

Nothing in the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">blog</a> directly addresses what Nadella characterises as the "seeming incongruence" of Microsoft being richer than all of the Roman emperors combined, and still taking a blowtorch to video game studios like ZeniMax Online Studios, King, Rare and Sledgehammer Games. But I guess it's nice that they've recognised that the optics are weird.
</p>
<p>
"By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving - our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right," Nadella writes. "We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.
</p>
<p>
"This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value," he continues. "Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding."
</p>
<p>
Ah, whomst amongst us can fathom the dissonant enigma of trillion dollar corporations spontaneously having layoffs happen to them, while doleful executives float by on golden balloons, scratching their heads with bloody hacksaws. 
</p>
<p>
In other news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sources-suggest-that-staff-laid-off-at-king-will-be-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-helped-to-create">reportedly</a> been replacing developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> with the generative AIs they helped to "train". Satya Nadella is apparently <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/the-surprising-way-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-uses-ai-to-consume-podcasts-on-his-commute/">a religious genAI user</a>, and I do wonder whether that's a "local surplus" of capacity there that could justify some further cost-cutting, as per the glorious mysteries of progress.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Techland’s <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> was set to release mid next month, August 11. However, in a press release published today, the developer has announced an eleventh hour delay to the zombie-fighting parkour game, moving the release date to September 19. It is “to allow for extra polishing,” including improving the UI, boosting physics, and tweaking cutscenes and player animations.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,195752,197562" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The follow-up to 2022's <em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human </em>was originally intended to be the second major DLC for that previous game, but after overenthusiastic fans unearthed and leaked everything about the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671?_gl=1*12ruh1t*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM0NDA1ODckbzIwJGcxJHQxNzUzNDQxNDIxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671?_gl=1*12ruh1t*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM0NDA1ODckbzIwJGcxJHQxNzUzNDQxNDIxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">the developers decided to entirely rethink the project</a></span>. This led to the desire to return to 2015's original <em>Dying Light</em> hero, Kyle Crane, now a super-human half-beast man, the result of ten years of brutal, tortuous experimentation.</p><p>Earlier this week there were a bunch of hands-on previews published across various sites, and given that a delay has been announced just a few days later, you might imagine significant issues were raised. However, from reading through a bunch of these previews of the first four hours, people appear pretty jubilant about what they played. In fact, Techland’s own statement notes the same, describing the mostly YouTube coverage as “universally positive.” However, it seems the developers spotted something the critics did not, as they’ve now decided to hold things back for an additional month of polish.</p><p>  “With just four additional weeks,” says the press release, “we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.”</p><p>Given the short nature of the delay, and the relative specificity of the intent, this does sound more purposeful than the the ambiguous notes you’ll often read when a game slips its release date. It does seem hard to imagine what can be dramatically changed in just four extra weeks, especially with elements as integral as the UI, but it’s definitely far better than receiving these improvements in piecemeal patches <em>after</em> the game’s released.</p><p>So <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will now be out September 19, in the safe release territory left behind after <em>GTA 6</em>'s delay into next year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-delay-techland-1851786943]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Cailee Spaeny is reportedly in talks to star in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The casting scoop comes from <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/cailee-spaeny-elden-ring-movie-cast-alex-garland-a24-booster-gold-writer-dc-studios-hbo-max">Jeff Sneider</a>, who reported Spaeny will reunite with director Alex Garland after starring in his 2024 film, Civil War.</p>
<p>Spaeny also starred in Alien: Romulus last year, in the lead role of Rain Carradine. Her voice and likeness as Rain were also used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> as a purchasable skin for Ellen Ripley. Prior to that, in 2023 she played the lead role in Priscilla, Sofia Coppola's biopic on Priscilla Presley.</p>

<p>So who might Spaeny be playing in the Elden Ring film adaptation?</p>
<p>We don't know yet what the plot will focus on and which characters will be included. A safe bet would be Melina, who acts as the Tarnished's maiden along their journey.</p>
<p>Other options include Ranni the Witch, Malenia, or perhaps even a female Tarnished.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">Elden Ring live-action film was announced back in May</a>, with Garland as writer and director. Garland is also known for Ex Machina and Warfare.</p>
<p>Heartstopper star Kit Connor is also said to star in the film, after featuring in Warfare.</p>
<p>Film production company A24 and game publisher Bandai Namco are both behind the project, though it's unclear if FromSoftware or the game's creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> are also involved.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">Elden Ring team announced its co-op spin-off Nightreign had passed 5m copies sold</a>, while DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has now soared past 10m downloads.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-romulus-star-reportedly-in-talks-for-elden-ring-film-role]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Atari 2600 was my very first home console. When my friends were playing on Megadrives and PCs, we were slightly less well-off, and that meant I was a couple of generations behind (let’s not think too hard about the gaming obsession I clearly developed after this). Still, I loved my Atari, and there’s a reason that classic games like Space Invaders, Centipede and Asteroids remain ‘classic’. They’re just great games. Perhaps the most iconic title, though, from the Atari 2600 era is Pac-Man and as the 35-year anniversary celebrations are rolling out, Atari and Bandai Namco have seen the opportunity to commemorate the event with a brand new Atari 2600 console. This rendition, named the Atari 2600+ PAC-MAN Edition, takes the original, wooden-build of the first Atari 2600, and replaces it with bright yellow, Pac-Man-coloured plastics, while adding in the console’s first wireless joystick, also crafted in eye-melting yellow as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atari 2600+ PAC-MAN Edition | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TP3JZ1RMdEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is a fully-functional Atari 2600, so you can play any original cartridge. In the pack you’re getting the Pac-Man Double Feature cartridge, a dual-game cartridge that includes Pac-Man 7800, a brand-new, arcade-style version of the classic, along with PAC-MAN 2600, the very first home console release of the game. I imagine that means the + in the 2600+ name means that there’s slightly more power on tap here than the original hardware, though probably not much more than is totally necessary. There is a non-yellow version already available, and the key improvement is that the 2600+ is capable of running Atari 7800 cartridges. While the older version is cheaper – <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Atari-2600-Plus-Exclusive-Amazon-co-uk/dp/B0CG9SVRJY/ref=sr_1_3?crid=UFJ1I07PHLXT&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ODU4K6ROKmK2jVjWcN5mWOtLKpkJpxtwS6JHHgXYmTINyK9LwZzOwhIRa4HgJI4F6A_I9A3rOcvDqRuuC1ETQUEVO4Sd3shnVu4yVg79MKgDXpCSLXfRbtlBrc5cdQhB27JvULWy-wavrqsdWv0GJ3I0ryicK_-0tGW3Lhtcezwi4pK2u3XFE0_LMQiwx3m8b1ffbpsB88xY0qzlypvL0SCymRvEugjPKo5QDyqKsJE.lTHnMBJZXIfGLx6Qee8MSOVcTCO1V2aePkCzuHk-P8o&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=atari+2600%2B+pac+man&amp;qid=1753441872&amp;sprefix=atari+2600%2B+pac+man%2Caps%2C77&amp;sr=8-3">currently&nbsp; £64.95</a> – and truer to the original build, it doesn’t include the new wireless joystick.</p>


<p>There’s going to be a full range of wireless joysticks, with five in total, complementing the colours of Pac-Man’s ghostly adversaries, and they’ll cost £29.99 each. I assume that there’s going to be wider functionality for them, perhaps via Bluetooth or a wireless dongle, but there are few extra details on these right now.</p>
<p>Speaking about the release, Plaion Replai’s Commercial Director, Ben Jones, said, “The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition is more than just a console – it’s a tribute to the moment home gaming truly began. By reimagining the iconic hardware in Pac-Man’s unmistakable style, we’re celebrating the legacy of two cultural giants who helped define a generation of play. We’re proud to bring this collaboration to life for collectors, fans, and a whole new wave of retro gaming enthusiasts.”</p>
<p>The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pac-Man-CX-40-Wireless-Joystick-Yellow/dp/B0FJM8RKLM/ref=sr_1_6?crid=UFJ1I07PHLXT&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ODU4K6ROKmK2jVjWcN5mWOtLKpkJpxtwS6JHHgXYmTINyK9LwZzOwhIRa4HgJI4F6A_I9A3rOcvDqRuuC1ETQUEVO4Sd3shnVu4yVg79MKgDXpCSLXfRbtlBrc5cdQhB27JvULWy-wavrqsdWv0GJ3I0ryicK_-0tGW3Lhtcezwi4pK2u3XFE0_LMQiwx3m8b1ffbpsB88xY0qzlypvL0SCymRvEugjPKo5QDyqKsJE.lTHnMBJZXIfGLx6Qee8MSOVcTCO1V2aePkCzuHk-P8o&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=atari+2600%2B+pac+man&amp;qid=1753441822&amp;sprefix=atari+2600%2B+pac+man%2Caps%2C77&amp;sr=8-6">Pac-Man CX40+ Wireless Joysticks</a> will be available for pre-order from Wednesday 23rd July at Amazon and on Atari.com, priced at £129.99 and £29.99 respectively. The release date for the Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition and Pac-Man CX40+ Wireless Joysticks will be 31st October 2025. There will also be a separate release of the PAC-MAN Double Feature cartridge later in 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-%E2%80%93-how-to-block-and-parry.1253133/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike game through and through, the hardcore action role-playing game developed by Leenzee Games twists some of the formula's mechanics to offer something unique. Among these twisted mechanics are the block and parry mechanics, which work quite differently from what you may be used to.</p>



<p>Besides dodging, which you should master as soon as possible, as it is the best way to get the Skyborn Might resource used to use special skills like Discipline Skills and magic spells, you have no other defensive mechanics as you begin your journey to find a cure for the Feathering affliction. <strong>To block or parry an attack, you will have to make some progress in the game.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Blocking in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers in only available with Axes</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To block enemy attacks </strong>in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, you will need to find axes, as these heavy weapons are the only ones that can block. After equipping one, all you need to do to<strong> </strong>block an enemy attack is hold the L2 button on a PlayStation controller or the Left Trigger on an Xbox controller. Blocking will not completely negate damage, but it's still a solid defensive option as it doesn't require any particular timing to use.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deflection requires great timing in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, but those who master it are mightily rewarded</figcaption></figure>



<p>Parrying enemy attacks in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a little more complex, as you get two different options to do so: <strong>Deflects and Clashes</strong>. Deflecting attacks requires you to learn a specific Discipline Skill available for Longswords, Dual Blades, and Spears, and to press the button usually used for blocking with Axe, so L2/ Left Trigger, at the exact time an enemy attack connects with Wuchang. A successful deflection completely nullifies the attack.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Clashing in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a great way to mitigate damage while attacking enemies</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Clashes</strong>, on the other hand, fit perfectly with the always-on-the-offense strategy you should often employ in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers. Instead of pressing the block button at the same time an enemy attack connects, to perform a clash, one of your attacks has to connect with the enemy's weapon, deflecting most of the incoming damage. Like for Deflection, you will have to learn certain skills on the Impetus Repository to add clashing properties to regular light attacks and to charged light attacks. Though damage is not negated with clashing, the timing is a little more forgiving than Deflection skills, so it's still a viable option to use, especially if you know enemy tendencies well and want to stay on the offensive as much as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has shared a new roadmap of content coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, including a release date for its Claws of Awaji expansion.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji is set to be released on 16th September, as paid DLC (though those who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Shadows will get it for free). On its release, Claws of Awaji will introduce a new region, a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. The expansion is said to be adding over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>

<p>Along with the Claws of Awaji date, Ubisoft has also promised a new game plus mode for Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will go live next week on 29th July. This will also add new achievements and trophies.</p>
<p>Then, the team is adding various quality of life updates further down the line, which will include the likes of uncapped framerates for cutscenes on PC and the ability to fast-forward the time of day.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also added a line about unfogging the world map under this future update section. This seemed a bit confusing, because we were doing that already, but the studio has elaborated this unfogging line means: "Once you synchronise all viewpoints in a region, the fog now completely lifts! You can focus your exploration on where you want to go."</p>

<p>Ubisoft recently celebrated welcoming five million players to Assassin's Creed Shadows. Along with those five million assassins, there have been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March. And it sounds like Assassin's Creed Shadows may soon be welcoming more players to Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">with a Switch 2 port seemingly being on the cards</a>.</p>

		<p>With a little less than a month to go to its previously announced date, Techland has announced that they are delaying the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> to 19th September 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/dying-light-the-beast-will-be-unleashed-with-an-august-release-date/">Previously expected for 22nd August</a>, the extra month will allow for extra polish.</p>


<p>In<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/516342322187731208"> the statement</a>, Techland writes:</p>
<p><em>It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve been carefully listening to what you’ve been saying – whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve based on player feedback include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.</em></p>

<p><em>We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand. Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we’ve learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is.</em></p>
<p>The team promises regular updates through the now 8 weeks before launch, and a playable demo of the game will be available at Gamescom in Hall 6, so you can check out Kyle Crane’s return if you’re heading to the show.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a standalone game that grew out of the second planned DLC for Dying Light 2. Because of that, it will be available separately, of course, but is also still being released at no extra cost&nbsp;for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition. Techland have a great reputation for long support and consumer-friendly moves, and this is just another example of that.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">previewed The Beast back at Gamescom</a> last year, Dom saying “Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.”</p>

			<p>Borderlands 4 has officially gone gold, and will launch next month as previously announced.</p>



<p>Today, Gearbox and publisher 2K confirmed the fourth entry in the series has gone gold, securing its September 12 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Although we have seen games getting delayed even after going gold, like in Cyberpunk 2077's case <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/">five years ago</a>, these are very rare cases, so there's little doubt at this point fans will be able to get their hands on the game in a little over a month.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Borderlands 4 is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2, but owners of the new generation system by Nintendo will have to wait until October 3 to play the game, as confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">earlier this week</a>. Considering the differences with the other current generation systems, it will be very interesting to see how the Nintendo Switch 2 will handle the game and if it will take advantage of any of its features like NVIDIA DLSS support and mouse controls, which would work extremely well for a game like this.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12. It will also hit Nintendo Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to launch on August 22, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-smashes-through-the-zombie-horde-in-august/1100-6532167/" data-ref-id="1100-6532167">Dying Light: The Beast is a new standalone adventure</a> that sees the return of Kyle Crane, the protagonist from the first game in the series. Hellbent on revenge after a decade of captivity and horrific genetic experimentation performed on him by a sinister figure known as the Baron, Crane eventually manages to break free from his prison.</p><p>Tracking the Baron to the once-bustling tourist destination of Castor Woods, Crane finds hordes of infected standing in his way. Fortunately, he has more than just parkour skills at his disposal, as the Baron's experiments have given him new rage-fueled powers that allow him to smash his way through zombies. When that's not enough, Crane can also rely on good ol' guns and melee weapons to even the odds.</p><p>"Dying Light: The Beast benefits from years of updates to Dying Light 2, while also pulling in elements from the first that Techland wanted to revisit." Mark Delaney wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-gave-me-a-car-and-a-gun-but-i-just-couldnt-stop-dropkicking-zombies/1100-6532282/" data-ref-id="1100-6532282">preview of the game</a>. "This mix of old and new feels like it's going to make the 20-hour game--40 to 60 for completionists--well worth it if you're already invested in the series.</p>

            <p>Troy Baker has had many video game roles over the years. He is Indiana Jones in The Great Circle, he is Sam Drake in the Uncharted series, he is Booker Dewitt in Bioshock, he is Higgs in Death Stranding… The list goes on (and on and on and on).</p>
<p>One of his most famous roles, though, is Joel in The Last of Us. Baker portrayed the cynical smuggler turned surrogate father in 2013's original release, before reprising his role in 2020's sequel. But, while Joel may have elevated Baker's career, the actor has admitted he was "woefully unprepared" for the part.</p>

<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe0xVuIcxMw">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon New Orleans 2025</a>, Baker was asked if playing Joel had affected him personally, to which Baker jokingly quipped "you're trying to make me cry". He then elaborated on his role further, saying it had affected him "deeply" in many different ways.</p>
<p>"There's nothing worse, and I hope that no one ever feels this… [but] do you ever show up to something and go 'I am so woefully unprepared for this'? And, it's not imposter syndrome, it's a fact. You are not equipped to do the thing that you are about to do," Baker said. "You could be like, 'let's go bungie jumping!', and then you get on the platform and you go, 'I can't do this'. That was The Last of Us for me. You get the gig, and then you go, 'oh no, I have to deliver this'."</p>
<p>Baker recalled going through the script and pitch in the early days of The Last of Us with the development team and his co-star Ashley Johnson, who plays Ellie in the games. During a break, Baker turned to Johnson and said: "'Do you realise that if this thing sucks, it's our fault?'"</p>
<p>He noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> already had had great success with its Uncharted games, and the studio now knew the story it wanted to tell next. "We knew that what they were going to make was going to be good," Baker recalled, so now the pressure was on him and Johnson to deliver a worthy performance.</p>
<p>The Last of Us "taught me how to be a better actor", Baker continued. "It taught me how to stop trying to convince people that I could act, and just realise that Joel has no idea that he's in a game, and he's just in a moment in his life. And, I took that lesson, and I apply it all the way across."</p>

<p>Baker more recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, where he reprised his role of Higgs. Earlier this month, he was also announced as the voice of Jack Pepper, <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/1944561535625605444">the lead protagonist of Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a>.</p>
<p>As for Naughty Dog and The Last of Us, the studio recently announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-want-yet-another-way-to-experience-the-last-of-us-games-theres-a-new-script-book-on-the-way">book containing the video game scripts for both of Naughty Dog's games</a>, including the first game's Left Behind DLC, is being released. Away from its post-apocalyptical series, it's also working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">which stars Tati Gabrielle as bounty hunter Jordan A Mun</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/troy-baker-wasnt-ready-for-the-last-of-us-admits-he-was-woefully-unprepared-for-playing-joel]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-cars-3">Project Cars 3</a> will be delisted in August and the servers shutdown in early 2026. This brings an end to the Project Cars franchise, with the first two titles in the series having been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/24/project-cars-games-are-being-delisted-from-sale/">delisted in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement on the game’s Steam page, it was announced:</p>


<p><em>Update on PROJECT CARS 3. All product sales will end on: August 24th, 2025 23:59 UTC. Please note that times may vary by region. If you bought the game digitally it will remain in your library and can be redownloaded in the future. Any DLCs purchased before August 24th, 2025 23:59 UTC will still be available to use after this date. The game’s online modes will also remain active until February 24th, 2026.</em></p>
<p>While a reason for this was not given, the most likely situation is the one that affects almost all racing games, as licenses for cars, tracks and soundtracks expire. With reduced income from games several years after release, it rarely makes financial sense for companies to review the game-specific licensing deals that are cut with manufacturers and tracks.</p>
<p>The sad part of this is that it’s an end to what was a real bolt from the blue for the sim racing genre. Launching in 2015, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/05/11/project-cars-review/">Project Cars was an imperfect, but refreshingly different take</a> on the sim and simcade racer, and gained a healthy fanbase on the PS4 and Xbox One generation, two years before Gran Turismo Sport arrived, and at a time when Forza Motorsport was still a lighter style of racer. It was quickly followed up by a sequel in 2017, but then things went a little bit off the rails.</p>

<p>SMS was acquired in 2019 by Codemasters ahead of the 2020 release of Project Cars 3. That game took a turn towards more arcade racing that didn’t meet the same audience as the previous titles, and with Codemasters subsequently acquired by EA, their sim racing endeavours were eventually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/08/the-project-cars-franchise-has-been-cancelled-by-ea/">cancelled in 2022</a> and the team broken up or laid off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, SMS founder Ian Bell had left and gone on to found Straight4 Studios (previously branded as Mildly Annoyed Studios). They’re currently working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/project-motor-racing-races-to-a-november-launch-with-an-intriguing-single-player-career/">Project Motor Racing</a>, putting even more focus on motorsports and with a November release date.</p>
<p>In our review for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/24/project-cars-3-review/?cmpscreen">Project Cars 3</a>, Thomas wrote, “Project CARS 3 suffers from a case of mistaken identity. Once you adjust to the new direction, you can get into a fun flow of ticking off objectives, drifting around hairpins and purchasing upgrades. However, while the series’ existing platform means you get a great variety of circuits, cars and weather conditions, it also shackles this game from being a great arcade racing experience.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dying Light: The Beast Receives Four-Week Delay to September 19]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has just announced a four-week delay for its upcoming first-person open world action/adventure game Dying Light: The Beast. The game was scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on August 22</a> and will now be released on September 19. As you might expect, the reason is that it needs more polish (no pun intended).</p>



<p>The team shared a message with the Dying Light community:</p>



<p><em>It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</em></p>



<p><em>We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Dying Light 2: Stay Human wasn't as well received as the first game. Granted, Techland kept working on it and improving it for years, but the early reception certainly left a mark on the Polish studio. They would not want a repeat of that.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was recently featured in a fresh round of previews, including a hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on Wccftech</a> and written by Kai Tatsumoto. If you're attending Gamescom, the game will be playable in Hall 6. Even if you're not going to Cologne, Techland will continue to share more information about the game. Next week, they'll publish a new development diary about how they handled gore in this new title, narrated by the fan-favorite 'Bober the Beaver'.</p>

            <p>Whimsy, grimdark, <em>and</em> gambling? And a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> to boot?! In <em>my</em> 2025 indie game? Eh, go on then. It looks neat. The trailer below features a desolate, hellish area called "The Pläins öf Päin" (umlauts mine) inhabited by lone egg idiot named 'eggo'. A curse on the egg idiot and his cracked shell, and a curse on the world for allowing this kind of tomfoolery to proliferate unchallenged.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slots-and-daggers">Slots &amp; Daggers</a> is by Friedemann, whose previous game was the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-teeny-tiny-townbuilder-is-the-pint-sized-townscaper-ive-been-waiting-for">Katharine-approved</a> tiny townbuilder. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/summerhouse">Summerhouse</a>. "After my last game, I wanted to make something radically different," says Friedemann. "Something faster, with numbers, fights and goblins!". Angry caffeinated math goblins, you say? Here are some other features <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3631290/Slots__Daggers">from Steam</a>.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fun slot machine</li>
<li>Weird fantasy world</li>
<li>Crude drawings of strange little guys</li>
<li>Retro visuals</li>
<li>Crunchy hip hop drum machines</li>
<li>Addictive arcade gameplay that goes “pling” a lot</li>
<li>Numbers! Fights! Goblins!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>"To make this game I combined a lot of things I deeply love – weird fantasy worlds, crude drawings of strange little guys, old school crunchy hiphop drum machines and addictive arcade games that go “PLING PLING PLING” as they spit out little coins – with classic roguelike mechanics," says Friedemann. They also warn that this is a solo project, and as such "doesn’t offer 80+ hours of content like games developed by bigger teams."</p>
<p>As delighted by both the crunchy drum machines and chucklesome weirdos as I am, I do despair a bit that anyone feels the need to avert potential gamer rage by clarifying that their project doesn't last as long as a CRPG. This isn't a slight on the developer, of course. Going by a sample of one (me), literally everyone who has ever played a videogame before is a massive idiot, and you can't be too careful. Can't wait for the enraged Steam review at exactly 79 hours of playtime.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gamings-only-three-genres-have-inevitably-converged-into-grimdark-balatro-with-a-whimsical-egg-idiot]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> has passed 5m copies sold, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has soared past 10m downloads, FromSoftware has announced.
</p>
<p>This duo of big milestones was announced on the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175">Elden Ring X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, alongside a lovely piece of custom art featuring the two games. The post reads: "The flame of thy passion burns ever bright in these shadowed lands. To all who wander the Lands Between, we offer our deepest thanks."</p>
<p>It was only in early June that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware celebrated Nightreign passing 3.5 million players</a> for its Soulslike PvE twist on the battle royale genre. Since its release, Nightreign has seen a consistant stream of updates and fixes. This includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">the addition of Everdark Sovereigns</a>, even harder variations of the game's end-of-run bosses.

<p>Smaller patches have made notable improvements to the game's rough edges too. A tweak to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-maintenance-makes-matchmaking-less-of-a-headache">how remembrances work removed the barriers they presented</a> with matchmaking online. In addition, soon after Nightreign's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">solo runs were made easier in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>The stage is now set for FromSoftware's future projects. Namely, the developer revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exclusive: The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-duskbloods">Duskbloods</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">Revealed during the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, it's a multiplayer PvPvE game that's another drastic shift away from the company's usual formula. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods">another unnanounced project we don't know too much about, but is reportedly deep in development</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond may finally be on its way to gamers. The <span>South Korean rating board, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank">GRAC</a>&nbsp;(Game Rating and Administration Committee), has just rated the game</span>, hinting at a relatively close release date.</p>



<p>The GRAC has often 'leaked' release date announcements. For example, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its rating on February 6, and the game's launch date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> around one month later, on March 9. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was then released on June 26.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4's launch date could therefore be announced in the coming weeks, whether at a Nintendo Direct, Gamescom, or even the Tokyo Game Show, for a late 2025 launch. Of course, an early 2026 date is also entirely possible.</p>



<p>Either way, this listing seemingly contradicts a rumor pushed a few hours ago by Reece 'KiwiTalks' Reilly, who <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1947809648700002346#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> there was no official release date because the game still wasn't finished. That seems highly unlikely given that the GRAC already put out its rating.</p>



<p>By the way, the game was rated '12 years old and up' by the South Korean rating board:</p>



<p><em>A first-person adventure game set on the planet Buros, where Samus Aran was transferred after an unexpected situation arose following her encounter with Silux at a Galactic Federation research facility.</em></p>



<p><em>Mild violence (using weapons attached to the suit to attack alien lifeforms).</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's development was very troublesome. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the original Nintendo Switch in June 2017. Back then, it had been assigned to an external studio, Bandai Namco, but their work did not satisfy Nintendo. The Japanese company decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot the project</a> and hand it back to the historic Metroid Prime caretaker: Retro Studios.</p>



<p>Now, at long last, the finishing line appears to be in sight. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to play the game</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event and came away rather positive about it:</p>



<p><em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also be available for the original Switch, by the way, as per the original announcement.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will get a New Game+ mode on 29th July, Ubisoft have announced in a video about their summer plans for the feudal Japanese <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a> stab-me-do. They're also working on a free Assassin's Creed Shadows update that lets you fast-forward the time of day, an ability that would certainly serve me well right now, as I contemplate the seven grim hours of video game journalism that separate me from the weekend.</p><!--more-->
<p>The New Game+ mode will reset story progression, discovered locations and objective progress, but will carry over your character level, gear, knowledge rank, and hideout progression. It'll let you start from the very beginning of the game, or skip the prologue to when you first inherit the hideout.</p>

<p>Ubisoft will also raise the level cap from 60 to 80, and are introducing new knowledge and mastery skill ranks together with new upgrades for hideout buildings, in particular the forge. Fans of live-served busywork can look forward to a third shadow project encompassing new resources, datafiles and animus-themed rewards.</p>
<p>It'll all be followed by one of those much-trumpeted "quality of life" updates at the beginning of September. This will let you speed the sun across the sky at whim, unfog the map by completing every single viewpoint in a region, and uncap the cutscene frame-rate (on PC only). </p>
<p>Ubisoft, if you want to improve the quality of my life specifically, please can you dispatch some of your best shinobi to menace my landlord? The hallway light has been flicking on and off for 18 months straight. Alternatively, please dispatch some of your best shinobi to fix the hallway light.</p>
<p>Finally, Ubisoft have slapped a release date on their Claws of Awaji expansion - September 16th. Access to the DLC is included with preorders, so if you're of the preordering persuasion, please resist the urge to buy it twice over.</p>
<p>Chaser: the video above harbours one of those Animus glitches with which Ubisoft are wont to tease future product announcements. I've screencapped it below. Please enjoy your continuing immersion in a simulation that has commodified the possibility of escape.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has apparently been a success for Ubisoft. It "delivered on its expectations" with five million players since launch, according to CEO Yves Guillemot, though Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/UBISOFT-ENTERTAINMENT-4719/actualite/Transcript-Ubisoft-Entertainment-SA-Q1-2026-Sales-Trading-Statement-Call-Jul-22-2025-50576409/">overall financial performance during their last financial quarter</a> was "mixed". Our Brendy was also mixed in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>. "A beautiful recreation of 16th century Japan is stained with the clumsy ink of an uninspiring revenge tale," he wrote, "but take your time sneaking through castles and visiting temples to get the most from an impressive open world."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-date-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-mode-alongside-plans-to-make-its-open-world-more-convenient]]></content:encoded>

<p>Excuse me?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We reported on Bandai Namco's naughty pup simulator, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doronko_wanko">Doronko Wanko</a>, back in December of last year, and not just because we were worried about what exactly this particular canine might be up to.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this very bold, but very cute, little doggy — who's name actually derives from <strong>わんこ</strong> <strong>Wan ko</strong>, which is an informal or cute way of saying dog or puppy in Japanese — is into wrecking the place, messing up his owner's stuff and causing havoc. Suddenly we are very, very interested.</p>
<p>The game, which is free-to-play on Steam (where it's currently sat on an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512840/DORONKO_WANKO/">"Overwhelmingly Positive" user-rating</a>) does cost $4.99 for Switch consoles. Boo! It's also launching alongside a bunch of new DLC that adds new breeds and kennels to muck about with. Hooray!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're into roleplaying a canine character who likes to destroy nice rooms with juice and ketchup, and just generally be a very bad dog, we're sure the price barrier to entry is unlikely to stop you in your messy, bold pup tracks. It's just one of those very specific things.</p>
<figure><a title="Doronko Wanko" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f91ce434669ac/doronko-wanko.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can check out the trailer for the game up top, and here's some more details for those dawgs over at Bandai Namco:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who’s a good boy? Whoseagoodboyyy? You are! Yes you are! So fluffy, so obedient, so swee—WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE HOUSE!?” Terrorize master’s domain with five new adorable-yet-troublemaking breeds as Corgis, Shibas, Jack Russell Terriers, Bulldogs, and Toy Poodles join the mess-making mix.</p>
<p>Fling muck onto every surface: spill wine bottles on the floor, splash paint on the walls, and shake grime from the pupper's filthy fur onto nearby furniture. It’s not all about destruction — haul scattered toys back to their rightful rooms (good dog!) to unlock new items, areas, and mess-making capabilities (bad dog!).</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Double the disarray with the assistance of rogue robo-vacuums and spinning fans that can spread dirt farther than those tiny paws could ever reach. Can these playful pups get any cuter? Yestheycanohmygoodness! Put on precious pirate hats or angelic halos — because they’re innocent!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DORONKO WANKO is now available for <a href="https://stridepr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/25YVWJhkzFCDWhgLPbt6YofXHpuPutNLujZn-5bPf-pngGeM8mAH4t14off9XzvI0aWlZaB18J1GBS5wLmTq_k4kUvs1-swhIBLEwuOwDwEJq3nNWMAMlLKHI-NOqkZDTH_Ra9mFNRLtfMd3YpTXJAfeRQnFRuZPfGfJ7CrQ6-ruTur61PZm7B9lQy2K_tv79NtLu8x989QFf4TyxfByseazx8fTJNHGLde6JDc1G0mVer8kNdqnOwpl7s9tnxqsxUDqskb6HxvAUpJQj-EwtMWsKzL2HE03M8TIEHA">Nintendo Switch</a> for $4.99</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix%E2%80%99s-final-fantasy-office-for-a-%E2%80%98creatively-rich-exchange-of-ideas%E2%80%99.1253046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Some of the key developers behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 have visited Square Enix's offices to meet with the Final Fantasy team. The confirmation <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1948389582665547854?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came</a> from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, who posted a picture of the two groups posing with a Cloud Strife standee.</p>



<p>According to Hamaguchi-san, the two groups engaged in a 'creatively rich exchange of visions and ideas' during the meeting. This will no doubt fuel Final Fantasy fans' hopes that Square Enix might reconsider its stance on turn-based combat.</p>



<p>The most recent games in the franchise have effectively shunned the traditional combat system in favor of action-based combat, as seen in Final Fantasy XVI, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> back in 2022 that the ever-improving realistic graphics was making it increasingly harder for some gamers to accept the inherently not-so-realistic nature of turn-based combat.</p>



<p>However, the success story of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proves that wrong</a>. Granted, Square Enix would have much higher sales targets for mainline Final Fantasy titles, and Sandfall Interactive's game doesn't use a traditional turn-based system anyway (dodges and parries are performed in real-time). Even so, it's obvious there is a market for this, as shown even by Baldur's Gate 3. Even though that was a Western cRPG, it still used turn-based combat mixed with fairly realistic graphics (perspective notwithstanding) to enormous acclaim.</p>



<p>Did Square Enix ask Sandfall Interactive for tips on how they made it work? Or, better yet, did they discuss a potential partnership on a new project? Co-development is all the rage nowadays throughout the gaming industry, so we wouldn't be surprised at all.</p>



<p>Of course, even if that were the case, it would be a long way from releasing. Nevertheless, it'll be interesting to see whether Square Enix eventually relents to fans to provide a new game with at least the option to play with turn-based fights.</p>

                <p>While last month's Unseen Update was meant to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades 2</a>'s final patch before the 1.0 launch, it turns out Supergiant had one more up its sleeve. The latest patch is full of balance tweaks, improvements, and fixes--including a handful that have come from players' feedback. Here's what's changing.</p><p>For the most part, players are getting a boost in power with the new patch, with many of the game's weapons, boons, and other abilities seeing buffs to damage, range, or other properties. Some abilities are being made easier to use, while a number of enemies are also becoming less punishing.</p>

<p>The PwC report suggests that the games industry, which saw total revenues of $224 billion in 2024, could grow to nearly $300 billion by 2029. While other forms of digital entertainment are suffering, streaming media especially seeing reduced consumer spending amidst an overcrowded market, video games have proved more resistant to economic pressures.</p><p>PwC isn't the only analyst firm anticipating big things for the future of video games. Another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-next-console-will-drive-major-industry-growth-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6528534/" data-ref-id="1100-6528534">recent report suggested</a> 4 billion people, around half the world's population, would be counted as gamers by 2028.

Itch co-founder Leaf Corcoran said the platform will introduce "new compliance measures" going forward.

Multiple sources told us how the cuts have resulted in the loss of institutional knowledge that will make life harder for those left behind. They also criticized Xbox leadership for completely missing the mark when communicating with employees on the day the cuts were announced internally. One source described Microsoft's approach as "inhumane" and said workers were left in a state of "fight or flight" after the company failed to effectively clarify who would be impacted. "Some people were here for 15 years and cut out. Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting, they added. The full story is a tough but vital read.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-lowers-down-the-outer-worlds-2-price-from-80-to-70" target="_self" data-discover="true">Xbox lowers the price of The Outer Worlds 2 from $80 to $70</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo employee data indicates the company excels at retaining workers"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-employee-data-indicates-the-company-excels-at-retaining-workers">Nintendo employee data indicates the company excels at retaining workers</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">New data published by Nintendo shows the company is incredibly adept at retaining talent. The company's revised Employee Data Sheet shows that staff in Japan have an average tenure of 14.4 years, which is more than the national average of 12.5 years. Notably, the company's employee turnover rate in the country is a meager 1.9 percent. Nintendo also posted similarly impressive figures in other regions such as the United States and Europe. Why is this notable? Well, retaining knowledge and keeping teams together is vital in the game industry. It helps ensure production runs smoothly, benefitting both workers and consumers in a world of spiraling development costs and lofty sales expectations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mobile-dev-sandsoft-is-laying-off-around-65-employees-and-closing-two-studios" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Mobile developer Sandsoft is laying off 21 internal developers to 'double down' on publishing</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Obsidian just cut the controversial price of The Outer Worlds 2"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/615369/outer-worlds-2-price-cut-obsidian-xbox">Obsidian just cut the controversial price of The Outer Worlds 2</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Polygon // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Xbox has reconsidered its decision to start flogging games for $80.

The company said the downturn was due to the underperformance of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which faced "temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues." Ubisoft expects the shooter to bounce back, which seems like good news given how reliant the company seems on the 10-year-old title. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also outlined plans to reorganize the company into "Creative Houses" to become more agile and deliver long-term stability. Where have we heard that before?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="1047 Games lays off developers, CEO says he's made 'many, many mistakes'"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/1047-games-lays-off-developers-ceo-says-he-s-made-many-many-mistakes-">1047 Games lays off developers, CEO says he's made 'many, many mistakes'</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> 1047 Games is laying off a number of developers and "unlaunching" </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In a lengthy statement posted on social media, 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx said the studio ultimately rushed the sequel to market and must now rethink its approach to build the game players deserve. It's the second round of layoffs the company has made this year—but it made headlines for other unsavory reasons too, after Proulx took to the stage at Summer Game Fest wearing a 'Make FPS Great Again' hat to announce </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be getting a battle royale mode. After the move drew criticism given the moniker's links to U.S. President Donald Trump and his right wing cohort of MAGA supporters, Proulx bravely decided to die on his MAGA-memeing hill and refused to apologize. He then apologized three days later. In an interview with Polygon announcing the layoffs, he said he has made "many, many mistakes." We suspect most would agree with him there.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Supermassive Games is laying off 36 people and delaying Directive 8020"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/supermassive-games-is-laying-off-36-people-and-delaying-directive-8020">Supermassive Games is laying off 36 people and delaying Directive 8020</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Dark Pictures Anthology developer Supermassive Games confirmed it would be making 36 people redundant this week to survive in a "challenging" business environment. The studio's upcoming horror title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Directive 8020</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has also been delayed to the first half of 2026—but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Nightmares III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> won't be impacted by the cuts. The news comes during period of upheaval for the UK studio, which lost its long-serving leadership team in February 2024. It then laid off a reported 90 people shortly after. That means the company has seemingly made 126 people redundant in around 18 months. How very bleak.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Just how much do consumers care about Nintendo Switch 2 peripherals?&nbsp;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">Just how much do consumers care about Nintendo Switch 2 peripherals?&nbsp;</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game File (subscription required) // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">New data published by Circana, spotlighted in Game File, indicates Nintendo sold around 512,000 Switch 2 Pro Controllers in the United States during the Switch 2's launch month. It's a number that means the premium gamepad, which retails for $85, had an attach rate of 32 percent in the region—in other words, one in three consumers purchased one with their Switch 2. Circana video game analyst Mat Piscatella also shared another interesting tidbit with Game File. He said the Switch 2's official camera—available for $55 in the U.S.—had a "mid-single digit percentage" attach rate. It'll be interesting to see whether Nintendo eventually shares concrete sales numbers to provide an indication as to how people are responding to the Switch 2's new social features.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Data points to slowing layoffs, but doesn't capture true harm to game industry"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/industry-layoffs-are-seemingly-slowing-but-the-damage-has-already-been-done">Data points to slowing layoffs, but doesn't capture true harm to game industry</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Believe it or not, it appears that game industry layoffs might actually be slowing down. Of course, the caveat is that so many people have been forcibly removed from their jobs over the past few years that you have to wonder how companies are still finding people to hurl out of the door. In her latest piece for Game Developer, veteran reporter Nicole Carpenter looks at how the layoff numbers have stacked up in the wake of a short-lived pandemic boom, how companies are approaching hiring after those widespread cuts, and why an apparent slowdown doesn't mean the industry or its workforce is suddenly out of the woods. Hint: propagating a culture of fear isn't helpful if you want people to make good video games.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
