			<p>Breath of Fire IV, the fourth entry in the classic JRPG series developed by CAPCOM, is now available on PC via GOG, complete with plenty of enhancements over the original PlayStation release.</p>
<p>The newly released PC version of the game, which launches 25 years after the original released on the first PlayStation in Japan, is now available for the price of $9.99 / €9.99 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a> and comes with improvements over the PlayStation release and the original PC release that launched in 2003, such as full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, 2 localization options (English and Japanese), new rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more), improved audio engine, improved keyboard and mouse support, fixed combat and cutscene scripting issues, full support for modern controllers and more.</p>
<p>The JRPG franchise by CAPCOM has been dormant for quite some time, so hopefully the Breath of Fire IV PC release will be successful enough to show the publisher how there's still interest in its series. Lately, CAPCOM has been bringing back series that were thought to be dead, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-hands-on-preview-aging-like-fine-wine/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">Okami</a> series, so a new game or a proper remaster of some of the older entries in the series, like my personal favorites, Breath of Fire III and Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, may not entirely be off the table.</p>

The metropolis of Tokyo is a bit different from what we know, but the streets are just as nostalgic, or, depending on where you’re from, they’re just as good as the place you’ve always wanted to visit.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Companions / Atypical Vehicles</strong></p><p>Autonomous drones, affectionately called “Companions,” have been integrated into daily life, but in cop terms, they’re referred to as “Atypical Vehicles”.</p><p>When they pose a significant threat to society, it’s time for the Atypical Vehicle Disposal Squad (AVDS)—a special unit of the Nitro City police force—to commence their mission to destroy all rogue vehicles!</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Shoot 'Em Up [779 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shoot-em-up">Shoot ‘Em Up</a>!</strong></p><p>Good news: you can bring as much ammo as you want… and that includes grenades!</p><p>After just a little bit of cooldown, the lightning bolt of destruction will return to your hands.

Why not try out the EMP, damage-dealing radio-controlled drones, auto-firing turrets, flamethrowers, anti-tank missiles, and more? There’s sure to be at least one out of the 12 different cool gadgets that’ll catch your eye.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Guns</strong></p><p>By assuming a more stable shooting position, your bullets will hit targets more accurately and deal more damage.</p><p>You can shoot some guns like SMGs while walking without caring about that, since they’re for close-range anyway, but the bigger the gun, the more it’s affected by your positioning.

You could totally stick with them and show them your perseverance, but you could hit them harder where it hurts with more powerful firearms and gadgets.</p><p><strong>Radio Comms</strong></p><p>Story dialogue in stages are all contained in the police radio comms, which can be accessed at anytime and are completely optional.

                <p>It has been a <em>wild </em>week for video games, and between the headline-grabbing news of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">shadow-dropped games</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/" data-ref-id="1100-6531084">turbulent console preorders</a>, it's only natural that some stuff has flown under the radar. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starless-abyss/" data-ref-id="5000-647018">Starless Abyss</a> is one such example here, as this blend of roguelike deckbuilding and Eldritch horror has just released today with very little fanfare.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx2nSUIMk0Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mx2nSUIMk0Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's a shame, because so far, the game is earning high praise for its Lovecraftian themes and retro-inspired art design. Starless Abyss sees you command a fleet of spaceships powered by science <em>and</em> the occult against alien invaders from a nightmarish reality. As one of five Proximae tasked with saving humanity, you'll be able to upgrade your ships along the way, and battles take place on a hex-based grid.</p><p>The catch here is that the closer you bring your fleet to the Outer Gods, the faster your sanity will deplete. You can keep your mind in check, but embracing a little bit of mental chaos will also allow you to use powerful occult abilities in battle. The art direction also looks quite enticing with its old-school spaceship designs and space-terror monsters. It's Steam Deck Verified as well, so you can download it and start playing right away without the need to fiddle about with the game settings.</p><p>If you're curious, you can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167970/Starless_Abyss/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full game on PC via Steam</a>, and a demo is available.</p><p>Looking ahead, a bunch of other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/a-bunch-of-cool-new-games-were-revealed-amid-this-weeks-wildness/2900-6498/">cool new games were announced earlier this week by Top Hat Studios and The Mix</a>. These cover a wide variety of genre, ranging from wholesome platforming with a duck through to survival-horror where you have to fend off flesh-monsters inside of a PS2-era mansion, and they're all coming out in the near future on PC and console.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature.1173519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>When shopping for a game on Steam you'll soon be able to filter results by accessibility feature. The filter options are coming some time later this year, say Valve in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/536595840131663918">Steamworks update post</a>, and will include tickboxes for alternative colour options, adjustable difficulty, menu narration, and subtitle options, among some other useful categories. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>When searching through the store you'll be able to use the usual filter side bar (the bit that lets you filter by genre, for instance) to "narrow by accessibility feature". Some of the stuff you'll be able to tick here includes "adjustable text size", "camera comfort", and "mouse only option". These features will also be listed on individual game store pages.</p>
<p>"Steam Users will be able to view accessibility features for a specific game on the right hand side of the store page," they say. This is the part of the game's page that commonly tells you key info, like if the game is single player or includes controller support. The post shows an example of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a>, which includes features marked as good for accessibility, such as "custom volume controls" and "save anytime" (although quicksave is a common enough convenience feature it's also valued by a lot of users for accessibility too). </p>
<p>For this to work well, however, developers will have to self-report the accessibility options their games include by following a step-by-step form in the wizardy innards of Steam.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/steam-accessibility-search-filters-added-store-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"As part of the 'edit store' section for each game in Steamworks, you'll find a new questionnaire to describe your accessibility support," the post tells developers. "Through this questionnaire, you will self-identify the level of accessibility that your game supports.</p>
<p>"It's not required, but highly recommended because of how much easier it will be for players with accessibility needs to find these games. We've worked to make it as easy as possible for developers to indicate these features are available by using feedback to standardize these options as much as possible."</p>
<p>It's not clear when the extra filter options will appear in the Steam store - Valve say it can only happen "once we've given developers time to work on it from their end".  </p>
<p>Valve have posted a list of <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/accessibility_features">how their various accessibility options will be defined</a>. It's useful, but the accessibility-focused games website Can I Play That have <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/04/23/valve-announces-accessibility-tags-for-steam/">suggested it might be better</a> if Valve instead ran with the definitons set out by the <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/03/20/accessible-games-initiative-announced-by-esa-and-industry-partners/">Accessible Game Initiative</a>, which wants to standardise these tags across all stores - Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo and so on. </p>
<p>Judging from Valve's tag list you might still have to do extra digging to find out the exact features in the game's options. The definitions are broad and don't always describe the precise features of each game. For example, if Gasbag Goblinz 2 is tagged with "camera comfort" that could mean it lets the player disable motion blur, but <em>not</em> camera shake - both of which are covered by the same wide category. This is a difficult thing to account for, given that every game is wildly different, and it looks like Valve will leave it up to the devs to be more openly specific about their features. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The full game is featuring over 140 main levels and more than 60 side levels. There are also hidden rooms, challenging boss battles, and fun mini-games. The full version will include an outfit system, with 30+ Cat and Toast skins waiting for you to collect!</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>Production has started on the film adaptation of horror work sim The Mortuary Assistant, with Willa Holland in the lead role.</p>
<p>Holland - who has previously starred in Arrow and Gossip Girl, although I knew her first as  Marissa Cooper's little sister Kaitlin in The OC - will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as, you guessed it, a mortuary assistant.</p>
<p>Holland is joined by House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire Paul Sparks, who plays Rebecca's boss Raymond Delver in the upcoming film. As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-willa-holland-paul-sparks-1236376119/">Deadline</a>, Rebecca's boss "appears to be a mentor, but also a potential threat".</p>

<p>Indie horror The Mortuary Assistant initially released on PC in 2022, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-finally-coming-to-consoles">becoming available on consoles</a>. As you may have surmised, it casts players as a newly hired assistant at a mortuary who embalms corpses. However, there is a catch - the mortuary is haunted.</p>
<p>Film director Jeremiah Kipp told Deadline he and the game's creator Brian Clarke "respond to character-driven storytelling within a disturbing horror space". Kipp said as Clarke's "influences have been largely cinematic, the whole process has organically felt like an expansion of his unique gameplay".</p>
<p>"We've captured the atmosphere of singular dread that players responded to so powerfully - this movie will be scary as hell," Kipp said.</p>
<p>Clarke added that "seeing the mortuary assistant evolve over the years from a small prototype to a full feature film is beyond anything I could have imagined as a solo developer", calling Kipp an "insanely skilled director".</p>
<p>"It has been one of the highlights of my life working with him," Clarke said. "The entire team at Epic Pictures have done an amazing job capturing the spirit of the game while adding their own unique cinematic flair. It is an honor to see Willa and Paul bring these characters to life along with the rest of the film crew.</p>
<p>"I feel extremely fortunate and can't wait for fans to see The Mortuary Assistant expand into new territory."</p>

<p>The Mortuary Assistant adaptation was first heard of back in 2022, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-getting-a-companion-piece-movie-adaptation">Kipp said the film will be a "companion piece" to the game</a>. According to Deadline's report, the film will expand the game's world further by "delving deeper into the lore of the demonic entities plaguing River Fields".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The most-watched game on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> last year was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, still, after more than a decade on sale. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, Rockstar's ever-evolving <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> is the big draw here - and the developer is still regularly updating the game's online portion with new story beats and quests. But its 25.8m hours broadcast and 1.4bn hours viewed in 2024 is still extraordinary - and also highlights the astronomical potential of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
Outside of GTA, Twitch viewers flocked to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> (1.18bn hours watched), and then the usual evergreen shooters such as Valorant (804m hours), Fortnite (539m hours) and Call of Duty (a combined 451m hours).
</p>
<p>
Overall, gaming content on Twitch was viewed for 15.6bn hours across 2024, and the platform had an average of 105 million monthly visitors. 
</p>
<p>
Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-ceo-reveals-2025-plans-collaboration-mobile-and-more-monetisation">Twitch boss Dan Clancy detailed the company's plans for 2025</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">bumpy 2024 marked by layoffs</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside including improvements to the Twitch mobile app, the company confirmed it would be opening up monetisation for "most" streamers, including the ability to offer subscriptions and bits. 
</p>
<p>
As our Ed wrote at the time, usually streamers need to reach Affiliate status before monetisation tools kick in, but this year streamers will be able to start earning immediately - something that not only benefits the streamer but also Twitch, which takes a cut.
</p>
<p>For more, Ed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-ceo-reveals-2025-plans-collaboration-mobile-and-more-monetisation">chatted with Twitch last year about the future of the company</a> and its approaches to safety, growth, and online communities.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>A meteorite suddenly crashes into Gensokyo.</p><p>A crack appears on its metallic, egg-like surface, and small particles of light shine through the cracks, and they scatter all at once, in all directions.</p><p>Eventually, they reach the most powerful residents of Gensokyo.</p><p>One of these lights reaches Reimu Hakurei.

To find the reason behind it all, Reimu hurries on her way… but it doesn’t take long before someone stands in her way.</p><p>“Looks like I’m not the only one.”</p><p>Standing before Reimu is another girl, similarly clad in a set of Valkyrie Arms.

		<p>What, it’s Friday already? It’s always nice, if a little disorientating to have a bank holiday and a four day week and so rapidly find yourself back at the weekend, where you can chill out, get housework done, and all the rest. Of course, we’ve just been coming out of Easter, which will have given a little bit more time than usual for gaming.</p>
<p>For me, my little time sink has been Into The Breach, the fantastic mini turn-based tactical roguelike from, like, half a decade ago. I remember whiling away a whole Christmas playing it in 2018, and it’s just as good. I’ve also played some other bits and bobs, including the intriguing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/tron-catalyst-preview-glitchy-but-in-a-good-way/">Tron: Catalyst</a> from Mike Bithell and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> gets things started this week by picking off more of the rogues gallery of villains within Assassin’s Creed Shadows, doing a little more cartography and generally progressing through to the game’s conclusion – “Even if the combat and story aren’t massively appealing, the stealth, exploration, and sheer level of beauty to the environments keep me coming back,” he says.</p>

<p>But then Oblivion Remastered released, and he’s suitably impressed. “The ‘remaster’ label may be confusing to some fans as the acclaimed RPG has received more than just a minor facelift. Whole swathes of the game have been improved and reworked while trying to retain that old school Oblivion feel.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played the “fantastic” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/22/promise-mascot-agency-review/">Promise Mascot Agency</a> and the “very good” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/23/amerzone-the-explorers-legacy-review/">Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy</a> for their respective reviews, as well as more of The Witcher 3, which continues to be “a masterpiece”. He also saved Le Havre from relegation in FM24, while relying on youth players after selling loads of senior figures.</p>

<p><strong>Dom</strong> played a healthy smattering of games that included Hundred Line Defense Academy, Atelier Ryza, Star Overdrive and Unbeatable, and because of all of that has only managed around 20 minutes of Oblivion so far.</p>
<p>Needing something calm and relaxing, <strong>Steve</strong> played Crime Scene Cleaner on Game Pass – “Like an edgelord Powerwasher Simulator but there was something compulsive about putting furniture back in place and cleaning off bloodstains.” He then played the fun but repetitive Patrick Starfish game, and has continued on with his quest to 100% Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, where he’s now chasing blue bricks. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and the Oblivion remake are on his to-play list, but they’ll have to wait until the end of term….</p>

<p>Speaking of which, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been tasked with reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for us, and having a great time with it so far. While there’s great depths to the combat, the visuals and overarching story, his favourite aspect is its quirky sense of humour.</p>
<p>And <strong>Ade’s</strong> still carrying on with Atomfall and really enjoying it. “It’s a little rough around the edges, but I find it’s jankiness rather charming,” he says. “Plus, all the references and nods to Britsh Comics are a delight.”</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

With a unique story, distinct design, and one of the best gaming soundtracks to boot, Sandfall Interactive took inspiration from JRPGs—like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona</a> &amp; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy</a> —and adapted it into the western style whilst making their own stamp on the genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently sitting at 92 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a>, plenty of reviewers across the gaming space have felt the same. What's even more impressive is that that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is actually Sandfall Interactive's first ever game—made up of just a small team of 30 to boot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is also available on Game Pass as a day-one launch. So, if you decide to try it out on the service or buy one of the deals ago so you can own it—you'll be supporting one of the best new studios in gaming and getting a Game of the Year contender-level experience in return, all at the same time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/robocop-rogue-city-%E2%80%93-unfinished-business-is-out-on-july-17.1173447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-is-out-on-july-17/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, publisher Nacon and developer Teyon announced the launch date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-styx-and-cthulhu-announcements-headline-nacon-connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a>. The standalone expansion to the first-person shooter game will be available starting July 17 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>RoboCop: Rogue City was the biggest launch registered by Nacon, making it more than understandable that they would want to build up on the successful release. Unfinished Business takes place after the events seen in the 2023 game, where the so-called New Guy in Town was defeated. The background is OCP's latest project, the OmniTower, a massive housing complex explicitly designed to meet the needs of the residents of Old Detroit. However, a group of highly trained mercenaries seizes the building, turning it into their deadly fortress. That's where RoboCop must step in to restore the rule of law.</p>
<p>The OmniTower is full of high-tech threats, such as flying drones, exploding bots, anti-personnel turrets, and deadly traps, on top of heavily armed elite troops that are equipped with mini-guns, jetpacks, and even katanas in some cases.</p>
<p>As RoboCop, players will be able to employ a vast arsenal, from the iconic Auto-9 to the brand-new Cryo Cannon. There are also devastating new finishing moves that highlight how he is the weapon himself when he picks up an enemy and smashes them into a concrete wall or a vending machine.</p>
<p>Moreover, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business will allow fans to step back into the past, when RoboCop was still police officer Alex Murphy, prior to the accident that left him near death. These unique missions will feature familiar faces and help flesh out the character even more, with the help of voice acting from the legendary Peter Weller.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business | Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ykC7btuV6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From a gameplay standpoint, Unfinished Business will feature all the elements that made the base game successful: intense combat, thoughtful investigation, and light RPG elements. Nacon hasn't shared the pricing or the system requirements yet, but you can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right now</a>.</p>

The Fallout creator is eminently listenable and seems to have an infinite well of great stories about a career working on formative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s. His latest is on <a href="https://youtu.be/F707wIeTX2g">game preservation</a>, in which he reveals that Fallout developer and publisher Interplay had to approach him after he'd left the company to ask if he still had development archives they'd ordered him to destroy. The reason? "Oops! We lost it", Cain says (cheers, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-creator-tim-cain-says-he-was-ordered-to-destroy-his-personal-archive-of-the-rpgs-development-individuals-and-organizations-actively-work-against-preservation/">Games Radar</a>).</p>

<p>Cain gives three reasons why he thinks we've already lost a good chunk of the medium's history: either "no-one thought to keep it", people wanted to "keep their things private", or "there's a lot of organisations out there that demand to be the archive keeper, and then they do a terrible job at it."</p>
<p>"This has happened multiple times in my career. When I left Fallout, I was told 'You have to destroy everything you have.' and I did. My entire archive. Early design notes, code for different versions, prototypes, all the GURPS code. Gone." (GURPS is Steve Jackson's 'Generic Universal RolePlaying System', which Fallout intended to use until a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_13:_A_GURPS_Post-Nuclear_Adventure#Termination_and_legal_issues">messy approval process</a> resulted in the creation of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system.)</p>
<p>"When they finally, a few years after I left, contacted me and said 'Oops, we lost it', I thought they were trapping me into 'We're going to sue you if you say you have it," Cain says. "Turns out, no, they really lost it."</p>
<p>Among the casualties of Interplay's slapdash archiving were, says Cain, the GURPS code, possibly the original artwork and, perhaps most tragically, the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Talking_head">clay heads used to animate conversations</a>.</p>
<p>A fine example of never attributing to malice what you can to carelessness, this. "No one is against the idea of video game preservation, but companies and their shareholders are against the idea of not making a profit,” the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game History Foundation</a>'s Frank Cifaldi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">told me last year</a>. “It's a technical black hole; It costs a lot of money to port a video game, and if the margins are just not there, then there's not a business rationale to keep things alive.”</p>
<p>Still, there's seemingly been an uptick in companies making more of an effort recently, such as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/04/playstation-is-using-a-cold-storage-vault-and-mineshafts-to-save-its-30-year-history">Playstation using mineshafts</a> to lovingly store old copies of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> in.

For eons, no contact existed between the two continents because ships couldn’t sail across the expanse. At last, when the historic first contact was made between the two powers, war erupted!</p><p>After long and costly fighting between the Fou Empire in the west and an alliance of countries in the east, both sides exhausted all their strength and resources.

Her trail vanished in a small town near the front line. Nobody knew her whereabouts!</p><p>The Eastern Alliance wanted to avoid sending a large army to the front. Such a move would be a political blunder, breaking the armistice and stirring up hostilities. It became impossible to carry out a large-scale search for Elena.

She leaves on a journey in search of her sister—by herself.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ryu</strong> – Ryu meets Nina while he is lying unconscious on a street in a desert town in the eastern continent.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-begins-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week.1173438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-begins-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has finally given an update on its plans to add an offline mode into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and The Crew Motorfest, which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">first confirmed back in September 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
This decision was prompted by the acrimonious situation with Ubisoft's original The Crew game, which was shut down and nuked from orbit, removing all players' access and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-states-players-dont-have-unfettered-ownership-of-games-as-the-crew-lawsuit-continues">prompting a still-ongoing legal challenge</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, Ubisoft has said that development is progressing "smoothly" on The Crew 2's offline option - which will ensure the game remains playable if and, let's face it, ultimately when Ubisoft does decide to pull the plug again.
</p>
<p>
The first user tests for The Crew 2's offline mode will begin next week, on 30th April, when a select group of fans will be invited to test the option on PC. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtX3oXj9yng&amp;ab_channel=Ubisoft">video message to fans</a>, producer Grégory Corgié confirmed the mode would roll out fully to all platforms at some point "before the end of 2025".
</p>
<p>
An offline mode for The Crew:  Motorfest, meanwhile, sounds further off - but is still coming.
</p>
<p>
"Regarding The Crew: Motorfest, our teams are currently focused on the live-service, and support for the game for years to come," Corgié said.
</p>
<p>
"But rest assured, The Crew: Motorfest will receive an offline mode. The Crew 2 will be first, allowing players to enjoy and switch between the online and offline mode whenever they want, when we will deploy the version before the end of 2025."
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/privacy-firm-files-ubisoft-legal-complaint-over-data-collection-forced-online-in-single-player-games">privacy firm revealed it had launched a fresh lawsuit against Ubisoft over data collection and forced online in single-player games</a>.
</p>
<p>Last year, one group of modders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">set to work recreating the server-side software needed to play The Crew online once again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the time of writing, it has not been decided whether Sweeney will play Mio or Zoe in the Split Fiction film.</p>
<p>It was first revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> earlier this year, when sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>
<p>But, it's not the first Hazelight game reportedly getting a film adaptation. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>. However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>
<p>As for Split Fiction, the co-op caper shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">another million copies in its first week</a> - and now it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">officially record-breaking, too</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, CAPCOM announced that the Resident Evil 4 Remake has broken the remarkable sales milestone of 10 million copies. The game initially launched in March 2023, so it's been a little over two years. Previous sales milestones included <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-surpass-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three million sold in the first two days</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four in just over a week</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five in less than four months</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-3-million-re4-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six and a half by the end of 2023</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-over-7-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven million around its first anniversary</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine million as of the end of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>In CAPCOM's list of all-time bestsellers, this puts the Resident Evil 4 Remake at the seventh spot, narrowly surpassing the Resident Evil 3 Remake but still around a million short of Resident Evil Village. Still, there's no doubt that this was a highly successful product. In time, it could overtake Resident Evil 2 Remake, which currently stands as CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time with 15 million units sold.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch noted a few of the game's faults, after remarking that it's still a very good game:</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 4 was the ultimate test of Capcom’s remake skills, and unfortunately, they buckled a bit under the pressure. The game suffers from minor mechanical issues and doesn’t reinvent or elevate the original material as boldly as some might have hoped it would. That said, Capcom hasn’t broken anything either as this is still a fun, inventive thrill ride that has been brought up to modern technical standards in striking fashion. The new Resident Evil 4 is well worth it for fans of the series, just keep your hopes slightly in check and you won’t be spin-kicked by inflated expectations.</em></p>
<p><em>I may be a bit disappointed by the scope and ambition of Capcom’s reimagining, but RE4 is still one of the most inventive and engaging action-horror games ever made, and this is a competent, technically-impressive new version of the game. The village battle may be largely the same, but it still gets your blood pumping. Same goes for the cabin defense sequence, your showdown with the village chief, or your first encounter with a Regenerator. The RE4 remake is still a fun, bombastic dose of mayhem, I just feel like it had the potential to be even better. It also suffers from the fact that Resident Evil Village was, in some ways, the bigger, crazier take on RE4 that this remake could have been.</em></p>
<p>According to rumors, this should be a big year for fans of the survival horror franchise, as CAPCOM is gearing up to reveal Resident Evil 9. When it comes to the next remake, the rumor is that it should be Code Veronica's turn, although <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it won't be as extensive as RE4</a>.</p>
