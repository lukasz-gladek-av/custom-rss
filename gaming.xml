			<p>Before nerd culture went mainstream, and everyone was into or aware of anime in all its forms, there was what anime die-hards called The Big Three. It was the three iconic and long-running shonen action manga &amp; anime series that were mainstream titans compared to any other series – Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach. The first two have had a healthy variety of video game adaptations over the years, but Bleach&nbsp;has never truly had its moment in the sun. A number of middling arena fighters have come and gone for the stylish and edgy series, but Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;aims to be a breakout hit by combining a reverence for the origins of the series with the sleek underground futurism of it’s recent anime revival seasons, all bundled together in what is easily the most inventive anime arena fighter I’ve played in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiyFl_UPGpk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bleach&nbsp;has a huge amount of major story arcs, not unlike Naruto&nbsp;or&nbsp;One Piece, and its final story arc from the original manga was only just adapted into anime form with a stylish new set of finale episodes. You might expect a new game to tie in with that arc for the sake of recency and relevance, but Bleach: Rebirth of Souls goes back to the beginning. Literally all the way back to the very first scene of the very first episode. In a world where most video game adaptations of lengthy anime tend to skip over the fluff and dive right into the major moments, the story mode in this game is a refreshingly slow and detailed journey through the finer and often brushed-over moments of the franchise.</p>


<p>Is it so successful that you could play this as a substitute for reading the manga or watching the anime? Maybe not entirely. You do get a great dive into the world of Ichigo Kurosaki, a Japanese teen who encounters a mysterious woman calling herself a Soul Reaper and a giant monster attacking his family, leading him down a long and complicated road of becoming a Soul Reaper himself. While the details are there, and the character models are gorgeously detailed and incredibly accurate to the style of the source material, the animation in these story scenes can be really stiff at times, and some iffy dialogue pacing ruins the flow of otherwise impactful and emotional moments. I think it’s an incredible story mode for a die-hard fan of the series, but a newcomer might be left wondering what all the hype was about.</p>


<p>Thankfully,&nbsp;Bleach: Rebirth of Souls delivers plenty of it’s own hype that more than makes up for some minor story mode issues. The game is packed full of music from the composer of The World Ends With You,&nbsp;and I got goosebumps from almost every needle drop moment in the game. Each character’s theme plays when they awaken in combat and every impactful moment in the story mode is paired with a wild song, each track blending the style and mood of Bleach’s original soundtrack with vocals and in-your-face beats that made me feel like I was right back in front of Shibuya 108 fighting Noise with Neku. On top of that, every menu, transition, and piece of UI in the game is sleek and stylish in the coolest way possible – it’s an element of the presentation from the newest seasons of the anime that I’m really happy they adapted for this game.</p>
<p>Of course, the heart of Bleach: Rebirth of Souls, like any arena fighter, is in the combat, and this is where the game shines brightest. Battles are focused around a dual-health system slightly reminiscent of Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy.&nbsp;You have a minor Reishi health bar that is drained normally when attacks land on you, and if that bar goes into the red, you’re susceptible to suffer a Soul Break when another attack hits you, letting your opponent trigger a special attack that depletes a certain number of lives from your major Konpaku health gauge. Different characters deal a different number of damage in these attacks, but are also balanced in different ways beyond how strong those special attacks are.</p>

<p>I was blown away by how faithfully the game managed to take the silly, ridiculous, and often unfair abilities of its cast and adapt them into actual gameplay mechanics. Iconic villain Aizen can trigger his Kyoka Suigetsu ability in the middle of an opponent’s super attack animation, cancelling it completely and rewinding the clock back to before it ever happened. Shunsui, meanwhile, can trigger a mode that randomly activates one of several mini-games that you’re forced to play at the same time as your battle. It’s often hilarious how some of these characters operate, but what’s consistently impressive is how gorgeous every attack, ability, and Awakening animation is.</p>
<p>Those Awakenings are a core part of combat. Each character, after taking enough damage, has an Awakening they can trigger that will let them transform into whatever their respective power-ups from the original series entail, changing their attacks, abilities, and more. It’s a comeback mechanic built into the flow of battle, but rather than acting as a quick reversal of circumstances like a Tekken 8 Heat move, it instead adds a new layer to combat mid-battle that complicates the situation for both players. It’s a really fun way to emulate the tug-of-war patterns so many battles in the original series fall into, but it does so in a way that’s actually rewarding and exciting.</p>

<p>There’s more style, soul, and spark put into Bleach: Rebirth of Souls than I’ve seen from any other anime spin-off game since some of the earlier <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/10/18/review-naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-2/">Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm</a>&nbsp;releases. This is a game clearly made by fans and for fans where the aura and energy of the original series has been perfectly adapted into a fresh gameplay experience. It’s the game that Bleach fans have deserved for a long, long time.</p>

<p>In a new press release by Capcom, it has been announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has passed 10 million units sold in its first month of release.</p>



<p>The press release also reconfirmed that the first free title update will be released later this week and that the second update for the game will be released in the summer. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds impressive sales numbers puts it on pace to easier match Monster Hunter World, which went on to sell 22 million units since its release.</p>



<p>But it’s success wasn’t without its issues. On release, Monster Hunter Wilds surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 million concurrent players</a>, but was criticised for its lack of PC optimisation. </p>



<p>“This game is absolutely amazing – but has the worst optimisation I’ve ever seen,” said one Steam user.</p>



<p>That being said, Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a success for Capcom and the games multiple updates since release has addressed a lot of issues pertaining to PC optimisation.</p>



<p>As for where the success will end remains to be seen, but Wilds’ next target will likely to be to try and overtake Monster Hunter Wilds place to become the best-selling Monster Hunter game in the series.</p>



<p>Do you think Monster Hunter Wilds has enough lets to hit 22 million units sold? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

Jacksepticeye streamed the game extensively at the time it came out, and often mentions it as one of his favorites.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/31/jack-1743416008894.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jacksepticeye was working on a Soma animated show. Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for QTCinderella.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, Jacksepticeye talked generally about what has been a difficult period creatively following various projects that have either been canceled or failed to progress far enough to show his fans. Lamenting his lack of content creation lately, Jacksepticeye then revealed the Soma animated show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had a very large creative project that I was very excited to do, and — I don’t actually know if I’m allowed to say what it is — I’m just going to say what it is, and then if I’m not allowed to say it then this next part won’t be in it,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was planning to do a Soma animated show. Because I love Soma — Soma is top five, top 10 at least video games of all time for me. I absolutely love that game. It has one of the best stories ever in a video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I was so excited to do that. We’ve been talking to the developers for like a year, talking about that, and we were ready to go into full production on that. And I was so excited, and I really wanted to announce that to people, and to talk about it and get really stuck in and share it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because I wanted to play the game all in one video. And I was like, okay, I’ll hold off on that then till we can announce that we’re doing it. So that’s why I haven’t done it yet.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jacksepticeye went on to say the Soma animated show fell apart abruptly after an unnamed party suggested they wanted to do “in a different direction,” but he deliberately left out specifics because he was left so upset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were making really great progress on that, and then it all just fell apart out of nowhere,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m not going to go into too many of the specifics of what happened, because I’m quite upset about what actually went down. But, it’s more of a, ‘we’re going in a different direction,’ kinda vibe. And that really upset me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jacksepticeye did not name the other parties involved. IGN has asked Frictional for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upset is the cancelation of Jacksepticeye’s Soma animated show “flipped” the YouTuber’s plans for 2025 “upside down.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had planned a lot of my year around it. I was like, you know what? I won’t be able to upload as much because I’ll be focusing everything I have into that. But at least I’ll have a really cool creative thing to show off. And I’ll have something for you and we can talk about it and share it and be part of this thing together and have fun with it. And then it all fell apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So all of my plans for the year are flipped upside down. Now what is the priority? What am I doing? I don’t know. I’ve had so many calls over the last couple of weeks. It’s been a lot. It’s been a tough month. I took time off and did all that and I have nothing at the end of it. It’s so frustrating. I hate that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of Soma, Frictional released two more Amnesia games: 2020’s Amnesia: Rebirth and 2023’s Amnesia: The Bunker. In July 2023, in the wake of the release of Amnesia: The Bunker, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amnesia-developer-frictional-games-cutting-back-on-horror">Frictional creative director Thomas Grip said the company was looking to cut back on horror games</a> "to give greater focus on other emotional qualities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While all of our games have been horror in some way, what we really try to do is to get a kind of playable immersion," Grip said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to give the player some sort of immersive fantasy, be that being a [World War 1] soldier trapped in a bunker or a robot stuck at the bottom of the ocean.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Horror games naturally are where emotions are front and centre. Games really excel at this. However, we are also exploring themes outside of making things spooky."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-has-surpassed-20-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding has reached a new milestone ahead of the sequel's release in a few months, Kojima Productions confirmed.</p>
<p>Today, it has been revealed that the first entry in the series connected over 20 million porters across all formats - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox, iOS, and Amazon Luna. This excellent result definitely bodes well for the sequel, which is launching in late June on PlayStation 5, and will presumably hit other formats in the future, like the original did after its PlayStation 4 release back in late 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">Death Stranding</a> is among the most unique open-world games ever released. As Sam Porter Bridges, players travel to a post-apocalyptic version of the United States called the United Cities of America, literally building connections between isolated communities to restore the bonds between the survivors of the apocalyptic Last Stranding. This unique experience was later enhanced in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">Director's Cut</a> release, which added more features, including enhanced combat features.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which will launch on <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">June 26th on PlayStation 5</a>, is looking to bring everything up to eleven with plenty of new mysterious characters, including Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli, who bears a striking resemblance to Solid Snake. Thankfully, it won't be long before we learn if the inclusion of this character will bridge the gap between the two series in some unexpected ways.</p>

        <p>Update 1.1 to make the factory sim yet more satisfying</p>

            <p>
Coffee Stain remain dissatisfied with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, their first-person factory sim, despite Matt Cox giving it the Cox's Orange Pippin Award in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-10-review">Satisfactory 1.0 review</a>. They're just about to release update 1.1 into public testing. This adds Photo Mode, programmable personnel elevators, and a bunch of twisty furnishings. 
</p>
<p>
One thing it doesn't add is rain, which used to exist in Satisfactory but was removed because it wasn't working properly. Apparently, Coffee Stain need to do an Unreal Engine upgrade before they can restore the missing precipitation. Many players are sad about this. Ah, I think it's kind of poetic that there are people in the Satisfactory community who wish only to be rained upon.

<p>
Here's a video in which the developers break down update 1.1's additions.

<p>
And here's a quick summary of the highlights. They're adding branches for hypertube networks, allowing you to shoot down one or the other branch as though switching rails in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a>. They've got some fancy new throughput counters for conveyor belts so that you can easily track how many items a line is carrying. The editor now supports curved building modes for belts, and straight building mode for pipes. There are also new vertical belt splitters and mergers for people who like to expand upwardly, perhaps because they've covered every inch of available soil in metal.
</p>
<p>
New bits and pieces include railway buffers to close out railroads, and the aforesaid personnel elevators - more of a cosmetic flourish in a game with jetpacks, perhaps, but you can customise what the buttons do, and I imagine Satisfactory players will find many arcane applications for such functionality. Just don't use them to transport vehicles, because the game will act as though you've chucked a bunch of forklifts onto a bouncy castle.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least - proper controller support for your Eggbox and PlayStaycation peripherals! There's no final public release timing for the update yet beyond its experimental branch rollout from tomorrow, 1st April. That choice of release date is obviously cause for suspicion, but the developers assure us in the video that, unlike the Cox's Orange Pippin Award, update 1.1 is a real thing that exists.

            <p>If you are simply breezing your way through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and thinking to yourself 'oh I would love this so much more if it was a bit more challenging', well then I have some good news for you.</p>
<p>According to creative director Jonathon Dumont, the team at Ubisoft is "actively looking at… making even a tougher setting for difficulty for some of our players".</p>

<p>Based on my own experience with Shadows so far, this will not be a setting for me. Reader, I have died plenty on my adventures through Feudal Japan so far. But, for those who are not me, Dumont joked to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-actively-looking-at-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode-for-the-rpg-how-challenging-do-you-want-it/">GamesRadar</a>: "How challenging do you want it?"</p>
<p>The developer added Ubisoft is "always listening and monitoring what players are doing" so it can address <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">things like bug fixes and any other changes its community wants</a> via the "constructive feedback" it receives.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we can't do everything, but there are things that we're going to be actioning on, and just for the next updates, there are quite a bit of bug fixes and little feature enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont explained. "I can't just make a list. There's quite a bit of it. So the team is always working to improve the game, and hopefully, people will be able to see the difference when they're playing Shadows in the upcoming months."</p>

            <p>According to Sony's outgoing SVP of Global Partner Development and Relations, PlayStation is like a well choreographed dance.</p>
<p>The company's Phil Rosenberg will be heading off to pastures new at the end of this year. But, while he may be leaving, he has plenty of optimism for PlayStation's future.</p>
<p>"I think we have the smartest, brightest and most passionate people in the world working at [Sony Interactive Entertainment]. They are specialists in areas that need specific expertise. I think that as technology continues to evolve, it becomes more stable, will run faster and that gaming will be an even bigger part of our entertainment world," he said in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/">a recent interview</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The exec went on to describe the company's workings being "like a ballet", saying while it may all appear "like it's kind of effortless", in reality there is "a lot of work" and "heavy lifting" behind the scenes.</p>
<p>"And we're really good at it,"  Rosenberg said.</p>
<p>The exec stated he was "very hopeful and very encouraged by the wind we have in our sails right now", adding he believes the company will "end this year on a great note". Meanwhile, while he didn't go into any great detail, he said all signs point to Sony having "another fabulous year" in 2026.</p>
<p>Based on nothing other than my own extrapolations, this comment made me think of Insomniac's Wolverine, which still doesn't have a release date yet. I am still hopeful for a release this year, although it was recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-window-narrowed-down-by-black-panther-himself">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was aiming for a Christmas launch window</a> - would Sony want to release a first party Marvel game around the same time? I am not sure.</p>
<p>But, back to the matter in hand! Continuing his train of thought, Rosenberg said he is sure Sony has a "bright, bright future" in store. "This is not a '30 years and out' story," Rosenberg closed. "This is a '60 years and who the heck knows from there' story."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Sony news, earlier this month a leak revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">the company was working on AI-driven characters</a>, including Aloy from the Horizon series.</p>
<p>This prompted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-actress-ashly-burch-responds-to-sonys-controversial-ai-aloy">Aloy's Ashly Burch to respond to the leaked footage</a>, with the actress stating she doesn't feel worried that the technology exists, or even because game companies want to use it, but it does still scare her.</p>
<p>"I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone's performance attached to it. That does have someone's voice, or face, or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse," Burch said. "They wouldn't have any protections. Any way to fight back.</p>
<p>"And that possibility... It makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The announcement of the long-rumored Final Fantasy IX may be imminent as Square Enix is gearing up to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Earlier today, a new <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary news page</a> went live on the series' portal website, revealing some of the projects that will mark the occasion, including new figurines, plushies, and a commemorative record featuring a newly recorded version of the Melodies of Life theme song called Timeless Tale. Interestingly enough, a couple of months back, a Reddit user called<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i2putn/comment/m7gztwq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TomAto314</a> revealed they knew of this record, and the information in their possession suggested that the music contained in it was for a game, so there's a good chance this new version of the theme song could have been recorded for the yet to be announced remake.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake is one of the very few projects by Square Enix revealed via a massive GeForce Now leak a few years back that has yet to be announced. According to rumors, the remake will be quite <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">faithful to the original</a>, so we shouldn't expect a massive overhaul in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. Unfortunately, it seems like we will have to wait a few more months to see Zidane and the gang back in action, as the remake isn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/">expected to release this year</a>, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a lot of different side activities that reward players not only with experience points but also with all sorts of items, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-get-resources/">resources</a> that can be used to improve the Hideout and Legendary equipment, and Knowledge points, which are used to unlock new parts of Naoe and Yasuke's skill trees.</p>
<p>Among the activities that Naoe alone can complete to earn Knowledge points, as well as unlock a specific achievement, are Kuji-Kiri, quick time events where Naoe meditates while sitting in some rather stunning locations. If you're having trouble finding all 22 Kuji-Kiri locations, you have definitely come to the right place, as the maps below, divided by region, will help you pinpoint the locations with ease without having to look behind every nook and cranny of the game's massive map.</p>

<p>16 - On Mount Hiei, to the north of Sakamoto. During the meditation, you will be attacked by The Pond Yamabushi, a Level 40 enemy. As such, you will want to leave this Kuji-Kiri for when you are at a higher level, closer to the end of the Assassin's Creed Shadows campaign.</p>

			<p>Ghost of Yōtei is, without a doubt, one of the most anticipated games scheduled to launch in 2025. Its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, was the fastest-selling new IP debut for Sony's PlayStation 4 console when it launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering</a> over 2.4 million units sold in the first three days on the market. It was so successful that Sony even fast-tracked a movie adaptation, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March 2021, only a few months after the game's debut. The film is being directed by Chad Stahelski of John Wick fame.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima was an excellent game, as I said multiple times <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a> at the time. Interestingly, Sucker Punch has decided to make a spiritual sequel rather than a direct sequel. Ghost of Yōtei takes place in another place and another time, featuring a new main character. Now, Sucker Punch and Sony have shared a few more details by updating the game's page <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/?country-selector=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation website</a>.</p>
<p>The new protagonist, Atsu, lives in 1603, at the very beginning of the Edo period, in the lands surrounding the titular Mount Yōtei, the stratovolcano located on the snowy island of Hokkaido. At that time, this area was not officially part of Japan, making it somewhat of a wild frontier.</p>
<p>It is in this context that Atsu's life is upended when her homestead is burned to the ground. Following this tragic event, she undertakes a path of vengeance not unlike that of Jin Sakai, the protagonist of the previous game. According to the website, side content like bounties will provide Atus with the coin needed for the journey, but how she fights, survives, and evolves is entirely up to the player. The developers had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-feature-a-less-repetitive-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at users having more control over Atsu's story, so this could suggest some level of player choice. Could Sucker Punch allow users to choose how to complete some quests? It certainly sounds like it.</p>
<p>The website also promises new gameplay mechanics and improvements as well as new weapons, such as the ōdachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas. The environment will vary from sprawling grasslands with vegetation that reacts to the wind to snowy tundras, all the while gracing players with skies featuring massive sightlines. Of course, Ghost of Yōtei is being developed for PlayStation 5, though it will be best experienced on the PlayStation 5 Pro with enhanced visuals and performance.</p>
<p>The game has no release window yet. Like most publishers, Sony may be waiting to see if GTA VI really launches this year. Stay tuned to get informed when the launch date will be made official.</p>

            <p>"Alien Ant Farm or we boycott," reads the top comment on Activision's <a href="https://x.com/TonyHawkTheGame/status/1905290954191298620">recent reveal</a> of the next wave of tracks for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> - a response to the revelation that the upcoming remasters have both been hit <em>and</em> struck by some soundtrack changes, which hasn't gone down completely smoothly with fans. You could almost say they feel making alterations to such classics is criminal. OK, I'll stop. For now.</p>
<p>It turns out these changes come straight from the large Hawk himself. “It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in THPS3+4 OST,” he wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tony-hawk-explains-controversial-pro-skater-34-soundtrack-changes-it-was-my-choice/">Very Gary Computing</a>. “I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride. More to come… both old and new.”</p>

<p>I'm not sure I entirely buy this, for no substantial reason other than I've grown too weary to accept such chummy reasoning for anything a publisher the size of Activision does ever. Still, I reckon you've got a point there, Mr. Tony 'Tony Hawk' Hawk. The original games's role in introducing US skate punk and hip hop to a huge audience outside the states was undeniable, as was its influence on baggy jean and wallet chain sales. Giving exposure to some lesser known bands is no bad thing, even if I'm personally devastated by the<a href="https://youtu.be/yFA7c7uK5Ks"> loss (or lack of mention so far) of AFI</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/hDolkBP98Mg">Del Tha Funkee Homosapien</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose this might have gone down better if it wasn't for the already announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-career-mode-timer-1851768305">changes to THPS's career mode</a> (Kotaku), which is getting replaced by time challenges ala the prior games, though there'll reportedly still be a free skate option. </p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545710/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_3__4/">out on Steam</a> July 11th, 2025. I assume so much licensed music means they'll be a robust option for streamers. Otherwise they might get copyright-struck down. Possibly in the bedroom. It'll be their doom, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rumours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake have been remaking themselves part of the discourse for several years now, sparked by the announcement of an animated series and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">Nvidia leak back in 2021</a>, and stoked by manifestations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-tactics-ogre-reborn-leak-brings-screenshots-and-a-release-date">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-finally-announce-chrono-cross-remaster">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Squeenix</a> games from the leaked Geforce list. Now, Square Enix have added a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th">dedicated 25th anniversary</a> page flogging figures, spectacles, and other charming tat to their website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>'s 25th cake day isn't until July 7th, but this new page <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097">lines up with claims</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a> leaker NateTheHate that we're getting closer to an announcement, if not a release. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-reportedly-real-and-happening-giving-hope-for-one-of-the-series-finest-to-finally-come-to-pc">has also claimed</a> that the Final Final Tactics remaster is still being worked on - a rumour that's been twinned with the FF9 one for about as long as it's been floating about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For now, all we have are Quina plushies, Garnet figures, and a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5482">lovely looking graphic novel starring Vivi</a>. I've come to love Vivi over the years, as well as as FF9 as a whole. I must confess that, when the game released, I was <em>that guy</em>. You know, that guy who had just played as brooding big-sword Cloud and brooding big-sword Squall and wasn't thrilled to be handed a whimsical monkey boy named after a footballer with dodgy chibi proportions. "What is this magical, fanciful tomfoolery!" I cursed. "I want to shoot motorbikes at my rival's floating child soldier training facility!". Thankfully, I have seen the error of my ways. Final Fantasy 9 is lovely.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy waiting for a remake that might not exist -  like some sort of hopeful but deeply disorientated salmon smashing itself repeatedly against a rock jutting out from a crystalline stream consisting mostly of frothy leaker saliva - then the beautifying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-9-has-never-looked-better-than-it-does-with-the-moguri-mod">Moguri mod</a> may be for you. You get some extra frames (15 to 30), alongside high-resolution textures. Flap in anguish no more, noble salmon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Still, fans of the action/adventure franchise were definitely elated, especially after learning that they wouldn't have to wait too long, given the 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Japanese publication Famitsu recently <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/37453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Game Director Satoru Nihei, who shared several details on the game's structure and length. The Producer said:</p>
<p><em>I want to make it a satisfying volume for a single action game. It's not a game where you defeat the same boss over and over like "Monster Hunter," so I think it will take about 20 hours to complete. It hasn't been decided yet, though. Basically, the story progresses as you clear stages. It's not an open world.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Kadowaki said that while the timeline won't change, the location may change, although it will still be mainly focused on Kyoto in the early Edo period (seventeenth century). Regarding difficulty, the two suggested Onimusha: Way of the Sword won't be a super challenging game:</p>
<p><em><strong>Satoru Nihei — </strong>We want a wide range of action game fans to enjoy the game, so we are proceeding with a policy of not making it extremely difficult. However, if the bosses are easily defeated, it will be boring, so we are continuing to make adjustments every day.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Akihito Kadowaki</strong> <strong>— </strong>Having a difficulty setting hasn't been decided yet. I'll say it again, but I want action fans to enjoy the game to the fullest, so I don't want to make it too difficult, and I want to pursue the appeal of being able to feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat it.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two stated that the setting has been completely reimagined, including the Oni and Genma clans. As such, there's essentially no direct connection to the previous installments, which also helps introduce newcomers to Onimusha: Way of the Sword.</p>

            <p>In its first month of release, Capcom's latest Monster Hunter game has passed an impressive milestone.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250331.html">shared by the company</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has surpassed 10m units since its release on 28th February, 2025.</p>

<p>Celebrating this success, Capcom said Monster Hunter Wilds "provides an environment where a wider range of players can enjoy the game together with the introduction of crossplay, a first for the series, and a simultaneous release on Playstation 5 system, Xbox Series X/S, and PC".</p>
<p>It added the "introduction of the new Focus Mode mechanic and the implementation of seamless movement between settlements and ecosystems" allowed players to experience a more "immersive gaming experience".</p>
<p>Capcom also credited "the fusion of numerous new elements with Monster Hunter’s appeal" for generating plenty of fan excitement, "all of which led to the company first-month sales record of over 10m units sold".</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the company highlighted Monster Hunter Wilds' first free content update, which is set to release later this week, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">bring leviathan Mizutsune and more to the fray</a>.</p>
<p>A second title update will then be released later this summer, Capcom said, adding it plans to continue to release updates that "delight" its players.</p>

<p>On its release in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak on Steam</a>, before breaking through the one million concurrent players milestone on Valve's platform. Meanwhile, it had the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-biggest-physical-launch-of-any-ps5-game-in-japan">biggest physical launch of any PS5 title released in Japan so far</a>, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">boosted cheese naan sales thanks to its delicious-looking in-game meals</a>. </p>
<p>Our Matt awarded the game four out of five stars on its release, calling Wilds the "most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter" to date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, CAPCOM announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has now surpassed the milestone of 10 million units sold across all platforms. This is a new first-month sales record for the publisher, making it a historic occurrence.</p>
<p>The achievement is, however, not at all surprising after the incredible success enjoyed by Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, which have reached 21.30 million units and 16.70 million units, respectively, and occupy the first and second positions in the Japanese publisher's all-time sales chart. Monster Hunter Wilds seems poised to surpass them both in relatively short order, especially considering that CAPCOM has a lot of plans to continue updating the game. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first free update</a> will go live this Friday, adding the new monster Mizutsune, which can be hunted starting at Hunter Rank 21. At Hunter level 41 and above, Tempered Mizutsune will also appear in the environment overview.</p>
<p>Arena Quests, Challenge Quests, and Free Challenge Quests will also be introduced in Title Update 1. Challenge Quests and the newly introduced Free Challenge Quests will only appear as temporary event quests. Arena Quests and Challenge Quests can be completed by up to two players using pre-defined equipment. Meanwhile, Free Challenge Quests have no equipment restrictions and can involve hunting parties of up to four players. All of these quest types can be completed solo, cooperatively in cross-platform online multiplayer, or with the help of support hunters. Replay for faster completion times and earn a spot on the Expedition Record Board for special pendants as rewards. New Event Quests will continue to appear on the Quest Board, offering opportunities to earn special armor, quickly increase your Hunter rank, collect cooking ingredients, and more.</p>
<p>Lastly, the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds update also introduces the Grand Hub to the Monster Hunter Wilds - a massive gathering space for hunters to engage in new ways, such as competing against each other in the Hunter League. Players will unlock the Grand Hub after reaching Hunter Rank 16 by speaking to Tetsuzan in Suja. The entrance to the Grand Hub will also house the Expedition Record Board, which will display the fastest global clear times for the newly added Arena Quests, as well as limited Arena Quest bounties. Each season, the Grand Hub will host a unique celebration. These begin with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance, which runs from 23 April to 7 May. During the festivals, the Grand Hub will change its appearance and the food available, and hunters will be able to obtain limited-time equipment, gestures, pop-up camp decorations, and more.</p>

<p>Since 2020, fans of the Call of Duty esports scene have questioned the downsizing of the top-most tier of the competitive ecosystem. When the Call of Duty League was created, it was cut to accommodate just twelve franchised teams, which has long been a sticking point with viewers and competitors alike.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, LA Thieves’ Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon spit some home truths about the state of play in response to his chat talking about ‘expanding’ the CDL. He’s of the mindset that an expansion would just yield more ‘dogsh**’ teams and that there isn’t enough talent to flesh out a broadened COD League.</p>

<h2 id="h-even-more-uncompetitive">‘Even More Uncompetitive’</h2>



<p>The Call of Duty League has long had a problem with competitive integrity or ‘balance’. The best example of this right now is the split between Atlanta FaZe and the Vegas Falcons. The former team has claimed two of two Major tournaments this year, while the latter org is yet to <strong>win a single series this season</strong>.</p>



<p>There are teams in the CDL that just cannot compete against the top-tier squads, and Envoy argues that adding more teams to match the days of the Call of Duty World League wouldn’t solve the problem. If anything, it’d make the situation worse.</p>



<p>That’s because there just aren’t enough good players coming up to fill rosters.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Expansion is not needed. That s*** is dead. You think some of the matches are boring to watch now?</p>



<p>The talent is just not good anymore, bro. It’s straight up. Like, some of the talent nowadays is better and the teams are structured better, but there is way less talent.</p>



<p>For CWL, last time there were sixteen teams, the bottom six teams were still dogsh**. These matches will be even more uncompetitive. It’s unfortunate for like, the Falcon boys and stuff. They’re obviously making switches after they tried out their roster, but like…</p>



<p>If you added four more teams, it would all be like that, unless you just added like — you made like a <strong>draft</strong>. It doesn’t change that all the top teams have the best budget, most resources.</p>

<p>He argued that the lowest teams in the Call of Duty League are on par with Challengers teams, which is the circuit that operates <strong>beneath </strong>the CDL.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft’s VP of Esports went on record stating that, without <strong>new talent</strong>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-vp-of-esports-no-new-talent-games-die/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports games <strong>will die</strong></a>. If there isn’t enough fresh talent passing through the rotation to keep rosters stacked and the scene competitive, titles will simply die.</p>
