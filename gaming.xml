			<p>The Chinese Room has released a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-hunting-and-feeding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new dev diary</a> that discusses more details about<a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-now-been-delayed-launching-by-first-half-of-2025/"> the upcoming title</a> Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2. This dev diary is the 19th dev diary that the team has released, and this one, in particular, dives into hunting and feeding in both combat scenarios and social scenarios. Both are possible as you roam the streets of Seattle. For this game, they've made sure to make feeding a fundamental part of the player's actions and strategies. "You'll be doing a lot of it- Phyre's a little-and-often kinda drinker; that helps keep the beast in check," says Senior Game Designer Max Bottomley. He goes on to explain how feeding is used throughout the game, and that feeding is predominantly used as a main source of healing, as well as being able to utilize discipline abilities.</p>
<p>While feeding in the game is very important, it's also a huge undertaking to ensure that you do it without being spotted. Getting spotted is a Masquerade violation, with more aggressive characters unwilling to let you feed without being attacked. As a result, it's important to isolate targets. "Feeding in the swing of combat is risky, but not impossible- if you're mindful of which direction you start a feed from, for example, your victim can help soak up a lot of gunfire for you!" says Bottomley.</p>
<p>The dev diary also explains the difficulties of trying to make feeding look good from a first-person perspective in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, "It doesn't really show you much at best and looks silly at worst, but a simple cut in and out of third-person can also be disorienting and feel a bit disconnected." Because of this, The Chinese Room decided to utilize both third—or first-person perspectives for feeding, allowing for cinematic action and continuity of motion.</p>
<p>The dev diary also discusses hunting in detail and Phyre's ability to use Heightened Senses, which enhances her sense of smell, allowing her to see, smell, and hear enemies. This also comes with a visual notification, and players are able to stalk their enemies via the scent of blood in the air.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Part of hunting and feeding in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is the Blood Resonance Events. While roaming the streets of Seattle, players will be able to track and hunt down NPCs that can become fully resonated using a specific type of blood to feed on. Once they are found, players can charm, fear, or anger to bend them to their will.&nbsp; These events are 'social feeding.' "Social feeding is a key part of the players' time in our Seattle and revolves around influencing the NPCs in certain ways- maybe you'll stumble upon someone angry that the ATM has stolen their card, and you can take that anger and feed on it," says Gavin Hood, the Project Lead Game Designer.</p>
<p>There are three more dev diaries listed to be upcoming, each discussing more details of the game, including the Blood Resonance events and fashion. The topic of the third diary will be announced at a later date.</p>

Now through 12:59AM ET on October 10th, you can save an extra 20 percent on top of Woot’s already-discounted codes when you use promo code <strong>SAVE20</strong> at checkout. That drops the price of a <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=verge100924&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-digital-code-1">three-month subscription to $29.19</a> (about $16 off) and a one-month subscription to $11.03 (about $6 off).</p><p>Taking advantage of the current promo — which just so happens to also coincide with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24255302/amazon-prime-day-deals-tips-news-guide-2024-october">Amazon’s ongoing October Prime Day sale</a> — is an easy way to nullify <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">Microsoft’s recent price hike</a>, which raised the price of an Ultimate subscription to $19.99 a month. Plus, unlike the 13-month limit associated with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241171/xbox-game-pass-standard-launch-pricing">Xbox Game Pass Standard</a>, you can stack up to 36 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>On top of the hundreds of other games constantly rotating in and out of the Game Pass library, Ultimate provides access to a growing list of full games and trials via EA Play. You’ll also get access to online multiplayer, exclusive deals, and in-game perks as part of the subscription. You don’t even necessarily need an Xbox console. Xbox Cloud Gaming lets you play on tablets, smartphones, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187164/xbox-cloud-gaming-tv-app-fire-tv-stick-amazon-launch">streaming devices like Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> — which is also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=theverge02-20">on sale at Amazon</a> for $34.99 ($25 off) right now as part of Prime Big Deal Days.</p><div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to more than 100 titles, including new first-party releases on day one, which you can play on multiple devices. The pass also gives subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p></div><p>Whether the price increase is justified is a moot debate while these discounted codes are still available, but note that Microsoft seems to be upping the ante with its offering. For example, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be the first game in its series to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">hit Game Pass on day one</a>. </p><p>It joins a score of other first-party and even some third-party games that Microsoft will give similar treatment to after a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">string</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889421/microsoft-acquires-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-warcraft-king-gaming-buy-news-reports/archives/3">studio acquisitions</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[It’s Rare You Experience Joy As Pure As The Plucky Squire]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/plucky-squire-pc-switch-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-rare-you-experience-joy-as-pure-as-the-plucky-squire.1005315/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/plucky-squire-pc-switch-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently sat down to play <em>The Plucky Squire</em> because I'd heard it was like <em>Zelda</em>, and I like <em>Zelda</em>. I didn't know it also had <em>special powers</em>.</p><p>Having not really seen much about the game outside of seemingly everyone I know and respect on social media saying how incredible it is, I was mere seconds into it before I found myself smiling at the clean, childish art style that, well, is the stuff of storybooks.</p><p>A few minutes later, when it became clear I was literally playing <em>through </em>a storybook, that smile grew even wider. The pages were turning as I moved across map tiles, there was a kind old British man narrating proceedings, and before long I was whispering "oh that's lovely" out loud.</p><p>Then, oh, another trick! We can interact with the story as it's written on the page! The bad guy of the tale has fucked with the pages and some of the text laid across the map isn't describing events, it's been switched up to block them, so you need to complete puzzles in the world (book?) that involve moving the text--and you're in the book, so the text can just be picked up--around to fix the sentences, which changes what they're describing, which <em>then </em>changes the world itself. Seeing this for the first time I am not just smiling or whispering, I'm looking at my cat and saying "oh this rules", to which she replies "mew" (yes, it does).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Plucky Squire | Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJSMqtG0Kcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>By the time <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is pulling its biggest party trick--leaping<a href="https://youtu.be/0DBGXN48tV4?t=177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> out of the pages of the book and into the real world</a>, which presents a whole new axis of movement and a fresh set of puzzle possibilities--I was sitting bolt upright in my chair saying, quite loudly now, "ahhhh wow this is <em>great</em>".</p><p>As you can hopefully tell by now, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is a game that made me <em>feel something</em>. I can talk about it as a game if you want, review-style, about how it's a cute little <em>Zelda</em>-like, about how it's got some interesting puzzles and a neat twist and some lovely voice acting. I could spend a surprising amount of time gushing about the little hand cursor you control in the main menu, which is pointing while you point, but once you click/press a button it stops pointing and gives a thumbs up.</p><p>But I'd rather just talk around this game, about how it's just pure joy. Playing it makes me smile, and laugh, and through its setting is able to deliver both the best of video games and the best of children's books at the same time. It's not that I feel like a child while playing it, there's a certain distance and reverence in its tone that requires you to have grown up already to appreciate it, but there's absolutely an echo, a child-like feeling of happiness--pure, warm, reassuring--to be found on each page.</p><p>Every time I play <em>The Plucky Squire</em> (which I haven't finished yet) brings a nice little surprise: maybe some fights, maybe a scroll with some unlockable art I can enjoy later, maybe some funny dialogue. It doesn't matter what it is, really; it's <em>all </em>good.It's also pretty short,<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-perfect-length" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but as we've established recently</a>, that's fine. A game knowing its limits is a good video game, and one that's able to make a grown man smile like an excited young child is a <em>very </em>good video game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In late July, Humble Games--the publishing arm of the Humble Bundle digital storefront--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-publisher-humble-games-reportedly-lays-off-all-staff/1100-6525236/">laid off the entirety of its staff</a> in a surprising move that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/humble-games-layoffs-leave-developer-unable-to-update-its-game-or-release-it-on-switch/1100-6525328/">left some indie titles in a precarious position</a>. But now, ex-Humble staff have formed their own indie publishing company, called Good Games Group, and it appears that Humble Games parent company Ziff Davis is one of its first clients.</p><p dir="ltr">Led by former Humble Games leaders Mark Nash and Alan Patmore, Good Games Group will be working with various companies to bring indie titles to market, and according to a report from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-humble-games-staff-found-new-indie-publisher" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, one of those companies is none other than Humble Games' parent company, Ziff Davis. Although Ziff Davis was ultimately responsible for the layoff that left them jobless just a few months ago, Nash and Patmore seem excited to get back to work.</p><p dir="ltr">"Good Games Group's mission is to bring exceptional indie games to the global gaming community," Patmore said of the partnership. "Partnering with Ziff Davis allows us to continue working with the amazing indie developers we collaborated with at Humble Games, while also allowing us to chart a new course for the future."</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly which titles Good Games Group will be responsible for, but <a href="https://www.goodgamesgroup.com/" rel="nofollow ">the new publisher's website</a> includes header and footer images featuring a number games previously published by Humble Games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ring-of-pain/">Ring of Pain</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/signalis/">Signalis</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/supraland/">Supraland</a>, to name a few. It's possible that the newly assembled team could be working on some of the same games it would have been responsible for if the mass-layoff had never happened. Initially, Ziff Davis <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-publisher-humble-games-reportedly-lays-off-all-staff/1100-6525236/">told GameSpot that the layoffs would have "no impact"</a> on its operations, with the company planning to have an outside consulting firm called The Powell Group handle any loose ends related to unfinished projects. Humble Games has yet to make a statement regarding the new partnership with Good Games Group, or whether The Powell Group is still in the picture.</p><p>Layoffs have hit the gaming industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">especially hard in 2024</a>, affecting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">AAA studios</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-publisher-thunderful-to-lay-off-20-of-its-workforce/1100-6520404/" data-ref-id="1100-6520404">indie devs</a> alike.

			<p>Diablo IV, which just received its first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred</a>d, was definitely a success for Blizzard. Even those who don't love the game must admit that, at its core, Diablo IV sticks closely to the tenets that made the franchise a tentpole in the genre.</p>
<p>However, as revealed by Jason Schreier (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/play-nice-book-excerpt-blizzard-diablo-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Wired</a>) in his latest book 'Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment', the first iteration of Diablo IV was something very different from what we got. Following Reaper of Souls, the higher-ups decided there wouldn't be a proper second expansion for Diablo III, so Reaper of Souls director Josh Mosqueira started working with a small team on a whole new concept. The project, codenamed Hades, employed an over the shoulder camera with action combat inspired by Rocksteady's Batman: Arkham trilogy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this concept even had roguelike elements such as permadeath. Whenever the player character died, the user would get some kind of perks to facilitate their next attempt. While intriguing, the idea quickly ran into some obvious issues. Batman: Arkham's signature action combat was designed for a single player game, while Diablo IV, like all the games since the very beginning, would need to support cooperative multiplayer. According to Schreier's retelling, it didn't take long for Mosqueira to realize that himself. He left Blizzard in July 2016, founding Bonfire Studios, which to this day appears to have made no games of its own.</p>
<p>Following Mosqueira's departure, Blizzard decided to scrap the project and go back to what made the franchise great in the first place. That obviously translated into a longer wait for fans, but given the Diablo IV we actually got, perhaps it is best that Hades did not materialize after all - such a radically different game might have killed the beloved franchise altogether.</p>

Damon had a cameo in <em>Interstellar</em> and played a much larger role as Gen. Leslie R. Groves in charge of overseeing the top-secret creation of the atom bomb in last year’s <em>Oppenheimer</em>. So it wouldn’t be shocking if Nolan has warmed up to the idea of making him the protagonist of his next film.</p><p>But what that project will be about remains a complete mystery. While Nolan will reportedly write and direct it, rumors that it would be a father-son story or an adaptation of the British TV show <em>The Prisoner </em>have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/christopher-nolan-next-movie-lands-at-universal-1235617025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/christopher-nolan-next-movie-lands-at-universal-1235617025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both been shot down by <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>. The only thing that seems possibly set in stone is that whatever the movie is will begin filming in 2025. </p><p>Hollywood A-listers dropped whatever they were doing to appear in <em>Oppenheimer</em>, and it ended up making hundreds of millions domestically. So it wouldn’t be shocking if the next Nolan movie attracts even more high-profile talent, with cameos that sometimes border on being outright distracting and fourth-wall breaking (at least that’s how I felt about Damon in <em>Interstellar</em>). </p><p>So what subjects might Nolan tackle next? He’s already done comic book adaptations with the Batman trilogy, sci-fi action with <em>Interstellar</em>, <em>Tenet</em>, and <em>Inception</em>, and period pieces between both<em> Oppenheimer </em>and <em>Dunkirk</em>. <em>Insomnia</em> and <em>Memento</em> ticked the mystery thriller box. Does the <em>Prestige</em> count as fantasy? It certainly included magic. Maybe Nolan’s next movie really will just be a lowkey, slice of life tale. If anyone could will that into being a box office blockbuster hit, it’s him. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-super-mario-party-jamboree-multiplies-the-chaotic-fun-of-its-predecessors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When it comes to game night with family and friends, there really ain’t no party like a Mario Party. The series has ignited our competitive spirit for over 25 years, turning the sofa into an energized playground of joy and banter. </p><p>The latest entry, Super Mario Party Jamboree, takes the chaotic fun of its predecessors and elevates it. This is the classic Mario Party formula you love, multiplied, and jam-packed with more minigames, characters and content than ever before – it’s the biggest Mario Party yet on Nintendo Switch!</p><p>Here’s how Super Mario Party Jamboree takes the ultimate game night to the next level…</p><h3><strong>Party with Even More Characters!</strong></h3><p>Firstly, this entry has the largest roster in the series to date, featuring 22 playable characters; more than double its predecessor, Super Mario Party Superstars. Naturally, fan favourite heroes like Peach, Yoshi and Donkey Kong return, while villains like Boo, Goomba and Spike, the latter of which hasn’t been playable since Mario Party 10 back in 2015, join the ranks. Two brand new unlockable characters, Pauline and Ninji, are also along for the ride.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/mariopartyjamboree-preview-blogroll-1725653103545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ninji Joins the Party</figcaption></figure></output><h3><strong>Seven Game Boards</strong></h3><p>Craving a classic 4-player frenzy? Jamboree’s Mario Party Mode applies the series’ beloved board game formula onto vibrant new terrain. Roll your dice block and prepare to traverse a whopping seven game boards – the most seen on Nintendo Switch to date – each with their own unique mechanics. </p><p>The five new boards are Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, where the paths are altered every time you wake the giant Wiggler; Goomba Lagoon, where paths can be washed away by high tide; Roll ‘em Raceway, which lets characters whizz around the circuit in a race car; Rainbow Galleria, a vast shopping mall where you can nab a star for 50% off in a flash sale, and King Bowser’s Keep, where imposter Bowser can cause carnage by claiming spaces as his own. Two returning boards are Western Land from Mario Party 2, and Mario’s Rainbow Castle from Mario Party, making Jamboree a true celebration of the series, then and now.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/07/supermariopartyjamboree-boarding-carousel-img-01-1728318016204.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party</figcaption></figure></output><p>In addition, there’s an exciting new mechanic to spice up the game ⁠– players can earn a Jamboree Buddy which will help them for three turns on the board. These allies enable you to take certain actions twice, including gaining double the coins or stealing stars twice from your foes. But the same way positive actions are doubled with a buddy, so too are unlucky ones! If you land on a Bowser space, it’ll trigger twice, adding a whole new level of chaos to your game. Beyond their doubling effects, Jamboree Buddies also offer aid via individual power ups, for example, Donkey Kong can launch you across the board, while Yoshi can copy an item held by your opponent.</p><p>Players can jump into Mario Party Mode with up to 3 friends locally or online, or match online with random opponents from across the world. And if they feel like <em>really</em> testing their skills, they can choose the new Pro Rules feature, which introduces a more competitive ruleset which makes things more strategic and more reliant on skills.</p><h3><strong>More Minigames Than Ever Before</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/07/nswitch-supermariopartyjamboree-24-1728318457404.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>More Minigames!</figcaption></figure></output><p>Minigames are the star of the Mario Party series, and this collection carries the same addictive, chaotic DNA to have you shouting at the TV. Doubling down on its mission to be the biggest Mario Party game ever, Jamboree has over 110 minigames ranging from classic races and obstacle courses to whimsically bizarre experiences, such as working with a co-op partner to perfectly slice a steak in two or leaping around in a giant picnic basket to avoid being crushed by falling sandwiches. Along with the variety of games, there is also a variety of control schemes – Jamboree has the best of both worlds with some minigames using motion controls and other using button controls. Not a motion control fan? You can disable those minigames from appearing in the settings menu, or using a Pro Controller to auto-disable them. <br>Similar to the aforementioned game boards, players get both new minigames and nostalgic hits, like Granite Getaway, Blame it on the Crane, and Snow Brawl which all make a return.</p><p>Players can also try their hand at these competitive trials in new ways, such as the Daily Challenges, by heading over to Minigame Bay. </p><h3><strong>Brand New Modes</strong></h3><p>Amazingly, Super Mario Party Jamboree isn’t content with delivering the most jam-packed version of the classic board game mode to date. It expands the series even further by adding three new motion control modes, and two brand new online modes, one of which lets up to 20 players join the chaotic fun! </p><p>Paratroopa Flight School is the first of the new motion control modes, where players can use their Joy-Con to soar through the air, taking part in competitive or cooperative activities with a buddy. There’s also Toad’s Item Factory, where participants work together to get a ball to the goal by controlling individual parts of a machine via their Joy-Con. Finally, there’s Rhythm Kitchen, a classic 4-player rhythm action game which lets you bust a move with the Joy-Con to cook along with the beat. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/07/supermariopartyjamboree-moving-carousel-img-03-1728318490598.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Paratroopa Flight School</figcaption></figure></output><p>The first new online mode is Koopathlon, a 20-player race via a series of minigames (your position in the race is tied to how well you perform at said minigames) which mixes the most popular elements of the franchise with a global “battle royale” approach, as players try to overcome Survivathon encounters that threaten to knock them out of the running. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/07/nswitch-supermariopartyjamboree-04-1728318591668.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Bowser's Kaboom Squad</figcaption></figure></output><p>Bowser’s Kaboom Squad, the second online mode, is an action-packed co-op experience where 8 players team up to take down a rampaging Imposter Bowser. You’ll need to defeat him within 5 rounds to win, so load bombs into a cannon to chip away at his health. After each round, you can earn helpful items via a minigame to help you gain the upper hand in battle. Remember: teamwork makes the dream work, particularly when facing off against the Imposter King of the Koopas!</p><p>Host the ultimate games night from the comfort of your sofa when Super Mario Party Jamboree launches on 17th October exclusively for Nintendo Switch, and is available from Nintendo eShop, My Nintendo Store and at retailers. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a> has arrived, adding a new region, campaign, and class. In the new region of Nahantu there are Tenets of Akarat to find activate, similar to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-fractured-peaks-altar-of-lilith-locations-in-diablo-4/1100-6512480/">Altars of Lilith</a> found in the regions from the base game. While they function slightly differently, the basic premise of finding them hidden in the environment remains the same. Finding them rewards you with region renown, which can unlock important bonuses, like extra skill points and potions.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How the Tenets of Akarat work</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381974-tenetofakaratexample.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381974" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381974-tenetofakaratexample.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381974"></a><figcaption>Based on the glowing statues in the background, you need to activate the left and middle statues for this Tenet of Akarat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381974-tenetofakaratexample.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unlike the Altars of Lilith, activating the Tenets of Akarat requires a few minor steps. Each Tenet of Akarat will have some small statues around them, either one or three. If there is only one, after activating it, you will have to take down a few enemies that spawn in. If there are three, there are a few potential solutions.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes you simply need to activate all three statues to activate the Tenet of Akarat. In other instances, like the above image, you will need to activate only some of the statues to match another set of statues in the background. The third possibility is that you will need to attack the Tenet of Akarat itself, which will activate all three statues for you. <strong>Once the Tenet of Akarat has its corruption removed, you still need to interact with it for it to count.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Every Tenet of Akarat location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381975-tenetsofakarat.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381975" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381975-tenetsofakarat.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381975"></a><figcaption>There are a total 0f 30 Tenets of Akarat in Nahantu.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381975-tenetsofakarat.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are a total of 30 Tenets of Akarat throughout Nahantu. Unlike the Altars of Lilith, none of them are hidden behind Strongholds or other quests, so once you reach Nahantu you can find and activate all 30 of them.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-6-all-seasonal-journey-rewards-and-objectives-for-vessel-of-hatred-launch/1100-6527027/">Seasonal Journey Rewards And Objectives</a> guide.</p>

"I once enjoyed the game as a player, back when I was in the middle of the game's target audience," Delaney wrote. "Today, I'm well outside of that, but the game has taken on new meaning to me now that I have kids of my own. Because the core gameplay remains fun and easy to learn, passing down my favorite characters to my kids has been a heartwarming joy, and watching their favorites emerge has been exciting."</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is now in early access, and many players are jumping into Episode Battles, the game’s single-player mode. However, the first big boss of Goku’s storyline already has players begging for mercy, with many complaining about the character’s difficulty on social media. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Boss is none other than Great Ape Vegeta.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The showdown between Goku and Great Ape Vegeta has always been iconic, whether in games, anime, or manga. It has consistently been one of the most challenging battles in Dragon Ball games, serving as one of the toughest bosses in the previous Budokai Tenkaichi titles. However, in Sparking Zero, the difficulty level has been raised even higher, making it a real challenge for players.</p>



<p>Several players have turned to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share their thoughts on the challenging Great Ape Vegeta boss fight in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. One player described it as “<a href="https://x.com/Mdso_Va1/status/1843999451263991945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the most difficult stage</a>” compared to other games, while another mentioned <a href="https://x.com/_Violet_156/status/1843509885859709026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">losing their voice from screaming</a> during the intense battle. Additionally, some players have even begun creating <a href="https://x.com/Dasone_/status/1843691687107051880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">memes</a> about the experience.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Funnily, Bandai Namco’s US and UK accounts of X have acknowledged the community’s feelings regarding Great Ape Vegeta. The UK account posted a <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUK/status/1843543427197350254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GIF</a> of Great Ape Vegeta pummelling Goku with the caption, “This monkey got hands!” The US account has also posted a GIF of Great Ape Vegeta; however, their caption stated, “A win is a win. Lower Difficulty and Retry.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-beat-great-ape-vegeta-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero">How to Beat Great Ape Vegeta in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</h2>



<p>If you are one of the players that are struggling with this boss, these are some tips that might help you.</p>



<p>The first thing you must remember is to maintain distance; use your Step Dash and Dragon Dashes to keep making the distance between you and Great Ape Vegeta. Then, keep spamming your Kamehameha as Goku while watching the distance. This process can be long, so you need to be patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another idea would be to switch characters once the switch meter fills up. Switching to Tien might be helpful as his Tri-Beam attack is much faster than Goku’s Kamehameha, making it difficult for Great Ape Vegeta to dodge it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
GAME customers who pre-ordered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and sat nervously waiting to see if their copies would arrive are now beginning to get their deliveries - but many appear to have been sent the wrong version. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer, GAME pre-order customers say they have received the game's standard edition rather than the pricier £65 version they paid for. 
</p>
<p>
Some customers say they've received a message from GAME informing them that their Steelbook will now arrive separately, though there's no estimate as to when. Others say they have not received this message.
</p>
<p>
"Hi Customer," the message reads. "Thank you for pre-ordering Silent Hill 2 with GAME! Unfortunately there has been a delay with your pre-order bonus Steelbook. We are aiming to have this with you as soon as possible and will be shipped separately to your Silent Hill 2 order. Thank for you shopping at GAME."

<p>
This is on top of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pre-order-customers-left-in-limbo-as-metaphor-and-silent-hill-2-launches-loom">the weeks of concern over the fact GAME no longer shows older pre-orders on its website, and a month-long delays for other game deliveries</a>, despite the chain still taking money for them.
</p>
<p>
The fact GAME customers are unable to access older pre-orders online means they are also unable to cancel said pre-orders and buy a copy elsewhere. Customers who spoke to Eurogamer said they had asked GAME support staff to cancel their pre-orders manually, but been told they were unable to do so.
</p><p>
Indeed, GAME customers tell Eurogamer they continue to struggle to get a straight answer - or any response at all - from the chain's overworked support staff. Eurogamer has seen screenshots showing contradictory and unclear replies to simple queries, and an inability to answer what is happening to GAME's pre-order deliveries generally. 
</p>
<p>As Eurogamer previously reported, the problem here appears to originate with GAME switching over to systems owned by its parent company, Frasers Group, at the end of August. As a result, any pre-orders made on or before 19th August no longer show in customers' online accounts. </p>
<p>
Head over to GAME's social media account on X and every post from the chain is filled with replies from customers concerned about their pre-orders. Many have begun sharing their experiences on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1fvx965/silent_hill_2_remake_preorder_game_uk/">reddit</a>, in a lengthy thread on the main Silent Hill subreddit.

Eurogamer contacted GAME parent company Frasers Group last week, when we previously reported on customer concerns and worrying messages about delays, to try and find out more about the chain's issues. Unfortunately, as with many of GAME's customers, we're still waiting for a response.

			<p>Today, Electronic Arts <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/global-drop-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the official drop rates for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-shockwave-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apex Legends</a> lootboxes to get Heirloom Shards. Why now after five and a half years? Well, the reason is simple: South Korea recently passed a law that requires publishers to disclose loot box drop rates, so EA decided to share a global communication. Here's what they had to say about Heirloom Shards:</p>
<p><em>Heirloom Shards are rare, reflecting the very special nature of these items in our game. While we have shared in the past that Heirloom Shard drop rates were less than 1%, we can share the more detailed percentage of 0.045%. However, we built in a guaranteed Heirloom Shards drop for those who did not receive any after opening 500 Apex Packs† to balance this. This ensures that every player will receive this currency to unlock a Mythic item of their choice along their Apex journey.</em></p>
<p>EA stressed that these are the lowest possible rates based on the inventory of a player who hasn't earned any of the Apex Legends cosmetics from the relevant Apex Pack pool. Since Apex Packs feature duplicate protection, players cannot receive the same cosmetic item twice; as users unlock more of a cosmetic item type, their odds of getting a specific item inevitably increase. As a result, every account has different odds of acquiring each cosmetic item type based on what they have previously unlocked. The post also reminds fans that items in the Apex Pack pool may also be obtained through other means, like using Crafting Metals to craft the item.</p>
<p>Apex Legends players already knew the drop rates to be 'less than 1%', although the reality is much worse, as many had already suspected. By the way, rather than complying with the new South Korean law, Take-Two has recently <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k25-to-remove-vc-packs-due-to-mandatory-odds-disclosure-in-south-korea.986688/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to outright remove NBA 2K25's own lootboxes (the VC Packs) from the Korean version.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266135/nintendo-original-alarm-clock-alarmo-prototypes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">its new Alarmo clock</a> with a motion sensor, and even though we’re still soaking in the $100 device, the company also shared a look at some interesting early prototypes that reveal how the project changed during its development.</p><p>While the Alarmo is round and an eye-catching red, one “early” prototype Nintendo showed in an “Ask the Developer” interview had a more boxy shape and came in gray. This prototype did have an interesting feature in its dot matrix LED display (similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205675/amazon-discontinue-echo-dot-with-clock">now-discontinued Echo Dot with Clock</a>), but Nintendo ultimately went in a different direction because “we felt that this display system wouldn’t be able to communicate the instructions sufficiently,” says Nintendo’s Yosuke Tamori, who oversaw the development of the Alarmo. “It was especially difficult to explain the product’s new features, such as the motion sensor,” he says.</p><div><figcaption><em>I don’t hate this?</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>Another prototype, which looks more like the Alarmo you can buy now, sat on a pedestal. “The system that serves as the brain of the alarm clock is in the base, and the LCD screen and speaker are built into the upper part, with one dial on the top, and a second on the side,” according to Tetsuya Akama, the director of the Alarmo project.</p><p>However, “the second prototype was difficult for left-handed people to use because the dial was on the right,” Tamori says. “Also, we wanted it to be stable even without the base part, so eventually, we placed all the controls on the top.”</p><p>Those two prototypes aren’t as immediately recognizable as an alarm clock, but Akama explained why the team went with the more traditional alarm clock shape with the final product:</p><div><blockquote><p>The most difficult factor in the design decision was whether to make it look like an alarm clock or not. While it’s a highly novel product that offers a completely new experience, we thought it was important to communicate clearly that it’s an alarm clock. After a lot of consideration, we decided to go with a design that people would instantly recognize as an alarm clock. Also, Tamori-san requested that if Alarmo was to be drawn as a picture or icon, it should be in a shape that would be instantly recognizable and eye-catching to anyone who saw it, so we ended up with this shape.</p></blockquote></div><p>The full interview, which is broken out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-1%2F">into</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-2%2F">four</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-3%2F">separate</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-4%2F">parts</a>, includes a ton of other interesting details about the Alarmo, including why the team went with the color red, didn’t go with gesture controls (somewhere, a Google employee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20907715/google-pixel-4-motion-sense-gesture-controls-radar-sensor-project-soli-demo-features">is shedding a tear</a>), and didn’t add any game elements to the clock.</p><div><figcaption><em>I can hear </em>Breath of the Wild<em> sound effects just by looking at the font.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And if you want to master mechanics and hone your play style, there are great in-game tools to help you. A fantastic example of this is the brand-new V-Rival mode, that was also added in the recent update.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192516" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Halo Infinite Map of Zelda’s Kokiri Forest Is Absurdly Detailed" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="192516,193144,192531" data-current="192516"><div><p>This Halo Infinite Map of Zelda’s Kokiri Forest Is Absurdly Detailed</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17972.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-replay-review-how-to-use-1851667802&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-replay-review-how-to-use-1851667802"><em>Street Fighter 6</em> Has Added The Coolest New Feature, And Not Enough People Know About It</a></span></p><p>Similar to the aforementioned Replay Review feature, the V-Rival mode has been somewhat overshadowed by the Terry Bogard DLC fighter. It’s also entirely possible you missed this new addition if you haven’t visited the Battle Hub since the update. We’re going to break down how this mode works, the secret to setting up your own V-Rival, and how to complete the associated V-Rival Challenges.</p><h2 id="h4142"><a id=""></a><strong>How Does V-Rival Mode Work?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="f9be836c9597e177bc5ecd7497027f78" data-recommend-id="image://f9be836c9597e177bc5ecd7497027f78" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Street Fighter 6 Juri win screen with feedback messages on the right-hand side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Street Fighter 6 Juri win screen with feedback messages on the right-hand side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f9be836c9597e177bc5ecd7497027f78" data-recommend-id="image://f9be836c9597e177bc5ecd7497027f78" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Street Fighter 6 Juri win screen with feedback messages on the right-hand side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The mode will unlock once you’ve spoken to Li-Fen and her cute robot partner Sim Sim in the Battle Hub. Not unlike Super Ghost Battle from <em>Tekken 8</em>, <strong>V-Rival mode pits you against AI fighters that are compiled from player-ranked data.</strong> You enter parameters, such as a specific rank, character, and control type, then an AI opponent who meets the attributes you selected will be generated.<br></p><p>Win or lose, you’ll earn some post-match feedback depending on how you played. This could range from commending you on breaking throws to pointing out that you were often hit by Drive Impacts. Talking to Li-Fen directly will provide some deeper commentary on what’s going well and what you could improve on.</p><p>It’s also possible to spectate a battle between two V-Rival CPUs. All you need to do is enter the same parameters as above to narrow down what kind of CPUs you want to watch fight. I prefer to watch these through replays, but a general representation of players fighting through this is still pretty useful.</p><h2 id="h4143"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Fight Your Own V-Rival</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1f170e483e683d4c3e22d9f8db660f45" data-recommend-id="image://1f170e483e683d4c3e22d9f8db660f45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Self V-Rival menu, which shows how many matches are needed to generate one." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Self V-Rival menu, which shows how many matches are needed to generate one." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f170e483e683d4c3e22d9f8db660f45" data-recommend-id="image://1f170e483e683d4c3e22d9f8db660f45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Self V-Rival menu, which shows how many matches are needed to generate one." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For a more introspective experience, you can also face off against a V-Rival based on your play style. You need online experience against them in 10 matches to create a Simple V-Rival, and 50 matches to create a Detailed V-Rival. If you’ve played online a lot already, there’s a chance you’ll have enough matches logged to try this feature immediately. This will, unfortunately, be pretty tricky for everyone else.<br></p><p>The wording isn’t very clear, and has led most people to believe you either need online matches as a particular character or against them. Ironically, both groups are halfway there. <strong>The only way to log matches for your own V-Rival is through online mirror matches</strong>. If you want to fight your own V-Rival Zangief, you’ll need to play as him against other Zangief players.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356"><em>Street Fighter 6</em>’s Version Of Terry Looks And Feels Tremendous In Action</a></span></p><p>That’s not too tall of a task when you’re using a popular character like Ken, or a new roster addition like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356">Terry Bogard</a></span>, but it’s undeniably tough for fans of Dhalsim or E. Honda. My suggestion is to find people in the Battle Hub who are using the same character. This is a far more convenient method for mirror matches than the random selection of Casual and Ranked modes.</p><h2 id="h4144"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Complete V-Rival Challenges</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="630b459c1608f100cc73ca6aa065664c" data-recommend-id="image://630b459c1608f100cc73ca6aa065664c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A strange-looking player avatar asking Li-Fen for feedback." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A strange-looking player avatar asking Li-Fen for feedback." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="630b459c1608f100cc73ca6aa065664c" data-recommend-id="image://630b459c1608f100cc73ca6aa065664c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A strange-looking player avatar asking Li-Fen for feedback." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the bottom of the V-Rival menu is an option labeled Rewards. Most of these are very straightforward to earn, but a few have the confusing task of completing a <em>V-Rival Challenge</em>. There isn’t a proper explanation of what these are, or even how to accomplish them. You won’t be able to figure it out by just playing matches non-stop, either.<br></p><p><strong>The trick is to talk with Li-Fen and ask her if she has any feedback for you.</strong> She’ll offer you some praise on what’s going well and mention a specific aspect you could work on. Keep what she said in mind and apply it during your next V-Rival matches. After you’ve had at least one successful match with improvement, talk to her again to properly complete the V-Rival Challenge.</p><p>Don’t feel bad if this left you feeling perplexed. There’s no visible marker for what the current challenge is or when you’ve improved enough to consider it done. That means you need to make your best estimate of whether you’ve shown progress toward the criticism she laid out. I’ve been able to complete a couple of these with one solid match, but it might take longer for other challenges or higher rankings.</p><hr><p>Many find V-Rival to be a great way to experience and learn from ranked mode fights in <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, without the worry of losing progress. I recommend at least using V-Rival matches as a warm-up before entering ranked mode. It could be a better way to get you in the competitive mindset than just playing a few casual matches.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
