            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Gaijin Entertainment, the studio behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-tracing-qa-fsr4-omm-ser-support-coming-soon/">War Thunder,</a> Modern Warships, Aces of Thunder, and MWT: Tank Battles, has announced EdenSpark, a new open-source platform where, along with an AI assistant, users can create games and make them accessible "<em>to console users hassle-free</em>" and "<em>truly own the code of their creations</em>."</p>



<p>The trailer frames EdenSpark as the platform that simplifies the game-making process with "<em>easy 3D modelling</em>," whatever that's supposed to mean, and that, with the help of its simplified toolset and AI assistant, you can "<em>create a game, and play it instantly on consoles</em>." </p>



<p><a href="https://gaijinent.com/news/edenspark-will-open-a-new-path-for-indie-developers-on-consoles">A blog post</a> on Gaijin Entertainment's official website speaks a little more clearly about EdenSpark, though the framing is generally the same, as EdenSpark is described as a new platform "<em>designed to lower the barriers to game development</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EdenSpark — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8JN9lKh5V4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark gives individual game creators an easy access to consoles, even without a registered company or costly legal paperwork. Anyone will be able to turn their idea into a game and share it with friends on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox</em>," Gaijin Entertainment writes. </p>



<p>"<em>At the same time, unlike closed ecosystems offering similar experiences, EdenSpark developers will retain full ownership of their games. This means that creators can keep their projects inside EdenSpark's community or, if they wish, self-publish independently, taking their work anywhere. This combination of accessibility and freedom is unique: major engines might offer professional flexibility, but they either don't help you [bring your game] to console audience fast and easy or are not available under FOSS, or neither. EdenSpark bridges the gap</em>."</p>



<p>Essentially, it seems like EdenSpark is a platform that users will be able to create games on their PC or console, and begin playing the game they just made, something akin to MediaMolecule's Dreams. It seems to go further, though, because it's not all one stylistic look, and if you wanted to take that game and properly publish it on the PlayStation or Xbox store, you'd be able to do just that.</p>



<p>So, if all you wanted to do was make a game and have people play it on their consoles, EdenSpark purports to be able to do that. But it's unclear if users will be able to monetize their games on EdenSpark, or if they'd have to self-publish in order to make money selling the games they made with EdenSpark. It's also unclear if, even with Gaijin Entertainment repeatedly saying that users will "<em>own</em>" the code their games are built on, Gaijin Entertainment would still ask for a cut of any profits made from games created on its platform.</p>



<p>It also seems like the AI assistant is a huge part of EdenSpark achieving its goal to "<em>lower the barriers to game development</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Experienced</em> <em>programmers can dive deep into code, while complete newcomers can rely on AI-assisted tools to generate art, sound, and gameplay logic, or simply build worlds using plain prompts. It's even possible to create games using a retail console</em>,<em> with a keyboard being the only extra accessory you'll need</em>. <em>EdenSpark is powered by Gaijin's Dagor Engine, the proven technology powering blockbuster titles such as War Thunder, Enlisted and Active Matter, ensuring professional-grade performance for projects of any scale</em>."</p>



<p>At some point in November 2025, Gaijin Entertainment will host a closed beta where users in the beta can take a look at several "<em>game prototypes</em>" and play around with EdenSpark before it launches into its 1.0 version sometime in Summer 2026, according to the <a href="https://edenspark.io/en">roadmap on the platform's official website</a>. The AI assistant for EdenSpark will also only be available in its 1.0 launch.</p>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark is more than just another game creation kit,</em>" added Anton Yudintsev, Gaijin Entertainment's co-founder. "<em>It’s the first platform that truly opens consoles to solo developers, while guaranteeing they remain the owners of their games. Whether you want to share a funny prototype with friends or build a real career as an independent studio, EdenSpark gives you both the tools and the freedom.”</em></p>



<p>At this point, it's too early to say with confidence if EdenSpark will be anything of note in the games industry or not. There are already free game-making platforms that let people jump into game development with plenty of tutorials and assistance to help make it as easy as possible. EdenSpark claims to be a new level of ease-of-use, partly because you can use it on any PlayStation or Xbox console you'd grab at your local retailer, instead of having to swing for a development kit.</p>



<p>It's not a bad concept, realistically, there are just a lot of variables left unanswered, like if EdenSpark will let users monetize the games they make within the EdenSpark ecosystem, whether Gaijin Entertainment would ask for a cut of profits for games made with EdenSpark that do get self-published, and perhaps most importantly, how easy to use EdenSpark really is, and if users really could create games that hit the necessary quality bar that makes players want to pay for them. Or, if EdenSpark becomes the new home for anyone looking to make the kinds of AI-slop games we already see filling digital storefronts, only now they get churned out even faster than before.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-friends-advent-calendar-is-the-only-one-left-now-selling-42-off-on-amazon-2000637620</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-friends-advent-calendar-is-the-only-one-left-now-selling-42-off-on-amazon.1330348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO released its 2025 Advent calendars just a few weeks ago, and they’re already vanishing from Amazon’s shelves at an alarming rate. The<strong> Lego City calendar is completely sold out</strong>, <strong>Minecraft has disappeared</strong>&nbsp;and most other themes have either limited stock or inflated prices. Surprisingly, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/">Lego Friends Advent Calendar remains available and has dropped to an all-time low of $20, down from its original $34 price</a>. For parents trying to stretch holiday budgets while keeping the magic alive through December, this is one of those deals that won’t last long once word gets out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Advent calendars solve a specific parenting challenge every December: Kids need something to channel their excitement during those long weeks leading up to Christmas, and a daily surprise keeps them engaged without the sugar overload of chocolate-filled alternatives. This<strong>&nbsp;set delivers 237 pieces spread across 24 doors, giving children aged six and up</strong> a new building project each morning.</p>
<h2>What’s Different This Year About The Calendar?</h2>
<p>LEGO recently rebranded the Friends theme with greater emphasis on varied storytelling and everyday situations that children are more likely to connect with. This 2025 calendar shows that transition with a holiday sleepover theme that seems more down to earth than releases from earlier years. The package <strong>contains five mini-dolls: Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo</strong>&nbsp;who come with sleeping mats that complete a whole indoor campout setup. The choice of characters reflects varied personality types and interests so that children may enter the narrative on several different levels.</p>



<p>The animal companions add another layer of play value: <strong>Two dogs, a guinea pig, a gecko, and a cat</strong> come with their own accessories like food stations, water dispensers, scratching posts and pet beds. Each animal’s accessories are scaled to match the mini-doll world so kids can actually integrate them into ongoing play scenarios beyond December.</p>



<p>The day-by-day builds range from tiny accessories in early December to larger interactive pieces as we build up to Christmas. Early dates may open with wrapped gift boxes or a table lamp, while later dates open up the fireplace with flame elements, a working sled with space for a minidoll, and a life-sized LEGO reindeer figure. The karaoke machine features a microphone piece that is compatible with a minidoll’s hand, and the hot chocolate stand includes mugs proportionate to the figures.</p>
<p>The scene-building potential extends well past December 25th. The sofa seats two minidolls comfortably, the Christmas tree comes with decorative elements that can be rearranged, and the hobbyhorse has a spring mechanism built into its base. These aren’t single-use holiday decorations. They <strong>become permanent additions to any existing LEGO Friends collection, compatible with playsets like the Heartlake City buildings</strong> and vehicles sold separately.</p>
<p>At $20, this calendar is cheaper than several single LEGO Friends expansion packs while offering more variety. The retail price of $34 already offered good value compared to purchasing single blind bags or accessory packs over the course of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Selling autographed merchandise has become so lucrative that celebrities and athletes are told </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-very-important-reason-celebrities-wont-use-blue-pens-for-autographs_uk_658059cee4b08e9b410b51f7"><span>not to sign anything with blue ink</span></a><span> because it’s believed that this makes their John Hancock easier to scan and forge. It’s true that if you don’t actually see someone sign something in front of you, it’s pretty difficult to verify if a signature is legitimate, so it’s good to be cautious when buying signed merchandise from a third party. Luckily some public figures, like </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>director Yoko Taro, are willing to call out phonies peddling fake autographs for profit.</span></p> <p><span>A </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fan on X sent Taro a screenshot of a now-deleted auction of an autographed </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>soundtrack CD that the director had seemingly signed. At a glance, you wouldn’t know that it was forged. It even has a little sketch of Emil, a character from the </span><i><span>Nier</span></i><span> series whose mask Taro wears during public appearances and that he often includes in his signatures. However, Taro himself replied that “nearly half” of the items for sale that are ostensibly bearing his signature are forged, including the one the fan had originally sent. After Taro put it on blast, the original auction listing was taken down.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine. I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.<br>（◎血◎） <a href="https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo">https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1980304441493582021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Taro says he includes “small, unknown features” in his signature to identify forgeries. A fan posted an image of Taro’s real signature as seen at a Square Enix event, and the differences are subtle but noticeable upon comparison. The R is longer, and the Y is kind of squiggly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">heres a real signature to compare everyone from the square enix cafe <a href="https://t.co/Heahqg06bI">pic.twitter.com/Heahqg06bI</a></p> <p>— la reina (rena) 🌽🐓🐟💀🐅😊 (@ashykitten_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashykitten_/status/1980400732768817636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Well, that’s another scammer’s day ruined, at least. Hopefully, now that </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fans have been made aware of this, they won’t buy any fake Yoko Taro autographs. It’s also possible that forgeries get better now that those looking to make a quick buck know what to look for. So be careful out there, y’all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Normally, this is where I’d talk about what Taro is working on right now, but we don’t really know, actually. I just finished a replay of </span><i><span>Nier: Automata, </span></i><span>and as much as I know people want more of those games, I’m pretty content with where it all ended. Hopefully Square Enix is considering giving </span><i><span>Nier Reincarnation </span></i><span>the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-demo-hands-on-impressions-jrpg-2000622687"><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>treatment</span></a><span> to bring it to consoles, given that the gacha game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><span>no longer playable</span></a><span> but contains a lot of major story revelations. </span></p>

<p>A new Futurama mod is breathing fresh life into the 2003 classic, The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run. Developed by Slurm Team, Futurama Hit &amp; Run transforms Springfield into an almost identical recreation of New New York.</p>



<p>According to the developers, the mod was created with <strong>“all fully from scratch 3D models, built from the ground up like it was an intended expansion pack for the game.” </strong></p>



<p>It’s even got the attention of the original game’s lead designer Joe McGinn, who said, <strong>“I can only say … this looks awesome! I want to play it.”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The mod is currently available to <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download as a free demo</a> and features four story missions, a bonus mission, four races, six vehicles, and more. The current map is roughly a quarter of New New York.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the team used AI-generated dialogue for aspects of the mod due to the series’ voice actors not being able to participate in its creation.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-didn-t-the-simpsons-hit-amp-run-2-happen">Why Didn’t The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run 2 Happen?</h2>



<p>With a new mod for the classic game, it obviously leads to the question of why fans didn’t get a The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run 2? As it turns out, development on a sequel was actually underway after the success of the original. Unfortunately, the original game’s publisher, Vivendi, lost the license for the franchise and turned down a deal to make more games. </p>



<p><strong>“The Simpsons came back with an offer for five games for X amount of dollars — a really good deal — and Vivendi said ‘No.’,”</strong>&nbsp;former executive producer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-didnt-we-get-the-simpsons-hit-run-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Melchior said back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Ridgeline Games was instrumental in the beginning of Battlefield 6, but the studio was closed midway through the game’s production following the voluntary departure of former director and VP Marcus Lehto. The former visionary has revealed that several members of the team were left out of the Battlefield 6 credits—including himself.</p>



<p>It’s never a nice feeling for your work to go unappreciated. This appears to be the case for several members of the now-defunct Ridgeline Games team, who worked tirelessly on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-former-battlefield-6-director-criticizes-game-for-not-acknowledging-former-devs">Former Battlefield 6 Director Criticizes Game For Not Acknowledging Former Devs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not good. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-lehto-7378b31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marcus Lehto</a> was a “Studio GM/VP” for Battlefield between 2021 and 2024. He led Ridgeline Games—formed in 2022—with the specific purpose of working on Battlefield 6—before walking away in 2024.</p>



<p>Lehto <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386081189645885440/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> to LinkedIn on October 20 to say: “Many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6.”</p>



<p>The former talent posted an edited version of the Battlefield 6 credits, featuring the devs who were omitted. It also highlights that anyone who was recognized was simply saved for a “Special Thanks” section toward the end of the credits. </p>



<p>Lehto called this out:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>“These talented developers worked tirelessly for 1 to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered. Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a “Special Thanks” section at the very end of the credits — and several were omitted entirely, including myself.</p><p>Out of respect for my colleagues and the awesome work they poured into this project, I want to take a moment to properly recognize them — listing their names and roles as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits.</p><p>Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment.”</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments section, for the most part, was nothing but love for Lehto and his team, and condemnation for the credits leaving out all the missing talents.</p>

More specifically, the "Kirby Air Riders Direct 2," as Nintendo calls it, will begin at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET on Thursday, October 23, and feature roughly 60 minutes of information about the game. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/19/nintendo-details-kirby-air-riders-and-its-november-release-date">Like the first one that aired in August</a>, Kirby Air Riders director Masahiro Sakurai will host the presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>During the last direct, we learned more about the game's roster, which includes Kirby, Meta Knight, Waddle Dee, King Deedeedee, and many more, the second button players can use in the game, two gameplay modes, and the November 20 release date. As for what to expect during this second direct, it's anybody's guess. Of course, there's still plenty to learn about the game but considering the August direct lasted 45 minutes, we've already learned so much about Kirby Air Riders. Nonetheless, we'll be tuning in this Thursday.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/oJVsNMp_nAU?si=ueniAhK4JHBUVINx" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJVsNMp_nAU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><hr><p><em>What do you hope to learn about Kirby Air Riders during this Direct?

			<p>Few games live in my head quite like the ones in the Persona series, and among them there is a clear pantheon of greats. Though there are just five main series games, the true number of games is significantly higher thanks to spin-offs and rereleases that are slightly different to the original.&nbsp;Persona 3 Reload is one of those slightly different rereleases, and now it’s been re-rereleased with a Switch 2 port.</p>
<p><iframe title="Persona 3 Reload — Announce Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vgpmt-54Rjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back at the start of 2024, I gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">a whopping 9/10</a> for being a completely revamped Persona 3 experience that was the best possible version of the game, though not quite the definitive one thanks to the omission of the playable female main character (FeMC, as she’s known online) from previous iterations.</p>


<p>For those who don’t know it, you play a teenager who is tasked with saving humanity. There’s a lot of adult themes here, including most notably, death and suicide. This game isn’t for everyone, but if after watching the trailer you’re curious, it will almost certainly get its hooks in you. If nothing else, the soundtrack has been playing in my head since last January.</p>
<p>So, how does the Switch 2 edition compare?</p>


<p>To paraphrase the great Igor, who famously resides in a place that exists between mind and matter, dream and reality, this game very firmly sits between the PS4 and PS5 version of the game.</p>
<p>To be clear: this is a carbon copy of last January’s release, scaled to Nintendo’s newest console. There’s no FeMC, but it comes with all the quality of life upgrades that we mentioned in the previous review. This game is incredible — that is not up for debate, you should absolutely play it — but it’s not perfect on Switch 2.</p>

<p>Performance wise, we’re somewhere between the PS4 and PS5 editions of Reload, which is what you’d expect for an anime game locked at 30fps. Is it as pretty as the PS5 version? No, absolutely not. There are issues with frame drops that have been picked up by the community following the demo’s launch, and these have already caught the ear of the developers, including Yoshihiro Komori, who told <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/atlus-to-address-persona-3-reloads-switch-2-frame-rate-hiccups-in-future-patches">Nintendo Life</a> that “We are currently taking steps to improve [the frame rate drops]. Since careful QA is required, it was difficult to address this in time for the main game’s release but will be in future patches.”</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help to steady that 30fps down the line, but is it a significant problem for launch?&nbsp; Probably not — this isn’t a photorealistic, high-intensity game. If you’re buying it for the Switch 2, it’s either because you want the portability and convenience, or because you don’t own a more powerful console. If this is a major issue for you, consider getting the game on something more powerful.</p>

<p>Frame rate aside, it actually looks pretty good on the Switch 2. It plays well on handheld and I’ve enjoyed having it on the big screen as well (the same one my PS5 is connected to). Other than some choppy frames during cutscenes, I haven’t really considered turning off the Switch to jump back on the PS5, so that’s a vote of confidence for anyone worried about performance.</p>
<p>This brings us onto the most pertinent question: is it worth buying Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2?</p>
<p>I’d say absolutely, yes, with the caveat that you don’t own a more powerful machine. At this point, it’s going to be cheaper on the PS5 and it frankly looks better. If you don’t own a PS5 and you haven’t already played it, though,&nbsp;I strongly recommend picking up Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2, either now or once a performance patch has arrived.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.</p>

<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159577/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve yet to play any version of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/shin_megami_tensei_persona_3">Persona 3</a>, then its darker tones and subject matter might come as a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>The opening scene shows supporting character Yukari Takeba sitting alone with a gun pointed at her own head, working up the courage to pull the trigger. Even considering some of the directions the subsequent sequels take across their respective narratives, it’s a bold opening statement that sets the tone for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Of course, going back to the original now (or even the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/persona_3_fes">FES</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_3_portable">Portable</a> releases) might prove difficult if you’re used to the slick presentation and gameplay found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> – so that’s where <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> comes in.</p>
<p>Freshly ported over to Switch 2 after launching on other platforms in February 2024, this is a complete remake of the 2006 PS2 entry, featuring revamped visuals, improved gameplay, and a host of quality-of-life updates. While the lack of content from FES and Portable prevents it from being truly definitive, it’s nevertheless the best way to experience the main story.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159580/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of which, Reload sees you transfer to Gekkoukan High School in Tatsumi Port Island, but your arrival reveals that all is not as it seems. A hidden period of time known as the ‘Dark Hour’ occurs every night during which the moon glows green, citizens become encased in coffins, and monstrous ‘Shadow’ creatures stalk a huge tower called Tartarus.</p>
<p>Thankfully, those with the ability to summon Personas can remain conscious during this time, and so it’s not long until the 'Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad' (S.E.E.S.) recruits the protagonist to its cause. Utilising the tried-and-tested ‘Chosen One’ trope, it's revealed that not only are you able to summon a Persona yourself, but you can accumulate multiple at once, swapping between them on the fly according to the situation. <em>"I've never seen this before!"</em> gasps the squad leader.</p>
<p>And so begins Persona 3 Reload’s familiar yet streamlined loop in which you spend the daytime building your social links and strengthening your Personas, while you explore Tartarus and put your skills to the test at night.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159584/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Time passes with each chosen activity, with major story beats occurring once a month during the full moon. Sometimes, progression through Tartarus may be blocked off until you reach these so-called ‘Full Moon Operations’, at which point you’ll need to spend your time elsewhere until you’re able to proceed.</p>
<p>Daytime gameplay is split into morning, afternoon (or after school), and evening. Unless it’s a Sunday, during which you’ll be off school, the afternoon and evening segments are usually when you’ll want to plan out your activities, but don’t stress too much about how to spend your time. Reload gives you ample opportunity to do what you want, whether it be simply hanging out with your friends, playing an online game, or working part-time at the local cafe.</p>
<p>Most activities boost your core stats, so you might feel somewhat overwhelmed at first as you figure out how best to pass your time. Again, you really don’t need to worry about it too much; one way Reload improves upon the original is directly notifying you of available activities via your flip phone, so you don’t have to spend every day tracking what you can and can’t do – it’s mostly spelled out for you.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159583/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s during the day that you really get a good sense of your supporting cast, too. Like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> and 5, Reload boasts an exceptionally likeable set of characters, and they feel greatly fleshed out when compared to the PS2 original – I adore Junpei’s lighthearted nature alongside Mitsuru’s more serious, no-nonsense approach.</p>
<p>It helps, too, that both the English and Japanese voiceover work is equally exceptional. I spent the vast majority of the game with the Japanese cast, simply because it lends the overall setting an air of authenticity, but if you stick with English, you’ll be well catered for.</p>
<p>Dungeon-crawling at night retains some limitations of the original, but key improvements make everything a lot more enjoyable. Each floor of Tartarus is procedurally-generated, with corridors and rooms containing Shadows to fight and items to gather. There’s definitely a sense of repetition as you make your way through — a lot of floors showcase the same visual style — but the frequency at which items crop up keeps things engaging alongside the casual chit-chat between the characters.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159585/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fights can be initiated by either running into a Shadow or swinging your weapon with ‘Y’ to hit them. If you manage the latter, you’ll gain a small advantage at the start of the fight, but if a Shadow happens to run into <em>you</em>, the advantage will be reversed. Encounters will feel pretty familiar if you’ve played Persona 5 Royal, and they remain just as enjoyable and thrilling as ever.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, victory often hinges on your ability to exploit your enemy’s weakness, whether it be fire, ice, wind, and so on. Achieving this grants you another turn, and you can expand it further by immediately shifting play to a teammate, potentially continuing a streak of powerful attacks. Exploiting weaknesses also knocks enemies to the ground, eventually culminating in an ‘all-out attack’ in which your entire squad rushes in to pummel foes in a cloud of chaos.</p>
<p>As you progress, your knowledge of how to approach each battle expands, and you’ll find yourself trying out different strategies depending on the situation. An all-out attack may well deal a fair bit of damage, but also results in your enemy immediately recovering from their knockdown, so it may be more advantageous to keep hitting them with elemental attacks to keep them on the ground.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159579/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether you're locked in battle or chilling in your dorm room, Reload’s presentation remains exceptional throughout. Once again taking a few cues from Royal, this game is simply dripping with style.</p>
<p>Launching into the in-game menu presents a slick animation that looks like you’re being plunged into water, while attack animations during battles are consistently impressive, whether you’re summoning a Persona or slashing your katana around. None of it feels <em>quite</em> as flamboyant as Royal, but the stripped-back nature of the presentation is a lot more in line with the darker tone of Reload's story.</p>
<p>Similarly, the slightly remixed soundtrack is just as memorable now as it was back in the day. Specific tunes play depending on where you are in the game, and they’re simply marvellous. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve started humming the school theme while hopping in the car or cooking a meal – it’s just so catchy and addictive. This soundtrack may be my favourite of the entire series.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159586/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In porting the game over to Switch 2, Atlus has done a pretty great job. Visually, it's stunning whether you’re playing docked or handheld, and loading is kept to an absolute minimum throughout.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback, however, is the 30fps performance. I want to stress that the gameplay here doesn’t suffer; turn-based JRPGs are rarely reliant on super-smooth gameplay, but it’s the principle, y’know? Reload doesn’t feel like it’s pushing the Switch 2 very hard, so I have to wonder why Atlus wasn’t able to achieve a higher frame rate. Perhaps it can be addressed in a future update.</p>
<p>Finally, as mentioned earlier, it's worth keeping in mind that Reload doesn't feature the expanded content found in Persona 3 FES, nor can you opt for a female protagonist like in Persona 3 Portable. It's true that this is undoubtedly the best way to play the main game, but I wouldn't say that Reload is the absolute definitive version of this entry.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Persona 3 Reload is an extensive and thoughtful remake of the original and unquestionably the best way to experience this modern RPG classic. Switching between daytime and nighttime activities is a blast, and the streamlined gameplay and slick presentation make even the smallest actions feel satisfying.</p>
<p>Minor frustrations remain, chiefly the repetitious nature of Tartarus, while the lack of FES and Portable content prevents Reload from being the definitive version of Persona 3. If this doesn't bother you, though, consider it a must-play on the Switch 2.</p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/edenspark-gaijin-entertainment-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaijin-entertainments-game-creation-tool-edenspark-goes-all-in-on-ai.1330279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Enlisted&nbsp;</em>studio Gaijin Entertainment has announced EdenSpark, a game creation tool that the company says will "let anyone make games for consoles and share them with the gaming community".</p>

<p>According to a press release, EdenSpark will enter closed beta testing in November, and Gaijin is eyeing a full release sometime next year. The tool aims to give developers access to console development "without a registered company or costly legal paperwork".</p>

<p>Despite its focus on console development, EdenSpark won't launch with full console support; that will be added in fall next year, while the closed beta will give you the opportunity to access "a number of game prototypes". You'll also be able to "upload personal projects" during this time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edenspark-gaijin-entertainment-ai-program.jpg?itok=y45_rG7z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edenspark-gaijin-entertainment-ai-program.jpg?itok=wWC2zzEb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EdenSpark will let you build games for consoles using generative AI tools.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this being a modern piece of software, Gaijin has gone all-in on generative AI, and so you can expect a suite of AI assistant tools to help "complete newcomers" create games for the first time.</p>

<p>EdenSpark's generative AI assistant will be able to create "art, sound, and gameplay logic" for you, and Gaijin even says it can "build worlds using plain prompts". If you don't want to bother with that side of things, you can still "dive deep into code" if you wish.</p>

<p>The idea behind EdenSpark is that you'll retain full ownership over any game you make using the tool; you can either keep your creations within EdenSpark's community or release them to the world, but either way, they'll be entirely yours to do with as you please.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for EdenSpark right here. Honestly, I'm very much not sold on the slightly ghoulish AI voiceover; if it's not AI, then whoever performed it is definitely aiming for that uncanny, flat tone, and I don't like it either way. Still, here's the trailer!</p>




<p>Like it or not, generative AI usage is on the rise in the gaming industry. During the most recent Steam Next Fest, more than 500 demos available on the platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage" rel="nofollow">disclosed their usage of gen AI</a>, and there may well have been many more that didn't, despite Valve's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-explains-its-rules-on-ai-content-in-steam-games" rel="nofollow">policies</a>.</p>

<p>Gaijin doesn't seem to be accepting closed beta applications for EdenSpark yet, but if you want to keep up with the tool's progress, you can visit the official website <a href="https://edenspark.io/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ball-x-pit-is-a-breakout-hit-with-300k-copies-sold.1330276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Kenny Sun and publisher Devolver Digital have announced that their indie roguelite&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, which marries roguelite-style progression with&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>-esque ball-based chaos, has hit a big sales milestone.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales just five days after its initial release. As is usually the case, that figure is inclusive of all the platforms on which the game is available, so that's PC, current-gen consoles, and the Switch (with a Switch 2 port on the way later in 2025).</p>

<p>It comes after&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up 100,000 sales for itself in its first 24 hours, which further makes it clear that there's definitely an audience for Sun and Devolver Digital's brand of spherical mayhem. I should know - I'm <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ball-x-pit-review-bubble-bobble-toil-and-trouble" rel="nofollow">part of that audience</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ball-x-pit-sales-300k-grasslands.jpg?itok=bXAqAI2T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ball-x-pit-sales-300k-grasslands.jpg?itok=FALsOArz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, it's a roguelite that combines&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>-style ball-batting gameplay with&nbsp;<em>Survivors</em>-esque bullet heaven elements, roguelite progression, and base-building. Believe it or not, the combination works pretty well.</p>

<p>The game features a number of different characters, all of whom bring their own gameplay quirks; one character is actually two people who fire their balls in opposing directions, for instance, while another transforms the gameplay into a turn-based tactical affair.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>also has lots of different ball types for you to discover, many of which synergize in ways that provide that sought-after roguelite feeling of "should I really be allowed to do this?".</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, which should give you a good sense of the kind of manic visual noise you can expect if you decide to give this one a try (and I heartily recommend that you do), right here.</p>




<p>You can check out <i>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016190" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ball-x-pit/9MWXF3SRD7QN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/BALL-x-PIT-2931076.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's due to hit Switch 2 sometime this year as well.</p>

Your phone, your crummy Android tablet, your car’s infotainment display, oops all Xboxes. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">If Microsoft is right</a> about the future of gaming, your game console might soon be an Xbox even if it’s not an Xbox. It’s an interesting idea, and raises some fascinating questions about the gaming industry. Here’s one of those questions: shouldn’t an Xbox play Xbox games? Here’s another: are they ever going to be any good?</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> begins the show by telling us about his experience with two new Xboxes: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience#:~:text=Xbox%20Ally%20and%20Ally%20X%20review%3A%20this%20is%20not%20an%20Xbox%20">ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X.</a> In a sea of Windows-powered handhelds, these have the official Xbox brand, and thus come with some high expectations. They largely do not meet those expectations. That makes us wonder: is Microsoft’s vision for the future of gaming the correct one? And even if so, can Microsoft pull it off?</p><p>After that, <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/hayden-field">Hayden Field</a> joins to discuss a couple of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1">recent</a> controversial <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-critical-thinking-self-reported-reductions-in-cognitive-effort-and-confidence-effects-from-a-survey-of-knowledge-workers/#:~:text=The%20Impact%20of%20Generative%20AI%20on%20Critical%20Thinking%3A%20Self-Reported%20Reductions%20in%20Cognitive%20Effort%20and%20Confidence%20Effects%20From%20a%20Survey%20of%20Knowledge%20Workers%20">studies</a> that seem to be indicating that AI is making us dumber. This sort of concern always appears at the advent of new technologies — people thought the newspaper was the end of civilization, then thought the same about radio and television and a thousand other things besides. Is the AI backlash just another in a series of moral panics, or are we making a cognitive mistake by offloading our brains to chatbots? The science is still nascent, but it’s already interesting.</p><p>Finally, Sean returns to help us answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about whether hybrid computers, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/25/3041280/asus-transformer-pad-review">very 2012 idea</a>, could be the future of computing.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-quietly-launches-fire-sale-star-wars-millennium-falcon-now-selling-for-pennies.1330267/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever dreamed of owning a piece of the Star Wars universe without needing a hangar bay or hyperdrive fuel, this might be your moment: The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary edition) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has just dropped to an all-time low of $67 on Amazon, down from its usual $84 price tag</a>. For fans who’ve spent decades watching Han Solo’s legendary <em>“hunk of junk”</em> outrun Imperial Star Destroyers, this mid-scale collectible brings that iconic vessel right into your living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another Lego set that’s going to end up collecting dust in a closet: The <strong>921-piece build provides adult fans with something more</strong>: a moment to quit staring at a screen and immerse themselves in a trance-like building experience that requires several intense hours to complete. The set depicts the Millennium Falcon as it was seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with all of the details that made it so iconic in its debut.</p>
<h2>Unique LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is part of LEGO’s starship collection which is a special line of <strong>mid-scale models designed exclusively for display purposes rather than play</strong>. The completed model stands 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide so it’s massive enough to draw attention on a bookshelf or desk without dominating your available space. The stand that comes with it does more than simply support the ship upright. It’s designed to angle the Falcon dynamically so that it looks as if it’s banked hard on a turn while it makes a daring escape.</p>



<p>The build process itself rewards patience and attention to detail. With 921 pieces, <strong>you’re looking at roughly 4-6 hours of construction time</strong> depending on your experience level. Each section reveals new layers of complexity as you work from the interior framework outward to the iconic hull plating. The cockpit section alone requires careful placement of transparent pieces to recreate those viewport windows, while the external paneling uses clever techniques to achieve the ship’s famously asymmetrical profile. The rotating satellite dish connects through a simple but satisfying mechanism that lets you adjust its position after completion.</p>
<p>This price drop represents genuine value for collectors: The set typically hovers around $84, and previous sales rarely dipped below $75. At $67, you’re getting a premium adult-focused building experience for roughly the cost of a standard mid-range LEGO set. The <strong>4.9-star rating across more than 1,800 reviews</strong> speaks to consistent quality.</p>

              <p>If you’re going to play games on your desktop PC, any old monitor won’t do. Sure, it would be nice to have a massive OLED ultra-wide curved display, but that’s not really necessary either. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4896/">Samsung has an excellent low budget gaming monitor that’s usually in the couple hundred dollar range, but happens to be on sale right now for as much as 45% off.</a> We’re in a bit of a deals drought between the Amazon Prime Big Deals Days and next month’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, so this is a pretty darn good savings for this time of year.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G3 gaming monitor comes in three different sizes, each on sale. The 24-inch has the steepest discount of 45%. That brings the price down by $90, from $200 down to just $110. Up a level, we have the 27-inch on sale for 35% off. That one usually goes for $230, but has come down by $80 to just $150. Then last we have the larger 32-inch display for 36%. That discount knocks off an even $100, taking the price down from $280 to just $180.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

The 1ms response time feels snappy with minimal blur. Are you struggling with <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s</em> pogo platforming section in Hunter’s March. That might be because you’re screen is making your suffer through some bad input lag.</p>
<p>AMD Radeon FreeSync support helps keep your GPU and monitor’s refresh rate synchronized. This means less change of screen tearing and a better experience overall both when gaming or when watching a show or movie. You can connect to the monitor over your chose of DisplayPort or HDMI.</p>



<p>Boost the black levels to see all the hidden details lurking in the shadows with the Black Equalizer. This can give you can edge for levels where the lights are out or to make spooky scary games a little less spooky scary.</p>
<p>If you’re been playing for a long while, you can help yourself avoid eye strain. Eye Saver Mode reduces the monitor’s blue light levels which can help relax your eyes. making those longer sessions a bit more comfortable. The stand is tilt adjustable as well so you can have the screen perfectly positioned for your optimal viewing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A video showing a fan assaulting <a href="https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2000637226&amp;action=edit">cosplay livestreamer Emily “Emiru” Schunk at TwitchCon 2025</a> made every online content creator’s worst nightmare go viral. It’s created a new crisis of confidence in Twitch as streamers worry about how seriously the Amazon-owned platform is taking their safety and security. Comments from Twitch’s CEO did little to dispel those concerns.</p> <p>“The safety of our creators is our top priority,” Dan Clancy told Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602">in an interview</a> the day after the incident took place. “The challenge we face is a challenge in today’s society. It’s not limited to Twitch, it extends throughout our society.”</p>

 <p>The executive waxed philosophical about community moderation before talking specifically about what happened with Emiru.&nbsp;“I do think that when you’re livestreaming, in many ways, since you control your community and you can ban people, you can make it so that those people that you don’t want engaging with you and participating with you, aren’t there.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I asked Twitch CEO Dan Clancy about <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emiru</a> getting assaulted at Twitchcon and whether creators can trust the platform to keep them safe. Full interview will be out on my YouTube channel/podcast feed on Wednesday <a href="https://t.co/wTH13vhjBH">pic.twitter.com/wTH13vhjBH</a></p> <p>— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Now, what happened yesterday, obviously, was something that we care deeply about securing this environment. We’re looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi. She’s a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there’s always more work to be done, because that’s the world we live in now.</p></blockquote> <p>But the actions of “leaders in the industry” is not how Emiru has been describing Twitch’s response to the assault at its most recent event. In a video published the same day as the Clancy interview took place, she accused Twitch of lying about its response, claiming the platform’s initial desire was to just ban the alleged suspect for 30 days instead of for life. Emiru also claimed that no one from Twitch security immediately came to her aid or apprehended the suspect to escort him from the show.</p>

 <p>“Like if you watch the clip, the security guard who pushes the guy away is my security,” Emiru said. “The woman who pulls me to the back, my manager. If you’re a small streamer and you don’t have those resources or someone in your line’s not filming, what the fuck do you do? No one would have known.”</p> <p>The incident has led to renewed warnings about Twitch personalities attending in-person events and even, in some cases, calls for new ownership of Twitch.</p>

<p>If you thought the hype for ARC Raiders couldn’t get any bigger, then you should know how much Embark Studios values its new extraction shooter. A 10-year plan is already drawn up for ARC Raiders, so if you buy the game, expect a lot of content to be fired your way.</p>



<p>It’s been a while since an extraction shooter had this much hype and attention. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-early-access-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is taking the spotlight from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov</a>, and the game’s build-up has featured the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam Beta</a> and is crescendoing into a big-time release. We’re not sure about you, but if you had any doubts about the future of ARC Raiders, the company has issued a <em>very </em>long-term vision.</p>

<p>Embark Studios design lead Virgil Watkins—and his team—were asked about what the future holds for ARC Raiders in a sit-down interview. We’re not sure where the original source comes from, but the video credit goes to <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ARCRaidersNews</a> for now.</p>



<p>Watkins had this to say about post-launch content:</p>

<p>“I think internally, for a very long time, we referred to this [ARC Raiders] as a 10-year game. That is the ambition we are aiming for and that dictates the type and quantity of content we want to put into it.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The design lead doesn’t elaborate on the exact nature of any content or a timeframe, as it can “spiral into promises that can go unfulfilled if things change.”</p>



<p>While we know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders isn’t free-to-play and has a price</a>, it should be somewhat comforting to know that the money you part with will supposedly be repaid 3,650 times over.</p>



<div><article><p><span>ARC Raiders’ design director, Virgil, on the game’s post-launch future.</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s very bold to proclaim a game will have a 10-year lifecycle of plans and content in this day and age. If ARC Raiders sees a huge drop-off in players within a couple of years, and it doesn’t financially make sense to develop content for a non-existent audience, then those 10-year plans are suddenly under threat.</p>



<p>Should Watkins have said this? Have you been impressed by ARC Raiders enough to think it can sustain itself for at least 10 years?

Veteran developer Marcus Lehto said the game failed to properly credit a number of developers who worked on it.</p><p>The Battlefield 6 credits list off a series of developers from Ridgeline Games, a studio that worked on Battlefield 6's single-player campaign that EA opened and closed in the span of two years. Not everyone from the studio was credited, though, and Lehto said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcus-lehto-7378b31_im-disappointed-to-see-that-many-of-my-former-activity-7386081189645885440-Q38B/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a> that he was "disappointed" by this. Ridgeline helped lay the "foundation" for what Battlefield 6 would become, and everyone who worked on it deserves to be recognized, Lehto said.</p>

<p>"These talented developers worked tirelessly for 1 to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-studio-loses-master-chief-creator/1100-6521367/" data-ref-id="1100-6521367">I left voluntarily</a> and the studio was subsequently shuttered," he said.

He rose up to become the art director at Bungie and spent 15+ years with the company before leaving in 2012.</p><p>He then started a new company, V1 Interactive, which made a game called Disintegration. It failed to find an audience, though, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-co-creators-new-studio-v1-interactive-is-closing/1100-6488536/" data-ref-id="1100-6488536">the game and studio were shut down</a>. He then joined EA in 2021 and worked on Battlefield until 2024.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a second Direct later this week covering Kirby Air Riders.</p>
<p>Presented by game director Masahiro Sakurai, the Direct will take place on 23rd October at 2pm UK time and last an hour.</p>
<p>This Direct follows a similar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-exclusive-kirby-air-riders-has-a-release-date-and-its-just-three-months-away">presentation on Kirby Air Riders that took place back in August</a>, where the game's 20th November release date was revealed.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders is a follow-up to Sakurai's GameCube game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, but the director took great pains to explain it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-grand-direct-unveiling-was-classic-sakurai-as-he-jokes-its-not-another-mario-kart-clone">not just a Mario Kart clone</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer then went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-is-a-blazing-assault-on-the-senses-where-once-you-lock-in-the-magic-cuts-through-hands-on">hands-on with the game after the Direct</a>, providing further detail on its City Trial battle royale mode.</p>
<p>"Kirby Air Riders is a strange little thing. It's simple, as demonstrated in its easy-to-discern objectives and a control scheme that requires only a handful of buttons to operate," said Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson. "With that said, it has its ways in which it is complicated - at the hands-on, Nintendo had a chaperone quickly run each player through a handful of tutorials amidst a menu replete with them, clearly concerned that some players might struggle to wrangle or understand its esoteric ways.</p>
<p>"This whole dichotomy is very much Sakurai's jam. These are the fingerprints of a man who designed one of the most competitively sublime fighting games of all time... sort of by mistake."</p>
<p>With that in mind, is there much more to add in an hour-long presentation?</p>
<p>Regardless, we'll be watching the Direct to bring you all the news - check it out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_ZHYjYHHiBM">YouTube</a>.</p>

			<p>The long-rumored PlayStation 5 version of Starfield will reportedly not be announced this year, according to a well-known, reliable insider.</p>



<p>Replying to a question on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2">X</a>, reliable insider NatetheHate, who correctly revealed many video game news in the past months ahead of official announcements, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">the official reveal date for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, suggested the port's announcement will be made in 2026, unless plans change.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, a PlayStation 5 release of Starfield has been rumored for a long time and reportedly in the works since the game's release in 2023. Earlier this year, we learned that the role-playing game developed by Bethesda would <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/">release later than originally planned</a> on Sony's current-generation consoles, and that its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">release should coincide with the launch of the second expansion</a>, which could shake up the game considerably with the introduction of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/">space gameplay changes and new gameplay systems. </a>Considering the reliability of the sources of these reports, there's little doubt, at this point, that PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait a while before they can embark on a new journey through space.</p>



<p>PS5 owners waiting until 2026 to enjoy Starfield may not be bad, with the new content and gameplay mechanics on the horizon. So far, free updates and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a> haven't improved the game's core issues, so its late debut would allow new users to experience Starfield in a much better state.</p>

              <p>Lego has released plenty of Harry Potter sets over the years, and with Halloween just around the corner, Amazon’s kicking off the celebrations early by putting quite a few of them on sale. We’ve spotted Hagrid’s hut, Hogwarts Castle, and Aragog in the Forbidden Forest dropping in prices previously. But today, things are taking an even more magical turn – straight into the dungeons.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/">Amazon is being generous with a 35% discount on the Hogwarts Castle: Potions Class Building set, offering it for just $26</a>. That’s a nice $14 discount on a set that’ll fit beautifully into your current Harry Potter Lego setup, and even make a memorable gift for a fan in your family or friends. There’s no word on how long the discount will last, so it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Four Key Characters From the Movies</h2>
<p>This set lets you recreate Professor Severus Snape’s lessons in his dungeon classroom. It comes with 397 pieces, and includes a blackboard, potion bottles, ingredient jars, shelves, and all the other elements you’ll need to bring the setup to life. You’ll also get four minifigures; a very angry Severus Snape (not even surprised), Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, and Seamus Finnigan. We would’ve loved to see a confused Ron or Malfoy up to some mischief, but this lineup works just fine too.</p>



<p>The set also includes two randomly selected collectible Hogwarts portraits. These are part of a larger collection of 14, and can be a valuable addition to your collection if you’ve got one. As with all Lego sets, you’ll get a step-by-step instruction book that walks you through the entire build. It’s pretty easy to follow, even for kids who are building for the first time, but if you need more help, we recommend installing the Lego Builder app. You’ll get 3D instructions, so you can view every step from all angles to get a better idea. There’s also a “Build Together” mode, which is great for when multiple people are working on the same set. Plus, you can keep track of your progress, and see all your Lego projects in one place.</p>
<p>All in all, this set offers a great chance to relive a classic Harry Potter moment, and bring your favorite characters home. It’s made for ages 8 and up, but you can also treat yourself to it (no judgements), or gift it to a Wizarding World fan in your life.</p>
