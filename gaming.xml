                <p>Tencent Games and developer Grey State Studio aren't sending players to Hell in their upcoming game, Rules of Engagement: The Grey State. But this free-to-play tactical-horror action-RPG shooter might be Hell-adjacent, thanks to a nightmarish realm filled with monsters and other unspeakable creatures.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wow0CtP7ng" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5Wow0CtP7ng" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Grey State is the name of an unstable dimension that's too dangerous for humanity, but it also contains alien artifacts that are invaluable. To survive in this hellscape, players assume the role of Striders who remotely pilot their bio-engineered shells from the comfort of their own dimension. Grey State Studios describes The Grey State as a "graveyard of nightmares" and a "Horrorverse" that includes Lovecraftian creatures, as well as monsters inspired by films, books, and even creepypasta online tales.</p><p>The gameplay is a PvEvP loop that gives players only a limited time to drop into The Grey State. Striders will have to scavenge for gear inside the nightmarish dimension and ultimately choose between accepting an early extraction for limited rewards or taking a shot at even bigger profits if they can beat their fellow players to an alien artifact.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YZqXXxPn4U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2YZqXXxPn4U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Grey State Studios is planning an alpha test for Rules of Engagement that will feature four classes of Striders that players can pick. The fourth option is currently being hidden, but the other three are listed below.</p><ul><li>Sledge, an unstoppable juggernaut that forges a path with shield and hammer</li><li>Pyro, a chaotic madman that controls the battlefield with fire and gas</li><li>Phantom, a swift assassin that strikes from the shadows with extreme precision</li></ul><p>The studio notes that players who demonstrate talent for buildcrafting and strategy will reap the rewards in this game. It also added that "Rules of Engagement was built with the future in mind, and we plan to support the game for years to come with content updates, meta shakeups and player-friendly free-to-play business model supported by a cosmetics-only in-game shop."</p><p>Rules of Engagement: The Grey State will hit PC in 2026, and it can be played as a single-player experience or with up to three other players. Additional seasonal content is planned post-launch to explore other aspects of the game's Horrorverse.</p>

<p>"Pokémon Legends: Z-A should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify."</p>

<p>We're also wondering what platform you're planning on picking up Z-A on, and if you'll be going digital or physical. So vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-can%E2%80%99t-believe-we%E2%80%99re-still-talking-about-this.1324924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last week, a cavalcade of cynics and useful idiots accused leftist Twitch streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker – who many of the aforementioned cynics <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been trying to bring down for years</a> – of being a secret dog abuser. This is on its face absurd; there are hundreds of hours of stream footage in which Piker does not abuse his dog, Kaya, in addition to numerous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CACIN1uyZnM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kh_QXIMlEKk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clips</a> in which he dotes on her, takes her to play with other dogs, and generally treats her the way you’d expect from a decent pet owner. However, more than half a week later, this non-troversy remains the talk of the Twitch extended universe. What are we even doing here?</p><p>To be honest, I wouldn’t be mentioning this if not for the fact that it’s a microcosm of how online platforms work today: Somebody makes an accusation based on evidence that’s spurious at best, big names with something to gain (viewership or the downfall of a perceived enemy) uncritically boost it, internet sleuths obsessively piece together supporting evidence by amassing context-free clips and ignoring everything that doesn’t match their intended conclusion, and all of the aforementioned parties spread performatively apoplectic videos across Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, and wherever else they can sucker in uninitiated normies.&nbsp;</p><p>Some version of this happens every week – every day, on a smaller scale – without fail. It accomplishes nothing aside from giving the disaffected masses a brief glimmer of what feels like purpose, but is actually a bloodsucking waste of their precious time on this dying planet. And of course, it provides platforms with sweet, sweet engagement numbers. As a result, platforms will probably never intervene to disrupt this corrosive dynamic, which has broken the general public’s ability to perceive anything resembling objective reality, even as society collapses around them and people like Piker attempt to identify the real reasons why (hint: they don't involve dog collars).</p><p>The internet has been like this at least since the Depp v. Heard trial, which wannabe sleuths similarly feasted on in 2022 while <a href="https://spitfirenews.com/p/what-we-didnt-learn-from-depp-v-heard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting pretty much every important detail completely wrong</a>. At least back then they were obsessing over something of consequence. Now they’ve taught viewers to regard <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-pokimane-cookie-controversy-is-so-dumb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every trumped-up non-issue they can surface</a> with similar gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The particulars barely matter in #CollarGate’s case, because they are stupid, but here’s a quick rundown: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o0sjun/hasan_reaching_for_something_and_seemingly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The clip that started it all</a> depicts Piker, clearly not in a great mood, chiding Kaya for leaving her spot behind his streaming setup. Shortly after, she yelps, seemingly in pain, before laying back down. Piker proceeds to say in an exasperated voice that she’s “being such a baby.” Piker himself has admitted that in isolation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-tJWdxHHr7s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s not a great look</a>! But it’s also explicable: Kaya likely got her dewclaw – a small extra toe higher on the leg than the rest of the foot – caught on the side of her bed, resulting in a sudden and surprising burst of pain as she moved to climb back in.&nbsp;</p><p>This single moment was enough to send the conspiracy mill into overdrive. Content creators and their fans became convinced that, in that moment, Piker pressed an off-screen button to violently shock Kaya, who – according to their telling of events – he has been secretly torturing for years. In the coming days, they reinforced their claims with clips in which Piker reached in a direction and Kaya, napping, did not make any noise but<em> </em><a href="https://x.com/parkingtigers/status/1977435955033415795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>suddenly moved</em></a>, as well as others in which Piker orders Kaya – clearly trained – to go back to her spot. Some of these <a href="https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1977590633104802212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">include text narration</a> of every minute reaction from Kaya, which seem incriminating until you realize she’s just doing normal dog things like licking her lips and looking in directions; she’s not regularly yelping, nor does she appear to fear or loathe Piker. Others purport to depict unforgivable abuse by Piker when, in actuality, Kaya is just napping.</p><p>For his part, Piker has offered multiple plausible explanations <a href="https://x.com/KweenInYellow/status/1978174460269068486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backed up by testimonies by friends</a> who’ve spent ample time in his home. Kaya’s collar, he says, does not have shock functionality. It can only rumble. He’s backed this up by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o1r33t/labased_streamer_shows_off_his_canine_companions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showing the collar to his audience</a>. He also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5sdaz/another_explanation_from_hasan_hes_pushing_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keeps a button on his desk</a> to open the gate that keeps her in his office.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, content creators like Ethan Klein, Asmongold, and Destiny – who have <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made countless hours of content about Piker</a> over the years both to farm engagement and because they <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oppose his pro-Palestinian politics</a> – have kept the faux-outrage train rolling right into a new week, with additional <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5vs5j/asmongold_on_valkyrae_throwing_him_under_the_bus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commentary on Piker’s friends</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5z8gx/asmongold_says_pokimane_lacks_empathy_in_her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast episode Piker was set to guest on</a> that apparently <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/pokimane-lilypichu-cancel-hasan-podcast-over-shock-collar-controversy-3266093/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got canned against the hosts’ wishes</a>, and whatever other scraps they can pick up and throw around like so much attention-grabbing confetti. Number-chasing drama hounds like xQc and MoistCr1TiKaL, you will not be surprised to learn, have also been having a field day with this one.</p><p>These creators and their orbiters do not actually care about dogs, nor do their <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ever-shifting</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trend-chasing</a> stances suggest that they care about anything except themselves. The content creation ecosystem breeds sociopathic cynicism and preys on those credulous enough to have not yet realized this. Unfortunately, millions upon millions of people fall into the latter category. This is not helped by the fact that large portions of the internet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ebzrqf/reddit_is_extremely_manipulated_by_bots_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially Reddit</a>, have been astroturfed via bots, making it seem like many more people give a shit about the non-issue of the day than actually do.&nbsp;</p><p>It is evident that Piker insists on maintaining structure in Kaya’s life so that she doesn’t go too far off the proverbial leash, but so do a lot of dog owners! My mom’s Kaya-sized dog, who I can attest lives a blessed life, spends most of his day napping next to her. This is because dogs sleep an average of 12-14 hours per day, almost as much as cats! That’s not evidence of abuse, nor is it in Piker’s case, especially in the face of an overwhelming amount of footage in which nothing is happening – or Piker is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcOtOQr9_Ys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going out of his way to give Kaya attention</a>. It is also clear that Piker has become vocally irritated with Kaya – and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o1ay9x/old_clip_of_hasan_piker_telling_a_dog_to_stay_or/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his dog before her, Fish</a> – at various points. He has even sworn at them and physically moved them. That’s not great! It is still not evidence of pervasive abuse, however, because pets cannot understand words, and sometimes all they do understand is a person pushing or pulling them.&nbsp;</p><p>Every pet owner gets frustrated with their pet sometimes; this is because animals are dumb and bad at recognizing what matters to us. My cat recently got into the habit of screaming at me before I was ready to wake up in the morning – in defiance of our long-established breakfast schedule, which keeps her from going over a healthy weight. Usually I would tell her to cut it out in a normal voice before rolling over and trying to get a few more minutes of shuteye. Occasionally, exasperated by her repeated attempts, I would yell at her from across the room to shut the fuck up. I’m not proud of that, and I wish I hadn’t done it. But I think there’s a pretty clear line between moments of frustration boiling over and outright abuse. My cat, by the way, remains perfectly chill and happy, and literally anyone who’s ever met her would attest that she loves me a lot.</p><p>The problem with the kind of supposed smoking gun people believe they’ve found conveniently offscreen of Piker is that it doesn’t really make sense in context. After all these years, the most incriminating evidence anyone can find is a handful of, at best, sus clips? And Kaya has only yelped in one of them? That kind of precision would require a diabolical mastermind to maintain, and what kind of calculating evildoer would film the whole thing for ten hours per day? While letting countless friends and high-profile guests – some of them politicians who could potentially <a href="https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">farm political capital</a> by disowning Piker – bear witness in person?&nbsp;</p><p>But the problem with conspiracies is that everything – even evidence to the contrary – becomes “proof” that the conspiracy is real. So despite how ridiculous it sounds when you put it to paper, the more likely explanation in the eyes of those both dishing up and dining out on this obvious bait is that Piker is a black-hearted villain, and every single person in his orbit is part of a meticulously coordinated effort to keep his secret, which he spent years allegedly parading around in the open, safe. </p><p>This despite the fact that it is simply much more likely that someone would have blabbed by now, because that’s how people work. This is the easiest hole to poke in almost any conspiracy: People talk. The more of them you bring into a covert operation, the more likely it is that somebody will slip up or switch sides for their own benefit. If you take into account the actual habits and tendencies of human beings, large-scale conspiracies are immensely difficult – verging on impossible – to keep going indefinitely.</p><p>We then arrive at the biggest worthwhile question of all: <em>Why </em>would anyone spend years performing not-so-secret secret dog torture? Or rather, if somebody possessed with your own human faculties – and not those of a cartoon super villain – was in this situation, why would they do it? I’ve seen people suggest that Piker just wants a living, breathing stream prop. But that also doesn’t make sense! Viewers tune into Piker for political commentary and himbo antics – not for a dog that evidence suggests does not meaningfully contribute to viewership numbers. For a period of time after Fish died, Piker didn’t have a dog. He nonetheless remained one of the biggest streamers on Twitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is probably the dumbest psychosis event the internet has produced in recent months, but it’s still illustrative of how the machine works. All this so it can vomit meaningless slop into your mouth, siphon away your energy, and keep you docile. When you see a controversy take this shape, share this general silhouette, you can safely ignore it. You <em>should </em>ignore it. Engage at your own peril.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Maybe you've noticed, but everywhere you look now, skating is back.</p><p dir="ltr">Though skateboarding games once dominated the gaming scene in the 2000s, the well appeared to all but dry up as the ambitions of the games industry evolved through the decades. Recently, however, there's been a resurgence of skating games, and an audience made up of both oldheads and fresh-faced players alike has been showing up for them. It feels safe to say there's still an appetite for these kinds of titles. With the early-access release of EA's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate/">Skate</a>--a revival of a series that once took up a lot of space in this industry--as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/">acclaimed</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">releases</a> of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remakes, the once-dying genre seems primed for a comeback.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I first clocked this resurgence a while ago while playing an entirely different kind of skate game: a remarkably chill longboarding game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2223700/Driftwood/" rel="nofollow ">Driftwood</a>. In Driftwood, you take on the role of a pretty cool sloth who carves and bombs--in skating parlance, to "bomb" means to ride down a huge hill--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLvW64MuvO4">picturesque mountainsides</a>. As a guy who longboarded back in high school and primarily cruised through the city, Driftwood brought me back to what first turned me onto skating--the rush of wind in my admittedly unprotected hair as I barreled down derelict roads and hills, and the satisfying (not to mention casual) coolness I'd feel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A42mHv2pqsY">swerving through throngs of walkers and traffic</a>. It feels suiting, then, that the game that reminded me why I loved skating also opened my eyes to just how many skating games had emerged in the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">For years now, developers have been producing a remarkable spectrum of titles, from the outlandish SkateBird to simulators like the aptly named Session: Skating Sim. SkaterXL came around a number of years ago, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk landed with all the noise and aplomb of Hawk's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYTNkAdDD8">first successful 900</a>--and has a sequel on the way--and all the while, the OlliOlli games grew in size, substance, and style with every new release right up until Roll7's unfortunate closure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's been no shortage of skating games keeping the dream to shred alive, but with Skate's return, it feels like all the sectors of games development--the indie, AA, and AAA space, to be clear--are fully in the throes of a skating game renaissance.</p><p dir="ltr">So why exactly is this the moment for these kinds of games to re-emerge? What about the gaming landscape of 2025, and the last few years preceding it, has made developers choose to revisit this part of gaming's past?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585335" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585335"></a><figcaption>A sloth skates downhill in Driftwood</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">According to Jason Mann, one of the developers who worked on Driftwood, the answer's pretty simple. "If I had to guess, it's probably that the people who grew up with the Skate and Tony Hawk series are getting old enough to make their own games, or at least have a bigger sway on consumer spending." Considering the timing, he's not exactly wrong. The Tony Hawk games first began appearing on the market back in the late '90s and the Skate series began about a decade after them. The average kid who played either is likely in a position to work in the industry and do something about their conspicuous hiatuses, the result of which we're seeing now. Given the industry's penchant for nostalgia and revisiting the touchstones of its past, this seems like the safest bet.</p><p dir="ltr">By and large, I agree with this opinion. But while I find the resurgence of skating games a welcome one, it also feels a bit like a tactical retreat at times. Maybe it's just the cynic in me, but when surveying the state of the games industry, one has to wonder: What works anymore? At a time when the field is fraught with layoffs and cancellations, it feels natural to see a reflexive nostalgia for the games that developers grew up with--games with legacies defined by their massive success and staying power. It makes ample sense then for something like Skate, which reshapes a beloved property into a new live-service model, to exist--even if it leaves audiences trepidatious.</p><p dir="ltr">For Jeffrey Spicer, a producer at crea-ture Studios who works on Session, the resurgence is reflective of skating culture's own highs and lows in popularity. Spicer added, however, that regardless of mainstream appeal, "there is always a core group of individuals that want a game that allows them the freedom and expression presented in real-life skating." It's a tough sentiment to deny when so many different skating games have cropped up over the years--a diversity that both he and Mann happily championed. It's especially fun seeing skate mechanics crop up in less-likely places too, like Thirsty Suitors from Outerloop Games back in 2023, the recently released Sword of the Sea (which seems more equivalent to surfing but we'll still take it!), and even last year's GameSpot GOTY, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Amusingly, the latter two of these titles allow players to ride on a sword. If I had a nickel for every time that happened, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585336" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585336"></a><figcaption>Metaphor: ReFantazio's protagonist skates through Grandtrad on his sword.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For Spicer, this sort of looming spectre of skating is likely because "the desire for skating games [has] never truly dwindled." Mann echoed this thought, pointing to how previous Tony Hawk and Skate games have enjoyed "cult followings that appear to get quite some social media engagement." And how many of us haven't seen some wildly popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p2nAAD5zous">shortform video</a> of a player hitting an unbelievable Christ Air in Skate 3 set to Pearl Jam's "Even Flow."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, the uptick in skating games and their popularity is becoming palpable, which Spicer attributes to "the growing playerbase" and their demand for more. Fortunately, this moment feels ripe for someone who might want to get into them and clearly there is a desire. Mat Piscatella, a senior director and analyst at the market research company Circana, confirmed that Skate's release for EA seemed to be off to a "phenomenal start." Evidently, the free-to-play revival of the series "ranked among the top 5 titles in weekly total actives" over the majority of the platforms for which numbers are reported, putting its starting audience on par with the likes of giants like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto. While it is typical of tentpole releases to see huge numbers out the door, it's a little rarer to see the feat accomplished by a title belonging to a once popular niche in a series that hasn't released a game in 15 years, making Skate's debut a refreshing shock to the system.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of their once dominating presence, Piscatella also shared that when he worked at Activision, "Tony Hawk games were what games like Call of Duty and Madden are today: annualized releases with a loyal audience that would buy the new version every year." The challenge now, as Piscatella puts it, is to turn these "pulses," instances where a sporadic major release spiked interest and sales in skating games, into a flashpoint that translates to more staying power. Maybe Skate can manage that feat, but folks like Mann would also welcome more original games from the genre's other big series, as well as skating games with "full-fledged story modes" and a bit more grit.</p><p dir="ltr">No matter what form or shape it takes, the devs I spoke to seemed enthusiastic. Not just about the mainstream moment skating games are once again having, but at the prospect of their own work keeping a "torch lit for future generations to find skating," per Spicer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Be it getting new kids on their first board or getting old skaters to dust off their set ups, skating is for everyone."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past weekend at New York Comic Con saw the announcement of a <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game localization. Yen Press has announced that the tabletop adaptation of Ryuko Kui's fantasy manga will be getting an official English-language release.</p>

<h2>The <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> Board Game Localization Announcement</h2>

<p>At a panel at New York Comic Con, Yen Press announced it had secured the rights for an English-language version of the <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game. This announcement came alongside the company's purchase of the licenses of several manga and graphic novels.</p>

The manga follows a group of adventurers as they delve deep into a dungeon on a mission to rescue a friend. This standard fantasy trope is elevated by the dungeon being a fully fleshed-out ecosystem, complete with individual monsters having unique anatomy. Which means, if you know what to do, the monsters can be turned into delicious meals.</p>

<p>The original Japanese release, according to a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/delicious-in-dungeon-board-game/announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wargamer</a>, was published in 2022 and features original artwork by Kui. This is notable because it is two years before the debut of the&nbsp;<em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> anime, which catapulted the series into mainstream popularity. The game is a rough adaptation of Ginichiro Suzuki's 1998 board game, <em>Monster Maker</em>, with some dungeon crawl elements.</p>

While, according to an interview <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/comics/delicious-in-dungeon-manga-creator-known-for-immaculate-dandd-vibes-says-shes-actually-never-played-dandd-but-loves-rpgs-like-baldurs-gate-3/" rel="nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>, she hasn't played the most popular of fantasy TTRPGs, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Kui has put plenty of time into the officially licensed critical masterpiece, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

<p>The English release of the <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game will be available May 2026.</p>

With these two deals, you're effectively saving about $30 compared to buying Xenoblade 2 and Torna directly from the eShop.</p><p>It's unclear when these random Xenoblade Chronicles deals end, but neither game receives discounts very often, so you should snag these discounted digital editions while you can.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4695" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Xenoblade Chronicles Digital Deals" data-collection="" title="[Various] Xenoblade Chronicles Digital Deals">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZBW3R9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B086ZBW3R9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZBW3R9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition (Digital)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZBW3R9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B086ZBW3R9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZBW3R9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$39.89 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition remains one of the best RPGs on Nintendo Switch more than five years after its release.

While it's not as highly regarded as the original, it's still one of the better role-playing games on Switch (and Switch 2). While you don't technically <em>need </em>to play the first game to enjoy Xenoblade 2, it's highly recommended you play each game in chronological order to experience the full weight of the trilogy's overarching story.</p><p>The sequel has some pacing and narrative issues, but the combat system remains awesome, and the expansive world is a joy to explore. Xenoblade 2 starts quite slow, but the back half of the 60-plus hour campaign is thrilling.

US editions of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Torna - The Golden Country often sell for above retail price, but you can often get these and other Xenoblade games for less by opting for region-free imports from the UK. Regardless of region, getting physical editions of the Xenoblade trilogy often means buying from third-party resellers. The physical editions listed above are from resellers but are fulfilled by Amazon or Walmart.</p><p>The best physical edition deal at the moment is for <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DLK17ZY5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a></strong>, the enhanced port of the 2015 Wii U spin-off.

This doesn't apply to the standalone edition of Torna - The Golden Country since it's considered a separate game. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 also has an Expansion Pass that must match the region of your physical or digital copy.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-series-nintendo-switch-best-deals/1100-6535432/">Two Xenoblade Chronicles Games Get Rare Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-by-alan-lee-deluxe-book-box-set-amazon-walmart-deals/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Illustrated Box Set Is Still On Sale For Only $108</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-preorder/1100-6529762/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorder Guide - Target Reveals Exclusive Launch Bonus</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/creepshow-complete-series-blu-ray-preorder-is-nearly-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6526479/">Creepshow: Complete Series Blu-Ray Preorders Are Nearly 50% Off At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-physical-edition-is-available-now-for-40/1100-6535099/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Physical Edition Is Available Now For $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-animated-series-blu-ray-release-preorder-amazon/1100-6535393/">Scott Pilgrim Animated Series Is Releasing On Blu-Ray, Preorders Restocked</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Collector Booster Box Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-crafting-table-creeper-best-amazon-deals/1100-6535384/">Lego Minecraft 15th Anniversary Diorama And Creeper Figure Get First Big Discounts</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-switch-2-comparison-framerate-upgrade-2000635404</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-looks-hardly-any-different-running-on-switch-1-vs-switch-2.1324831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-round-up-switch-2-metacritic-2000635309"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> is coming to both new and old hardware, leaving fans with an important decision to make. Is it worth upgrading to play it on Switch 2, or will the old version handle well enough? According to one of the first comparison videos of the game running on both consoles, the differences are hardly noticeable outside of it running at 60fps on the newer hardware. That’s good for Switch 1 owners, but a bit underwhelming for those who’ve already bought a Switch 2.</p> <p>A new 15-minute video published on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H34ZUA-DD3M">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> shows a deep-dive comparison between both versions of the game. On Switch 1, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is capped at a resolution of 1080p and goes down as far as 800p in handheld mode. On Switch 2, it displays up to 2160p, and down to 1080p in handheld. By far the most meaningful difference is the 60fps perk for Switch 2 owners. Every other side-by-side comparison, however, looks pretty similar.</p>

  <p>The Switch 2 version appears to sport better shadows, textures, object draw distance, and density of vegetation and other details, but at least when viewed through captured footage uploaded to YouTube, the differences are pretty minor. On the one hand, that’s good news for everyone who will be playing <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> on the old hardware. On the other hand, it makes it that much harder to stomach the $10 upgrade for the game on Switch 2. The Pokémon Company is essentially charging for a 60fps mode within the new console’s first six months.</p>

 <p>“Before vs before,” joked one YouTube commenter. “From Water to H²O,” quipped another.</p> <p>New <em>Pokémon</em> games always get dragged through the ringer for their lack of graphical prowess as some fans pine for a major visual upgrade on par with the ones some franchises got with the previous Switch hardware. As a cross-gen game, it’s clear <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> isn’t going to provide that “next-gen-feeling” leap. At the very least, it seems like the Switch 1 version of the game is in better shape than <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> were at launch back in 2022. The video doesn’t show off any major glitches or framerate dips. Hopefully, that reflects the experience most players have when the game comes out on October 16.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Thing You Can Buy For Your Steam Deck Is A Kickstand]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-rog-ally-mini-pc-valve-asus-accessories-2000635411</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-thing-you-can-buy-for-your-steam-deck-is-a-kickstand.1324828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Regular Steam Deck users (and those who enjoy gaming on the variety of mini-PCs out there) are likely familiar with a certain physical sensation: wrist pain, tingling, and numbness. It’s not fun, and typically cuts your gaming short long before the battery gives out. These devices are just heavier and bulkier than the handhelds of yore, and even outweigh the Switch by a significant margin. But there’s a way to enjoy hours of gaming on them without that extra weight taking a toll on your wrists. If you don’t already have a kickstand, either by way of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-deckmate-valve-kickstand-portable-1849583263">something like a Deck Mate</a> or a case with a built-in stand, consider it one of the most essential investments you can make in your mini-PC gaming quality of life.</p> <p>It really doesn’t matter how strong you are. Muscling through signs of strain is a good way to give yourself pain and, even if you’re willing to grit your teeth and endure it, consider that powering through the pain is a great way to increase the likelihood that you’re going to accidentally drop your very expensive gaming device. As I’ve learned in Olympic weight training lately, doing unnecessary reps or spending too much time under tension decreases your potential to keep carrying something. That may seem obvious when we’re talking about carrying over a hundred pounds, but it’s not something that clicked so easily for me when it came to the Steam Deck.</p>

 <p>However, replaying <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</i> on Steam Deck recently made this glaringly obvious. As I sat there watching the game’s notoriously lengthy cutscenes, that familiar tingly sensation I often get in my wrists from prolonged Steam Deck sessions started kicking in, and I realized that given the length of the game, this would be a problem. That feeling is a prelude to pain and tens of minutes spent flexing out my wrists instead of gaming. It became obvious to me that, during these cutscenes, there was no good reason for me to be holding this device. I flipped out the stand on the JSAUX case that currently houses my Steam Deck (I have another one for the Ally X as well) and just put it down on the nearest table while I watched the remainder of the cutscene.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635414"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635414">© Image: Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s become common practice now when I’m playing on either the Steam Deck or Ally X. If I don’t need to be pressing buttons, the machine is resting on its stand–provided there’s a table somewhere nearby. I only rarely experience wrist pain as a result and have a far greater experience with the devices, especially since the stands keep the screen facing me, as opposed to just laying them flat. This small practice has also dramatically increased how much time I spend on Steam Deck.</p> <p>So however you get one on the back of your device, please save your wrists and put your machine on its stand whenever you don’t have to be actually holding the thing. You’ll thank me later, after many hours of blissful portable gaming.</p>

              <p><span>I wasn’t at New York Comic Con this year, but I could feel a wave of awkwardness reverberating from the Javits Center in my Brooklyn apartment like a disturbance in the Force. It wasn’t until videos of one of the most uncomfortable convention panels I’ve ever seen started circulating online that I knew the source of this sudden secondhand embarrassment. Participants in the Blumhouse panel, also known as Blumfest, talked a bit about the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fnaf-2-five-nights-freddys-2-movie-trailer-teaser-foxy-1851786887"><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s </span></i><span>sequel</span></a><span> before revealing that Megan Fox, of </span><i><span>Transformers </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Jennifer’s Body</span></i><span> fame, would be voicing Toy Chica, the evil animatronic bird, in the live-action follow-up. This was met with an underwhelming response from the crowd, and oof, it is a brutal watch.</span></p> <p><span>I have no stake in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddys-fnaf-2-movie-sequel-release-date-1851149677"><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</span></i></a><span> cast, but I do understand why Fox’s casting might not elicit an enthusiastic response from the crowd. Fox’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/megan-fox-mk1-voice-acting-nitara-mortal-kombat-1-1850853516"><span>voice acting in </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat 1 </span></i><span>was atrocious</span></a><span>, and it also wouldn’t surprise me if some of the </span><i><span>FNAF</span></i><span> fandom doesn’t have a strong association with her, given the series has a pretty young fanbase and the actor was most prominent in Hollywood well over a decade ago. But the crowd at the Comic Con panel could barely muster up a polite cheer. Instead, Fox’s announcement is met with some murmurs and a </span><i><span>few </span></i><span>claps, but mostly deafening silence.</span></p>   <p><span>The panelists try to hype up the announcement by saying her name, almost as if they fear people don’t recognize her from the photo alone, and then you can hear some people in the crowd laughing at how uncomfortable it is. Whether or not Fox actually pulls off the role remains to be seen, but the whole thing feels like a miscalculation of both the crowd’s enthusiasm and, perhaps, Fox’s cultural cache. </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s </span></i><span>fans are notoriously protective of its characters, so we’ll see how they react to her performance when the movie premieres on December 5.</span></p>

              <p>Odds are you’ve seen Drew Struzan’s work at some point. The artist and illustrator was responsible for some of the most iconic movie posters around. From <em>Star Wars</em> to <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, he elevated the promotional marketing format into a pop art form few have been able to match. He passed away earlier this week at the age of 78.</p> <p>His career started with album art for groups like <em>The Beach Boys</em> and<em>&nbsp;Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</em>, before he moved on to creating the airbrushed one-sheets for movies that would make him famous in the late ’70s. His wife <a href="https://www.facebook.com/drewstruzan/posts/1193923778759477">revealed earlier this year</a> that he was suffering from&nbsp;Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

 <p>“Drew made event art,” Steven Spielberg said in a statement (via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/drew-struzan-dead-star-wars-1236552587/"><em>Variety</em></a>). “His posters made many of our movies into destinations…and the memory of those movies and the age we were when we saw them always comes flashing back just by glancing at his iconic photorealistic imagery. In his own invented style, nobody drew like Drew.”</p>

His style collapsed photo-realistic portraiture into dense and dramatic compositions that married the deeply personal and the fantastical.</p>

 <p>His lasting influence on cover art of all types is immeasurable, including in video games. There are clear nods to his airbrush style and framing in the box art for the original <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/d30a1m/image_death_stranding_new_key_art_visual_by_pablo/">Death</a></em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/d30a1m/image_death_stranding_new_key_art_visual_by_pablo/"> Stranding</a>, and <em>Judas</em> director Ken Levine said Struzan’s work <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">was a direct inspiration</a> for the key art for the upcoming sci-fi immersive sim.</p>

 <p>“A giant among giants,” wrote DC’s Jim Lee in response to Struzan’s passing (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/drew-struzan-dies-movie-posters-1236400361/"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a>). “His work captured the humanity, power and emotion of his subjects in ways not seen since. Thank you for bringing to life all the tentpole moments of my childhood and beyond.”</p> <p>If you’ve visited a movie theater in the last decade, you can feel the shadow cast by Struzan’s absence on the lobby walls. Some of the posters are fine. Almost all of them are forgettable. Now with the rise of AI, Hollywood seems to have less of an appetite than ever for trying to treat its biggest releases with a human touch. Thanks to the streaming revolution, movies are no longer a destination, and Struzan’s art feels as much like a relic as the stuff in those crates at the end of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>.</p>

<p>Burnout fans will notice quite a few similarities with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wreckreation-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wreckreation</a> when they read the achievement list above. For example, Road Rage is a mode that originated in that series and involves you forcing the opposition to crash while speeding down the road.</p>



<p>Those similarities are not surprising, though, as the development team for Wreckreation, <a href="https://www.threefieldsentertainment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Three Fields Entertainment</a>, is made up of members from the original iteration of Criterion, who made the Burnout series that EA has completely forgotten about these days. They have developed Danger Zone and Dangerous Driving, which obviously have a lot of Burnout energy in them, and you see that even more now with Wreckreation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>If you are a fan of games like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls, you know it's in the lineage of those games to feature third-person and first-person viewpoints for gameplay. That's why fans were disappointed that The Outer Worlds didn't feature third-person gameplay when Obsidian Entertainment, which developed Fallout: New Vegas, a game that included a third-person camera, launched the game in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the studio has heard the fans, and you can expect not one, but two third-person viewpoints in The Outer Worlds 2 when it launches later this month. While that will be a fun way to see your customizable Earth Directorate hero in-game, this wasn't always planned to be a feature.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"We didn't intend to do third-person when we first started the game," game director Brandon Adler tells us. "We actually didn't start doing it until, really, maybe about two years ago or so."&nbsp;</p><p>Adler says he and The Outer Worlds 2 team at Obsidian were discussing a long list of things everyone wanted to add to the game. "You're like, 'It's too expensive for us to do some of these things; maybe on the next one," Adler says, noting the team isn't saying a third Outer Worlds game is in the works but rather, hypothetically, there's a list of things it might do in another crack at the series. "But again, about halfway through, we were like, 'I think people are really going to want this,' so we did an evaluation of how difficult it was going to be to implement it."&nbsp;</p><p>Obsidian ended up collaborating with a team called Disruptive to create a third-person camera system that integrates seamlessly within the gameplay and mechanical structure of The Outer Worlds 2. That includes animation, in-world interactions, FOV, and more. And you can see that third-person gameplay in action in the clip below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/09/30/the-outer-worlds-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story for The Outer Worlds 2</a> is available to read right now if you're a subscriber (and this issue is shipping to mailboxes as we speak).

<p>"It's closer to Call of Duty-tier numbers than any of EA's premium-shooter efforts so far. But the question now is whether or not EA can foster this successful launch into a platform that stands the test of time," Elliott said.</p><p>The report also had a breakdown of sales by platform, with Steam accounting for 65.7% of sales, driving 3.5 million copies sold and more than $220 million in revenue. Next behind was PS5, which accounted for 1.5 million copies and made up 23.7% of total sales, the report said. Xbox Series X|S ranked third overall, with 1.2 million units sold and a 19.6% share.</p><p>On Steam specifically, Battlefield 6 is putting up big numbers, reaching a peak concurrent player record of more than 747,000.

			<p>When Bethesda revealed and surprise-dropped The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, it was a cause of concern for at least two other game studios. One was Sandfall Interactive, which was understandably concerned about their debut game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, being overshadowed by the Oblivion Remaster. The other, as we now know from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-inside-story-of-how-oblivion-remastered-caused-immense-worry-then-sublime-relief-for-the-industrious-devs-behind-mod-megaproject-skyblivion">a new mini-documentary courtesy of Eurogamer</a>, was, even more understandably, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">the Skyblivion mod development team</a>.</p>



<p>And in both cases, the concern quickly faded to relief. In the case of Sandfall Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">the word-of-mouth around both games that week actually helped Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 commercially</a>. For Skyblivion, which is still in the works, it was a different kind of relief, the relief of knowing that Bethesda wasn't doing something that would actually get in their way.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>It was not set in stone whether it was a 'remake' or a 'remaster,' so we were concerned,</em>" said Dee Keyes, former world designer on Skyblivion and member of the development team. "<em>It was a huge relief because we realized, 'Oh, they're doing something completely different.</em>' <em>They're doing a faithful remaster, and we were going for something more remade from the ground up</em>."</p>



<p>Since the release of Oblivion Remastered, Bethesda has shown the Skyblivion team plenty of love and appreciation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">not only giving each of them codes for Oblivion Remastered</a> when it released, but later <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-shows-even-more-support-to-the-skyblivion-mod-team-hosts-them-at-rockville-headquarters/">inviting the team to Bethesda's headquarters in Rockville</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, the Skyblivion team <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/">confirmed that it is in the "<em>final stretch</em>" on the mod's development</a>, and also <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-first-15-minutes-shared-new-video/">shared the first 15 minutes of gameplay</a> that players will get to experience when the mod is finally ready and in their hands.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-shatterpoint-fall-2025-expansions-the-force-is-strong.1324756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Picture this: you're in the middle of a heated fight with your opponent. One wrong move could cost you the game. Who would you rather have by your side? A highly trained squad of Clone Troopers, scary fish men, Rogue One, or even Vader and Ashoka? All of this is made possible thanks to Star Wars: Shatterpoint's September 2025 expansion. Asmodee USA sent me review copies of the new line, so let's take a quick look!</p>

<h2>I Am No Jedi Duel Pack</h2>

<p>This set comes with Ashoka Tano, Fulcrum, and Darth Vader, Fallen Master. But let's focus on the first before jumping into Vader. Ashoka is a primary unit with a four-force cost, and it can only be paired up with other characters from the Age of Rebellion. Her kit is built around inflicting as much damage as possible to her opponents. This is further reflected in her abilities, which she can perform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_164243555.portrait.jpg?itok=3tDXI7EU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_164243555.portrait.jpg?itok=VhP8Sp1J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>She is no Jedi</figcaption></figure><p>Ahsoka has two reactives, one of which allows you to damage an opponent if they land misses during a melee attack, and the other lets her unit make a combat action as long as they're within the character's line of sight.&nbsp; That's all, without mentioning her Identity move, because whenever a unit is wounded, you'll automatically receive one force (if spent) and jump. In addition, if the attacking enemy is a primary or secondary unit, you'll also be able to make a five-dice melee attack with one character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_164508213.portrait.jpg?itok=2z1VJQGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_164508213.portrait.jpg?itok=LB9G7FjF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>She can pack a punch</figcaption></figure><p>So if you're looking for someone to dive headfirst into the heat of battle to offset an objective, Ahsoka is a perfect fit for your strike force. Even though we didn't dive too much into it, her defensive stance can max out at 5-8 damage, while her defensive stance maxes out at 6-7. Vader is a really interesting character for a couple of different reasons. He's classified as a secondary unit and can not be paired with Anakin Skywalker on the same strike team. But he can be used in the Reign of the Empire and Age of Rebellion era.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_163949145.portrait.jpg?itok=0qjEI8QK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_163949145.portrait.jpg?itok=LxQU2REi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Father of the year over here.</figcaption></figure><p>His kit is a bit different and is mainly meant for tactical uses. He's all about damaging himself or anyone in his unit, and in return, they'll be able to hold objectives, move up the board faster, or get the jump on their enemies. Being paired with Darth Vader, Fallen Master will give the unit the Protection, Steadfast, and Impact keywords. What's nice about Vader's attack tree is that it's only one-sided, but you can go about it in a couple of different ways thanks to its branching trees. If you really wanted to, you could do 8 damage in one swing if you roll well enough.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_164104126.portrait.jpg?itok=-nyIwSt0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_164104126.portrait.jpg?itok=OleqRBH5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The more you know!</figcaption></figure><p>What's nice about this box is that the keywords for both Vader and Ahsoka don't handicap one another. If anything, they work extremely well in a team, so if you're looking to match up this iconic duo again, you can easily do it and get decent results in return.</p>

<h2>Delta Squad, Form Up</h2>

<p>Star Wars: Republic Commando was one of my all-time favorite games growing up. So, needless to say, I was beyond excited when this set was announced. Thankfully, Delta squad plays on the table similarly to how they did in the game. By this, I mean fast and swift.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_165055492.portrait.jpg?itok=nwU_xFL9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_165055492.portrait.jpg?itok=T54YWQcY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Delta Squad!</figcaption></figure><p>&gt;Many of the abilities built around Delta Squad encourage you to play aggressively. What's nice is that Boss will get stronger after taking a couple of hits, and his tactic ability allows you to add an extra attack die to his role, and if someone in your team is wounded, you'll refresh two force points.&nbsp; At the start of his turn, if there are any Delta Squad members within range four of him, they can dash for free. What's nice about Boss, too, is that both of his stances can inflict significant damage regardless of the one you pick.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_165128405.portrait.jpg?itok=iP9cDJX8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_165128405.portrait.jpg?itok=xAsyExPl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Boss man!</figcaption></figure><p>Fixer plays a bit differently but similarly in a lot of ways, too. His tactical ability allows him to pick another allied Clone Trooper, and once selected, they'll be able to recover and dash. With this, you don't have to worry too much about leaving any characters exposed as long as he's on the board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_165646646.portrait.jpg?itok=gPxcJfuX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_165646646.portrait.jpg?itok=ia89G-pv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can he fix it?</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, his two reactives are built around buffing any Clone Troopers you may have in your army. Perhaps the deadliest thing about him is his Innate ability, which lets him control the objective if there's a tie. This ability alone has saved me in a few fights I would have lost, so don't be afraid to push up with him. His attack stats have two trees and have a max of 4-7 damage in one go. Last but not least, we have Sev and Scorch. These, too, are fairly straightforward; get them into a fight and have them back up whoever is on the objective. Many of their abilities are tied to pushing up towards enemies and buffing anyone with the Galactic Republic keyword. Their attack tree has two branches and can do 5-6 damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_165855019.portrait.jpg?itok=wQ81K7aw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_165855019.portrait.jpg?itok=T7c4K6ue 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at my boys!</figcaption></figure><p>This team is great because they're a high-damage team, and they encourage you to push the frontline. What's nice, too, is that they mainly work well with other Clone Troopers. So if you're looking to max out what they can do, stick them with fellow clones. Terror From Below The Terror From Below pack is a great way to spice up any Separatist strike team you may be building. Most of the team has a lot of keywords that work well with anyone in the Separatist Alliance. Let's look at Riff Tamson first, aka the primary unit of this team. He has two force points and can be paired up with anyone in the Fall of the Jedi era.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_170509662.portrait.jpg?itok=afXKTeNT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_170509662.portrait.jpg?itok=q2_VfobI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shark Wars?</figcaption></figure><p>Many of his abilities are built around moving across the board as quickly as possible and doing as much damage in one go. Even though his model doesn't show it, he has melee and range options for attack. His melee focus stance can inflict 8 damage, while his ranged stance can do 7-9 damage. But if we're being honest with ourselves, you'll want to ignore his range stance because many of his abilities are tied to melee combat. Even though Nossor Ri is a secondary unit, he takes on the role of a support one in many ways. Many of his abilities are tied to buffing those around him, and getting them up the board a lot quicker if they're part of the Separatist Alliance. He has a ranged and melee attack; in one go, he can max out anywhere between 4 and 6 damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_170758750.portrait-1_1.jpg?itok=kEvn9isW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_170758750.portrait-1_1.jpg?itok=SOiOQ1Br 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Squid Wars?</figcaption></figure><p>To finish things off, we have the Aqua Droids. If you're a fan of the Clone Wars era, it should be no surprise that these robots are all about damage. For starters, their activation ability allows them to dash and take a focus action right after, which alone makes them dangerous in any fight. In addition to that, they have the Impact 1 and Protection keywords. If you roll well enough, you can max out 5-6 damage. The only downside about this team is that they only work well with other Separatist Alliance characters. You won't get a lot of bang for your buck if they're paired up with another faction. The Miniatures &gt;Building the minis was pretty straightforward for most. Unfortunately, I faced a lot of issues when it came to the Terror From Below pack. A lot of the major headaches came from the Aqua Droids. The legs weren't fitting into place, and I had to get a bit creative when sticking them together. But if it wasn't for some super glue I had lying around, those legs would have never stuck together for both models.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_170844585.portrait.jpg?itok=u2WnEPCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_170844585.portrait.jpg?itok=R-hHM2Ic 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Building these robots took a while...</figcaption></figure><p>I wish that's where my issues ended. Because shortly after Nossor Ri was built, his trident broke off. It's worth pointing out that I've assembled my fair share of minis, so I know how to properly take care of them. But the second I glued them together, it fell off, and putting it back together was impossible. So when you're assembling this box in particular, be on the lookout for those issues. The Bottom Line This set of expansions is excellent because it caters \ to a lot of different fans. It doesn't necessarily trap you in one era or the other because of the range of strike teams that came out with this release. A lot of the keywords do work well with their respective faction. If you want to venture into one specific army, these boxes may be the ideal set to get you on your way.</p>

<p><strong>Get These Expansions If…</strong></p>

<ul><li>You're into the Fall of the Jedia Era</li>
	<li>Are a fan of Vader and Ahsoka</li>
</ul><p><strong>Avoid These Expansions If…</strong></p>

<ul><li>You don't have any Fall of the Jedia Era models</li>
	<li>Don't have any clone models</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gregg Mayles, one of Rare’s longest-serving workers and co-creator of Banjo-Kazooie, is resigning from the company.</p>



<p>The legacy of Rare in the 1990s is beyond incredible. From massive hits like Battletoads and Banjo-Kazooie to Goldeneye and Donkey Kong Country, there was no studio quite like them. After being bought by Microsoft/Xbox in 2002, the company’s track record went a bit low, with success being less and less. Unfortunately, despite Sea of Thieves’ reputation, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rares-everwild-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent cancellation of Everwild</a> has left many dejected, with its director and former creative director now jumping ship.</p>



<h2 id="h-gregg-mayles-co-creator-of-banjo-kazooie-resigns-from-rare-after-everwild-cancellation">Gregg Mayles, Co-Creator of Banjo-Kazooie, Resigns From Rare After Everwild Cancellation</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today was my last day at <a href="https://twitter.com/RareLtd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RareLtd</a>. Thanks to everyone who played and enjoyed any of the games I helped create while I was there. Also thanks to all the people that worked on the games alongside me. It seemed fitting that I should say farewell with one final rhyme! <a href="https://t.co/X54u8Bc2oI">pic.twitter.com/X54u8Bc2oI</a></p>— Gregg Mayles (@Ghoulyboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter/X</a>, Gregg Mayles announced his retirement from Rare. True to his form, his message is done in rhymes and can be seen above. For many, he crafted people’s childhoods in more ways than one. Mayles, as previously mentioned, co-created Banjo-Kazooie with his brother Steve Mayles at Rare. In addition, Mayles was responsible for designing games like Viva Pinata, Donkey Kong Country, Sea of Thieves, and Kinect Sports. He had also been Rare’s longest-serving worker, starting as a designer, director, and later studio creative director.</p>



<p>Sadly, his final piece of work would’ve been Rare’s Everwild, which he directed and designed. The title was canceled alongside Project Blackbird and Perfect Dark. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots of the game</a> emerged, giving us a glimpse as to what could’ve been. With many of the original talents of Rare gone, the studio’s future is a bit uncertain, so hopefully, good will come. Though, with fans hungry for a new Banjo-Kazooie title, the news isn’t the most favorable.</p>

Though the team doesn't have many specifics to share on that project as of now, I caught up with Barsamian to discuss the team's famous monster and his guest spots in other games this month.</p><p>With Fortnite's lighter tone and Call of Duty's emphasis on more mature themes, it's as though Jason were reimagined twice, with the towering killer giving fans two different sides of himself--and it's all wrapped up in the new Jason design helmed by Greg Nicotero of The Walking Dead fame.</p><p>Below you can read my interview with Barsamian on how the Jason Universe team worked with both teams to make Jason fit each world, how the new design came to be, and what's next for the slasher.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585043" data-ratio="0.52333333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585043"></a><figcaption>Jason is pulling double duty, arriving in Fortnite and Call of Duty for Halloween 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the Greg Nicotero-designed Jason, at first glance, he looks quite faithful to the Jason who has persisted as my mental image of him for decades. What were some of the creative decisions that steered his design, and are there any nuances we should look more closely for that maybe we miss at first glance?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We drew inspiration from more classic versions of Jason from the ‘80s movies when we started working with Greg Nicotero. Jason is a strong, towering (over 6’5”!), and terrifying human that is one of the most iconic villains of all time, and we wanted our new design to reflect those classic elements to honor the legacy, while simultaneously refreshing his look for a new era of stories.</p><p dir="ltr">We also reimagined the eyes on the mask to make Jason look even more menacing, while reducing the number of holes in the mask to 13 as a fun nod.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Debuting in Call of Duty and Fortnite makes sense given how massive and crossover-friendly those games are, but fans will notice two very different versions of the slasher, with Call of Duty's naturally being more violent and graphic and Fortnite's being a bit sillier (like his canoeing emote). How did the various people involved seek to capture Jason's essence in two similar but importantly different ways?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We are thrilled Jason is stepping into both the Call of Duty and Fortnite worlds for the first time ever this Halloween! Our fans have been asking for these collabs for quite some time, so we’re glad we could deliver during our 45th anniversary celebration year.</p><p dir="ltr">We wanted to give players the ultimate Jason experience in each world, so we worked with both teams to ensure he’s still Jason, with his classic physicality and movements—he’s towering and moves with intention--as well as his weapons like the machete and axe. But we also wanted him to be appropriately reimagined for these worlds, which means he uses a gun (which he never does in our movies) and has his exclusive tactical combat skin in Call of Duty, plus fun emotes, back bling, and an overall non-bloody design in Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">We hope players love playing as and against Jason in both games!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Voorhees is a horror icon for most generations alive today, but I wonder how much younger people know him since he's been out of the spotlight for some time. Do you have any sense of how big Jason is with the--let's call it the TikTok generation? These collabs are naturally going to introduce him to </strong><em><strong>some</strong></em><strong> players. So what do you hope they see in him?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Jason is a pop culture icon 45 years later and is recognized and beloved by generations. There are 5.5 BILLION views on TikTok of #Fridaythe13th and #F13 UGC videos, and 3.7 BILLION views of #JasonVoorhees UGC videos. The TikTok generation has come to love the same hockey-mask-wearing killer, just in different ways. For example, the 2017 Friday the 13th game had nearly 15 million players, and many of them found Jason for the first time through the game without ever having seen any of the original movies.</p><p dir="ltr">We hope the TikTok generation loves playing with Jason through these new crossovers and getting to know him better whether it’s through gaming, TV with Crystal Lake premiering on Peacock in the near future, movies, or immersive experiences like Halloween Horror Nights.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Does it feel difficult or strange to hand over Jason's usual aura in these games, where he will inevitably be seen doing things like silly dances and emotes? Is this something where you have to swallow your pride and not be so precious about the character, or is it easier now that players and creators have gotten so used to crossovers like this? Are you mentally prepared to see Jason wearing Jordans and singing Chappell Roan? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">We’re excited to see how players in both collabs make Jason their own. In terms of the base Jason design, we made sure to stay true to classic Jason elements, but we know players want to have fun--especially since it’s the first time Jason has entered into this sort of gaming environment. When Jason is in his own world and projects, we are of course committed to giving fans and players a more authentic experience centered around his Camp Crystal Lake legacy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585044" data-ratio="0.55886102847429" data-width="2353" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585044"></a><figcaption>In both games, Jason is one of several famous horror faces joining the fray.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>A good example of reimagining the character for the platform is Jason's tactical outfit in Call of Duty. What's the creative process look like when the Jason Universe team and Call of Duty team are going for such a specific crossover like that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We loved the tactical outfit from the initial sketch the COD team shared with us! We maintained Jason’s body and mask design and overlaid the tactical outfit along with the recolored mask. Adding the machete strapped to his back was a fun nod to classic Jason. Both teams were striving to keep Jason’s essence while considering what he would look like in a way that was more native to the COD world, and I think we nailed it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When designing gameplay elements like the Slasher mode in Call of Duty or presenting Jason as a boss NPC in Fortnite, what specific moments or movies did you look to for inspiration?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We didn’t look to specific moments or movies as much as we aimed to make sure Jason’s core essence was fully realized. Jason is such a force in the movies, so it was important that he truly feels like one in the games too. Both Slasher Deathmatch and the Jason boss NPC in Fortnite really convey that Jason is a force of nature, in a way that feels distinct and natural to the gameplay of each title.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I was 14 when I excitedly went to the midnight showing of Freddy vs. Jason, and it was probably the coolest thing I'd ever seen to that point in my life as a huge horror fan. Nowadays, Fortnite and Call of Duty sort of offer a version of horror mashups in every match, with Jason joining so many other crossovers from Hollywood's slashers and monsters. What are your thoughts on seeing fans bring them together in this way?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">That’s awesome to hear! As you mention, Jason obviously has that history of crossing paths with a character like Freddy, but they do operate in the shared realm or genre of horror and slashers. These new collabs open things up so much more, allowing Jason to interact with characters in ways that would never happen in an official setting like a movie, giving fans of all backgrounds a way to live out their dreams. So, personally, I think it’s great!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A lot of Jason Voorhees fans are eager for him to get his own game again. Do you have any updates to provide there?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We want that, too. Jason will be back in his own game. Stay tuned!</p>

		<p>SpaceCraft will not be entering early access this year, Shiro Games has announced, pushing back the release to Q2 2026. However, Shiro Games has announced that there will be a playtest for SpaceCraft taking place and it will be starting at the end of October. However, there are some restrictions such as there only being EU servers, limited space, English translation only, and it will not represent the early access version of the game. However, the playtest will be continuous and new content will be added. The roadmap for SpaceCraft’s playtest can be seen below.</p>



<p>Shiro Games has confirmed it has been able to implement a much requested feature for SpaceCraft, and that feature is cockpit view when piloting ships. The studio did issue an apology for delaying SpaceCraft’s early access saying,<em>“In order to fit the playtest in our development schedule, the Early Access release window has been moved to Q2 2026. We understand this news might be disappointing to some of you, and for that we would like to apologise. The playtest is a crucial part in our process of developing a high quality experience and we could not prepare for a successful Early Access launch without incorporating player feedback beforehand.”</em></p>
<p>In SpaceCraft, players will have the option to forge their own path in the galaxy, but that does not seem to be the way for long term success. Shiro Games has stated that connections between players is the real key, building up organisations and factions called Corpos, to dominate the emerging economy and becoming new military powers too. Players will be able to build orbital and land based bases that will grow as more housing and resource centres are added. Searching and securing resources will be necessary to keep things running and growing.</p>

              <p><span>A year after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the first one</span></a><span>, a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>new leak of documents and production concepts</span></a><span> has hit Game Freak and the contents are spreading across social media. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer has several upcoming games in the works, including a Generation X game, a </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game set in Galar, and an MMO-style game that lets players explore multiple regions. But the leak isn’t just about the games that are on the way. We also learned a few interesting tidbits about older games and the inner workings of the company. While they may not be as exciting as “Generation X games will feature procedurally generated worlds,” here are a few takeaways.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b><i>Scarlet</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Violet</i></b><b>‘s DLC cost as much to make as a full game</b></h2> <p><span>I was pretty lukewarm on both of </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s DLC expansions, but the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679"><i><span>Indigo Disk</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-dlc-review-ogerpon-1850839564"><i><span>Teal Mask</span></i></a><span> were such big projects that they ended up </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139"><span>costing as much as </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>‘ entire budget</span></a><span>. According </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977994754085253581"><span>to the leaks</span></a><span>, the add-ons sold around 6.15 million copies in the first 10 months, compared to the base </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s 27 million in sales. </span><i><span>Arceus, </span></i><span>meanwhile, moved roughly twice what the DLC did (14 million copies) at a higher price point, so Game Freak is looking to scale back budgets for its DLC packs to make the business model more sustainable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Development Budgets:</p> <p>– SV DLC: 500 million yen<br>– Legends 2/ZA: 2 billion yen<br>– Winds/Waves: 3 billion yen</p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977779651352133635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another interesting fact about </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s DLC is that while the final product ended up taking place in Kitkami and the Blueberry Academy in Unova (</span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>), the original plan was to set them in Kalos (</span><i><span>X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>) and Alola (</span><i><span>Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>).</span></p>

The 2019 Switch games introduced a new battle gimmick called Dynamaxing that allows players to temporarily transform their monsters into powerful kaijus under certain conditions. Every Pokémon could use this technique, but a select few were able to take on new forms entirely, called Gigantamax forms, once they grew to the size of a skyscraper. One of the original 151 Pokémon, the poison-type monster Nidoking, was at some point in development going to have one of these forms. He would have sported a red crown and beard, as well as a cape on his back. It would have really leaned into the “king” part of the Pokémon’s name, but it was scrapped. It’s unknown if its female counterpart, Nidoqueen, would have also received a similar form.</span></p>

Some design motifs survived the iteration process, such as each member having a float/vehicle they pilot that caters to their different aesthetics, but overall, it seems like Team Star would have had a much different role if this version of the group had survived. One member has a biker/monster truck theme, another has a Wailmer-run boat, and there’s also a cunty-ass car being held up by several Togekiss.

              <p>Of the many updates <i>No Man’s Sky</i> has received over the years, few have <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428">transformed the game</a> in the same way as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674">recently released Voyagers update</a>. Arriving toward the end of last summer, the update allows players to construct ships on a scale never seen before in the game, complete with fully traversable interiors. It led to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">wild original builds and recreations</a> of ships from legendary sci-fi franchises. Now, as spotted on Reddit recently, one player is looking to top them all with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1o683xa/someone_built_a_deathstar/">intimidating Death Star</a>.</p>   <p>Reddit user Even-Ad648 caught sight of the ominous orb of planet-destroying death in a <i>NMS</i> multiplayer game. And though it technically looks a bit smaller than the “real” thing would be, it’s nonetheless an impressive and grim-looking spectacle.</p>

 <p>Though you can create some impressive flying machines with <i>NMS</i>’ corvettes, this Death Star clearly uses some glitching to scale to the size of an in-world space station. And, according to Even-Ad648, the game crashed once they got too close. So I guess that rules out any death-defying close runs to exploit a structural vulnerability.</p> <p>Folks have made attempts to build Death Stars before. Some have struggled a bit to perfectly match the <a href="https://x.com/tuyosi723_pilot/status/1977671635256971341">spherical dimensions of the original</a>, but <a href="https://x.com/NoMansZine/status/1976211868017676486">others have made some decent efforts</a>. Still, there’s something eerie about that one in the Reddit vid. Fly safe out there, ya’ll.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/">Midnight</a>, is taking the nuclear option when it comes to eliminating combat add-ons, after years of Blizzard discussing how they posed problems for the health of the game. It's a bold approach, but, unfortunately, one that has been communicated incredibly poorly and seems to be taking unnecessary risks that could potentially make the game worse, not better, in the short term.</p><p dir="ltr">Until the recent arrival of Midnight's alpha build, it wasn't exactly clear how far-reaching Blizzard's approach would be. While non-combat add-ons (WoW's version of player-made mods) aren't being touched, it was known some major changes would be coming to how combat add-ons work in Midnight. Those changes would come in conjunction with Blizzard introducing its own version of popular add-on functions, like boss timers and damage meters, alongside improvements to recently implemented features like the cooldown manager and combat assistant. Blizzard also said it's designing combat encounters going forward so that (hopefully) combat add-ons wouldn't be as necessary as before.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiIjThwKLaE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SiIjThwKLaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That all sounded great on paper. Many assumed some of these changes would come over time, allowing for a period where both add-ons and Blizzard's own UI updates could work in conjunction or until certain parts of the base-game UI meant to replicate add-on functionality was ready. Blizzard has instead opted to rip off the proverbial band-aid.</p><p dir="ltr">In the Midnight alpha, nearly every piece of combat information is rendered invisible to add-ons and thus can't be computed or read to give players more information. That includes things as simple as how much health a player or enemy has, what abilities enemies are using, reading chat messages during combat, or whether there's a puddle of fire on the ground you should probably move out of. Combat add-ons may still work technically come Midnight, but they will require a ton of tweaks by creators and their functionality will likely be so much worse than the game's base UI (much of which still needs improvement) that there won't be much use for them.</p><p dir="ltr">The result has blindsided combat add-on developers and left them scrambling. The folks behind one of WoW's longest-running and most-popular add-ons, WeakAuras, have stated that unless Blizzard makes major changes to its approach, they won't be making a version for Midnight. In a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/weakauras-x-140349416?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link" rel="nofollow ">statement</a>, the WeakAuras team said Blizzard downplayed the scope and timing of its add-on approach in past statements, and that the current approach "does not leave us with much choice other than closing shop." Meanwhile, the creators of Deadly Boss Mods, WoW's most-popular add-on that has been downloaded more than 571 million times according to Curse Forge, have <a href="https://x.com/deadlybossmods?lang=en" rel="nofollow ">stated</a> the add-on isn't going anywhere but will be changing alongside WoW itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I'll just say it upfront: I don't like combat add-ons. I've played WoW for nearly two decades, and in that time I've always viewed them as a necessary evil. Whereas some players love spending hours making their own custom UIs and enabling WeakAuras to track their buffs and cooldowns, I've largely opted to instead stick with the default UI, finding the entire add-on process tedious.</p><p dir="ltr">A large part of this is because despite having played for the better part of 20 years, I have no real interest (or time) to participate in high-level Mythic+ dungeons or Mythic raiding, and thus have never viewed combat add-ons as essential as many top players do. I've also just never been a fan of the idea that I have to go to a third-party site and download something like Deadly Boss Mods, which up until this point has basically been viewed as mandatory for even casual WoW players, in order to play the game properly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584912"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is overhauling WoW's old Blood Elf zones as part of Midnight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Combat add-ons have always offered a major advantage to those who opted to use them compared to those who don't. This has always been a failure on Blizzard's part for allowing the add-on arms race between mod creators and the development team to go on for as long as it has. The same is true for designing WoW in a way that such add-ons felt like they had become necessary due to players not having all the information they needed to be successful.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard eliminating the need for combat add-ons is undoubtedly a good thing for WoW's long-term health, and something I'm not particularly upset about. I believe there are plenty of others who feel the same way. When combined with Blizzard's built-in UI updates and proposed changes to make combat more streamlined, WoW will soon be more approachable than ever before. It could also pave the way for WoW to be ported to consoles, exposing even more players to Blizzard's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/">genre-defining MMORPG</a>. All of that is good.</p><p dir="ltr">There's only one issue: Blizzard's entire approach. By gutting combat add-ons immediately upon the start of Midnight, Blizzard is backing itself into an unnecessary corner. All of Blizzard's plans revolve around it actually being able to deliver all these features in time for the expansion's launch. If it can't replace all that add-on functionality on day-one, players are left with a worse version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are some features that are already ready from primetime, like the new nameplates, boss alerts, and the cooldown manager, there's plenty still missing. Damage meters and updated raid frames are huge pieces of the puzzle that aren't available for testing, and it's unclear when they will be. Raid frames in particular are huge for healers, who often use raid frame add-ons like VuhDo in order to be able to track their outgoing heals, priority debuffs, and more. Raid frame add-ons will still exist come Midnight, but they won't be able to track combat data as they currently do, a huge nerf to healers.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard does plan to offer some solutions here, but it's unlikely Blizzard's in-game versions will be as robust, customizable, or feature-rich as what many add-on users are accustomed to. That applies to just about every add-on Blizzard is looking to replace. Many of these add-ons have been updated and improved for over a decade. It's unreasonable to assume that Blizzard's versions will be at that same level right out the gate, assuming they are there at launch at all.</p><p dir="ltr">The success of Blizzard's plan also depends on its own encounter design. Until we see more of what Midnight's top-end raid boss encounters look like, it's impossible to say whether Blizzard has designed an endgame with no combat add-ons needed. WoW's Mythic difficulty encounters have been designed in a certain way for years, facilitating the need for combat add-ons in the first place. Having all that change in a single expansion requires a lot of trust in Blizzard to stick the landing, and I don't think players can be blamed for not entirely believing in its ability to execute.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584914" data-ratio="0.56238244514107" data-width="1595" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584914"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is aiming to design Midnight's endgame to not require combat add-ons in order to succeed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for those unforeseen consequences I mentioned earlier, Blizzard's all-or-nothing approach is unfairly cruel to one particular portion of the WoW community: disabled players. These players can make extensive use of combat add-ons in order to play WoW, whether casually or at a high-level, as is the case with <a href="https://undauntedguild.com/about-us/" rel="nofollow ">Undaunted</a>, a well-known competitive WoW raiding guild for deaf and hard-of-hearing players. In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ny1lg7/accessibility_impact_of_the_recent_addon_changes/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a>, Undaunted guild leader Saormash wrote an extensive breakdown of just how damaging losing "20 years of accessibility" is to the game's disabled community. Saormash said WoW has long been a leader when it comes to gaming accessibility thanks to the game's community of add-on creators. If Blizzard doesn't walk back some of its approach, that's due to all be tossed out the window.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will be completely locked out of progression due to something that is completely beyond our control," Saormash said. "In the past, we could turn to add-on and WeakAura creators for help. Without that benefit, we may see less tolerance from the raiding community for disabled players. Nobody will want to have their raid progress stalled by one person's inability to successfully pass a mechanic check."</p><p dir="ltr">Without the extensive ability to customize and tweak combat add-ons to meet their needs, these players will be left in the dust come Midnight without many new features being added to the game. Blizzard's UI design team simply cannot compete with the thousands of add-on creators who have created tools and solutions for players of all sorts for decades. As Saormash explained, despite the game's disabled community being the most negatively affected by the combat add-on apocalypse, it feels "unseen and unheard" by not being given the opportunity to provide direct feedback to Blizzard. It's unclear how long it will take Blizzard to implement the kinds of changes and features currently filled by WeakAuras and other add-ons that make the game playable for WoW's disabled community. Any answer longer than "immediately at launch" just isn't acceptable and reason alone to pump the brakes on this entire combat add-on crusade.</p><p dir="ltr">There is, at least, some indication Blizzard is listening. It's already walked back some combat add-on restrictions based on feedback. In a recent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-director-admits-its-too-hard-without-combat-mods-and-explains-how-bosses-will-change-in-midnight-were-not-looking-to-turn-all-our-raid-encounters-into-giant-puzzles-for-people-to-solve/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> interview, WoW senior game director Ion Hazzikostas said it has now invited members of Undaunted into the Midnight testing program to receive their feedback, and that "accessibility remains a top focus for the team." Midnight also won't be launching until sometime in early 2026, giving Blizzard, at minimum, three or so months to listen, respond, and iterate on its plans. I have no doubt bigger changes to what is and isn't allowed in terms of combat add-ons will be coming in the weeks and months ahead, as well as more details about what players can expect from the game's updated raid frames and other UI improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">None of that, however, changes the fact that these are all problems entirely of Blizzard's own making. Not only were Blizzard's intentions and plans poorly communicated, but its choice to take the all-or-nothing approach to combat add-ons, without more closely involving the game's community beforehand, has resulted in confusion and frustration from some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's overall goal here is admirable, and one that many players will likely agree with. Fast forward one, two, or five years and WoW might be the best it's ever been, with no need for combat add-ons, approachable endgame encounters, and all the accessibility features it needs to serve its community. But Blizzard is putting the cart before the horse. That future, idyllic version of WoW is not now, and given how Blizzard has handled this entire situation thus far, it might not be here in time for Midnight's launch either.</p>

                <p>One of the year's best indie games, Blue Prince, is getting an official <strong>physical PS5 release on November 21</strong>. Until now, it was only available digitally on consoles and PC, but fans can now preorder this new PS5-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blue Prince physical edition</a> for just $35 at Amazon. While the digital version of the game is also available on Xbox Series X and PC, PS5 is the only confirmed physical version--which isn't surprising, since that seems to be the case with most physical indie game releases these days. Along with the base game, physical copies will include an exclusive poster. Preordering also gets you a digital version of the game's soundtrack. It's probably wise to grab an early copy soon if you're interested--preorders for the Blue Prince PS5 edition initially went live about a month ago, and the first wave quickly sold out, so there's a chance this could disappear again soon.</p><h2>Blue Prince Physical Edition Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584983" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584983"></a><figcaption>Blue Prince preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg"></figure><p>Preordering Blue Prince physical edition gets you the Blue Prince: Day One Edition, which includes an exclusive download code for a digital copy of the game's official soundtrack.</p><div title="6535406 - Blue Prince Physical Edition" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4687" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535406 - Blue Prince Physical Edition" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Blue Prince (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$35 | Releases November 21</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Blue Prince PS5 release includes the full game on disc and an 18 x 12 inch fold-out poster featuring Mount Holly Manor, plus the digital soundtrack if you preorder the Day One Edition.
