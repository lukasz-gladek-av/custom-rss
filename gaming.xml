			<p>A new The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 4K texture pack is now available for download, further enhancing the game's visuals for those playing the game on PC via a Nintendo Switch emulator.</p>



<p>The texture pack, whose 1.0 version was released a few days back on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/legendofzeldatearsofthekingdom/mods/161">Nexus Mods</a> after being in early access beta state for a while, upgrades all of the game's textures to 4K resolution, including terrain textures. Compared to the previous version of the texture pack, the 1.0 version also includes some texture additions and memory optimizations, as well as some fixes for glitched textures in shrines. As such, this version of the texture pack should be the most stable yet, allowing players to experience the latest entry in the series like never before. You can check out this The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 4K texture pack before downloading in action in the video below released alongside the very first version of the modded textures last year.</p>

<p>Although PC players will continue to be able to experience The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at its best for the foreseeable future, Nintendo Switch 2 owners can also enjoy the latest entries in the series with plenty of enhancements thanks to the upgraded versions released alongside the system earlier this year. Besides visuals and performance enhancements, the Nintendo Switch 2 versions of both games come with the Zelda Notes feature, which is a great addition to the experience, as Nathan highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on/">piece</a>.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. Learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">review.</a></p>

              <p><strong>Amazon’s Labor Day sales have officially launched</strong>&nbsp;and some of the best offers are not on everyday essentials but on real tech upgrades. That’s exactly the case with the <strong>Samsung 9100 Pro 4TB SSD</strong>, which only went on sale a few months prior for $550. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3720/">Now it has dropped to as little as $372 (37% off)</a> which is an all time low for a brand new item. Samsung’s smaller 1TB and 2TB versions are seeing price drops as well right now but they come with less dramatic dives.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3720/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4.8 Out of 5 Stars Rating</h2>
<p>This is a <strong>PCIe 5.0 drive</strong>&nbsp;which means you’re effectively stepping into the latest generation of storage technology. On paper, it can push sequential read speeds up to <strong>14,800 MB/s and write speeds of around 13,400 MB/s</strong> (double the Samsung’s legendary 990 Pro). Launching games, opening massive video projects or crunching through workloads tied to AI applications and content creation happens almost instantly.</p>
<p>What’s equally impressive are the random read and write numbers as it can reach up to 2,200K and 2,600K IOPS. Sounds like computer lingo, but what it really translates to is seamless multitasking with a whole lot less waiting. <strong>Edit 4K or 8K footage, train AI models</strong> or load intense workstation applications: this drive maintains your system responsiveness even at high load. Gamers benefit too with incredibly fast in-game loading and virtually zero stutter while streaming assets in-game.</p>



<p>There’s a<strong> fresh 5nm controller inside which cuts power consumption by nearly 50% compared to the 990 Pro</strong>&nbsp;and that’s gigantic for laptops that sit through long sessions and desktops trying to keep temperatures under control. There’s <strong>integrated advanced thermal management</strong> which prevents overheating and throttling even when you’re hammering the drive with constant workloads.</p>
<p>On the software side, Samsung continues to support its drives with its <em>Magician</em> software suite which updates firmware automatically, contains helpful drive health monitoring and offers extra layers of encryption for workstations that deal with sensitive information.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting for a reason to jump into PCIe 5.0 speed, this Labor Day is the perfect time.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot will appear in court in October in relation to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-on-ubisoft-reveals-more-shocking-sexual-harassment-allegations">sexual harassment allegations that emerged back in 2020</a> against a number of employees.
</p>
<p>
Back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-senior-ubisoft-staff-convicted-in-french-harassment-case-receive-fines-and-suspended-sentences">three former senior Ubisoft employees received suspended prison sentences and fines</a> after being found guilty of harassment. All three employees left the company in 2020 as part of a wave of resignations and dismissals.
</p>
<p>
However, as reported by French outlet <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/affaire-de-harcelement-chez-ubisoft-le-pdg-yves-guillemot-convoque-devant-la-justice_AN-202508220570.html">BFM TV</a>, a subpoena has been issued against Guillemot in relation to this case, meaning he'll have to appear before the Bobigny court (Seine-Saint-Denis) on 1st October.
</p>
<p>
The summons for Guillemot was filed by the Solidaires Informatiques union and four individuals, "the same civil parties" as in the previous trial resolved in June.
</p>
<p>
Following an investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office, no criminal proceedings will be held against Ubisoft or its management, which was confirmed during the closing arguments at the hearing in June.
</p>
<p>
"Our top priority is to ensure the absolute protection of the physical and moral integrity of its employees, through a policy of prevention and zero tolerance with regard to sexual or moral harassment, sexist behavior, assault, insult, or discrimination of any kind," said Cecile Russeil, executive vice president of Ubisoft.
</p><p>
A union representative from Solidaires Informatiques has confirmed the summons was sent last month, but Guillemot was absent and his family refused to take his place. HR director Marie Derain and Ubisoft as a legal entity have also been summoned.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, following reports of harassment at the studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-weeks-of-devastating-sexual-harassment-allegations-ubisoft-boss-yves-guillemot-is-asked-how-much-he-knew">Guillemot was asked how much he knew of the issues taking place</a>. "It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and did not live up to Ubisoft's shared values," he said. "I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will. I will continue to run and transform Ubisoft to face today's and tomorrow's challenges."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s been a veritable smorgasbord of roguelite games over the last few years, so many that the release of yet another entry in the cram-packed genre elicits plenty of yawns and little excitement. Well, stifle your sleepy exhalation, as The Rogue Prince of Persia – a roguelite imbued with the thrilling free-running platforming that Ubisoft’s best franchise is famous for – is worth getting excited about.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deep Dive Trailer - The Rogue Prince of Persia" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0jWFjABmW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Huns have only gone and invaded Persia, which, quite frankly, is proving problematic for the Prince and his allies. As not only are the Huns formidable warriors in their own right, but they also possess potent dark magic. At the start of the game, the Prince faces off against their despicable leader, Nogai, but is quickly killed off. Thankfully, the Prince possesses a magical amulet that restores him to life and, as a Brucey bonus, partially rewinds time, to just after our hero was first killed. And so, with the death loop cycle of the roguelite established, the Prince sets off on a fateful quest to vanquish the Hun menace before they destroy all of Persia.</p>


<p>He’ll do this by wall-running, leaping, backflipping, rolling, and tumbling through a series of 2D levels, stylishly taking down henchman before defeating a series of ultra-hard bosses. Visually this is a sumptuous treat, with gorgeous evocative environments and accompanying background art. The cartoon-like characters are equally pretty, with fluid, smooth, seamless animation, which effortlessly brings to mind the iconic rotoscoping of the original Prince of Persia game. The graphics are tied up with a lovely Bande dessinée comic-style ribbon, ensuring that the Rogue Prince of Persia is one of the most beautiful 2D games released in recent memory.</p>


<p>Platforming is precise and fluid, just as it should be in a Prince of Persia game. As the Prince continues to free-run he accelerates, until he’s barrelling through the level like a particularly acrobatic freight train. Speed-runners are going to have a blast with this, but even us regular mortals can enjoy a silly grin slapped on our face as we hurtle past buzz saws, spike traps, and hordes of enemies with such agility even Sonic would be jealous. Being able to climb up the background is a genius touch, enabling developers Evil Empire to construct levels with impressive ingenuity. Indeed, I haven’t quite experienced anything like this in my 2D platformers before. What I really appreciated though, is how the Prince reacts very quickly if he hits a trap. Sure, you’ll still take damage, but you can rabidly recover and continue your wall run or flip away from danger, preventing the frustration that would occur if being struck with a trap was an insta-kill situation.</p>
<p>Combat is just as brilliant, with the Prince using his dexterity to counterattack an impressively varied array of Huns. With a backflip that apes the one seen in the classic game Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, the Prince can nimbly strike his foes from behind for increased damage, before darting away to prevent their superior numbers and strength from overwhelming him. It’s thrilling best-in-class stuff.</p>

<p>This being a roguelite, exploring each level rewards the Prince with numerous temporary buffs, from powerful new weapons to special ability granting medallions. Of course, you never know what the randomness of each run will grant you, but I always found that I had a decent chance of progressing, even with one of the naffer builds. Collecting magical gunk from defeated Huns provides permanent stat boosts, additional weapons, medallions and access to upgrades.</p>
<p>Progress initially comes thick and fast, with early runs always providing something new. Whether that’s allies to rescue – who will return to your homebase to take on the role of merchants and talking heads – or new gameplay mechanics to uncover. I also must applaud Evil Empire from attempting to vary up the repletion of the roguelite genre by providing additional side quests, providing you with motivation for the necessary task of constantly revisiting levels. This takes the from of a ‘mind palace’ in which the Prince can discover clues to various mysteries – from finding secret paths between levels to rescuing family members and discovering the Hun’s diabolic plans – and progress further through the game’s story, even whilst frequently dying.</p>

<p>Having said that, if you’ve bounced off the roguelite genre before, you won’t be won over here. Sooner or later, and with inexorable inevitability, the tedium of running through the same levels again and again sets in. Sure, you’ll complete them quicker, faster and with increasingly effortless athleticism, but you’ll still have to get through early levels like the village, aqueduct, and the Hun’s headquarters far more times than is enjoyable. &nbsp;Additional foes only do so much in alleviating the boredom. Still, if you adore the rinse and repeat elements of the roguelite genre, then The Rogue Prince of Persia is an essential purchase. For me? I’d love it if the stand-out game making skills of Evil Empire could next be applied to a more conventional platformer, one without the roguelite trappings.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-iphone-16-charger-costs-4x-less-than-at-apple-amazon-clears-out-stock-for-labor-day-2000620287</link>

              <p>If you’ve ever found yourself scratching your head wondering why you’re shelling out so much money just to have your iPhone charged, this deal will be a bargain. On Apple’s website, <strong>a simple vanilla 20W charger sells for $19</strong> – and that only comes with one block, not the cable.</p>
<p>Great news, you can currently purchase not one but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">two Anker 20W USB-C charger blocks and corresponding cables on Amazon for the low price of $11</a>. That’s under six bucks apiece, the very same low price we did last Black Friday and Prime Day but with a Labor Day flavor. No wonder this two-pack is the <strong>#1 best-seller in Amazon’s entire charger section</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed and Safe Charging</h2>
<p>These are <strong>20W USB-C (and USB-A) charging blocks</strong> that are meant to charge in a hurry. The virtue of rapid charging is that you’re not wasting so much time alongside a power outlet, and with these, you can <strong>recharge your iPhone 16 or 15 series battery up to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong>. If you’ve been stuck using those older 5W chargers, the difference is night and day. Anker has tuned its PowerIQ technology to keep speeds consistent while staying safe for your battery.</p>
<p>Since this set comes with <strong>two chargers and two matching USB-C to Lightning cables</strong>, it’s ready to cover multiple needs at once. You can have a person sleep by your bedside, the other in your bag or at the office desk so that you’ll get rid of those annoying frustrating minutes of <em>“where did I place my only charger?”</em> The braided build of the cables also renders them more resilient than what you’d otherwise receive in the package.</p>



<p>Compatibility isn’t something to fret about either. Just because the purchase is marketed for iPhone 16 and 15 devices doesn’t signify that exact <strong>20W PD (Power Delivery) output won’t perform with iPads, AirPods, and even some Android models or smaller USB-C devices</strong>.</p>
<p>You’re getting Apple Store quality at less than a third of the unit cost, with the added advantage that Anker actually includes the cables, something that Apple charges extra for. Deals such as these won’t stay on the shelves long when they hit this record-low price, make sure you don’t miss the opportunity on Amazon.</p>

            <p>The next character in Riot Games' upcoming 2v2 fighting game - 2XKO - has been leaked on <a href="https://support-2xko.riotgames.com/hc/en-us">the official Riot Games support website</a>. We're going to say who they are in following paragraphs, heads up.</p>
<p>Art for the Blitzcrank was spotted by keen-eyed fans early this morning for the 2XKO, front and centre as both the the star of the banner at the top of the dedicated 2XKO page, as well as the character used on the 2XKO widget when browsing the wider Riot Games support website.</p>
<p>As of writing the art is still live on the support website. Blitzcrank would be the ninth character to come to 2XKO, though no word on when he'll be implemented has been announced, officially or otherwise.</p>

<p>2XKO is set to launch into closed beta on 9th September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/was-riot-games-fighting-game-2xko-revealed-too-early-interview">marking the end of a lengthy development journey</a>. In recent months, online sentiment around the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-interview-eight-characters-enough-launch-roster">has been tinged somewhat due to a demand for a wider variety of weirder characters</a>. Blitzcrank, a big goofy robot, certainly fits the freakier category.</p><div>

<p>There's a hint of irony here, given one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>' most legendary support champions being revealed early via the support website. As for when we'll see Blitzcrank revealed properly? Well, one would hope that with official Riot Games websites locked and loaded with official assets, it could be around the corner, but that's entirely speculation. Who knows, maybe he'll be a surprise addition to the closed beta?</p>

<figure><a title="Hitman 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6e22fe7852fe/hitman-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: IO Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p>IO Interactive has launched a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The key improvement here is the game's frame rate, which at launch failed to maintain its 60fps target at frequent intervals. The patch adds in a 'Frame Rate' option to stabilise the performance, and this will be turned on by default, which perhaps just goes to show how terrible it was before.</p>
<p>There are a few other notable improvements regarding performance and lighting, alongside a particularly concerning issue in which the game would sometimes crash when loading auto saves.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3ljumnt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Hitman's performance woes at launch meant that it only managed to score <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">7/10 in our review</a>, despite showcasing the franchise's excellent open-ended gameplay and stunning level design.</p>
<p>IO Interactive is also hard at work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, a brand-new James Bond title confirmed for launch on the Switch 2 in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve heard what we think of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-the-final-preview">from an expert point of view</a>. But what if you’ve never played a Ninja Gaiden game before? Will this latest entry in the notoriously difficult action series offer newcomers something they can get to grips with? Will the story make sense if you don’t know your Ryu Hayabusas from your Yakumos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was my angle of attack going into my gamescom 2025 session with Team Ninja's Masakazu Hirayama and PlatinumGames' Yuji Nakao, co-directors on this eye-catching new co-production from Xbox Game Studios. As Nakao expertly dispatched a boss on a big screen overlooking our behind closed doors presentation, I couldn’t help but marvel at the slick, fast-paced ninja action I was seeing. But I also felt intimidated. I’m no stranger to action games; I love Capcom’s Devil May Cry series, for example, but I know Ninja Gaiden operates on a whole other level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also know that Microsoft, which is publishing Ninja Gaiden 4, hopes that that this latest entry appeals not just to hardcore fans of the franchise, but to the wider action game fanbase. That it will, essentially, convince the likes of me to give it a shot. And so my line of questioning is probably a little different compared to what you’ve already seen from the illustrious Ninja Gaiden experts IGN has on-staff. Read on to find out how Team Ninja and PlatinumGames convinced this worrisome action game fan to give Ninja Gaiden 4 a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'm a newcomer to the series. For people who have never played a Ninja Gaiden game before but have perhaps heard about it by reputation as a very difficult action game, will they be able to get some enjoyment out of this, or is this very much aimed at people who are veterans of the series who know how to play?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masakazu Hirayama:</strong> So with Ninja Gaiden 4, first and foremost we wanted to stay true to the tradition of intense combat. But with that said, it has been quite a while since the last mainline Ninja Gaiden came out, and we also want to make sure that a wide audience can approach our game and enjoy it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So to that end, we've prepared not only difficulty options, but other features for those new players. In terms of difficulty settings, there is a mode called Hero Mode. So when you choose Hero Mode, it'll automatically enable a number of assists. So these assists include Auto Guard, Auto Dodge, and another assist that allow you to perform more complicated actions, moves more easily. And these individual assists, once you select Hero Mode, you're not stuck with the assist. You can actually go into the menu at any time and toggle them on and off individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you start out in Hero Mode and then you feel like, oh, I want to start dodging manually now instead of having automatic dodge, you can go to the menu and toggle it off and see how you fare. But not only that, the difficulty settings themselves in your first play through, you can freely change between hero mode, normal mode, and hard mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for example, you start your game on hero mode with all the assists. After you beat the first chapter, you turn off the assists, and then after you beat the next chapter, you feel like you've developed as a player and it's getting too easy. You can go to the menu, change to normal, and then after that, if you feel like you need more of a challenge, you can go back and change it to hard, and then you can adjust it on the fly. So you can really curate your combat experience based on your progression as a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for newcomers who may feel like this game might be too difficult for them, I want to assure them that the tools are available for them to train themselves and allow them to progress as a player and enjoy that core intensity of the combat while also providing that tools to allow them to progress through the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And for newcomers who aren't familiar with Ninja Gaiden but are perhaps familiar with the action game genre, what sets Ninja Garden apart? What are its signature mechanics that other games in the genre perhaps don't have?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yuji Nakao:</strong> Ninja Gaiden is a series that has been developed by Team Ninja up until now. One of the main characteristics that sets apart Ninja Gaiden from other action games is just that feeling you get when you're gripping the controller in the sense of precision and responsiveness. Ninja Garden has an intricate feeling of control, but at the same time it's elegant and precise, and that's what really sets it apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And since this is a collaborative effort — it's not just Team Ninja, it’s PlatinumGames that’s developing the game — PlatinumGames has injected their own flavor into Ninja Gaiden 4. And that's best represented in the Bloodraven form, which is the main new system in Ninja Gaiden 4, where Yakumo can unleash these over the top, really expressive attacks. Ninja Gaiden 4 fuses that over the top expression with that elegant precision of a Ninja Gaiden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: On the story, this is Ninja Gaiden 4, so newcomers will be aware this will be the fourth mainline game in the series. Do you feel that newcomers will be able to understand the story without having played the previous games in the series, or would they benefit from catching up? And how does the story differ from what's gone before? What do you hope to achieve with the story this time around?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> New players can rest assured that they can just jump into Ninja Gaiden 4 and enjoy the story from the jump. It's not directly connected to the prior games. The world and the setting is the same, but the story itself stands alone. So as long as you know that Ryu Hayabusa is the badass ninja, then you're good to go with Ninja Gaiden 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You mentioned previously that it's been some time since the last mainline Ninja Gaiden game. What have you been able to achieve with this game that was impossible before that makes use of all the new technology that has been created since then? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakao:</strong> In prior Ninja Gaidens you weren't able to seamlessly switch your weapons on the fly. With the new technology and the new hardware that's available, we're actually able to realize that, which really opens up the possibilities in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then another point is how violence is depicted. So Ninja Gaiden 4, as well as other prior Ninja Gaidens, when you dismember an enemy and you cut into them and there's blood splatters, we were really able to amp that up in Ninja Gaiden 4 and provide an even more elevated sense of satisfaction and catharsis when you are devastating your enemies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 4: June 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’re collaborating with Platinum this time for Ninja Gaiden 4. What made Platinum the perfect choice? What is it that they bring to the table that's unique that no other developer perhaps could?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masakazu Hirayama:</strong> PlatinumGames, they have a lot of accomplishments in the action game genre, and they're really known for their expressive stylish action. So with Ninja Gaiden 4, because it's a collaborative effort, we really wanted to allow PlatinumGames to bring that to the table in development. And we previously touched on Bloodraven form — we think Bloodraven form is the best representation of how we were able to incorporate it. But not just incorporate it for the sake of adding new things, really incorporating it into the foundation of Ninja Gaiden, so it doesn't just exist on top of it, but it exists within it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why was now the right time to make a new Ninja Gaiden mainline entry? How will Ninja Gaiden 4 expand the audience for Ninja Gaiden as a whole so it is more popular than it has been in the past?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> In terms of the timing of bringing a new Ninja Gaiden into the world, it wasn't necessarily that we wanted this to happen right now. It was more the result of a series of events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Team Ninja we had wanted to make a new Ninja Gaiden for quite a long time. And when that opportunity started to present itself, there was a conversation that took place between the president of Koei Tecmo, Hisashi Koinuma, and the president of PlatinumGames, Atsushi Inaba. They're actually friends, and they were talking about, wouldn't it be great if we could work on something in the future? That's when the idea of creating a new Ninja Gaiden together came up. And then Phil Spencer from Xbox caught wind of this idea and just threw his support behind the project. That's what got it off the ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like you said, it's been a long time since the last Ninja Gaiden game. To the end of providing a fresh entry point for new players, we introduced a new protagonist. This protagonist was a proposal from PlatinumGames, actually. And I think we were able to allow PlatinumGames to really incorporate their own take on Ninja Gaiden through Yakumo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, Ryu Hayabusa is the icon of the series, so we've also made sure that Ryu Hayabusa is playable and has a strong presence in the game as well. So I think through this collaborative effort we've been able to provide a fresh experience, but it still feels like Ninja Gaiden, and it will be a fresh entry point for new players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why did you accept the proposal for a new protagonist from PlatinumGames, and what exactly is it about this new character that sets him apart from Ryu Hayabusa?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> In terms of the reason why we accepted Platinum's proposal to bring a new protagonist, it was really what I touched upon earlier: providing that fresh entry point for new players, but also because this is a collaborative effort, really allowing PlatinumGames to bring their own ideas to the table. And Yakumo was a vehicle to allow that to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakao:</strong> So with Ryu Hayabusa, he really retains his distinct qualities from the prior games. In Ninja Gaiden 4, he's really all about that power and that sense of speed. So when you're playing as Ryu Hayabusa in Ninja Gaiden 4, you can really experience that raw, primitive Ninja Gaiden experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contrasting with Ryu, Yakumo has this savviness. There's a cleverness to the way he fights with his arsenal, and he also has those more expressive combat techniques through the Bloodraven<strong> </strong>form. And through that he has this stylish take of the Ninja Gaiden combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So even though they both share the Ninja Gaiden fundamentals, there's this very distinct difference that you will feel when you are picking up the controller and pressing the buttons and seeing how they respond to those inputs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And what is the split in terms of play time, roughly? Is there one character we will spend more time with than the other?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> In terms of the story, Yakumo is the protagonist, so the playtime split, Yakumo will have more playtime. So more than half of the story you'll be playing as Yakumo. With that said, there are dedicated segments in the story for Ryu. And you won't be playing as Ryu Hayabusa just for a short time and then you'll be done with it. There'll be a very robust amount of content for you to enjoy playing as Ryu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And once you complete the story once, you'll actually unlock a chapter challenge mode. This will allow you to freely play different chapters in the game and you'll be able to play as either character. So you could, after your first playthrough, play through all the chapters as Ryu. Conversely, you could play Ryu’s story chapters as Yakumo. So there's a lot of content that you can enjoy after you do your first playthrough.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’d love to know your favorite new mechanic we’ve not seen in a Ninja Gaiden game before.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> My favorite new aspect is the Bloodraven form. So Bloodraven form, it really captures the new kind of expressiveness that PlatinumGames has brought to the table in Ninja Gaiden. But not only that, there was a lot of back and forth with regards to Bloodraven form throughout the development of this game. So Team Ninja would get the build from Platinum and then play the game and provide their feedback. But a year ago Bloodraven form was just so OP, like as long as you activated Bloodraven form, you could really just defeat any enemy. And we were looking at it as like, well if Bloodraven form dominates everything, we're going to lose the Ninja Gaiden essence. And there was a lot of interesting back and forth that we went through to arrive where we're at today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll see that when we were incorporating Bloodraven form into the Ninja Guide game cycle. For example, when you use Bloodraven form and you attack an enemy, it'll increase the likelihood of doing a dismemberment. When you dismember an enemy in Ninja Gaiden, you can perform an Obliteration Technique. Obliteration Technique is basically just a finisher, like an execution style attack. And then once you execute an enemy, they'll drop a blood orb essence. Essence was in previous Ninja Gaidens, and it basically functions the same way in Ninja Gaiden 4. And then once that essence drops, you convert it into an Ultimate Technique using Ultimate Guidance. I know I’m throwing a lot of terminology at you! But we were able to bring this Bloodraven form into Ninja Gaiden and really incorporate it into that foundational Ninja Gaiden game cycle. Finding ways of exploring that was very interesting from a development perspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakao:</strong> In addition to the Bloodraven form, there's also the base form. Within the base form I feel like we've been able to evolve Ninja Gaiden in terms of the new type of techniques that are available. Ninja Gaiden 4 introduces Just Guards and Just Dodges. In Ninja Gaiden, the dodging move is called the Reverse Wind. In Ninja Gaiden 4 you can actually do a Just Dodge Reverse Wind. And this really opens up the variety and possibilities of Ninja Gaiden’s combat and serves to continue to evolve that high speed back and forth between offense and defense that really makes Ninja Gaiden distinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> And building on the new possibilities that are available in Ninja Gaiden 4, sometimes you'll see enemies glow up in red when they're about to unleash a powerful attack. You can actually use Bloodraven form to counter that attack using an offensive ability. This especially becomes apparent in the boss battles, where you can not just be defensive, but you can actually use aggression to counter enemy attacks. And because of that, Ninja Gaiden 4’s boss battles especially feel very distinct and provide a new kind of intensity compared to our previous entries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 launches on October 21 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, the first proper new entry in the series in over 8 years, already made 2025 a great year for fans of kart racers, those looking for a slightly more traditional approach to the genre have Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to look forward to. Appearances, however, can be very deceiving, as this more traditional approach is only the tip of the iceberg for a game that manages to combine spectacle with a tight balanced combination of different mechanics that not only make the game a joy to play, but also one that can be enjoyed to the fullest by players of all skill levels.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last week, I was able to try out Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for around 30 minutes, which, right from the onset, looked like they wouldn't be enough to truly understand the depth of the many options on offer, ranging from a massive character roster featuring a lot of characters taken from series besides the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise such as Steve and Alex from Minecraft, Spongebob and Patric, Pac-Man and the Ghosts, Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban Kasuga from the Like a Dragon series, the vehicle selection and customization options, which ranged from cosmetic to performance options, and a perks system which provided further depth. Having little time to check everything out, I simply picked out Sonic and the first vehicle that provided a balanced performance, a basic set of perks, which included the ability to store an additional item during a race, and went to race in one of the available cups, which comprised four different tracks.</p>



<div><p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is setting out to be an excellent kart racer balancing accessibility with depth</p></div>



<p>Up until this point, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds looked as traditional as a kart racer could get, and the first lap through the first track only reinforced this feeling. As soon as the second lap through the first colorful track ended, however, the new entry in the series showed how unique the experience is setting out to be. Instead of continuing on the same track, the player in first place has the chance to pick between two other tracks, which adds an incredible element of unpredictability to a race. In the blink of an eye, every player is seamlessly transported to a new track with its own set of gimmicks, which made each of the four tracks included in the cup exhilarating to play. With the final lap being set in the original track, however, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has everything in place to be accessible to every sort of player, even those who are only looking for some casual fun, casual fun that is easy to have in the game also thanks to some rather tight racing mechanics which feel great even if one were to ignore drifting, the vast item selection and the customization and perk systems outlined above.</p>



<p>Having only the time to play through a single cup, my time with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was somewhat short, but the little taste of the experience I had was more than enough to make me hunger for more and see for myself how all of these advanced mechanics will come together at higher difficulties and in online play. Thankfully, it won't be long for anyone to have a taste of the experience, as an open beta will be held later this week on August 29 ahead of the game's release on September 25 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, with a Switch 2 version to follow later in the year. One thing, however, already seems to be certain. Sonic Team managed to create a great kart racer with a solid balance between accessibility and depth that is sure to please all sorts of players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Cosy games are in right now and one new announcement looks like a very pleasant and comfortable experience, with that game being Tony The Mole. Tony The Mole is an adventure game in which you play as Tony, a mole that helps the people he comes across while wearing a variety of hats. While this is his main goal, he will be helping the people of Pebblegrove with their requests.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tony The Mole Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkNzrnQTAkQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, Tony gets around the world by tunnelling underground to get past obstacles like fences, and he can also climb upwards though has limited stamina when doing so. The gameplay consists of exploring different areas, platforming and collecting items to complete tasks. There is also some interaction with the people of Pebblesgrove as they give requests and some advice to Tony too. Tony also has the ability to sniff out things like hidden areas, earthworms, and secret treasures that are not in plain sight. The earthworms give Tony upgrades to increase his stamina so he can climb walls for longer, allowing him to scale new heights.</p>

<p>A huge blow for Capcom</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Lightspeed Japan" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/996cc2a85ec6e/lightspeed-japan.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>From left: Bingo Morihashi, Hideaki Itsuno, and Daigo Ikeno — <em>Image: Lightspeed Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lightspeed Japan Studio, a subsidiary of the Tencent-owned company Lightspeed Studios, has announced a key expansion with the opening of a new office in Osaka.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Hideaki Itsuno – who perhaps most famously spearheaded the development of the <strong>Devil May Cry</strong> series following his introduction as a replacement director for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry_2">DMC2</a> – Lightspeed Japan Studio has also made three new significant hires.</p>
<p>All three are Capcom veterans. The first is narrative designer Toshihiro Nakagawa (Bingo Morihashi), who has previously worked closely with Itsuno in creating scenarios for the Devil May Cry franchise. The second is Daigo Ikeno, an illustrator famed for his work on the <strong>Street Fighter</strong> series (most notably <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/street_fighter_iii_3rd_strike_fight_for_the_future">3rd Strike</a>). Ikeno also made significant contributions to Devil May Cry as a character artist.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tgzmqj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Finally, illustrator 'Gouda Cheese' (who might be better known as 'Bengus') has also been hired. 'Cheese' has contributed to a number of high-profile fighting titles, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/super_street_fighter_ii">Super Street Fighter II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/darkstalkers_the_night_warriors">Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors</a>, and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/marvel_vs_capcom_2_new_age_of_heroes">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a>.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Japan Studio is currently hard at work on creating a 'cross-platform' AAA action game. It's still early days yet, so no details have been shared as to what it might entail, but we think it's safe to say that it will be quite similar in design to the likes of Devil May Cry and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in the months and years ahead, Capcom can't be pleased at the loss of three key veterans. Nakagawa, Ikeno, and 'Cheese' have made some truly invaluable contributions to the success of the company, and we'll be keen to see what they all come up with over at Lightspeed Japan Studio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FPS weapon skins is always a divisive topic. Call of Duty’s reputation as a serious military shooter has been increasingly questioned in recent years due to its outlandish camos and Operator skins. Battlefield 6 appears to be curbing this zaniness, and the new BF6 weapon skin leaks suggest this.</p>



<p>Adding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-adding-beavis-butt-head-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis and Butt-Head to Black Ops 6</a> jumped the shark for many CoD fans. The franchise has incorporated anime characters and larger-than-life Kaiju characters such as Godzilla in recent years. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-cod-next-2025-schedule-where-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> fans are becoming disillusioned with the series’ lack of seriousness and self-awareness, and this seems to be something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/this-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6-fans-react-to-black-ops-7-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> is trying to steer away from.</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-a-look-at-battlefield-6-weapon-skins">Here’s a Look at Battlefield 6 Weapon Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No floating dragons here, yet. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 devs have already hinted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-dev-hints-that-game-wont-have-unrealistic-skins-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF6 won’t have unrealistic skins and cosmetics</a>. EA and Battlefield Studios <em>seem </em>to know what the people want.</p>



<p>A new leak from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a> reveals many Battlefield 6 weapon camos. Honestly, they’re quite normal, and it’s refreshing!</p>



<p>We’ve seen hundreds of camos from FPS games over the years. You’ve likely seen or equipped these skins if you play FPS games like CoD regularly. The Battlefield 6 camo leak shows an assortment of leafy woodland camos, minimalistic makeovers, more artistic and complex designs, and some that resemble classic Call of Duty Digital and Blue Tiger colors.</p>



<div><article><p><span>LEAK: Here are some of the Weapon Camos coming to Battlefield 6

W or L?</span></p></article></div>



<p>This is a leak at the end of the day. Don’t be surprised if some of these don’t make it to the final game. They could be subject to change, as we don’t know at which stage of development these leaked designs come from. So keep this in mind before you start dreaming about your favorite camo.</p>



<p>Are you hoping and praying that Battlefield 6 keeps it on the straight and narrow and doesn’t start throwing in lucrative tie-ins left, right, and center?

            <p>
Demonschool, the forthcoming RPG Eurogamer described as "Persona meets Buffy", has been delayed once again due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">surprise release of Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-inspired-demonschool-gets-release-window-following-last-years-delay">originally intended for a release last year</a>, but was delayed until 3rd September this year. Now it's moved back to 19th November thanks to "brutal" market conditions.
</p>
<p>
The decision appears to have been made by publisher Ysbryd Games. "With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025 on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game," it wrote in a statement on social media. "Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."

<p>
Visibility is of prime importance for the publisher; as such "we would not be doing our game any favours by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red". Instead, it wants to allow Silksong to have its moment, and for Demonschool to follow.
</p><p>
The publisher has also confirmed there will be no more delays after this. Until release, more time will be spent polishing and enhancing the game experience, with more endings and minigames originally planned for a post-release patch to be included at launch.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-racing-crossworlds-preview-%E2%80%93-teaming-up-in-the-race-park.1280430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sonic is heading back to the race track this September, giving himself the handicap of having to drive a race car to compete with a wide set of opponents, with a new dimension-hopping twist for both the races and the full game roster. But racing doesn’t always have to be so straight forward, and we went hands on with Sonic Racing: Crossworlds at Gamescom to check out the new Race Park modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds | Competition Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nIhfo2X0oI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout this latest hands on, the arcade kart racing was completely on show. The handling is tight and snappy, the drifting is more sideways, and as you pull tricks while grabbing some airtime off a ramp, the car will flip in any and every direction with wild abandon. It’s got that oft touted Sega style to it, and you could absolutely imagine this game appearing on arcade cabinets…. if those were still really a thing.</p>


<p>Taking a half step away from the main Grand Prix racing, Race Park provides a bunch of additional team-based modes, to go alongside the core racing experience. Playable online or offline with challenge bots to face off against, you do still have a standard 12-character race mode available to you, but there’s also the option to have that with all items at their highest power, if you want races to be more chaotic.</p>


<p>What’s more interesting is having the lobby split down into two teams of six or three teams of four, each then with various additional objectives and goals. Your team’s score is a combination of points for finishing position and how well you do at those additional goals – in a Eurovision style, the final total sees the racing score added first before the objective score is lumped on top to, quite possibly, flip the result around.</p>
<p>For the three team modes, Ring Grab is the more straight forward, as you do your best to follow the strings of coins laid out through the stage and gather as many as you can, but Tap Boost is sure to be much trickier, as your prime bonus and task here is actually to race closely with your teammates, bumping into them to give you speed boosts and hopefully propel you to the front together. On the two team side of things, you then have Shoot Out to push the combat angle a bit further, and Dash where you need to hit as many boost pads and boost rings as possible. You can also fiddle with these modes even further, if you want, with the ability to create custom ruleset beyond what’s on offer by default.</p>

<p>While dipping into these various modes at Gamescom, we also got to play some newly revealed tracks, and one of these really, truly stood out to me. The standard form of a Crossworlds race will see you do one lap around the chosen track before passing through a portal to an alternate world for the second –&nbsp;the choice of this is handed to the first placed racer –&nbsp;before returning to the original track in a somewhat ramped up form.</p>
<p>This was most obvious to me in the Wonder Museum track, racing through a history museum with countless exhibits for the first lap, but with a grin spreading across my face when returning for the third lap to discover everything had come to life, Night at the Museum style. It’s a really fun track, and I hope there’s plenty more inventive gems to find throughout the rest of the game.</p>

<p>The other surprising element will be the depth of customisation offered by the Gadget Plate, giving you modifier gadgets to slot into place to boost or tweak everything from speed and acceleration, to item counts, how boosting works, item types and more. You can save these in loadouts, so you have quick access to a time trial build, a team mode build, something for different racers and karts, and on. It’s an aspect that we’ve really only had the lightest touch on, but has potential for the full game.</p>
<p>Is Sonic Racing Crossworlds going to be able to shine as brightly as a certain plumber’s karting escapades? You’d doubt it, but I certainly appreciate how different it looks and feels. This game is trying to put its own stamp on the genre, the visuals are right out of the classic blue sky Sega arcade game style, the racing is fast and snappy, and the customisation potential for the Gadget Plate is crazily broad. Adding various twists and spins on the core racing is just the icing on the Sonic-shaped cake.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem to happen as often as it used to, but physical copies of games can still occasionally be sent out too early, and players get games several days ahead of launch. This is exactly what’s happened with Lost Soul Aside, and you should be on alert for spoilers, according to the game’s social media team.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a> continues the recent trend of pure action games instead of the relentless march toward Soulslike supremacy. The new ARPG is in the same vein as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, and if you’re excited for it, you might want to watch out for spoilers.</p>



<h2 id="h-lost-soul-aside-spoilers-could-be-out-there">Lost Soul Aside Spoilers Could be Out There</h2>

<p>Lost Soul Aside doesn’t officially release until August 29. This applies to digital editions and physical launches. However, unlike digital copies, it’s harder to keep a lid on physical pre-orders. Retailers can send out orders early, for example.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/Lost_Soul_Aside" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X account</a> for Lost Soul Aside has become aware of this very act happening: “It has been brought to our attention that some people may have gotten their hands on physical copies of Lost Soul Aside. Please do not spoil the game online, out of respect for each other!”</p>



<p>People are always keen to be first to everything. You can bet that YouTube is probably already filled with Lost Soul Aside videos and walkthroughs for content that’s not supposed to be seen by the public eye yet. I won’t check, as I also don’t want the game to be spoiled for me!</p>



<p>I advise you to block and avoid all mentions of ‘Lost Soul Aide’ on social media until the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonys-lost-soul-aside-release-date-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>It has been brought to our attention that some people may have gotten their hands on physical copies of Lost Soul Aside.

<p>How do you avoid spoilers for upcoming games? Or are you not bothered and are quite happy to get the early leaks before launch? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f46311a19f74/bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts are in, and with no major releases in the last week, the top ten looks pretty familiar. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mafia_the_old_country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has taken a bit of a tumble to land at number 7, which means that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> both sit pretty at the top of the pile.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> has also seen a healthy boost in numbers, taking it all the way from number 29 up to number 10. Most sales were for the PS5 version, taking in a total of 58% of the platform split, but combined together, Switch and Switch 2 managed a reasonable 34%.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036jiymqw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuEn0ZOn5c" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>It's a similar story for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, which re-entered the charts at number 14. Although the PS5 achieved the most sales again for a single platform at 43%, Switch and Switch 2 combined made up 47%.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> launches later this week, so we'll see how that affects things next time. We're honestly not expecting gangbuster sales, but it would be nice to see it sat alongside Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>Well, it happened again: the Maw devoured a Monday. My recent, highly suspicious news article about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-a-uk-bank-holiday-please-talk-amongst-yourselves">a sudden "bank holiday"</a> was, of course, a hasty PR smokescreen to avert a stock market crash. In Horace's name, we have now forced the Maw to sick up the missing Monday, but locating the gag reflex of a cosmic monster has its risks, and there have been a few casualties.</p>
<p>Mark has theoretically been "on holiday" since last Wednesday, returning tomorrow, but that's another piece of disinfo - he's actually stranded somewhere in the Cretaceous period. James, meanwhile, has come down with a case of the Schrödingers, neither away at Gamescom nor back at his desk. I am going to email him shortly - fingers crossed the quantum binary collapses in a way conducive to preview write-ups. As for this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/new-pc-games">new PC games</a> - here you are. I've included the regurgitated Monday, but please handle with care as it's still rather radioactive and, er, talkative.

<p>As always, let us know if there's any must-plays we've missed. My plans for this week include making sense of a big, tangly interview-driven feature and maybe writing something about liminality that would secretly be a love letter to a particular videogame level. Providing the superposition resolves in our favour, I imagine James will be Jamescomming it up with sundry impressions articles and interviewage. Assuming he overcomes the giant Venus flytraps and makes it past the Ankylosauri to the time portal, Mark should be on regular news and possibly a review. I seem to remember him bagsying something in the spreadsheet before he disappeared into the vortex. What are you up to this week?</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 is hurtling into a long-awaited Xbox release, which comes alongside a huge collaboration with fan-favorite Microsoft title Halo. If you can’t wait to get your hands on the ODST Legendary Warbond, we’ve got all the details for your countdown.</p>



<p>Announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-collab-with-halo-odst-lands-with-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this month</a>, the ODST crossover with Helldivers 2 comes amid a big turning point in the game with the introduction of Xbox players, who can enjoy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay with PlayStation and PC players</a>.</p>



<p>For all the details on exactly when the new Legendary Warbond releases, look no further than our guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-release-date-amp-start-times">Helldivers 2 Halo ODST Warbond Release Date &amp; Start Times</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dropping in hot. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Helldivers 2 x Halo ODST Warbond releases on August 26, with an official start time of 5am PT.</strong></p>



<p>The start time coincides with the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox, a seismic moment as it marks the first time a Sony title has made the jump to the rival platform. Naturally, that big move has been celebrated in style with the special Halo ODST Warbond, revealed by the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>.</p>



<p>For those in America, the Warbond will be available early in the morning, while those elsewhere in the world will have to wait until later in the day to jump in.</p>



<p>We’ve created the table below for easier viewing, which shows start times for the Legendary Warbond in Helldivers 2 in various time zones.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-in-the-helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond">What to Expect in the Helldivers 2 Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</h2>



<p><strong>The Halo ODST Legendary Warbond in Helldivers 2 features a host of Halo ODST-related cosmetics, including armor sets and patterns, along with four new weapons.</strong></p>



<p>Of the content, the weapons are perhaps the most exciting bit of kit launched, as they bring the world of Halo into Helldivers 2 in style, featuring some of the most popular and well-known guns from the Halo franchise. The MA5C Assault Rifle, M7S SMG, M90A Shotgun, and M6C Pistol are all being added.</p>



<p>Armor-wise, the A-9 Helljumper and A-35 Recon are being added, along with another smaller cosmetic items like player banners, titles, and capes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve played </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-previews-sonic-resident-evil-play-days-1851784271"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a> <span>twice now, and both times, I had the same fleeting thought: “What if </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span> outruns </span><i><span>Mario Kart </span></i><span>and has the better kart racer this year?” </span><i><span>Mario Kart World </span></i><span>is pretty good. It is a really solid One of Those, and it will no doubt be a mainstay in the Switch 2’s long lifetime–but it plays things safe, has several frustrating things going on under the hood, and by God, 24 players is too damn many.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>After playing about a dozen hours of </span><i><span>World </span></i><span>with friends since the Switch 2 launched in June, playing </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>for even an hour was refreshing, as it feels like Sega is not only taking some cool risks to shake up the formula, but also making calculated choices that rein in chaos and allow for more strategic racing.</span></p> <p><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ biggest shake-up is the introduction of the Gadget Panel, which is essentially an overhaul of </span><i><span>Team Sonic Racing</span></i><span>’s Bonus Box system. Before each race, you can use your panel to create a loadout of upgrades, usable items, and stat boosts to fit your playstyle. Some upgrades take up more space than others on your panel. My typical arsenal included the option to start each race with a monster truck transformation item that gives you a significant speed boost and also lets you trample over enemies in your path. Having something like that takes up multiple slots on your panel, but it’s an excellent way to get a head start at the beginning of a race.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While that’s a one-and-done boost, a lot of the upgrades help you throughout a race, such as performing speed boosting air tricks faster, making your drift a little smoother, or offensive-based upgrades like giving yourself a boost every time you collide with an enemy kart. You can race in cars or the Extreme Gear hoverboards, which will define your playstyle, but your Gadget Panel lets you fine-tune it into something unique and personalized. I use the monster truck at the beginning of the race, but after I’ve gotten my head start, I want to make sure I have a smooth ride as I pass the rest of these slowpokes, so I use the rest of my panel to make my drifts faster and get a speed boost when I bump into others.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds | Competition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nIhfo2X0oI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Having all those spinning plates on screen at once would overwhelm </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>if it had taken </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s 24-player races as a challenge. However, </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>maintains a 12-player limit on its races, and after all the </span><i><span>World </span></i><span>I’d been playing, it’s become pretty clear to me that this is the sweet spot.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, having 24 players on a track at once is a good technical showcase for the Switch 2 and feeds into the usual “bigger = better” mentality that permeates through most video games, but it has also turned out to be one of </span><i><span>World</span></i><span>’s biggest frustrations. By design, if there are more racers on a track, the slightest setback will inherently give more players a chance to pass by you. One well-timed blue shell can send a first-place winner back a dozen placements with not enough time or resources to regain the lead. So much of </span><i><span>Mario Kart </span></i><span>is determined by the luck of the draw. If you get the right item, you can Bullet Bill your way to the front of the pack, but you might get something less useful. </span><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </span></i><span>has the same item-based play, but its Gadget loadouts leave your playstyle less to chance, and its 12-player races mean that the slightest misstep isn’t punished by being tossed down the rankings into an oblivion you can’t drive out of. It adds fun complexities without becoming chaotic and convoluted to the point where only the sweatiest among us can reach first place.</span></p> <p><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> is doing a lot of things right, and in light of a relatively lukewarm reception for its biggest competitor, </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>are potentially on an even playing field, and the blue blur could come out on top for the first time in a while. I may not be thrilled with the crossover slop this time around, but I’m eager to get on my board as Shadow when </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>launches on September 25.</span></p>

I got the chance to play the kart racer for a second time recently, and my opinion of the game is largely unchanged from my verdict during Summer Game Fest: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-drops-the-best-aspects-of-its-predecessors/1100-6532469/">It's dropping the best aspects of its predecessors</a> to become something closer to Mario Kart. This second session, I spent a little more time with the game, getting a chance to race on additional tracks and play as the previously unavailable Hatsune Miku and Ichiban Kasuga.</p><p dir="ltr">CrossWorlds sees you jump into a kart or onto a hoverboard and compete against several other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonic-racing-crossworlds-every-character-announced-so-far/2900-6920/" data-ref-id="2900-6920">racers from Sega's catalog of Sonic characters</a> (plus a few guests from other franchises!). Each race across the 24 different tracks is three laps, with the second taking place in an entirely different world after the racers teleport through a travel ring. Whichever competitor is in the lead as the racers approach the second lap chooses which world everyone hops over to, with two options given at random from a total pool of 15 other worlds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 8 Minutes of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's an interesting gimmick, best seen in the Grand Prix mode that was the focus of both the SGF preview and my latest hands-on. In that mode, you're awarded a number of points depending on your place, which are added up at the end of a series of races to determine the ultimate winner. Each Grand Prix is four races, with the fourth and final race taking place across the three previous tracks--the first lap is on the track from the first race, the second lap is on the track of the second race, and so on.</p><p dir="ltr">As was the case at SGF, I crushed the computer-controlled competitors handily on the hardest available difficulty (there is one that's even harder, but it has not been available in either preview). As fun as it is to win, it's been hard to enjoy the game without the challenge of needing to try. I still believe that challenge will come when given the chance to play with other humans, but until then, CrossWorlds feels lacking compared to what came before.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556068-sonic2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556068" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556068-sonic2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556068"></a><figcaption>Anyone else miss Sonic Riders?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556068-sonic2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game borrows mechanics and features from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-sonic-racing/" data-ref-id="5000-482784">Team Sonic Racing</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders/" data-ref-id="5000-25205">Sonic Riders</a>, but lacks the teamwork-oriented relay racing of the former or fuel management and character abilities of the latter. Those aspects made Team Sonic Racing and Sonic Riders distinct enough from Mario Kart to give them more identity, and also make them more challenging--it was rewarding to win at those games and I remember playing them (especially Riders) for hours upon hours and wanting to push myself to get better. I haven't gotten that sensation from CrossWorlds yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Like all of the other characters, Hatsune and Ichiban have their own stats that affect the minutiae of play--making slight adjustments to how each kart handles in a race. It must be very slight though, as I didn't notice any discernible difference between them, nor any change from my time with Jet the Hawk and Amy Rose at SGF. Changing up the plate loadout of the kart is a far more noticeable adjustment. I tinkered around with the kart plate system--which allows you to create several established loadouts to change how your kart behaves--a little more this time around, creating plates that let me start off with the monster truck transformation so I could run over everyone from the very start, or draft off others more easily and overtake the competition by stealing their rings, or spin like an unstoppable top while drifting to bash other racers and build extra speed boost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556069-sonic3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556069" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556069-sonic3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556069"></a><figcaption>With 24 tracks and 15 other worlds to explore, you'll see plenty of strange sights throughout the race.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556069-sonic3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">These plate builds are fun and zany, and I wish they had a bigger impact on my performance to encourage me to spend more time tinkering in the shop. But I won with them all and I didn't really have to adjust my strategy for how I raced with any of them. I still needed to collect rings to build speed, pick up items to mess with opponents, dodge other racers' items, and drift around corners. Like everything else, the customization features don't help CrossWorlds differentiate itself from its competitors--nothing (so far) about this experience feels like it belongs solely to CrossWorlds.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still hopeful that I'm just missing something. I generally enjoy the Sonic games that focus on racing, so this one not connecting with me feels like I'm somehow lying to myself. I'm sure that as soon as I sit down on the couch with my closest friends and we're screaming at each other for the bullcrap that we manage to pull off, I'll recognize in that moment what makes CrossWorlds special. Until that moment, however, I'm choosing to remain cautious of this one.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is launching for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch on September 25. The game will be released for Switch 2 during the 2025 holiday season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned game designer Hideaki Itsuno famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left CAPCOM</a> around a year ago after a thirty-year career at the Japanese company. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-creator-hideaki-itsuno-joins-tencents-lightspeed-to-work-on-aaa-action-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that he would become the head of a new Japan-based team at Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios, which would create action games, per his expertise.</p>



<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-veteran-itsuno-hires-devil-may-cry-street-fighter-royalty-for-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by VideoGamesChronicle</a>, LightSpeed has announced new milestones for the studio: the hiring of several key developers from CAPCOM and the opening of a new office in Osaka (Japanese developers will be able to choose whether they'd like to keep working from the Tokyo office or move to the new one, <a href="https://x.com/__lightspeed___/status/1960146677844861325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the official X account</a>).</p>



<p>As for the new hires, they're all former colleagues of Hideaki Itsuno:</p>



<ul>
<li>Writer Toshihiro Nakagawa, also known as Bingo Morihashi, has worked on Devil May Cry 2, 3, 4, 5, and both Dragon's Dogma games</li>



<li>Daigo Ikeno, an artist whose works include Street Fighter, Devil May Cry, and Dragon's Dogma</li>



<li>Gouda Cheese/Bengus(both fictional names), another artist who has worked on Street Fighter and Power Stone</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Actually, the new LightSpeed Japan Studio has roughly a third of its employees (around 40 in total for now) who came from CAPCOM, and Hideaki Itsuno highlighted the benefits of this choice in a statement shared with VGC: </p>



<p><em>Although we’re a new studio working on a new game, it’s good to be able to work with people who I trust like Mr. Nakagawa. I have been working with him for decades, since Devil May Cry 2, and he’s one of those core members who understands me very well. Ikeno-san is also participating as an art director this time, and Bengus-san has a very high level of understanding and is a very unique man – he was a legendary designer at Capcom.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s all about a sense of trust… we know exactly what each of us want. And it’s not just these three people: I also hired some other people I worked with from before at Capcom, so even though this is a new studio, I’ve gathered those people who I trust to make sure that this is going to be a successful game.</em></p>



<p>Hideaki Itsuno and his team are working on an original IP. Earlier today, Itsuno-san <a href="https://x.com/tomqe/status/1960151714423865732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a> that the team will work on a prototype that will 'delight players around the world', though they are still seeking creative directors. As such, it would be wise to expect a long wait before we hear concrete details on the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft recently appeared at Gamescom to present the future of The Division 2, including the unveiling of ‘a big project’ that turned out to be The Division 2: Survivors. As the game approaches its tenth anniversary, more content has been lined up, but for a while, things looked a little sketchy for Ubisoft’s once-iconic third-person shooter MMO.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Palle Hoffstein, art producer at Massive Entertainment, revealed that a micro-sized team stumped up the courage to ‘resurrect’ The Division 2 when it was in a slump and content delivery had effectively ended, and the turnaround was something incredible.</p>



<h2 id="h-something-bigger-and-lasting">‘Something Bigger and Lasting’</h2>



<p>Ubisoft posted a timeline to social media on August 22, unveiling the immediate and long-term future of The Division franchise, including the string of expansions coming to The Division 2. The team also discussed The Division: Resurgence, an all-new mobile experience set at the heart of The Division’s <em>borderline </em>post-apocalyptic universe.</p>



<p>In a line of comments responding to that post, art producer <a href="https://x.com/Palle_Hoffstein/status/1959275482462953660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Palle Hoffstein revealed</a> how The Division 2 almost slipped out of reach, but a dedicated team of just <strong>five developers </strong>clawed it back from the zero-content abyss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We had 5 people to restart Division 2. Five! What were we thinking? Ah that was fun.</em></p>



<p>When a few of us made a small team to resurrect TD2 I had zero interest in adding a year or two, just to sunset the game again. The goal, what we believed we could do, was to <strong>build something bigger and lasting</strong>. This is fun to see but there’s still so much more we want to do.</p>



<p>I figured the biggest challenge would be staffing and yeah. Studios plan staffing years in advance to keep everyone allocated and busy. We created a problem of being a team that needed positions filled that weren’t on anyone’s spreadsheet. <strong>We weren’t supposed to exist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><span>(</span>Thanks to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ubisoft-allocated-5-devs-restart-the-division-2-build-something-bigger-lasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The Division debuted in 2016 and turned heads thanks to a solid marketing campaign and a great launch that plunged players into a desperate fight to reclaim New York from looters, shooters, and organized criminals. The Division 2 was released in 2019 and has become a staple of Ubisoft’s live-service lineup, even if things went wavy for a while.</p>



<p>Palle later revealed that when a 2024 crossover event that introduced Resident Evil to The Division aired, he might have been ‘the last person’ on the D2 team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might have been the last person actually on the D2 team, to launch the Resident Evil stuff. We were done. Then a few weeks later I was asked if I could do another apparel event for D2. Despite having no artists I said, “sure.” I assumed I could figure something out lol.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you glad that this team of five developers got their heads down to ‘save’ The Division 2? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Ahead of Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2025 in September, PlayStation has announced its lineup for the expo. The convention, held yearly, has already shown promise this year with contributors like Capcom and Koei Tecmo showing up with huge games. Now, PlayStation has joined in on the fun with two of its biggest upcoming titles.</p>



<p>This is the company’s second year in a row showing up to TGS after being absent from 2020-2023.  Last year, the biggest games were Monster Hunter Wilds and the GOTY winner Astro Bot. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach also held a showcase, where a new trailer was unveiled. While no showcases are revealed just yet, the two titles on display are sure to make fans happy.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As of right now, only two brand-new titles will be available for attendees to play on the show floor. Those titles, according to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/sony-interactive-entertainment-announces-preliminary-tgs-2025-lineup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>, are Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei and ARC System Works’ Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls. More games will be announced closer to the expo’s start on September 25th, 2025. </p>



<p>This marks the first public demo of Ghost of Yotei, which launches a week after TGS on October 2nd. Meanwhile, many fans at EVO got their hands on Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls, with many more when the closed beta comes on September 6th. Still, both games are some of the studio’s and are sure to make a splash with attendees.</p>

<p>Following an announcement earlier this month, Nintendo's free Switch eShop and smart device application <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> is now available to download.</p>
<p>This game is designed for parents and their children and is only available in Japan right now. If you want to download the game on your Switch or Switch 2, you'll need to have access to a Japanese Nintendo account.</p>
<p>When you boot up the application, the message "play together with an adult!" appears on the screen and from there, Mario's face will pop up and you can interact with it. You can also use the block in the corner of the screen to access items and other interactive objects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tgzmqj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's an official description, along with some more screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>A free smart device app and Nintendo Switch software that children can play intuitively by pulling Mario’s face, or turning it around and around on the screen. Mario will react in various ways based on the player’s input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the eShop page, Hello, Mario! is only playable in handheld mode and requires 156 MB on Switch and 166 MB on Switch 2 to install.</p>
<p>This app is part of a new range of Super Mario products aimed at parents and children. These products are scheduled to be released outside of Japan at the beginning of <strong>2026</strong>. You can find out more in our previous story here on Nintendo Life.</p>
