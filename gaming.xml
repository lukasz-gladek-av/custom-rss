            <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards Of The Coast have apologised for "mistakenly" sending a legal takedown to the creator of a free <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod that adds a village inspired by and featuring characters from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. The mod has attracted praise from Larian CEO Swen Vincke, who was naturally a bit piqued when it was taken offline.</p>
<p>Published on Nexus Mods on 16th March, the Baldur's Village mod in question was taken offline days later and placed "under moderation review". <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13511816-dmca-request-issued-by-wizards-of-the-coast-llc/">According</a> to a Nexus Mods staff member, legal firm Reynolds Law PLLC sent a claim of copyright infringement on behalf of Wizards on 27th March.</p>
<p>The mod has now <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">been restored</a>, following a player backlash, so go ahead and marry pixelart Astarion as you please. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">PCGamer</a> also have a statement from Wizards, who claim the strike was one big whoopsie.</p>
<p>"The Baldur's Village DMCA takedown was issued mistakenly - we are sorry about that," it reads. "We are in the process of fixing that now so fans and the Stardew community can continue to enjoy this great mod!"</p>
<p>It's possible this has something to do with Vincke's intervention yesterday. In a predictably popular post on the Muskvine, he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">wrote</a>: "free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth. Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.</p>
<p>"Protecting your [intellectual property] can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled," Vincke continued. "There are good ways of dealing with this."</p>
<p>For context, Larian have <a href="https://larian.com/fan-content-policy">said</a> in their fan content policy that they're fine with people making mods based on their games, as long as they give them away for free, don't pass them off as Larian's own work, and don't do anything "inappropriate, offensive, damaging, or disparaging". Larian are not, however, the legal custodians of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world in which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> takes place.</p>
<p>The Baldur's Village mod is informally set after the Larian RPG's ending, so beware spoilers if you're planning to install. Again, it's free, though the modders do run a Patreon. Given enough interest and crowdfunding, they hope to flesh out their chunk of the Forgotten Realms with further BG3 callbacks.</p>
<p>"Our next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline," the Nexusmod page FAQ explains. "Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy 9, Square Enix has launched a special website dedicated to the title. But all this has done is spark gossip and speculation that a Final Fantasy 9 remake is on the way and close to being announced.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-single-player-record-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> project has been a hit. It’s won awards, both games have sold millions of copies, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-developers-have-already-written-part-3s-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third and final chapter of the trilogy</a> is sure to round things off in style. But while the FF7 remake talk has been constant, the chatter about a Final Fantasy 9 remake has been just as loud and fervent.</p>



<p>The ninth mainline game is considered as important as any to many in the FF community. So when Square Enix suddenly drops a new FF9 website, eyebrows are raised, and questions are sure to be asked.</p>

<p>A new official <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 9 website</a> celebrating the JRPG’s 25th anniversary launched in March 2025. It pays homage to the game and gives fans worldwide the chance to buy exclusive merchandise, learn about the title, and see what Square Enix has planned.</p>



<p>Nothing else has been confirmed for now. However, it’s been reported that <strong>a Final Fantasy 9 Remake has been in the works</strong>—although it may not involve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14-director-denies-ff9-remake-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki Yoshida</a>. The development of the title has reportedly happened alongside the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-release-on-a-wide-range-of-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FF7 Remake Part 3</a>.</p>



<p>A new website and all this commotion and celebration for Final Fantasy 9 likely doesn’t stop here. With the annual Summer of blockbuster gaming announcements upcoming, all signs are pointing toward the inevitable Final Fantasy 9 Remake confirmation.</p>

			<p>A Sonic Adventure 2 Unreal Engine 5 remake is in the works, and a new playable demo is now available for download to allow users to experience for themselves the stunning recreation of some classic stages.</p>
<p>The demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/SA2R/939490">here</a>, features the modern recreation of Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Green Forest, among other levels and boss fight updates. The demo, much like the yet-to-be-released full remake, is powered by the Azure Framework, a branch of Velocity+ that overhauls the physics, camera, controls, and UI to offer a brand-new experience that still sports some classic mechanics, such as a high-speed platforming experience and the return of the scoring system which rewards players to chain moves together to keep a perfect score and score more points. Visuals have also been significantly improved over the original, featuring real-time path-traced lighting and reflections.</p>

<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog PC fans have definitely been eating well. Besides the recent release of the Sonic Adventure 2 Redux Unreal Engine 5 remake demo, some dedicated developers have released an unofficial port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-unleashed-unofficial-pc-port-download/">Sonic Unleashed</a>, finally giving PC players the chance to try out the console-exclusive game like never before. Hopefully, the follow-up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/">Sonic Frontiers</a>, which has yet to be officially announced, will receive the same amount of love from Sonic Team as these fan projects have from their developers.</p>

They're dated back to 2023, so it's possible that they aren't up to date. However, it does provide us a glimpse of what the project might look like. According to MP1st, the game's codename is "Bruno" and the screenshots suggest that it's an isometric tactics game.</p><p>Some of the screenshots show gameplay where Mandalorians and a droid take cover while others depict the user interface. One shows what looks like the hub area, called Kafrene Mining Colony.</p><p>As these images are over a year old, it's also possible that the final release could look drastically different.

            <p>The anonymous creator of Balatro, LocalThunk, impressed passersby at last month's Game Developer Conference with his card skills, but nobody recognised him.</p>
<p>Balatro won several awards at GDC's Game Developers Choice Awards, including Game of the Year, Best Design, Best Debut, and Innovation Award. As a result of the nominations, the game had a booth on the show floor.</p>
<p>LocalThunk himself played the game there, but managed to retain his anonymous status despite impressing onlookers at the booth.</p>

<p>"One of my fav moments from GDC - they had a booth set up to play Balatro since it was an award nominee. I watched for a bit then I gave it a go myself. Crushed a white stake run," the developer wrote on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"Someone approached me as I was about to leave. 'Wow you must have played this before!'</p>
<p>"'I guess you could say that'."</p>
<p>He added: "Also this was actually the first and only time I have seen strangers play my game in real life. Have yet to see Balatro in the wild. So as far as I'm concerned y'all are just Truman Show-ing me."</p>

<p>As with previous awards shows, Playstack Communications Director Wout Van Halderen collected Balatro's wins on LocalThunk's behalf.</p>

            <p>75 people have been let go by Eidos-Montreal, the studio announced yesterday. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and Tomb Raider developers laid off the workers because they didn't have the "capacity to entirely reallocate them", according to a statement. It's a further blow to the workforce at the Embracer-owned company, following hefty cuts last year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end," said management in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/?originalSubdomain=fr">the post on LinkedIn</a>. "It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>
<p>"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition."</p>
<p>The company doesn't specify what that "mandate" is. But it most likely means that work on a current project is finishing, for whatever reason. Note the classic use of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">not-our-fault spinlingo</a>. The statement says the axed workers are "going to enter the employment market" rather than, say, being frogmarched there.</p>
<p>"Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development," they added.</p>
<p>The only project that the studio has publicly acknowledged they've been working on lately is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-has-been-delayed-until-2026-because-the-studio-needs-more-time-says-xbox">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fable">Fable</a>, on which they're helping out alongside core developer Playground Games. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-deus-ex-game-in-the-works-for-two-years-reportedly-cancelled-almost-100-staff-laid-off-at-eidos-montreal">cancelled a Deus Ex game last year</a>, and laid off 100 workers in the wake of that cancellation. We don't know what else they're doing right now. </p>
<p>Eidos-Montreal was bought by Embracer Group in 2022, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> the year before. Soon afterwards Embracer began a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">ruthless cost-cutting purge of workers</a> across all its studios. In March last year, Embracer's CEO claimed this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">process of "restructuring" was over</a>. But since then the multinational conglomerate has overseen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">closure of the Gothic developers</a>, the axing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">139 people from a Diablo IV support studio</a>, and just last week other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-and-perfect-dark-devs-crystal-dynamics-cut-staff-promising-that-current-projects-are-unaffected">layoffs at Crystal Dynamics</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We already know that 2026 brings us a new reboot of Resident Evil. However, thanks to words from director Zach Cregger, it could be one of the most faithful adaptations of the legendary survival-horror series to date.</p>



<p>The history of Resident Evil movies isn’t the best. There’s been plenty to love, and we’ve seen countless nods to the game from characters to Resident Evil Apocalypse’s full inclusion of Nemesis. Milla Jovovich killed it as Alice in the original six movies, but the franchise has moved in a different direction since.</p>



<p>2021’s Resident Evil Welcome to Raccoon City has already been forgotten, but now we look ahead to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new 2026 Resident Evil film</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films">Resident Evil Movie is “Unlike Any of The Previous Films”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This news has us howling. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-resident-evil-movie-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films-director-promises?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, we’ve learned from Zach Cregger—director of the Resident Evil movie reboot—that his interpretation “Will be built in the spirit of those games and follows one central protagonist from point A to point B, as they descend deeper into hell.”</p>



<p>He wants to capture a truer feel of the survival games, and has boldly claimed the reboot is “<strong>Unlike any of the previous films</strong>.”</p>



<p>Zach Cregger is an actor-turned-director and producer. He’s had several roles across TV and movies, but he’s recently best-known for writing and directing 2022’s Barbarian. The Resident Evil reboot is a huge project, and if the movie can be a success, it could start a new trend of Resident Evil movies to go along with the game series.</p>



<p>We know a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Resident Evil game</a> is well into development, and it’s also rumored that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 0 and Code Veronica remakes</a> are on the way. Join the conversation in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to see if anyone else is excited at the prospect of more Resident Evil screentime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the launch of Season 3 this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone get a significant change that some within the PC community have said could hit their matchmaking queue times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision published the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-3-patch-notes-are-here">Season 3 patch notes</a> and with it confirmed a big change coming to regular Multiplayer. It’s separating the Multiplayer Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of these three settings (Multiplayer Ranked Play, Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play, and Multiplayer Unranked) will include the following crossplay options when Season 3 goes live on April 4:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in the selected playlists.</li><li>On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in selected playlists.</li><li>Off: Restricts matchmaking to your current gaming platform only in selected playlists.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision made a point of warning those who select 'On (Consoles Only)' <em>may</em> experience negatively impacted matchmaking queue times. But Activision outright said 'Off' <em>will </em>negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the console-only crossplay coming to regular Multiplayer that has some within the Call of Duty PC community spooked. They’ve said that console players having the option to essentially strip out matchmaking with PC players for regular Multiplayer may mean longer queue times for them, and you can see why they’d be worried.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has a reputation for cheating (it comes with the territory of being such a hugely popular shooter and having a free-to-download battle royale). Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says">if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings and turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a PC player…. hate this change but I get it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1job9jr/comment/mkqf7p7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor exjr_ said</a>. “I hope it doesn’t affect queue times for the game in the long-run so I’m not forced to buy the game on PS5 to have a good experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is awful for PC players because this just killed PC,” <a href="https://x.com/GKeepnclassy/status/1906786971831435531" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added X / Twitter user @GKeepnclassy</a>. “Terrible idea because now PC players that ARE NOT cheating are being penalized. This is bullshit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My lobbies barely fill already to being with on PC due to sbmm," said @CBBMack. "This will withought a doubt make it worse. Time to plug in the console I guess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some PC players have reacted angrily to the change, saying Activision should instead do more to make its anti-cheat more effective so console players aren’t driven to turn crossplay off in the first place. “Maybe they should fix their anti-cheat instead of isolating PC players,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1job9jr/comment/mkqgqcu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor MailConsistent1344 commented</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision, as IGN has reported, has spent millions of dollars in the battle against Call of Duty cheat makers, cheat sellers, and cheat users, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>. Earlier in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-call-of-duty-cheat-developer-insists-its-shutting-down-but-players-are-skeptical"><u>Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down</u></a>, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider would fall by the wayside. And just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-call-of-duty-cheat-providers-shut-down-in-apparent-sweep-and-clear-operation-ahead-of-verdansks-return-to-warzone">IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut down</a> ahead of next week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-release-date-for-return-of-original-verdansk-map-to-call-of-duty-warzone"><u>hotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it is an uphill battle that may be impossible to win. Activision has promised improved anti-cheat tech with the launch of Season 3, so it will be interesting to see if PC players feel any changes there, especially with the influx of players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-returns-to-call-of-duty-warzone-here-are-all-the-biggest-changes">the return of Verdansk</a> will bring to Warzone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as many have pointed out, the ultra mainstream, super casual Call of Duty audience on console may never make use of these new crossplay settings because they may simply not be aware of them. Most Call of Duty players likely do not fuss over patch notes or spend much time in the settings. They jump into unranked Multiplayer, have some fun for an hour or two, then leave. These players may never know console-only crossplay is an option, or know why it would be needed in the first place. And so, the majority of console players may continue to play Call of Duty as they’ve always done: with full crossplay on by default.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a point made by Call of Duty YouTuber TheXclusiveAce, who reacted to PC player concern in a post on <a href="https://x.com/TheXclusiveAce/status/1906804429992730990" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I see a lot of pushback with this change from PC players concerned that they won't be able to find games in lesser played modes or that matchmaking will take too long,” TheXclusiveAce said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To be clear, PC players will still be matchmaking with the largest pool of the playerbase since that majority of players won't even notice this setting exists so they'll stick to the default or even if they are aware of it, many will choose to leave it on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If anything, it's the players that decide to turn console-only crossplay on that will be limiting their matchmaking pool but that's a choice that's now in their hands for the first time in Pubs and it's a tradeoff that many of us will be happy to make.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Season 3 nearly upon Black Ops 6 and Warzone, it will be interesting to see if these changes move the needle, as Activision’s war on cheaters continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>First it was rumoured, then it was implied, and now it seems all but officially confirmed that the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release.</p>
<p>A brief video shared on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">Nintendo's newly minted Today app</a> counting down to tomorrow's Direct shows the Switch successor in various configurations. A console can be seen docked in front of a nice looking flat screen (devoid of kids' fingerprints, unlike mine) and one console is in its handheld mode with the Joy Con attached either side.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while a pair of Joy Con have been slipped into Nintendo's handy little controller grip, two others lie loose to the side of another Switch 2 screen. Well, I say lie. One is lying on its back, as you would place an OG Switch Joy Con when not using it, but the second one is perched on its side.</p>

<p>This placement lends further credence to earlier reports of that aforementioned mouse functionality.</p>
<p>We got a look at what was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">perceived to be the Switch 2's mouse functionality</a> when Nintendo unveiled its upcoming console in January. During the brief teaser, two Joy Con could be seen being pushed along a flat service, their wrist straps out the back like little mouse tails.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there appeared to be some kind of attachment that gives the side of the Joy-Con a smooth edge.</p>

            <p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will retain its controversial sexual content from the original release, as revealed in its ESRB rating.</p>
<p>As with the original release of Metal Gear Solid 3, the forthcoming remake will be rated M for Mature. And it will retain the "Peep Demo Theatre" too.</p>
<p>Reads the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40362/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater/">rating summary</a>: "The game contains some suggestive/sexual content: a man groping a woman's breasts; close-up cameras angles of deep cleavage; a character briefly groping a man's crotch; a Peep Demo Theatre allowing players to view cutscenes of a female character's body from a first-person perspective."</p>

<p>The Demo Theatre was an unlockable extra from the Subsistence version of the game onwards, which allowed players to view cutscenes while controlling the camera. The Peep Demo Theatre was one such cutscene that, once unlocked via multiple playthroughs, allowed players to see female spy Eva in her underwear.</p>
<p>In the main game too, players can press a button during cutscenes to see Snake's first-person viewpoint. This can provide an advantage, but in some scenes his gaze settles on more suggestive imagery.</p>
<p>While some players may have expected some of this sexual imagery to change in the remake for a more modern audience, the rating makes it clear the remake will stick closely to the original release.</p>
<p>The rating summary also details the amount of violence in the game. "Combat is highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood-splatter effects," it reads. "Some close-quarter combat allows players to slit enemies' throats, resulting in large spurts of blood. Cutscenes depict further instances of violence/blood: a restrained character beaten and electrocuted; a character shot in the eye; a character on fire shot several times."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-difficulty-is-being-adjusted-to-match-its-control-styles">remake will offer two styles of controls</a>, based on the original game and new modern controls, with difficulty altered accordingly.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will release on 28th August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">complete with the Ape Escape-themed minigame from the original game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-keenan-teases-asus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-%E2%80%9Cproject-keenan%E2%80%9D-teased-by-asus-with-a-not-subtle-at-all-short-video.1150737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-keenan-teases-asus/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox handheld known as Project Keenan was teased with a not-subtle-at-all video that essentially confirmed who is making the yet-to-be-officially-announced system.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the ASUS ROG Global official X profile shared a new video teasing something new that the company is working on. During the video, an ROG Ally is shown together with an Xbox controller, strongly hinting at the fact that ASUS is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">indeed</a> the company making the Xbox handheld reportedly launching this year. The Xbox X profile also added more fuel to the fire by reacting with a rather telling meme, so it seems like it's all but confirmed that ASUS is making the handheld.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://t.co/ONZpeEmNka">pic.twitter.com/ONZpeEmNka</a></p>
<p>— Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Xbox handheld codenamed Project Keenan, which will look markedly Xbox with a similar design sensibility and will run full Windows with the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass as some of its focuses, is only a small part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">Microsoft next-generation plans</a>, which will also include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a full-blown handheld that will launch in 2027. Microsoft's next-generation system will supposedly deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical leap</a> ever seen, so it will be very interesting to learn how this leap will be delivered and how future games will take advantage of it.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has called NieR: Automata the "game that changed everything", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry on its release.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html">AV Watch</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-he-was-ordered-not-to-worry-about-overseas-reviews-by-games-producer/">Automaton</a>), Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined and increasingly studios there were chasing "overseas tastes".</p>
<p>That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. "I think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success," said Yoshida.</p>

<p>The game proved Japanese studios could find success by creating Japanese-style games. "With NieR, everyone realised this," said Yoshida. "That it wasn't just something they could do, but something they had to do."</p>
<p>As such, Japanese studios strove to "create based on their own culture and what they knew", realising this was the appeal of their work overseas.</p>
<p>"I think that the Japanese game industry revived after NieR, so much so that you could talk about pre-NieR and post-NieR eras. Simply put, I think that was the title that made everyone want to pursue Japanese-style games," said Yoshida.</p>
<p>NieR creator Yoko Taro himself responded on social media, thanking Yoshida for the praise but crediting producer Yosuke Saito, who "ordered" him to make a game "that targets the Japanese market, without worrying about overseas reviews".</p>
<p>"Or, to put it more precisely," said Taro, "I remember being told something like 'Yoko, you can't make games for overseas, so (at least) try to make it for Japan'."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="ja"><p>なんか飛んできたので。オートマタを評価していただいているのは光栄ですが、「海外評価を気にせず日本向けに作れ」と命令したのは齊藤Ｐです。</p><p>もうちょっと正確に言うなら「ヨコオさんは海外向けにゲーム作るのは無理だから（せめて）日本向けに頑張ってくれ」的なことを言われたような記憶。 <a href="https://t.co/kOr2BwjFSs">https://t.co/kOr2BwjFSs</a></p></div>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1905991546828452080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Saito then replied: "What I said at the time went more like this: Since we're Japanese people, there's no need for us to go out of our way to cater to people overseas. Surely, we'll be able to attract at least a million players among all the people out there who genuinely want to play a Japanese game made by a Japanese person (the one and only Yoko Taro)."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-developers-join-forces-for-new-project-that-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier">Saito teased a possible new NieR project</a> alongside Taro, though nothing further has been said since. "I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now," he said at the time. "I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. [Laughs] That's about all I can say for now."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-is-superior-to-nier-automata-says-yoko-taro">Taro also compared NieR: Automata to Stellar Blade</a>, stating: "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> is a really amazing game. I'd say that it's much better than NieR:Automata."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Have you played so much <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg">PUBG</a> that you’ve developed… feelings for your favourite guns in the game? Well, lucky you, because Krafton has released a new dating sim for the month of April, called Winner Winner Romantic Dinner.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s an April Fools gag, but yes, it’s <a href="https://pubg.com/en/events/wwrdevent">a real thing that you can play here</a>, so long as you don’t mind it using AI game development.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG | Winner Winner Romantic Dinner ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRIzm0f7cLQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The anime dating game has become a bit of a go-to gag, starting off with that game where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/10/kfc-date-colonel-sanders-a-finger-lickin-good-dating-simulator/">you can date Colonel Sanders of KFC fame</a>, and more recently, with the Dead By Daylight dating sim <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/03/dead-by-daylight-dating-sim-hooked-on-you-is-out-today/">Hooked On You</a>. Mixing this with PUBG is…. well, it’s amongst the weirdest, but maybe not quite.</p>
<p>Featured in the game are anime girlf-ified versions of the Molotov Cocktail – a fiery redhead, of course – AKM, AUG, and KAR98K. You’ll also, quite obviously, be attending school where you meet them.</p>

<p>This game has been created by Krafton’s AI game development studio ReLU Games, with generative AI used to create variations of character and background images. This is a pretty touchy subject between game developers and gamers right now. Krafton also encourage players to allow microphone access with voice recognition – if you play without mic access, mini-games will not be available.</p>
<p>If you reach one of the three game ending, you’ll receive a reward. These are 10&nbsp;<a title="Games > Contraband [20 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/contraband/">Contraband</a> Coupons to use within PUBG Battlegrounds, and an anime gun girl-themed nameplate. Reach all three and you can get a new spray, emblem and 500 G-Coin to spend in-game.</p>
<p>The game is available to play until 29th April.</p>
<p>There’s also a PUBG in-game event called Land, Love, Survive across PC and console. Running until 8th April at 2AM UTC, this pushes players toward co-op play with social and squad-based missions to reward&nbsp;Event Tokens, BP, Hunter’s Chests, Keys and Contraband Coupons. Find the details in-game.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/runescape-dragonwilds-is-a-new-open-world-survival-game-in-the-mmo-universe/</link>

		<p>Exploring the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/runescape">RuneScape</a> universe in a completely new way, Jagex has revealed the co-op open world survival game RuneScape: Dragonwilds. The game is launching into Steam Early Access this spring, with a deep-dive reveal coming on 15th April.</p>
<p>By the way, this was actually announced on 31st March, so it’s definitely not an April Fools.</p>
<p><iframe title="RuneScape: Dragonwilds - Official World Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ssbPDfS92o4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>RuneScape Dragonwilds will explore some rather familiar territory within games, with open world survival games having been a huge part of the indie gaming scene for quite a few years. Major hits like Valheim, Enshrouded and Grounded have set out the tone for this style of adventure, but Jagex is taking that template and putting a RuneScape twist on things, thematically and with the story that it’s looking to tell.</p>
<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds will head to the forgotten continent of Ashenfall, where dragons have now awoken. You’ll have to gather, build, craft and skill up in order to survive the lands, uncover some ancient secrets, and look to slay the Dragon Queen.</p>


<p>There’s some light RPG elements mixed with familiar RuneScape vernacular and lore for fans of the long-running MMO. That flavour includes things like using the power of Anima, summoning spectral axes to chop down trees and using nature’s energy to repair armour. The progression system. All of this can be played solo or with parties of up to four players.</p>
<p>Just as familiar to gamers is the game engine that Jagex has chosen to pull this off with. Instead of the rather distant top-down view of traditional RuneScape, the camera’s pulling right in on the characters and with that closeness, Jagex has chosen to adopt Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing RuneScape: Dragonwilds | Q&amp;A With Mod Dutch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30mkN1Hw83Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“We’re so excited to finally give players a glimpse at the next entry in the RuneScape franchise today with RuneScape: Dragonwilds,” said Jon Bellamy, Jagex CEO. “RuneScape: Dragonwilds is an entirely new RuneScapeexperience set within the iconic world of Gielinor and is a game which is worthy of wearing the RuneScape name.</p>
<p>“From the very beginning, community feedback has been at the heart of <em>RuneScape: Dragonwilds</em>. We’ve already conducted closed alpha tests with some of our closest community members, and we’ll be listening to player feedback when building the game throughout Early Access. We’ve built an entirely new team filled with industry veterans who are focussed on making sure that <em>RuneScape: Dragonwilds</em>&nbsp; sits naturally within the <em>RuneScape</em>franchise, and a game that is loved by both our biggest <em>RuneScape</em> fans and entirely new players alike.”</p>
<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds is heading into Early Access this spring, with a full reveal set to come on 15th April at 5PM UK time.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> co-creator and programmer Tarn Adams has made fleeting, whimsical allusion to the possibility of an Elf Fortress game in a new interview - a fleeting, whimsical allusion I will now pounce on and make an enormous deal of, because my goodness, man, you can't just say "Elf Fortress" and walk off whistling into the sunset. 
</p>
<p>
The topic arose during a discussion of why fantasy dwarves are a "fortuitous" archetype for a maddeningly system-driven game like Dwarf Fortress, in which half the fun is enjoying the tunnel vision of characters who will cheerfully neglect their responsibilities and doom their brethren because, for example, they're obsessed with crafting a mug that menaces with spikes of bituminous coal and alpaca wool. According to Adams, this is relatably "human", though he muddies things intriguingly by dropping a reference to androids, and allows players to weave stories around technical eccentricities and outright bugs, which can be read as instances of "dwarfy" fixation and excess. Elves? They don't work the same way. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All this comes from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/dwarf-fortress-dwarves-are-more-human-than-human-creator-says-theyre-allowed-to-embody-bigger-emotions-theyre-allowed-to-make-bigger-mistakes-theyre-allowed-to-do-anything/">a Parchment Gamer interview</a> at this year's Game Developer Conference, in which the Bay 12 co-founder reflects a little on the game's long development. "Dwarves turned out to be fortuitous, because they're sort of like - I don't know why it pops into my head - replicants from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>," Adams said. "More human than human. That's a dwarf."
</p>
<p>
Fantasy dwarves are "more human than human" because "they're allowed to embody bigger emotions," Adams went on. "They're allowed to make bigger mistakes. They're allowed to be stubborn. They're allowed to do anything." There's a kind of catharsis at work here, he said. "There's everything about it, from drunkenness to a very noble hubris. It's all there. Dwarves allow us to experience these different parts of ourselves that, in humanity, you might be more judgmental of." 
</p>
<p>
By contrast, "if you were playing an elf fortress, all of these stories would hit different," Adams said. "The antics they get up to, especially when it's a bit buggy or just being weird - I don't think elves would hit the same way. It'd be like 'What's going on with them?' Whereas with dwarves, you're like 'Nah, I know what's going on.'" The "devotion" of the dwarves supports the game's historically bloody-minded AI, he added, which has bred many internet legends of dwarves obstinately prioritising scavenging jobs while the fortress is being overrun.
</p>
<p>
"What are these AI agents but driven by the top need that has to be checked off right now? "Adams said later in the chat. "It feels right, even when it goes wrong, that they have that sense of devotion. It doesn't work for anything else quite the same way."
</p>
<p>
While I obviously defer to Adams's experience as the co-creator of by far the most elaborate manifestation of fantasy dwarfdom in video games, I can readily imagine a fortress or colony sim involving elves. I can imagine this partly because elves already exist in Dwarf Fortress. Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/g36l0w/no_mods_elf_fortress/">have even managed to create Elf Fortresses in-game</a> - admittedly, "culturally dwarvish" ones - by cultivating an influx of poets, allowing all the original dwarf residents to die off, and appointing an elf as baron. 
</p>
<p>
I can also imagine an Elf Fortress games because elves are themselves a set of well-entrenched literary archetypes and psychological metaphors. There's the Warhammer High Elf/Rivendell portrayal of elves as a declining, noble caste of immortals, rendered passive and complacent by their technological advantages and gifts of foresight - condescending in their benevolence toward the mortals. There's the contrasting depiction of elves as seductive, murderous bluebloods  found in Terry Pratchett's Lords And Ladies. There are the tree settlements and fey naturalism of wood elves in various stories. There's the association of elves with forbidden scholarship, demon flirtations, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
Plenty of material. Building a game of Dwarf Fortressy depth around the persona and associations of an elf would be a hard labour - likely, it would take the Adams brothers another few decades. I wouldn't wish that on them. But given the magnitude of their accomplishment with Dwarf Fortress, I'd be fascinated to see them try.

The Special Illustration Rare Pikachu ex is going for around $430, and Latias ex is even higher at nearly $500. Milotic ex is another banger at about $150 thanks to an ability that blocks damage from Tera Pokémon. Hydreigon ex is strong too, with a deck-discarding attack that’s super viable for play. Even the Hyper Rare Pikachu ex holds value at around $120. I don’t expect to pull any of these, but the odds keep things interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is the kind of deal that’s perfect for casual collectors like me, or anyone who enjoys the chaos of pulling something rare right after saying, “Just one more pack.” I know better than to promise a Pikachu EX SIR in every box, but I’ll absolutely take my chances when I don’t have to pay a third-party markup for the privilege.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re building a deck, feeding a binder addiction, or just gifting this to a kid so you can secretly open the packs yourself later, this is your chance. No inflated prices. No shady listings. Just six legit booster packs that actually ship from Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I already added one to my cart.

            <p>The official landing page for Ghost of Yōtei got a little update yesterday, with some new information on Sucker Punch's upcoming game tucked in there.</p>
<p>Straight off the bat, along with some more story details, the developer has remained committed to its 2025 release window on PS5. There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).</p>
<p>In terms of story, while we knew Ghost of Yōtei's protagonist Atsu had a revenge mission of some kind, we now have a little more background as to why.</p>

<p>Here's what the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/">updated Ghost of Yōtei synopsis reads</a>:</p>
<p>"300 years after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, a new warrior – Atsu – rises from the ashes of her homestead.</p>
<p>"Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you."</p>
<p>Along with the fact we now know Atsu is seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, that mention of "every odd job and bounty" has also sparked some intrigue. It sounds like Ghost of Yōtei may include a bounty mechanic, and perhaps have some kind of in-game economy, which would spice up the game's world a touch.</p>
<p>The developer previously said it was going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei had a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities.</p>
<p>Back in October, Sucker Punch's creative director Jason Connell said: "One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yōtei was first unveiled at a PlayStation State of Play last year</a>.</p>
<p>"To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," wrote Sucker Punch communications manager Andrew Goldfarb at the time. "At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend.</p>
<p>"This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker.1150674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new rumor suggests that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake could be mere days from its announcement and launch. New leaker Detective Seeds <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1906165593016799478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> (two days ago, so it's not an April Fools' joke) that the launch could come as soon as Thursday, April 3, or maybe next week, according to his source. Detective Seeds doesn't have a long track record, but he did get a couple of things right: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-out-on-april-17-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 release date of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM previews dropped yesterday</a>. He also <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1906086027665490373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that Ghost of Yotei might launch in July, by the way. We'll see if he's right about either of them.</p>
<p>As for the Oblivion remake, though, there are other sources pointing in that direction. Both proven insider NatetheHate and VideoGamesChronicle <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-unreal-engine-5-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-and-launched-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game would launch in April, with the former also adding that it could be shadow-dropped, meaning the announcement and launch would happen at the same time. It would, however, be a little surprising since Xbox has South of Midnight (out next week) and then the aforementioned PS5 debut of the Indiana Jones game.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake is said to be powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology and developed by Virtuos. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous report from MP1st,</a> the remake will deliver enhancements in six main gameplay areas (other than the obvious visuals): Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD.</p>
<p>Blocking has reportedly been inspired by the Soulslike genre and other modern action games. Sneak has also been overhauled and its damage formula has been reworked. The stamina system was tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen when you ran out of stamina should occur less often.</p>
<p>The HUD (Heads-Up Display) has been modified to make it more accessible and visually interesting. In combat, hit reactions have been introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, Virtuos has improved archery so that it feels smoother whether the user is playing with the third or first person camera.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake comes in the same year as <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyblivion</a>, the long-awaited fan-made total conversion of The Elder Scrolls IV into the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. There should be enough adventures in Cyrodiil for everyone in 2025.</p>
