			<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Steam Next Fest</a> for October 2024 has begun and as usual, there's a veritable treasure trove of demos available for upcoming PC games. The downside is that some gems might slip through the cracks, given how many demos are released at the same time. In this article, we'll try to give you an overview of the five games (plus another bonus five) we believe are worth checking out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/8e31e7492372aa052c2caa93f48a0fbc2c9e4cd3-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force?snr=1_614_615_nextfest_100718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force</a></h2>
<p>Let's start from the top. So far, the most played demo is the latest playtest of Delta Force, TiMi Studio's upcoming tactical first-person shooter game based on the historic franchise. Back in June, we were <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-qa-early-access-in-october-release-window-in-q1-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the developers planned to launch early access in October, although that schedule appears to have been delayed. Anyway, this new playtest also features Asia and South America servers in addition to North America and Europe, allowing more players to jump into the fray with a decent latency. Across the Steam Next Fest week, Delta Force players will be able to check out four Havoc Warfare modes (Attack/Defend, King of the Hill, Siege, and Blitz) across two maps (Cracked and Ascension), while the extraction mode Hazard Operations has three maps available. This playtest also includes 45 weapons, 9 vehicles, and 12 props.</p>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/490110/The_Precinct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Precinct</a></h2>
<p>Do you miss the old days of Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2? If so, there is no better cure than The Precinct, even though the game in development at Fallen Tree flips GTA on its premise and puts you in the shoes of a rookie beat cop who just graduated from the Police Academy.</p>
<p>The Precinct mixes action with sandbox elements. In the game, you'll patrol the streets and respond to calls to take on criminals, from drug dealers to bank robbers, choosing your own approach in car chases and shootouts. As a cop, you can get various forms of backup, from spike strips to roadblocks and fellow police cars. A full-fledged day/night cycle with dynamic weather should make you even more immersed in the fictional city of Averno, set in the 1980s East Coast.</p>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407270/AI_LIMIT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Limit</a></h2>
<p>Fans of games like NieR: Automata and Code Vein should definitely check out AI Limit, which has a demo out now on PC for the Steam Next Fest and on PlayStation 5.&nbsp; As in many Japanese games, the setting of the debut title from Sense Games is post-apocalyptic Earth, following various wars and disasters. Players will venture out into the dangerous world from the last human refuge of Havenswell, trying to uncover the truth behind all the destructive events. The AI Limit demo lets players experience the first level in its entirety for an estimated two hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>Enemies include elite and boss battles, and the level has several secret paths that hide weapons and items. Once you finish the demo, there's also a Boss Challenge mode.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/a42b03f27152499b9a48439eb89a5b6b563913f1-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287330/Empire_of_the_Ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empire of the Ants</a></h2>
<p>This impressive looking Unreal Engine 5-powered real-time strategy game is based on the novel from best-selling saga sci-fi novel originally published by French writer Bernard Werber in 1991. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-lineup-also-includes-the-ue5-rts-empire-of-the-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a> expects you to build up your economy, manage your units, gather information on the battlefield, gain new powers, and strengthen your defenses. When you run out of space, there's always the option to conquer other nests. The full game, out on November 7, also includes a 20-hour campaign and even multiplayer modes.</p>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Arc Line</a></h2>
<p>Our final pick is New Arc Line, the intriguing magic-meets-steampunk cRPG in development at Dreamate Games. In the Steam Next Fest demo, players can pick from two classes (either a Voodoo Shaman or a Diesel Engineer) and two races (Human or Elf). The events of the demo take place a little further into the main story, in a small part of the Harbour Slums, where players are tasked with investigating the Leprosarium and finding out why a doctor is not making her rounds to help the poor community affected by the deadly Iron Plague epidemic.

		<p><span>In fashion, it’s said that trends return every 20 years. But it seems technology has started to repeat itself at the same cadence, too. Can you identify what things happened in 2004, 2024, or in some cases, both?</span></p>

								<p>Two decades ago, the EU handed down a fine of over $600 million for not offering versions of Windows that did not come with Windows Media Player preinstalled. Microsoft still has antitrust problems in Europe at the moment, and last year, the EU attempted to block the company’s acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard. But Microsoft has paid no fines this year… so far.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>The very first Razr, called the Motorola Razr V3, was released in November of 2004. At the time, it cost <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22857413/motorola-razr-internet-button-flip-phone-data-cellular-charges">$500 with a two-year contract</a>. That was expensive then, and it’s expensive today. The current model of Motorola’s revival model, the Razr Plus, comes unlocked at nearly the same price.</p>

				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>Steve Jobs introduced the company’s Cinema Display in 2004 at WWDC. The price of the 30-inch model was $3,299 — adjusted for inflation, that’s over $5,400 today.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>At the end of last year’s film adaptation of the Mattel product, Barbie discovers her independence. But in 2004, Mattel announced that <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/barbie-ken-splitting-after-43-years-1c9485747">the couple had split</a>. Drama in doll lore existed long before Greta Gerwig scripted it.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>Google famously launched Gmail on April Fools’ Day 2004 — at a time when promising one gigabyte of free storage surely must have been a joke. Google did introduce Inbox a decade ago in 2014 but shuttered that in 2019.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>The 2024 film is actually an adaptation of the 2017 stage musical, which was adapted from the 2004 film, which was originally adapted from a 2002 book titled <em>Queen Bees and Wannabes</em>.</p>

								<p>He hates Mondays but loves reboots. In 2004, it was called <em>Garfield: The Movie</em>; in 2024, <em>The Garfield Movie</em>. How times have changed.</p>

				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p><em>Spider-Man 2</em> opened on June 30th, 2004, breaking the previous opening-day box office record held by its predecessor. Though there were <em>Spider-Man </em>sequels released in 2019 and 2021, none are slated for this calendar year. (We’re not counting <em>Madame Web </em>since it is not a direct sequel and also barely counts as a movie.)</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>Microsoft released the SPOT watch — short for “smart personal object technology.” Given that you don’t hear that acronym much anymore, you can probably guess that the watch never took off, despite the fanfare over the device’s ability to read headlines, send instant messages, and give weather forecasts. The SPOT watch also wasn’t even the company’s first attempt at a smartwatch: as early as 1994, it partnered with Timex to release the Datalink, arguably the world’s first smartwatch. But here in 2024, it’s been a while since Microsoft tried to make wristwear happen.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>In 2004, Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards — her first as a solo artist. Though this year’s <em>Cowboy Carter</em> is a likely favorite come awards season, she did not release an album in 2023, which means nothing that qualifies for this year’s Grammy Awards.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>US consumers loved trucks in 2004 and have continued to love them for the past two decades. Ford’s F-series remains the bestseller even today, and it has little to do with the addition of the electric version — in 2024 so far, the Lightning makes up less than 5 percent of total F-series sales.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>First identified in January 2004, Mydoom became the fastest-spreading email worm ever. As of 2024, its speed record has not been surpassed, and its origin is still unknown.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>In June of 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that the Child Online Protection Act was unconstitutional, a violation of the First Amendment. Though it was designed to prevent minors from seeing pornography on the internet, the Court ruled 5–4 that the law itself was too broad. Similar echoes are happening this year, though. Age-verification laws at the state level are blocking porn sites for minors or, in some states, blocking them entirely; and this July, the similarly named Kids Online Safety Act passed with bipartisan support.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>The original <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </em>was released for the GameCube in 2004, and its remake was released for the Switch almost exactly 20 years later.</p>

				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>One of Hollywood’s biggest tabloid magnets, the couple called off their engagement and broke up for the first time in January 2004. Lopez and Affleck got back together many years later, finally marrying in 2022. That union officially ended again in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a big revision of the original Hunt: Showdown, which was released way back in 2019. For those not familiar, it’s a PvPvE extraction shooter featuring zombies, hunting down a selection of bosses, and a bunch of gunslinger types who want to kill all the aforementioned things as well as you. It’s also got some very cool ideas behind it, such as a heavy reliance on audio cues and spatial sound to pinpoint where other players are, but alas, some of these cool ideas fall apart in a multiplayer game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hunt: Showdown 1896 I Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16vBsmpcxh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The set-up is fairly straightforward, as you and up to two other hunters head into a zombie-filled map to find clues that will lead you to a big monster to kill. You must then banish that monster and collect its bounty tokens, which takes time and gives other hunters your location so they can hunt you down, and steal your bounty tokens – very rude, if you ask me. It’s an extraction shooter, except the things you’re extracting are, I guess, bits of a giant spider, or whatever boss you were lucky enough to get instead. I honestly love the idea, but the reality is a bit less exciting.</p>


<p>The first boss I encountered was the aforementioned spider, and what a spider it was – taller than me, nine feet long, hairy, and scuttling all along the ceiling and walls at a horrific pace. The sounds it makes are the worst part, accurately giving the impression it’s crawling around you when you’re wearing headphones.</p>
<p>The spatial audio is vital throughout, as while you’re finding these clues and fighting this boss, the gunshots and explosions will make an awful lot of noise and draw other groups of players to you. The quieter you are, the safer you are. In addition to shooting and your footsteps, they can also hear any noise traps you might trigger – things like dying horses in the road, flocks of crows, and dogs in a kennel all make noise if they notice you, giving your position away. With a pair of headphones, you can pinpoint the direction they come from and know that there’s likely enemies over there well before you see them. The sound design and the use of spatial sound in this game is truly excellent.</p>

<p>As great as it sounds, it has mostly led to frustration. You can keep your distance from noise traps to avoid triggering them, but there’s often many of them clustered together directly in your way, and sometimes they trigger from further away than you thought they did last time, somehow. This, combined with certain zombies, can make sneaking around more of a chore than a thrill.</p>
<p>The Hive, a zombie with a beehive stuck in its chest that attacks from range demands you have a silent ranged weapon with you or you will be forced to shoot and draw attention to yourself. Its bees also deal poison damage, which prevents you from healing until it stops taking health away from you, which you either have to wait out or heal with an antidote. Meanwhile, the Immolator is a zombie that explodes into flames and charges once pierced by bullets or knives, but I don’t know how many blunt strikes it takes to kill with my fully charged melee because I got to four before it had taken three quarters of my health and then just shot it out of sheer frustration. Fire and bleed both need to be stopped by holding square before they kill you, which just isn’t engaging. Just yet another thing passively draining my health and slowing me down as if the movement speed wasn’t abysmally slow as it is.</p>

<p>Every piece of your equipment costs Hunt Dollars. I started with 8000 Hunt dollars I believe, but now have about 3000. Each time you die you’ll lose all your equipment and, once you reach level 11, you’ll lose your character and all the traits you’ve unlocked from levelling them up as well. Once I run out of Hunt Dollars, I’ll be without ammo packs, med kits, fire bombs, antidotes, and dynamite, not to mention being stuck with basic free characters and their similarly bare-bones weaponry. In short; a very severe disadvantage. Bounties don’t even reward that many Hunt Dollars, with the best way to earn some being killing other players or engaging with the event that sometimes appears in the center of the map.</p>
<p>To counter this disadvantage, you could hang back collecting stuff whilst you wait for the other groups to kill each other, then swoop in and take out the survivors. Unfortunately there isn’t that much stuff to collect, with most of it marked on the map and most buildings just being completely empty, making exploring feel pointless. Many players are also content to just sit in the building they fought the boss in forever. They’ll wait until they’re sure they’ve murdered everyone with their much better sight lines whilst you’ve got to see them through a window and headshot them in the split second they’re visible or try to navigate through all the noise traps and actual traps they have placed.</p>
<p>I’ve been hunting down someone only to find that they were just camping inside a large bush where they simply can’t be seen from outside. They were there for almost five minutes whilst I painstakingly snuck my way over to them, completely still, next to their team mate who I had already downed, and invisible to me because all I could see was their bush.</p>

<p>That’s the issue with this type of cool gameplay idea. When there’s lots of players it gets abandoned because it’s not efficient to play that way. If you sneak you won’t make noise, but you’ll spend fifteen minutes slowly making your way around and then you’ll either have to dash madly towards bounty holders anyway or keep sneaking and lose them. You’re much better off sprinting around because being careful and engaging properly with the sound mechanics is too large of a disadvantage, especially since there’s horses and cows constantly going off anyway because everyone else <em>is</em> sprinting around.</p>
<p>The shooting itself has its share of issues as well. Now, reloading is extremely slow. If someone were to reload like this in real life I’d suggest they switch to using swords or something, it’s so slow it almost feels passive aggressive. But beyond that, there’s also some latency and hit detection issues. In addition to having played a few matches with a big red lag warning in the corner of my screen though without any actual signs of lag like rubber banding and desync, I’ve also aimed directly at a player’s head whilst they were completely still and missed. Additionally, I’ve very obviously missed shots only to find that they mysteriously still connected. This could be part of the lag, it could be poor hit detection, I don’t know, but I do know it’s annoying and quickly converts the tension in gunfights into frustration.</p>
<p>On top of this, there’s a lengthy list of issues with the game’s UI and menus, despite it being overhauled with this update. Navigating around the menus is always a pain, sometimes it’s unclear where things are, where you’ll end up when you press a button, what a button will do, or even what UI elements mean. When choosing traits for your characters, there are a few icons on some of them that we could not find an explanation for in-game. You can’t highlight them, there isn’t a key, eventually we had to google them because we thought they would tell us why we couldn’t equip them. It turns out you have to find them in-game before you can equip them, something the game didn’t tell us outside of an icon without a description. They’ve even removed the Encyclopedia, which had all the background information about types of zombies and the world and so on, so that just isn’t in the game it belongs in anymore apparently.</p>

<p>Speaking of removing things, this new map – Mammon’s Gulch – is pretty nice, though not as nice as you might expect from Crytek. It’s got quite a few distinct areas, though two of those are both burned out wastelands, and a lot of verticality with all the hills, mountains, and mines/caves. It looks good, it just doesn’t have the wow I’ve previously associated with Cryengine. But they’ve also removed the other three maps from the game temporarily for some reason, initially for a month but now for an undisclosed time longer than that. That means you get one map for more than a month, ensuring less variety in the game than there was before this revitalising patch.</p>
<p>Then there’s bugs and frustrating traversal issues. In addition to walking painfully slowly and sneaking/crouching being even more painful, you can usually vault over things in this game, but I guarantee whilst you’re sneaking through the undergrowth you’ll come upon a waist high rock or ledge that you inexplicably can’t vault over. This totally ruins the sneaky vibe and your immersion as you have to go around or stand and jump to get up it, exposing yourself to anyone you might’ve been sneaking up on. Hunters also sometimes leave some chunks of their guns floating in the air around extraction points once they’ve been extracted, whilst sometimes the gun models don’t load even whilst playing, which is poor and a minor disadvantage to other players as that gun sticking up off their back could give away their position if they were, as a random example, hiding in a bush. And <em>then</em> there’s slow matchmaking and even occasional failures when inviting another player into my party, the only reliable way around this being to restart the game for both of us.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sentinels Unsure of Future in Halo, Says Bubu Dubu]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sentinels-halo-future-bubu-dubu/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sentinels-unsure-of-future-in-halo-says-bubu-dubu.1009623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sentinels-halo-future-bubu-dubu/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a clip captured during a recent stream, Jesse ‘bubu dubu’ Moeller explained that he and his squad are being dropped by Sentinels in the Halo Championship Series. He also explained that the organisation is uncertain of its future in the Halo scene, prompting concerns from fans.</p>



<p>Sentinels has yet to make a comment about these claims, but the organisation is notorious for being radio silent where the Halo ecosystem is concerned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bubudubu/clip/ObeseUninterestedGooseWholeWheat-zxlkrP0WNdjt18G6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short clip</a> captured while broadcasting a ‘Health &amp; Fitness’ stream, Sentinels’ bubu dubu said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Sentinels pretty much told us that we are all – like my entire team – are unrestricted free agents, and we are available to explore. They’re pretty much undecided if they’re going to field a team for year four, you know?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sentinels is far from being one of the winningest teams in the Halo space. In 2022, the organisation won the Kansas City Major, beating Cloud9 in a 4 – 0 sweep in the grand finals to secure a $140,000 prize. Since then, not much has happened for the organisation.</p>



<p>Most recently, the team finished in fifth place at the Halo World Championship tournament in Seattle.</p>



<p>Regardless of the team’s stature, it would be a blow to the Halo Championship Series to see the organisation cut away and move on. Sentinels has had a place in the HCS since it was reborn a few years ago, and it has shared the stage with some of the biggest names in gaming, like FaZe Clan and OpTic Gaming.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky few years for the Halo esports scene, despite 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) and Esports Engine trying to set up a solid competitive ecosystem and attract fans worldwide to attend a series of high-profile events.</p>

Echoes of Wisdom <em>just </em>released on September 26, so this offer existing at all is a bit surprising. So if you didn't pick up a copy of the latest Zelda game at launch or planned on buying it again as a gift this holiday, now's your chance to save eight bucks. Amazon Prime members get free shipping on all orders from Woot, which is essentially the online equivalent of an outlet mall with deals you won't often find at major retailers.</p><hr><h2>Nintendo Switch Game Deals at Woot</h2><p>Woot's deals on Switch exclusives tend to sell out fast, so you'll want to be quick if you're interested in any of the games listed below. As of October 15, Woot's site lists the end date for these days as four days from now, so they will likely disappear before the weekend whether they sell out or not.</p><h3>Nintendo Switch Exclusives - Save on 2024 Switch New Releases</h3><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-already-discounted-but-not-for-long%2F1100-6527148%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> -- $52 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnintendo-nes-world-champion-nintendo-world-championships&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-already-discounted-but-not-for-long%2F1100-6527148%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a> -- $25 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fluigis-mansion-2-hd-7&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-already-discounted-but-not-for-long%2F1100-6527148%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> -- $45 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnintendo-mario-vs-dk-game-mario-vs-donkey-kong-us-ve&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-already-discounted-but-not-for-long%2F1100-6527148%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> -- $40 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fprincess-peach-showtime-8&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-already-discounted-but-not-for-long%2F1100-6527148%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Princess Peach: Showtime</a> -- $45 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><h3>Deals on Super Mario Bros.

It's the first mainline entry in the series with Princess Zelda in the leading role, and it plays a lot differently than previous top-down iterations starring Link. Zelda's ability to create echoes (copies) of objects and monsters to solve puzzles, cross gaps, and fight offers a fun new spin on the classic formula. Just like Tears of the Kingdom, there are many ways to solve puzzles. Echoes of Wisdom also has key components of the classics, including traditional dungeons and Heart Pieces.</p><p>All long-time fans should play Echoes of Wisdom, but it would also make for a great first Zelda game for newcomers.

This means that you aren't guaranteed to get a North American edition of the Switch games you order from Woot. All Nintendo Switch consoles are region-free, and Nintendo includes multiple language options in most games, including English in all of the Switch games listed in this article. If you get an international import, the only visible difference is the ratings board logo on the box, which is always ESRB for North American releases.</p><p>When it comes to actually playing the game, you won't notice any differences between the North American, UK, Japanese versions, etc. The one potential snag is with DLC. For example, if you buy the UK edition of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, any DLC you purchase in the future must be from the UK eShop. North American Switch owners can easily create UK and Japanese eShop user accounts on Switch, so this is more of a potential annoyance than anything else, but it's worth keeping in mind. That said, most of the games above--and first-party Switch games in general--are fully self-contained and don't offer DLC.</p><p>Of the games on sale at Woot, four of them have notable add-on content: Smash Bros., Luigi's Mansion 3, and Pokemon Sword and Shield.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="153760768" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

			<p>In a new announcement, Microsoft has announced that three major Call of Duty games will be available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> via <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQjwgrO4BhC2ARIsAKQ7zUnPqwr0nqsAi0fDZv1FPmufzq9uHWa6WGu-XD0qK8yySUy4burJP8MaAne7EALw_wcB_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmm3j0z1q0_SEM__k_Cj0KCQjwgrO4BhC2ARIsAKQ7zUnPqwr0nqsAi0fDZv1FPmufzq9uHWa6WGu-XD0qK8yySUy4burJP8MaAne7EALw_wcB_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgrO4BhC2ARIsAKQ7zUnPqwr0nqsAi0fDZv1FPmufzq9uHWa6WGu-XD0qK8yySUy4burJP8MaAne7EALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> Ultimate from 25 October 2024. This is a huge occasion for those who want to play Call of Duty but don't want to pay the hefty price tag that often comes along with the games. As we already know, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a day-one release for Xbox Game Pass, but having these games available via Xbox Cloud Gaming means those with less powerful rigs will be able to dive into them.</p>
<p>Alongside Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone, all of which will be available to stream via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. This update will be rolled out as of 10 AM PDT / 1 PM EDT / 6 PM BST. For a lot of Game Pass Ultimate users, this update won't matter too much, as Modern Warfare III has been available since July, and Warzone is equally available and free to play regardless of what platform you play it on. However, these games were not previously available for streaming, which is what makes this announcement a big deal, especially as Microsoft is now trying to push more for Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>
<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is available on Xbox consoles, PC, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Meta Quest, and finally, select Samsung TVs. To be able to stream these games in the first place means that Microsoft will have had to make a deal with Ubisoft. Although they had made a <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-resctructures-activision-blizzard-deal/">deal in the past</a>, it was actually in the reverse order. Instead, Microsoft sold the streaming rights of Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft, allowing them to stream the games for 15 years. Completing this deal means that Ubisoft has the right to stream games like Call of Duty through the Ubisoft+ service.</p>
<p>Because of this deal, they likely had to create a new deal that allowed Microsoft to have some form of power again over the contract so that they could equally stream the games of a company that they outright acquired.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 isn't too far away, with the game set to release on 25 October, meaning that those eager to play the game using Xbox Cloud Gaming will be able to stream it on the day one release of the highly anticipated title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mythic-games-files-liquidation-end-controversial-company<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mythic Games has filed for liquidation (aka bankruptcy). This final note in the board game developer's history is an unsurprising one. Their history is a long one of miscommunication with customers, delays, troubled crowdfunding campaigns, and lawsuits.</p>
<h2>The Mythic Games Liquidation Announcement</h2>
<p>The liquidation of Mythic Games was made public by a news report by French website <a href="https://annonces-legales.leparisien.fr/annonce/23cba43f-8a82-48c1-8f57-6a2285e239c3">Le Parisien</a>. According to the report, the decision was made on October 1, 2024. Mythic's co-founder, Leonidas Vesperini, will be acting as liquidator.</p>

<p>These controversies and issues are numerous. They include underwhelming or unsatisfactory miniatures and components for expansions to <em>Super Fantasy Brawl</em> and legal action <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2348051/right-of-reply-from-pascal-bernards-ip-dispute-aut">regarding royalties</a> in <em>Time of Legend: Joan of Arc</em>.</p>
<p>This history includes their landmark achievement: a crowdfunding campaign for an officially licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-board-game-wont-ship-unless-backers-pony-up-more-money" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Darkest Dungeon </em>board game</a>. By all accounts, it was a major Kickstarter success raising more than $5.6 million. But after two years of production issues, the studio asked for more money from their backers to ship the game. This was done after backers had paid shipping costs.</p>
<p>This behavior was frequent with Mythic Games. Products arriving significantly late. Games made with inferior or inconsistent materials. While forces outside of their control did play a factor such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Mythic was synonymous with development issues before such hardships exacerbated their troubles.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-fantasy-brawl-board-set-up.jpg?itok=gfwTtme- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-fantasy-brawl-board-set-up.jpg?itok=ue1QzB7p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Financial struggles were so dire for Mythic Games that they sold some of their board game IP <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/01/27/mythic-games-fails-to-deliver-on-two-kickstarter-projects-worth-3-2m-sells-ip-to-cmon/">to CMON</a> in January of this year. This sale included <em>Hel: The Last Saga</em> and <em>Anastyr</em>, which was done to get both projects into production.</p>
<p>By contrast, CMON has a more steady hand on the wheel. They have experience with crowdfunding platforms <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-announces-future-games-coming-exclusively-to-gamefound" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like Gamefound</a> and have shepherded many beloved tabletop series like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/zombicide-dceased-brings-anti-life-to-table" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the fate of Mythic Games' outstanding board game projects is unclear.</p>

Game Freak — which develops the main lineup of <em>Pokémon</em> video games — <a href="https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/info20241010.pdf">confirmed the breach</a> in a statement, saying (per a machine translation from Japanese) that it was the result of “unauthorized access to our servers by a third party” and dated back to August of 2024.</p><p>Game Freak said the leaked personal information — which it characterizes as names and company email addresses — included around 2,600 items. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/465710/pokemon-game-freak-leak-hack">As <em>Polygon</em> notes</a>, however, the breach appears to include much more than employee information. Redditors and others say they’ve unearthed source code from previous games as well as unused pokémon designs and other things that were scrapped during the development process of those games. They’ve allegedly found more limited detail about future projects, including some codenames for future games.</p><p>There are no apparent reports of direct leaks from the other companies involved in <em>Pokémon</em> as part of this breach, including Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and the jointly owned Pokémon Company.</p><p>Game Freak’s statement, which is dated to October 10th but, according to <em>Polygon,</em> appeared on the 13th, says the server has since been secured and that the company is taking steps to bolster its security measures. Here’s the full machine translation:</p><div><blockquote><p>October 10, 2024</p><p>Game Freak Inc.</p><p>Notice and apology regarding the leak of personal information due to unauthorized access</p><p>Game Freak Inc. (Headquarters: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, CEO: Satoshi Tajiri, hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) has discovered that the personal information of our employees and others was leaked in connection with unauthorized access to our server by a third party in August 2024.</p><p>We sincerely apologize for the great inconvenience and concern caused to all concerned parties.</p><p>1.

<p>From Warcraft to Resident Evil, the world of video game film adaptations runs the gambit. They’re either downright terrible, like one we’ll mention briefly below, or they’re serviceable adaptations that prove entertaining to watch; there’s very little in between.

<h2 id="h-what-is-the-highest-rated-video-game-movie-of-all-time">What is the Highest Rated Video Game Movie of All Time?</h2>



<p>Did you know the film <strong>Werewolves Within</strong>, starring Milana Vayntrub and Sam Richardson, is based on a video game of the same name? I didn’t know that, despite absolutely loving the movie. The game was a multiplayer VR title developed by Red Storm Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, in which players would need to use social deduction to figure out which player was the werewolf before they could slay everyone.</p>



<p>Well, the movie is considered one of the best video game film adaptations of all time, and I agree somewhat. It’s exceptional!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-lowest-rated-video-game-movie-of-all-time">What is the Lowest Rated Video Game Movie of All Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Postal</strong>, the 2007 film by Uwe Boll, is often considered one of the worst video game film adaptations ever made, and yeah, it’s terrible. Starring Zack Ward and Chris Coppola, Postal follows a trailer park resident who helps a cult leader while dealing with terrorist plots. It’s an absolute mess of a film that somehow comes across as offensive in all the worst ways.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pc-gamer-games-media<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote a piece last year about video game website headlines, and how the quest for SEO prominence and a reliance on "clickbait" was making so many of them borderline unreadable</a>. I think about that story almost every day as I scan the internet for news, because almost every day I am forced to read terrible headlines that are quite frankly exhausting to try to decipher.</p><p>As I hack through my feed like a Victorian-era explorer tripping through a jungle with a blunt machete, there are always exceptions. And a lot of those exceptions come from one website: PC Gamer. So in the interests of balancing out my criticisms, I thought I'd give them a little shout out here.</p><p>While other sites engineer their headlines like the villain of a narrative-based puzzle game, and render the subject matter so opaque you're forced to click through just to find out what the hell they're talking about, lately it seems like PC Gamer's heds have simply gone the other direction, using entire sentences to spell out a story's content with as much detail as possible, clickbait be damned.</p><p>Take some recent headlines:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/satisfactory-1-0-finally-has-mod-support-and-the-revamped-mod-manager-now-supports-dedicated-servers-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satisfactory 1.0 finally has mod support, and the revamped mod manager now supports dedicated servers too</a></strong></p><p>This one would probably have appeared on another site as something like "Steam's Strategy Smash Gets A Big Update", or "Fans Of Steam Game Rejoice At Online Feature News". Here, though, it just...says it all.&nbsp;</p><p>As does this one:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/former-gta-dev-says-gta-6-has-no-competition-so-wont-release-until-rockstars-100-percent-happy-before-cracking-a-joke-about-the-pc-version-2027-for-you-im-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Former GTA dev says GTA 6 has 'no competition' so won't release until Rockstar's '100% happy', before cracking a joke about the PC version: '2027 for you I'm afraid'</a></strong></p><p>Not sure it's news, to be honest, but I appreciate the clarity on the blog's subject matter regardless. If I <em>had </em>clicked on it, I'd have known exactly what I was getting myself in for.&nbsp;</p><p>A third headline from last week reads:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/thanks-to-its-all-encompassing-randomizer-mod-deus-ex-has-gotten-a-festive-halloween-update-with-game-modes-and-modifiers-to-turn-it-into-a-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thanks to its all-encompassing Randomizer mod, Deus Ex has gotten a festive Halloween update with game modes and modifiers to turn it into a survival horror game</a></strong></p><p>Again, thank you, I was fully prepared for everything this blog was going to cover, and upon reading it was not disappointed in the slightest.</p><p>For a slightly more recent example, how about this one from Saturday, which reads...uh...:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/theres-a-future-where-you-and-your-graphics-card-decide-what-a-game-looks-like-not-the-developers/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There's a future where you and your graphics card decide what a game looks like, not the developers</a></strong></p><p>OK, well...yikes, you can't win 'em all I guess. Look, I said <em>most </em>headlines have been excellent, not <em>all </em>of them. </p><p>I have no idea how this is going for the site's traffic, or why PC Gamer's editorial team decided to buck an industry-wide trend (I contacted them a few times but they never got back to me), but as someone who spends most of his time reading websites instead of writing for them, I just wanted to publicly say how appreciative I am of a website that doesn't treat me like some chud who has to be tricked into reading any of its (quite often very good) blogs.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong> <strong>6:26pm, October 14</strong>: Some background! PC Gamer's Strategic Director Evan Lahti tells Aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>It's not typically great writing hygiene to make a headline really long, but in most cases it gives us enough room to achieve this kind of conversational voice we've come to enjoy, that lets us get a piece of hard information down and then sarcasm alongside it, or some setup/payoff combination like that. So I guess it's mainly a voice thing, in many of those stories. But from a reader behavior POV longer headlines do occupy more space on some platforms, like Google Discover - obviously they get cut off at a certain character count, but in some cases we think that an ellipsis at the end of a HL can be a source of curiosity, not that we're engineering that or something.</p><p>The other broad thing we think about is the homogeneity of the media environment at large, wanting to find ways to become and remain distinct, not just to our peers in gaming but the internet at large. Everyone's been playing from the same playbook for roughly a decade, as you note the best SEO techniques are known, and any new ones are immediately recognized and dispersed, "SEO voice" absolutely sucks, and in that environment where everyone's chasing that (I'm sure you can relate), you have to have a special sauce.</p><p>It's definitely not a silver bullet or something, we still feel the changes in the the sudden, arbitrary shifts in the algorithmic sea like everyone else, of course. But we're having fun, and clearly you are too, which is great to see.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It <em>is </em>great!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Bungie and Netease Games have partnered up for Destiny: Rising, a mobile phone based shooter that will be playable in third and first person. To avoid issues with the years of lore that has been built up through Destiny and Destiny 2, Destiny: Rising will be set in an alternate timeline. There will be a Destiny Rising closed alpha taking place as well from November 1st, though it will be limited to North America.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising Developer Preview | &quot;What is Destiny: Rising?&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQPomw5UBCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The alternate timeline is based in a time way before the setting familiar to those who have played the main Destiny Games, with it being set before the Last City has been built. Players will take control of various characters from a roster that will keep growing, but they will not be based on the classes of Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. Instead these characters will have their own abilities. Some of the characters players will get to use include Ikora Rey, Iron Lord Jolder, and Kabr. The main protagonist will be a character called Wolf that players will be able to customise.</p>
<p>The closed alpha for Destiny: Rising will contain both PvE and PvP. PvE modes will include campaign missions,&nbsp; free roam exploration, Haven Ops Strike missions, and raid-like Gauntlet Ops. There are also new modes which are Morgran’s Prey, Legacy, and Realms of the IX, which will be detailed when the closed alpha is launched. The PvP mode will have a Destiny: Rising exclusive mode called Shifting Gates, though again details released later. The recommended specs and devices include:</p>

<ul>
<li><u>Android Devices:</u>&nbsp;Snapdragon 845 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPhone:</u>&nbsp;iPhone 8 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPads:&nbsp;</u></li>
<li>iPad (8th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro (10.5-inch)（2017） or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro (11-inch, 1st generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad mini (5th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Air (3rd generation) or newer</li>
</ul>
<p>To register for the Closed Alpha you need to head to<a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/index.html?page=2"> playdestinyrising.com.</a></p>

<p>The 2024 PGL Wallachia Season 2 officially ended this weekend, with some of the best teams in Dota 2 competing against each other. The event not only gave fans their fix of competitive Dota action but even had some altercations between players.</p>



<p>So, who won the 2024 PGL Wallachia Season 2 tournament series?</p>



<h2 id="h-2024-pgl-wallachia-season-2-winner">2024 PGL Wallachia Season 2 Winner</h2>



<p>The winner of the PGL Wallachia Season 2 tournament was HEROIC. The team walked away with $300,000 in prizing. The entire prize pool as a whole was $1,000,000.</p>



<p>The event took place in Bucharest, Romania, and featured 16 of the best Dota 2 teams.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-placements">All Placements</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here is the official list of placements for the 2024 PGL Wallachia Season 2 tournament:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st:</strong> HEROIC</li>



<li><strong>2nd:</strong> Team Falcons</li>



<li><strong>3rd:</strong> Tundra Esports</li>



<li><strong>4th:</strong> Natus Vincere</li>



<li><strong>5th:</strong> Nouns Esports</li>



<li><strong>6th:</strong> beastcoast</li>



<li><strong>7th:</strong> Infinity</li>



<li><strong>8th:</strong> AVULUS</li>



<li><strong>9th:</strong> Alliance</li>



<li><strong>10th:</strong> Azure Ray</li>



<li><strong>11th:</strong> Invictus Gaming</li>



<li><strong>12th:</strong> L1GA TEAM</li>



<li><strong>13th:</strong> MOUZ</li>



<li><strong>14th:</strong> Nigma Galaxy</li>



<li><strong>15th:</strong> Apex Genesis</li>



<li><strong>16th:</strong> Team Waska</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-altercation-between-avulus-and-team-falcons">Altercation Between AVULUS and Team Falcons</h2>



<p>The event did not go as smoothly, though, as some may have thought it would. On October 6, just before Team Falcons and AVULUS were set to compete against each other, players from each team got into an altercation in the hotel lobby.</p>



<p>Team Falcon’s ATF and AVULUS’s SoNNeikO went at it, which resulted in a Level 3 Draft Penalty (110 seconds time lost in draft). This overtly led to AVULUS’s loss, as Team Falcons beat the team 2-0.</p>



<p>Team Falcons then released a statement claiming that SoNNeikO approached ATF in the hotel lobby and threatened him with physical violence. SoNNeikO then came forward claiming that ATF took their interaction the wrong way.</p>



<p>Regardless, the altercation resulted in a penalty that, in the end, hurt AVULUS on the battlefield.</p>

		<p>Microsoft has announced that three tentpole Call of Duty games will be available for Xbox Cloud Gaming via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> later this month. This includes the brand new launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on day one on 25th October.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023)</a> and the free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone will be available for streaming via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, rolling out to all players from 6PM BST on 25th October.</p>


<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is available across Xbox consoles, PC, Android and iOS, of course, but it’s also available on select Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV and Meta Quest.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that, in order to get this to happen, Microsoft will have had to cut a deal with Ubisoft. The company had to sell the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/22/microsoft-and-ubisoft-agree-streaming-rights-for-activision-blizzard-games/">streaming rights to the catalogue of Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft</a> last year, a move that was trying to placate antsy regulators to let them complete the purchase of the Call of Duty publisher. It worked, of course, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft then able to close the deal almost exactly a year ago</a>.</p>
<p>Modern Warfare III is already <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-comes-to-game-pass-july-24th/">available via Game Pass since July</a>, though not for streaming. The bigger announcement earlier this year, was that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/">Black Ops 6 will be a day one launch into Xbox Game Pass</a>, with Microsoft gambling on the potential growth and engagement for the streaming platform vs. the truckloads of money they’ll initially miss out on for every subscriber… except that they then changed the bargain on what Game Pass will get you. You now need Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to get day one game launches.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 leans into all of the usual tropes and expectations of Black Ops series, with double crossing subterfuge and more through the campaign, set in the 1990s after the end of the Cold War. George HW Bush is President, and there’s lies and more swirling around that you’ll dip your toes into. The campaign is sure to be another rollicking ride of gunfire and explosions, and that will absolutely carry on over to the full multiplayer game, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/see-the-black-ops-6-zombies-gameplay-reveal-and-its-definitely-round-based/">the round-base zombies mode</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sands-steam-next-fest-demo-available-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SAND is the latest game to be published by tinyBuild and is shaping up to be a multiplayer mech FPS with PVPVE gameplay. This title did get a demo just before <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-sorcery-pvpve-extraction-arpg-gets-alpha-demo-for-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a> officially started, and players will now be able to dive into the world of Mech vs. Mech Warfare in the Steam Next Fest demo. This will allow people to team up with their friends and experience the diesel-punk world of SAND in the new public demo for the upcoming open-world FPS. People will be able to play the game in up to a team of six players and are able to customize their traveling fortresses and battle it out against each other in the demo.</p>
<p>This title is being published by tinyBuild, an iconic company that started off as an indie game developer and has managed to work their way up into a developer-publisher brand. They are behind games such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, and Speedrunners. For this title, they have teamed up with TowerHaus, a game development and outsourcing studio based in Kyiv, Ukraine. Alongside them is Hologryph, a studio based in Lviv, Ukraine. After creating successful games such as Party Hard, Hello Neighbor, and Secret Neighbor, they work together to create SAND.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure whether you want to commit to the demo just yet, tinyBuild uploaded a seven-minute video onto YouTube that showcases the gameplay in its rawest form. In it, players are introduced to Tramplers, mechanical walkers that explore the ruins of a destroyed planet. This game features a massive, procedurally generated world where players have to work to survive encounters against rival smugglers, as well as take part in Trampler battles. If you manage to survive, you then have to find your way off of the planet with any valuables that you may have found during your exploration.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAND DEMO | 7 minutes of raw gameplay footage | Play Now On Steam" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/abHXuNB-bks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who are uncertain about being stuck inside a metal box, don't panic. There is the opportunity to disembark the Trampler and explore the dunes on foot, which will allow you to participate in close-quarter combat during fights for resources and city raids. Or, if you feel like being a nuisance to other people, you can steal the opposition's Trampler and ruin their day. As you progress, you'll be given the option to upgrade the Trampler's power, armor, weapons, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1431300/Sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAND is available to be wishlisted on Steam</a>, and the demo for this game is currently available for players to dive into.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-escape-from-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-best-games-like-escape-from-tarkov%E2%94%82tarkov-alternatives-in-2024.1009449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-escape-from-tarkov/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov is widely considered the best extraction shooter game ever made. It has spearheaded the growth of the genre over the last ten years, and no game that has been released to compete against it has come close. It’s one of the most challenging games you’ll ever play, but some gamers appreciate that. In this list, we’re breaking down the best games like Escape from Tarkov, to give you an idea of who is trying to compete against this pioneering title.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hunting for a new Tarkov alternative or a game like Tarkov that’s not as tough, read on – we’ve got every title you need below. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-games-like-tarkov">What Are The Best Games Like Tarkov?</h2>



<p>If you want to invest time and effort in learning a new extraction shooter, you’ll be ecstatic to know that there are many games like Tarkov out there. This list represents the best alternatives you’ll find anywhere online in 2024.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-incursion-red-river">5. Incursion Red River</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Incursion Red River is a single-player and co-op extraction shooter with no PvP combat but plenty in the way of engaging gameplay and entertaining value for money. It was released in early access in April 2024, allowing players to take on a Vietnamese adventure, dodging bullets and seeking loot either with friends or alone.</p>



<p>It’s a great extraction shooter with some sumptuous visuals, but it’s nowhere near as polished as the competitors out there. That’s because it’s still an alpha product – but it’s getting there and if you invest now, you’ll be getting in early.</p>







<h3 id="h-4-hunt-showdown">4. Hunt: Showdown</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hunt: Showdown was first released in 2018, and it remains a popular enough game today. In Hunt, players are tasked with entering an open-world environment, fighting against other players and AI-based opponents, completing tasks, collecting bounties, and then extracting successfully from the map. </p>



<p>Does that sound similar? It’s a different aesthetic entirely, but it’s one of the best Tarkov alternatives.</p>







<figure></figure>







<p>Level Zero: Extraction is a shooter that’s played by some of Tarkov’s most prominent content creators. It’s more supernatural than Escape from Tarkov, but it’s a dramatically similar title as a whole. In Level Zero, players must survive against human enemies <strong>and </strong>monsters, which adds a unique twist to the typical extraction operating model.</p>



<p>It’s an early access game that was released in August 2024, which makes it one of the newest and best games like Escape from Tarkov on the market right now. It’s only available on PC, though. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-arena-breakout-infinite">2. Arena Breakout Infinite</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Arena Breakout Infinite is such a similar game to Tarkov that the developer was accused of ‘ripping off’ Battlestate Games in numerous ways. Those allegations were thrown out, though. Left in their place is a phenomenal extraction shooter that tops Escape from Tarkov in many ways. It looks phenomenal on screen and plays well, too.</p>



<p>In ‘ABI’, players are tasked with exploring various maps, securing the best loot, and winning fights against human and AI enemies, which is where the similarities to Tarkov start to creep in. If you’re looking for a brilliant Tarkov alternative in 2024, don’t sleep on Arena Breakout Infinite.</p>



<p>It’s also the only game on this list that’s free to play, so that’s a <strong>huge </strong>win.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-gray-zone-warfare">1. Gray Zone Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gray Zone Warfare is the perfect game like Tarkov for anyone wanting to scratch that tactical shooter itch. It’s not <strong>exactly </strong>an extraction shooter, but it’s remarkably similar to Escape from Tarkov in many ways. It features a gameplay loop that sees players deploy into a wide area, loot and kill to their heart’s content, complete tasks, and then successfully get back to their camp to bank their loot.</p>



<p>It differs in many ways, too. There isn’t a time limit, it’s an open-world game, and it’s more about the tactical shooter experience than the extraction shooter experience. It’s a solid game that was released in early access in 2023 by MADFINGER Games, and it skyrocketed in popularity.</p>



<p>It’s brutally realistic and deeply immersive, and it has enough meat on the bones to keep the average Tarkov fan engaged for hours on end. There’s no doubt that it’s one of the best games like Escape from Tarkov.</p>

<p>What do you think? Are there any other games that should have made this list?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/welcome-to-strinova-a-next-gen-anime-shooter-with-a-unique-mechanic.1009440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/welcome-to-strinova-a-next-gen-anime-shooter-with-a-unique-mechanic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s no secret that the hero shooter genre has become a crowded market. So when the creative team at iDreamSky started planning their next game, they knew they needed to differentiate themselves.</p><p>The result was Strinova, a third-person shooter with an anime art style and unique mechanic. It’s called “Stringification” and allows you to shift between 2D and 3D versions of your character. You become paper-thin and are much harder to see and shoot. You can hover above the ground to see more of the battlefield or stick to walls to travel across or up them. </p><p>“Usually, for a player to dodge bullets or evade attacks, you move faster, jump, or hide behind a wall. This is very traditional, and almost every game does that already,” said Alan Zhang, producer of Strinova and Vice President of Game Development at iDreamSky. “Stringify is an innovation. The new mechanics, we believe, allow players higher tolerance to move around the blocks, while providing a smoother and faster experience during a match with less risk of getting shot.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/stringify-floating-1728671899001.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you want to get to a higher vantage point, you can stick yourself to a wall and move directly up it, reaching the high point in a matter of seconds without attracting attention to yourself. If an enemy gets the drop on you, you can become super thin, making aiming harder and giving you a chance to escape. It also makes camping more difficult.</p><p>“If I camp on one spot, I can only see one dimension," said Jeff Lyndon, President of iDreamSky.  “I won’t be able to cover the wall. If someone is sticking themselves to the wall and walking straight at me, I won’t be able to see them. You need to change your angle to make sure you’re covering the area.”</p><p>Strinova introduces a brand-new universe, where characters belong to one of three factions — P.U.S., The Scissors, and Urbino — who are fighting over Energy Crystals (the battlefield targets), and they have different belief systems and objectives. P.U.S., who stick to the present, control most Energy Crystals of the current universe. The Scissors, who believe the past allows them a better life, want to unlock more Energy Crystals that allow them to return to Earth. While Urbino, the neutral mercenary faction, believe all should move on to a better future, so they work with either side to fight for Energy Crystals.</p><p>The core mode of Strinova is Demolition, a 5v5 mode where an attacking team tries to plant a bomb while a defending team tries to stop them to protect the Energy Crystals. Characters from the P.U.S. faction can only be on the defensive team, while characters from The Scissors can only be on the attacking team, but characters from Urbino can be on either side.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/1v1-gameplay-1728671930765.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“If you’re on the attack side, you probably would be missing defensive maneuvers. So you can ask your teammates to play as an Urbino character who has those capabilities,” Alan said. “Or if you’re playing as the defensive side and you’re lacking the ability to get more information about how the match is being played or where your opponent is, you’ll ask your teammate to play an Urbino character who can do that.”</p><p>Demolition is played in rounds, and after each round, your performance is assessed and you’re given points. You can use those points to upgrade your character in certain skill trees and unlock Awakening Skills that fundamentally change the way your character plays.</p><p>Each character has two distinct Awakening Skills. For example, the Urbino character Audrey starts with a heavy machine gun you can shoot on the run with lots of ammo but a wide spread. Or you can hunker down and place the machine gun like a turret, which raises accuracy but limits mobility.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/audrey-turret-mode-1728671964329.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Audrey’s first Awakening Skill allows the turret to slide side-to-side, providing mobility and the ability to change its firing angle. Her other Awakening Skill allows her to turn her turret into an autonomous sentry, allowing you to cover two points at once.</p><p>All of your skill tree selections and Awakening Skills reset after the match is over, so you can choose your upgrades based on what that specific match calls for. With unique abilities and Awakening Skills, even two characters who fill the same general role can end up playing very differently.</p><p>While characters and their roles were primarily built around the Demolition mode, that isn’t the only mode available. Escort also involves an attacking team and defending team, with one trying to push a payload forward while the other tries to stop it. The closed beta that launched October 10 added Team Deathmatch, a 7v7 match with the goal of reaching a particular kill count.</p><p>After two rounds of closed beta tests in select markets, the Strinova team has already made plenty of changes based on player feedback. But they want to hear even more, so they’re currently running another closed beta you can join. They stressed that they take community feedback very seriously and want to do all they can to give players the experience they want.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/group-gameplay-1728672009971.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We listen to the community. We create content based on what we think is cool, and we make and we test,” Jeff said. “If the community likes it, we’ll continue developing it. If the community doesn’t like it, we modify, we correct it.”</p><p>The Strinova team has added lots of content through their past beta tests, and they plan to release new maps and/or characters every two to three months. There are also collaborations with other IPs in the works, though it’s too early for the team to share details.</p><p>“Without disclosing who we’re working with, we are going to have IP collaborations on a scheduled basis,” Jeff said. “These collaborations will not just be adding a new skin. It could be coming in with a new game mode, it could be a new map, but it’s something that adds more complexity and content for players.”</p><p>Strinova is currently planned for a PC release in the very near future, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282270/Strinova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wishlist it on Steam now</u></a>. The team plans to expand the release to consoles in 2025, with cross-progression for both platforms, so you’ll never have to start over from scratch. A mobile version of Strinova is also being developed and will be released in the near future.</p><p>The PC closed beta is live now and will run until October 21 at 5 pm (UTC+0). That’s 1 pm ET / noon CT / 10 am PT. You can check out the game’s <a href="https://x.com/Strinova_EN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/strinova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord</u></a>, or <a href="https://strinova.link/2XbSzu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official website</a> to get all the info.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-multiversus-trailer-showcases-nubia-queen-of-the-amazons/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new MultiVersus trailer has dropped, showcasing the gameplay of DC's Nubia, Queen of the Amazons and protector of Themyscira. She is the latest playable character to join the extensive roster and will be available to play as of October 15, during Season 3: Sugar Spice &amp; Everything Nice. This will make her the 31st addition to the game, with there already being an extensive list of characters from The Iron Giant, Powerpuff Girls, Jason Voorhees, and Arya Stark, for example. There's something for everyone, depending on whether you prefer to be an assassin, bruiser, or mage.</p>
<p><iframe title="MultiVersus - Official Nubia &quot;Long Live the Queen&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYsJMRa5Tw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those wanting to know more about Nubia, she is a close-combat fighter but leans heavily into her role as an Assassin, as she utilizes her Staff of Understanding, a long-range spear with a sprinkle of Godly power, to make her a powerhouse on the battlefield. To celebrate the release of Nubia, a new trailer has been dropped to showcase Nubia's capabilities, and it shows off her ability to create Shockwaves using her staff, as well as her ability to kick, slash, and strike.</p>
<p>To celebrate her release, there will also be a character variant called Future State Nubia, which will be available to purchase on October 15 along with her release. Nubia isn't the only thing arriving to MultiVersus, as there will be a new battle-torn "Destroyed" version of the City of Townsville map from The Powerpuff Girls series, which will equally be available as of October 15. For those wanting to obtain Nubia, she will be available on October 15 as a standalone purchase for 1,250 Gleamium, which is the in-game currency. Alternatively, you can use a character ticket for $9.99. If you want to obtain Nubia and some extra features to show off your prowess, you can buy the Future Queen: Nubia's Strength Pack for $29.99, which includes a character skin, announcer pack, taunt, and two badges.</p>
<p>As of October 18 starting at 5 PM PDT / 8 PM EDT, Nubia will be available for purchase with 6,000 Fighter Currency, a currency which can be earned in-game and can be used to obtain new fighters. To those who own the Founder's Pack, you will be required to use character tickets before you can obtain new characters with the fighter currency or Gleamium, so make sure to choose wisely when using your character tickets to ensure you get the ones that interest you the most.</p>
<p>MultiVersus is a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free-to-play platform fighter</a> that is available to those on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It features full cross-play and cross-progression support, and there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-multiversus-leaks-skins-stages-renders/">characters constantly being added</a> to the game to keep the game fresh and exciting. Make sure to check out the trailer for Nubia's arrival to MultiVersus above.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A brand new event has started in GTA Online, where players will be able to fight off zombies in a new Left 4 Dead-style event. This leads players to the starting area of GTA 5, and players will now get to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3999181oaa34ko/fight-off-the-north-yankton-nightmare-in-the-new-ludendorff-cemetery-s#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%20in,new%20Ludendorff%20Cemetery%20Survival%20mode." target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience the Ludendorff Cemetary Survival Mode</a>, which was released on October 10. Since then, 400,000 people have eagerly logged into the game to play the new game mode, where players got to return to North Yankton. For many, this will be quite nostalgic, as this is where all the initial action of the story takes place, and players get to play as Trevor and Michael as they pull off a bank heist.</p>
<p><iframe title="New GTA Online Ludendorff Cemetery Survival" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDX66qVWCXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For many years, GTA Online players weren't able to explore North Yankton without using glitches to get into the area, as it's technically disconnected from the rest of Los Santos. As a result, this is the first time ever in GTA Online's history that players are able to freely go to North Yankton without having to try and break their game to get there.</p>
<p>As a result of North Yankton now being available for players to explore, over 400,000 GTA Online players have been coming back to the game to jump into the new game mode within the first 24 hours. In the past couple of days, the number has since shot up to over one million. With these numbers being so high, it's now remarked that player numbers for this event are 270% higher compared to GTA Online's last massive-scale event, Assault on ATT-16.</p>
<p>It's possible that the reason this event is doing better is because it's a wave-based zombie survival mode, which is often a popular genre, especially in games like Call of Duty and even Rockstar's very own Red Dead Redemption, which was recently announced to be making its arrival onto PC, including the iconic Undead NIghtmare add-on. However, this event will at least allow players to team up with each other, as the upcoming PC release of the game won't include any multiplayer elements.</p>
<p>Considering that GTA 5 is now over ten years old, the game continues to remain a mainstay across all platforms, and it's possible that it will gain more hype and attraction in the upcoming months before the release of GTA 6, which still remains a large mystery, as there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-map-two-times-bigger-gta-v/">barely any details</a> out about the upcoming game. While it's said that there may be a release period at the end of 2025, it's possible that it may be even later than that, depending on setbacks and the development budget.</p>

Nomada Studios has refined their game design craft, delivering a brief, but deeply moving experience. A stellar blend of measured game design and phenomenal art direction makes it one of the best games of the year.</p>
<h2><em>Neva</em> Review – A Girl and Her Pup</h2>
<p>You play as Alba, a young woman in an enchanted forest. When the forest is overrun by a wave of corruption, its protective guardian, a giant wolf, dies protecting Alba and its pup. Alba adopts the pup, names her Neva, and embarks on a journey to make the world right again. All the while, Alba watches her new friend grow and mature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-spring-time-forest.jpg?itok=lulu-xZu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-spring-time-forest.jpg?itok=YuNyUSbs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every level looks like this. Hats off to the art direction.</figcaption></figure><p>The first early moments of the game do a fantastic job of setting up the tone and core themes. At its heart, it is an inversion of Nomada Studio's first title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gris-review-brilliantly-beautiful-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Gris</em></a>. Where that game was a melancholic meditation on loss, death, and depression, <em>Neva</em> is a celebration of life, parenthood, and the joys of nature.</p>
<p>It is a celebration that bursts off the screen through stunningly beautiful art direction. Fantastically stylized tableaus of warm colors and striking vistas. Coupled with some fluid and responsive animations, it comes together to create an experience somewhere between a game and a watercolor painting in motion.</p>
<p>Contrasting this vibrancy are the more subdued moody color palettes when you wade through corrupted areas. Mountains and forests break away into surreal, abstract vignettes. Nightmarish fields of desolation were torn apart by grasping clawing hands. Once peaceful animals twisted into pained monstrosities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-alba-in-combat.jpg?itok=M80u1NcX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-alba-in-combat.jpg?itok=skzNSDbC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bob, weave, keep moving.</figcaption></figure><p>Through visuals alone, <em>Neva</em> expresses a strong environmentalist narrative, one that can be interpreted both as a call to action against climate change and a meditation on the circle of life through the changing seasons. It is arguably the most overt theme in the game since its chapters are broken up by seasons. Starting in Spring and Summer with bright colors and friendly faces before turning into something akin to a horror experience in Fall and Winter.</p>
<p>What anchors this entire story is the central relationship between the two leads. Alba's furry companion starts as this small pup, wandering around, playing with and investigating everything around her. It is only with Alba's guidance that the pup follows and grows. Yes, there is a dedicated button to calling and petting the dog.</p>
<p>In a way, <em>Neva</em> shares similarities with Team Ico's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-guardian" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a>. Both games are about the growing relationship of a human and a supernatural dog creature. But Nomada Studios handily avoids frustrating situations by keeping the gameplay focused on Alba with her furry friend serving as a guide and aid. It's an elegant solution for interactive storytelling since it allows key moments in the story to land with precision and intention.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-broken-altar-with-monster.jpg?itok=WU07bUSv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-broken-altar-with-monster.jpg?itok=TQwp5hmf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh great, a smaller arena. Reflexes don't fail me now.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Neva</em> Review – Oh The Places You'll Go</h2>
<p><em>Neva</em> continues the proud tradition of the arthouse platformer. You will be spending most of your time moving from location to location, navigating through moderate platforming challenges.</p>
<p>Notably, Nomada Studios has greatly improved the game feel in this title. Alba doesn't just look effortlessly gracious as she twirls through the air, her jumps feel responsive and bouncy. Sword slashes are quick, and pack the right amount of punch. Getting into a chase sequence is packed with balletic tension.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing since <em>Neva</em> is expertly paced. Each level introduces a new twist on the gameplay, explores it, and then wraps it up in a nice bow before the idea overstays its welcome. It helps give each story chapter its own identity and each environment personality. The result is a platforming experience with an effortless sense of flow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-falling-birds.jpg?itok=y2YIYBTV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-falling-birds.jpg?itok=m-Sd7Zul 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just when I think the gameplay is getting stale, these vignettes happen.</figcaption></figure><p>Complementing this platforming is some basic but serviceable hack-and-slash combat. Alba has a simple three-hit combo and a dodge roll. Eventually, she can command Neva to pounce and neutralize enemies, but that's about it.</p>
<p>Whenever enemy encounters happen, they never feel completely frivolous. This is thanks to inventive and creative arena design and a steady introduction of new enemy types. It nails the feeling of having each encounter being a puzzle of priority rather than an extensive chore.</p>
<p>It also helps the fights are designed to be quick and rewarding. Checkpoints are plentiful. Enemy attacks are telegraphed expertly with visually distinct wind-up animations. There's even a rallying mechanic where Alba can regain health by hitting enemies.</p>
<p>Yet, <em>Neva</em> doesn't completely alienate the less dextrous members of its audience. The game has two difficulty modes. Normal mode, the one I played, and story mode, which gives you unlimited health and lowers combat difficulty. It's a great compromise that will help this title age like wine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-nightmare-wolf.jpg?itok=4ho-gk90 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-nightmare-wolf.jpg?itok=0caJEZc5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's so expressive, yet Neva is still pops at the bottom, keeping the whole thing readable. Peak visual design.</figcaption></figure><p>What stuck in my mind after rolling credits on <em>Neva</em> is how it feels so precise in its gameplay and focused on its storytelling. There are plenty of games out there that focus on core gameplay, storytelling, or content by volume. But this game maintains a lean completion time of four hours packed with emotional richness and meticulous technical polish.</p>
<p>In the purest sense of the word, <em>Neva</em> is a game that must be experienced firsthand. It stands alongside the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/journey-five-years-on" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Journey</em></a> with its elegance, brevity, and emotional richness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-giant-monster-chase-sequence.jpg?itok=clAgsKFy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-giant-monster-chase-sequence.jpg?itok=QwHB0A3b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Run. Run. Keep Running!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Neva</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Nomada Studios has made something deeply moving with <em>Neva</em>. A short, but powerful experience about the persistence of nature, the joys and struggles of life, and a great visual tone poem of parenthood. It is one of the best games I've played this year and well worth your time.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Neva</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over 4 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review. </em></p>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Partner Preview digital showcase, which will feature "around 25 minutes" of games when it airs this Thursday, 17th October.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Microsoft's "no-fluff, all-games broadcast" kicks off at 6pm in the UK/10am PT and will feature "over a dozen" new trailers across its 25-minute-ish runtime.
</p>
<p>
There's talk of new game reveals, release date announcements, and new gameplay for upcoming games, with confirmed titles including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>'s The Lake House DLC, Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, and dark-fantasy action game Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.

<p>
Expect at least some chatter about Game Pass too, likely including a bit of fuss around the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-modern-warfare-3-and-warzone-coming-to-xbox-cloud-gaming">imminent arrival</a> of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and Call of Duty: Warzone for Game Pass Ultimate members - news that was shared earlier today as Microsoft celebrates a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">concluding its $69bn Activision Blizzard shopping spree</a>.
</p><p>
If that sounds like an enjoyable way to spend 25 minutes of your time this week, the Xbox Partner Preview can be viewed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a> (4K/60fps footage will be YouTube-only), with British Sign Language, American Sign Language, and audio descriptions all supported - as detailed in Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/14/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024/">announcement post</a>.

            <p>
Bungie has unveiled Destiny: Rising, a free-to-play mobile version of its sci-fi shooter series developed in collaboration with Chinese publisher NetEase, that's set to receive a "limited access closed alpha test" on iOS and Android this November.
</p>
<p>
NetEase initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-moves-to-reassure-destiny-fans-after-securing-usd100m-for-new-game">announced a partnership</a> with Bungie back in 2018, and reports began circulating in 2022 that the two were, in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-netease-reportedly-developing-destiny-mobile-game">working to bring Destiny to mobile</a>. And the fruits of that labour have now been revealed as Destiny: Rising, a "brand-new adventure set in an alternate Destiny timeline, exploring a narrative in the post-Dark Age era".
</p>
<p>
"With the help of legendary Iron Lords," Bungie teases, "humanity has broken free the shackles of tyranny and began to rally together against the alien forces intent on its extinction. Amidst the chaos of this early age for The City, a new generation of Lightbearers, resurrected by mysterious entities known as Ghosts, set out to restore humanity's prominence and secure its future."

<p>
All that'll take the form of a "shared world" experience stretching from the sanctuary of Haven to the "icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift." Single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes are included, with some set to be "familiar to Destiny players", while others are "all-new". NetEase has so far confirmed a mix of PvP and PvE, including campaigns and six-player cooperative strikes.
</p><p>
Destiny: Rising also promises a "diverse roster" of playable characters - including "familiar faces" from Destiny's past and a "host of new, intriguing characters" - all with unique abilities and stories. And if that appeals, the whole thing can be played in first-person or third-person using either a controller or touchscreen - this comes after Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-files-new-virtual-controller-patents-following-destiny-mobile-rumours">filed several patents linked to virtual controls</a> on touch-enabled devices back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Bungie hasn't yet shared a release date for Destiny: Rising, but a closed alpha test is scheduled to run on 1st November, with <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/">registrations now open</a> on the official website.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcement follows a steady dripfeed of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> news - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-teases-destiny-2s-metroidvania-expansion-with-new-concept-art-talksnext-generation-armour">recent confirmation</a> that next year's Codename: Apollo expansion will feature a "Metroidvania-inspired destination" - as Bungie continues its efforts to build enthusiasm for the game's future amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">significant layoffs</a> at the studio.
