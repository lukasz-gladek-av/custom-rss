<p>Sea of Thieves continues to be a massive success for Xbox and PlayStation. According to a new report, Sea of Thieves has sold more than 1 million copies on PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p>



<p>“[T]rusted sources have indicated to me that Sea of Thieves has crossed a million sales on PlayStation since its launch over there, and is most likely higher still since this information came to me,” Jez Corden of <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/phil-spencer-we-have-more-xbox-console-players-than-ever-as-fans-question-microsofts-multi-platform-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central reports</a>.</p>







<p>If the numbers are accurate, Microsoft is looking at an extra $40 million-plus in revenue that it wouldn’t have had if they kept the game exclusive. As Corden astutely states, however, the actual revenue is likely higher due to in-game purchases that can also be made.</p>



<p>The game launched on PS5 on April 30. The game has been available on PC and Xbox since March 2018.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and PlayStation for comment on the rumored sales numbers. Should a response be received, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-feminist-propaganda-politics-twitch-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chinese action-RPG <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is officially a hit, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/black-myth-wukong-breaks-steams-concurrent-single-player-record-within-hours-of-launch-184559634.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM6-oR4EjeU4eldsTz-da3U4XHqeuTAXHL9o-5A4_mejqOrmOxNfBj2gE4YS_YLaZaQVS8hmSzHnzyf4BLT_29P_WboaMSq6XbXu1igYyAfz8RBXaSRqQTfHYMTqFbPMfb6jmxty3nz2Gn-cpIkYci5mKyKcLM1JfS5mgBVAkDzP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking Steam’s concurrent single-player record</a> within hours of release. It’s also embroiled in a culture war that, unlike a great deal of others, is not <em>entirely </em>contrived. Following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports of sexism</a> at developer Game Science last year, the studio sent pre-release code to content creators last week with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-marketing-team-offers-content-creators-a-steam-key-but-bans-feminist-propaganda-and-all-talk-of-covid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a series of stipulations</a>, one of which barred “politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishization, and other content that instigates negative discourse,” as well as mentions of covid and “content related to China's game industry policies.” These are extreme restrictions. They are, however, not that far afield from what content creators sometimes encounter during dealings involving game code.</p><p>It’s important to situate <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> in the broader context of content creation not to minimize the overbearing directive issued by marketers at Game Science collaborator Hero Games, but to understand the forces that can inform creators’ thinking – even slightly – as well as the ways companies try to control the messaging around their games.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s case, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1aKlZvxWxbPOzldSUdc6CaHmoy80Fl7W_wQt-Ex-vl0k/mobilebasic?pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of do’s and don’ts</a> was only issued to content creators, not reviewers at websites and other more traditional publications (who received a different set of guidelines with restrictions largely centered around spoilers). It was also not tied to any sort of contract or sponsored content. As Aftermath understands the situation, Hero Games sent out code with what essentially amounted to a gentle – albeit forcefully worded – suggestion. Aside from denying opportunities in the future, there’s not much the company can do to actually enforce these rules.&nbsp;</p><p>That part immediately struck creators to whom Aftermath spoke as strange. Typically, you don’t encounter rules this specific until you’re in the fine print of a contract for a sponsored stream or video – aka, one in which a company is directly paying a content creator to play a game.&nbsp;</p><p>“The normal language of 'No politics, please don't talk about current events (covid), etc' have always been part of contracts,” longtime Twitch streamer <a href="https://x.com/CohhCarnage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben “Cohh Carnage” Cassell</a> told Aftermath. “That's totally normal and has been in there for years. Even the vulgar language stuff, although I've never seen it enforced. ... I do many sponsored streams, and I've never seen anything about ‘feminist’ anything in any of them. That is new. And definitely very strange."</p><p>"It's only in sponsored, actually-paid stuff when we're signing a contract and agreeing to certain things [that] I ever see 'Don't bring up politics. Don't bring up this. Don't bring up that,'" pirate-themed streamer <a href="https://x.com/0BurkeBlack0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burke Black</a> told Aftermath.</p><p>"The vast majority [of creator emails about game keys] I’ve seen don't require behavioral restrictions," <a href="https://x.com/shannonplante" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shannon Plante</a>, director of business operations for popular Twitch streamer <a href="https://x.com/Sacriel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sacriel</a>, told Aftermath. "Those are usually kept to paid activations, which makes sense [because] they’re paying you. … Typically restrictions would be normal stuff like refraining from abusive conduct, hate speech, [and] sometimes too much swearing depending on the game and brand.”</p><p>A creator who was granted anonymity so as not to lose out on future opportunities shared several such documents with Aftermath. One, for <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, included mandatory streaming language, but only around <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTC disclosures</a> (“Thank you to Epic Games for sponsoring this video” at the beginning of the stream and again every 30 minutes). Another, for <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, included talking points to help advertise the game (“Talk about what makes <em>SMTV: V</em> so interesting to you – the ominous atmosphere, the metal music, demons, etc”) as well as a request that streamers include spoiler tags in their titles. </p><p>A third, for Meta-published VR game <em>Asgard’s Wrath 2</em> was a little stricter, with a list of do’s and don’ts that forbade third-party IP in creators’ content (logos, etc), alcohol consumption, and derogatory, sexual, or explicit comments. The streamer who received it told Aftermath that they nonetheless made “plenty” of sexual comments during the stream and were not penalized.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, while language can at times be restrictive, enforcement is rare.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’ve never experienced a situation where a brand hasn’t paid, but technically I guess if you violate those things it could result in them withholding," said Plante. "It would have to be proven, though, I’m guessing, [because] talent management firms would go after the brand for denial of pay otherwise."</p><p>"I’ve broken the ‘no swearing’ rule by accident a handful of times before and have never seen any enforcement, nor even any negative feedback,” noted Aftermath subscriber (and content creator and writer and actor) <a href="https://x.com/Charalanahzard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alanah Pearce</a> told Aftermath. “Generally if a brand wants to sponsor a creator, they know who that creator is and know their audience [and] can tell when they aren’t being authentic; if you talk about politics or you swear, they wouldn’t want you to stop doing that to the extent that it goes against your established brand."</p><p>But not all companies are created equal in this regard. In May, <a href="https://x.com/JeffHoogland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Hoogland</a>, a <em>Marvel Snap</em> streamer, was invited to join the creator program for upcoming <em>Overwatch</em>-alike <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which, like<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em>, is being published by a Chinese company, NetEase. The program would not have paid Hoogland any money. Despite this, he was sent a “commitment letter,” which Aftermath has viewed. Among other things, it required a signature and included language like "I pledge not to disseminate any content associated with misinformation, hate speech, discrimination, politics, pornography, or other objectionable subjects" and "not to publish any illegal content, distorting game facts with malicious intent or insult to others." Hoogland objected to the “politics” restriction and asked a company representative if that language could be removed. The rep, Hoogland said, ended up ghosting him.</p><p>“Effectively policing what I post on social media in general just to be a part of a creator program is a huge overreach,” Hoogland said. “Code of conduct for no hate speech and hostile stuff is typical [for these sorts of creator programs]. Blanket no 'politics' as an incredibly vague catch-all is a first for me.”</p><p>Game Science and Hero Games have yet to publicly comment on <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s content creation restrictions. They’ve also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/black-myth-wukong-sexism-controversy-interview-no-comment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained tight lipped about other, similar subjects</a>. Aftermath asked the PR firm representing the game on the press side of things, One PR, for more details, but did not receive a response. Given the outcry around <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s approach, however, other companies employing heavy-handed tactics might want to reconsider.</p><p>"Simply put, what that studio is requiring just for a key is absolutely insane," said Plante, "and they should get called out for it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A sequel to Journey to the Savage Planet has been revealed by Raccoon Logic, and the new game is Revenge of the Savage Planet. Revenge of the Savage Planet is due to release in early 2025 for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Revenge of the Savage Planet | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mVjBRZqajYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We’re beyond excited to welcome budding explorers back to the Savage Planet universe. A lot has happened since we launched the original title – both in-game and life, with the whole studio being shuttered during a global pandemic. On the back of this, Raccoon Logic was born, and with it Revenge of the Savage Planet, which may or may not incorporate an element of the journey we all went through. The XBOX showcase today is the tip of the asteroid, and we can’t wait to show everyone the world we’ve created next year.”, </em>said Alex Hutchinson, Creative Director at Raccoon Logic.</p>
<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet will be playable solo and in co-op, including local split screen, and it will have four planets for players to explore. You’ll be tasked with cataloguing the plants and animals of each planet, and you can even capture the animals too. Not every venture will be easy and you will have to fight some dangers out on the planet surfaces. Exploration will net you rewards with all sorts of gear scattered around the place.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">Journey to the Savage Planet Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Journey To The Savage Planet review, Dom wrote,&nbsp;<em>“Few games generate enough excitement, intrigue, or fun to have you hoovering up all the collectibles in order to bag all the trophies and achievements, but Journey to the Savage Planet will have you searching every nook and cranny, leaping seemingly impossible gaps and scanning every last rock, simply because you’ll want to. A rollicking space adventure, Journey to the Savage Planet has the smarts to make you laugh out loud while taking shots at consumerism and big business.”</em></p>

<p>Journey to the Savage Planet was released in 2020 for PC, PS4, and Xbox. Then in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/24/journey-to-the-savage-planet-lands-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-in-february/">February 2023</a>, a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S version was released, and included the DLC, 4K visuals, performance options, and improved photo mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dice-towers-mike-diliso-starts-board-game-company-massive-asterisk-first-project<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new board game company is making its debut. The company is called Massive Asterisk, created by Mike DiLiso. DiLiso is a content creator for the tabletop-focused website The Dice Tower. The first game it will publish is coming to Kickstarter this Fall, and it is packed with 90s nostalgia.</p>

<p>According to Massive Asterisk's <a href="https://massiveasterisk.com/">official website</a>, they are a company dedicated to creating strong theme-driven games with a passion and commitment to quality.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/massive-asterisk-i-made-you-a-mixtape-card-artwork.jpg?itok=shlPIHcv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/massive-asterisk-i-made-you-a-mixtape-card-artwork.jpg?itok=yj6mpUD8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Massive Asterisk's debut board game is titled <em>I Made You A Mixtape</em>. It is a board game set in the 1990s where you try to make an awesome mixtape for the coolest kid in the neighborhood as they leave for college. Whoever makes the best tape gets the grand prize: a <em>Quantum Leap</em> poster signed by Scott Bakula.</p>
<p><em>I Made You A Mixtape</em> was created by both Mike DiLiso and Dan Hughes. It is an easy-to-learn, quick-to-teach drafting game utilizing an 'I cut, you choose' system.</p>
<p>Players slowly create a mixtape of songs on the cards. Players earn points based on how well the tracks flow, their genre consistency, and if both the A-side and B-side of the cassette are balanced in length.</p>
<p>It is designed for 1-4 players and a single game can be finished in 30 minutes. Overall, it is a novel take on a card game with a strong nostalgic appeal to an older Millennial audience.</p>
<p>Mike DiLiso is a content creator and video editor for The Dice Tower. The Dice Tower is a website dedicated to videos, reviews, and podcasts discussing interesting or acclaimed board games across multiple categories. DeLiso is also the co-host of the "Sporadically Board With Mike and Dan" podcast.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>I Made You A Mixtape</em> will launch this November.</p>

It wasn’t at all what I expected out of an open-world crime game, though my experience was pretty limited to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tag/grand-theft-auto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tag/grand-theft-auto"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a></span><em> </em>back then, and I think these days I’d really find a lot to love about it and its atmosphere.<strong> Hell, if you want to stick to that classic feeling, the original version of </strong><em><strong>Mafia </strong></em><strong>is also on sale  right now for just about $5.</strong></p><p><em>Mafia 2 </em>came about a decade later in 2010, and though it got knocked for its linearity—even if in my opinion, it means it doesn’t suffer from open-world bloat— it’s still probably my favorite. I remember being wowed by its production values, a staple which carried over from the original game, and its attention to detail. While other open-world games were certainly upping their fidelity and the sizes of their worlds, <em>Mafia </em>was always a series more interested in the minute details, which always led to interesting wrinkles and systems that flew under the radar despite the franchise’s clear success and longevity.</p><p>In <em>Mafia 2</em>, one of those systems was the ability to interact with certain objects in one of two ways: either neutrally, or in a more violent manner. It was a subtle system that might not have meant much to too many people back in the day, but as far as roleplaying tools that help build immersive worlds and characters, this was absolutely wonderful.</p><p><em>Mafia 2 </em>was also just a tried-and-true mobster story, filled with the kind of deplorable characters and tragic twists one might expect from their favorite mob movie. <strong>Yeah, I’m a </strong><em><strong>Mafia 2 </strong></em><strong>apologist, and you can be too once you pick it up as part of the </strong><em><strong>Mafia Trilogy </strong></em><strong>or on Steam where it’s going for $7.49 right now.</strong></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mafia-iii-the-kotaku-review-1787722761&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-iii-the-kotaku-review-1787722761"><em><strong>Mafia 3</strong></em></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>is the most recent entry, releasing back in 2016, and it and its DLC are now compiled into a </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmafia-iii-definitive-edition%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmafia-iii-definitive-edition%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>definitive edition</strong></a></span><strong> that you can pick up for $7.49.&nbsp;</strong>I admittedly haven’t played this game, but it’s at the top of my to-do list due to its main character, Lincoln Clay. A Black veteran of the Vietnam War, he returns from overseas only to be plunged into a life of crime in the deep South, where he still feels the effects of racism and segregation as he rises through the ranks. Games that are frank in their tackling of subject matter such as institutional racism in America aren’t exactly a dime a dozen, and though <em>Mafia 3 </em>sounds like it has trouble clearing some technical hurdles, I’m more than happy to hear it out.</p><p>Altogether, the <em>Mafia </em>series is one of the more interesting open-world crime franchises, departing from the do-anything zaniness of its closest competitors with more somber, linear stories and some unique systems. Everywhere they could (and maybe <em>should</em>) have zigged, the developers stewarding the series have zagged. I think that makes the series bolder and more unique than a dozen other <em>GTA </em>clones that have come and gone. And after all of this, the <em>Mafia </em>series is still standing, and even has a fresh new game on the horizon, so these games clearly stand the test of time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nearly every ability in the Martian medic’s kit has been balanced in some way. Her primary fire has been reduced to 28 shots per second from its original 34, her lock-on torpedoes that damage enemies and heal teammates have become more powerful, and her speed-boosting Hyper Ring ability has an increased deploy range alongside a shorter cooldown. So while her healing and damage output has been lowered, her abilities have been made more efficient. Those are the kinds of minimal changes you’d expect as Blizzard is still figuring out a new hero, so we’ll see if farther-reaching changes are on the horizon. The team also included several quality-of-life adjustments to how Juno’s abilities are communicated, which you can read about in the patch notes below.</p><figure id="" data-id="0eb76ad65e2cdad6ca8914687bb8c464" data-recommend-id="image://0eb76ad65e2cdad6ca8914687bb8c464" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Juno stands in Midtown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Juno stands in Midtown." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0eb76ad65e2cdad6ca8914687bb8c464" data-recommend-id="image://0eb76ad65e2cdad6ca8914687bb8c464" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Juno stands in Midtown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lifeweaver, who Blizzard has had trouble balancing since he launched last year, is getting some pretty notable quality-of-life improvements that will make his kit less punishing to those using the support hero. His primary Healing Blossom that heals teammates now passively charges, allowing you to fire a fully-charged flower across the battlefield instantly. This passive charge is slower than the manual one you can do by holding down the RT/R2/Left click, but it stays charged when you swap between Healing Blossom and his offensive secondary fire. This way you’re not punished for swapping between modes of fire, allowing you to switch to an offensive attack and quickly return to healing if need be. The Petal Platform, which elevates any hero (friend or foe) who stands on it, also got a much-needed update. Now, if someone steps off the platform, rather than remaining in the air and becoming functionally useless, it will return to the ground to lift a player to high ground once more. There have been plenty of times I’ve thrown a platform down as Lifeweaver just for someone to fall off of it almost immediately, so this is a welcome change.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2f43baafa42ffe13c2815d11179d2837" data-recommend-id="image://2f43baafa42ffe13c2815d11179d2837" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lifeweaver tosses a Healing Blossom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lifeweaver tosses a Healing Blossom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f43baafa42ffe13c2815d11179d2837" data-recommend-id="image://2f43baafa42ffe13c2815d11179d2837" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lifeweaver tosses a Healing Blossom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One balance change that affects multiple heroes is a health nerf that cuts a lot of squishy characters’ health down to 225. <em>Overwatch 2</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801">increased most characters’ health</a></span> in February after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-self-healing-passive-tank-damage-1851163814&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-self-healing-passive-tank-damage-1851163814">adding passive health regeneration</a></span> in season 9. Blizzard is tweaking health pools for mobile heroes that can get away from a scrap, so the hope here is that this will make it easier to take out the heroes who often harass a backline and get away just before a killing shot. Heroes affected by this nerf include flight-based characters Echo, Juno, and Mercy (Pharah is notably absent), as well as those who can escape a fight easily like Lucio, Sombra, Kiriko, and Moira. Hanzo, meanwhile, has also had his health nerfed, which Blizzard says is to balance the fact that he can one-shot a lot of these heroes now that they have 225 HP.<br></p><p>Beyond hero changes, Season 12 also adds the new mode Clash, which is a King of the Hill-style mode that feels like a reason for Blizzard to bring back old maps without revisiting the maligned two-point capture mode that was phased out in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Both the Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis maps are based on fan-favorite maps from the original <em>Overwatch</em> Hanamura and Temple of Anubis, respectively. We’ll see how the community reacts to the mode in the coming weeks.</p><p>The full patch notes are as follows:</p><h4 id="h26022"><a id=""></a><strong><em>GENERAL UPDATES</em></strong></h4><p><strong><em>Avoid As Teammate</em></strong></p><p><em>The Avoid List has been updated with the following new features:</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Players now have 15 avoid slots divided into 3 Pinned slots and 12 Recent slots.</em></li><li><em>Pinned Avoid slots guarantee that these players will never be in your matches and unlike our old Avoid slots, they never time out.</em></li><li><em>The new Recent Avoid slots do time out after 7 days like the old Avoid slots, and they only prioritize constructing teams without these players on them.</em></li><li><em>The player with the lowest time remaining in the Recent list is removed from the list if a new player is avoided when the list is full.</em></li><li><em>Time Remaining for an avoided player in the Recent list can be refreshed by using the Reset Avoid Expiration feature.</em></li><li><em>The Avoid List is now its own tab in the Social menu (which still only appears when at least 1 player is avoided).</em></li><li><em>Any players that were avoided when Season 11 ended will be removed from the avoided list due to the aforementioned updates to the system.</em></li></ul><p><em>Developer Comments: Avoiding other players has been a great way to curate your experience since the system was added, but with these changes we wanted to explore giving players best ways to manage their avoid slots.</em></p><p><strong><em>Spawn System Changes</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Group Respawn is replaced by Wave Respawn for all non-Competitive modes.</em></li><li><em>Wave Respawn is added to Competitive Play.</em></li><li><em>Default respawn time increased from 10 to 12 seconds.</em></li><li><em>Overtime respawn time increased from 13 to 14 seconds.</em></li><li><em>Wave Respawn is disabled in Overtime.</em></li><li><em>Overtime respawn time is not increased in Flashpoint.</em></li><li><em>Wave Respawn is disabled when the Payload is near the end of the track in Escort and Hybrid game modes (the same time the existing Anti-Stall system activates).</em></li><li><em>When the first hero on a team dies, they start a new Wave for their team.</em></li><li><em>Any hero that dies within 6 seconds of a Wave starting automatically joins that Wave.</em></li><li><em>A hero joining a Wave will respawn at the exact same time as the hero that started the Wave. This means that the respawn time of heroes joining the wave can be as long as 12 seconds if they died at the same time as the first hero or as short as 6 seconds if they catch the end of the Wave.</em></li><li><em>If a hero starts a Wave and no other hero joins the Wave they will respawn 2 seconds faster. This hero will respawn in 10 seconds (the default respawn time before Season 12).</em></li></ul><p><em>Developer Comments: These changes are designed to reduce the number of one-sided matches.

There are a few additional tuning changes in this update for Tanks but this patch is largely focused on adjusting many of the more mobile heroes in the Damage and Support roles.</em></p><p><em>Mobility is very powerful and we would like for there to be more of a tradeoff for the flexibility that it brings, especially as we add speed boosting abilities by welcoming Juno to the game.

These changes are to make it more accurate and better reward accuracy by increasing the energy gained from headshots.</em></p><p><strong><em>Railgun</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Primary fire weapon spread reduced from 2 to 1.6 degrees.</em></li><li><em>Critical hits now grant 10 energy.</em></li><li><em>Energy degeneration rate reduced from 33 to 15 per second after 7 seconds.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h26034"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SOMBRA</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: The increased movement speed while in stealth will better enable Sombra to get into advantageous positions or be slightly more evasive with the new lower health.</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Base health reduced from 250 to 225.</em></li></ul><p><strong><em>Virus</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Impact damage increased from 25 to 35.</em></li></ul><p><strong><em>Stealth</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Bonus movement speed increased from 45 to 60%.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h26035"><a id=""></a><strong><em>TORBJÖRN</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: This shift in armor health for Torbjorn is to increase survivability against the heroes which are most affected by armor’s damage reduction, such as Tracer.</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Base health reduced from 250 to 225.</em></li><li><em>Base armor increased from 50 to 75.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h26036"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SUPPORT</em></strong></h4><h4 id="h26037"><a id=""></a><strong><em>ILLARI</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: Illari can deal a lot of damage over the course of a game but may have too much ammo, given that her projectiles are easier to land hits due to their increased projectile size. We’re also removing the extra environment collision size on her Captive Sun projectile so that it doesn’t accidentally detonate early when firing at nearby walls and such.

On the stat side, she performed strongly in most every categories but particularly overperformed in healing output over the course of a game. These changes are improving her utility while pulling back lightly on healing throughput, since we’d still like her to launch in a strong state as players grow accustomed to her playstyle. There were also quite a few quality-of-life improvements that are listed elsewhere in the patch notes.</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Juno has been added to the lineup.</em></li><li><em>Juno is now eligible for Competitive Play.</em></li><li><em>Base health reduced from 250 to 225.</em></li></ul><p><strong><em>Mediblaster</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Burst projectile volley rate of fire reduced from 34 to 28 shots per second.</em></li></ul><p><strong><em>Pulsar Torpedoes</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Damage and Healing impact increased from 75 to 85.</em></li><li><em>Heal-over-time reduced from 60 to 50 health.</em></li></ul><p><strong><em>Hyper Ring</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Deploy range increased by 3.5 meters.</em></li><li><em>Cooldown reduced from 16 to 14 seconds.</em></li></ul><p><strong><em>Orbital Ray</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Beam travel speed increased from 1.9 to 2.25 meters per second.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h26039"><a id=""></a><strong><em>KIRIKO</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: Despite the perception of how powerful Kiriko feels to play against, she is a hero that consistently underperforms when it comes to winning games. However, she is a highly evasive hero that makes a lot of sense to be in the 225 health bracket. To help counterbalance the loss of health, we’re smoothing out her damage dealing consistency by increasing the Kunai weapon’s base damage and removing the enhanced critical multiplier.</em></p><p><em>Base health reduced from 250 to 225.</em></p><p><strong><em>Kunai</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Critical multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2x.</em></li><li><em>Damage increased from 45 to 60.</em></li><li><em>Recovery time increased from 0.5 to 0.55 seconds.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h26040"><a id=""></a><strong><em>LIFEWEAVER</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: The Petal Platform was too easy to waste if a player accidentally ran over it without intending to make use of it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ArenaNet has finally released <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-expansion-is-out-august-20-adds-new-raid-player-housing-and-land-spears/">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds</a>, marking the <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth expansion</a> for the renowned MMORPG title, originally released back in 2012.</p>
<p>The hype surrounding Janthir Wilds in the industry is at its all-time peak, given that initially, we saw ArenaNet disclosing to us about the actual expansion almost three months ago, and now the time has finally arrived when players will have the opportunity to experience the new in-game content that arrives alongside the expansion update. Janthir Wilds brings mechanisms to housing the game, allowing players to create their own "Homesteads." Along with this, the update features a new World Boss event and much more, which we'll discuss next.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Starting with Homestead, the game apparently grants players a patch of land where they can build their own housing space, with plenty of customization options. These include different props, objects, and decorations, which can be placed in the housing area through tools. It's an area where you can socialize with in-game comrades and is set to "provide a new way to express personal identity in the world of Tyria."</p>
<p>Apart from Homestead being the big thing, Janthir Wilds also brings in access to a new weapon type, particularly a spear. The Kodan Spear Mastery will teach players a bevy of new abilities in order to face the wild beasts of Janthir, ultimately taking the combat experience to new levels. Along with this, the new expansion brings in an enhanced Warclaw Mount, along with the dedicated World Boss Event, which is described as below:</p>
<p><em><strong>Warclaw Mount Update:&nbsp;</strong>previously occupying a niche for World-vs.-World competitive game modes, the newly updated warclaw mount provides additional opportunities for exploration in the open world via a new mastery track. Once fully trained, this large cat doesn’t take fall damage, can leap multiple times in the air, uses its sharp nose to sniff for treasure, and employs its chain pull skill in combat against enemies while also allowing its rider to throw lances from the saddle.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><em><strong>New World Boss Event:&nbsp;</strong>the primordial energies of Janthir have drawn massive entities known as titans to its rocky shores. This dual threat encounter will challenge upwards of 50 players to put all their new skills to use in the kind of massive, signature epic showdown that&nbsp;Guild Wars 2&nbsp;is known for.</em></p>
<p>Josh Davis, Guild Wars 2 Game Director, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Janthir Wilds is a promise fulfilled. When we announced we were moving to yearly expansion cycles, this is what we had in mind: new content every few months full of compelling content and new gameplay features so that the game always feels fresh when you log in</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, ArenaNet's Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will require users to pay a $25 fee to access the new content, but given the in-game additions we have seen, it's certainly worth it, especially for the franchise's fans.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-new-details-on-anti-cheat-esports-and-updates.960003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-new-details-anti-cheat-esports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, we sat down with Ian Proulx, co-founder and CEO at 1047 Games, the developer behind Splitgate 2. Eager to find out more about this developing and intense shooter, we probed into the game’s development and the outlook on the title from a competitive perspective.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-first-and-foremost">First and Foremost</h2>



<p>Sitting down with Ian Proulx, we received key insights into the ongoing development of Splitgate 2, which is being tweaked at present following a recent playtest. One of our first and most important questions was about the integration of a solid anti-cheat system, which is paramount to success for an FPS title in this day and age.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It has been our top priority – a couple of years ago, we acquired an anti-cheat company called EQU8. We decided to bring these guys in-house, partly to put more resources into our anti-cheat. You kind of have two options –  you can either make an anticheat that does a mediocre job of defending against all sorts of games, or you can make an anticheat that does a really good job of defending one game, and for us, we only care about one game. </p>



<p>As a third-party, that was their focus, they needed to make something that caters to lots of different clients, but now they’re in-house, they only have to cater for Splitgate 2.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bringing the anti-cheat solution in-house means that the team doesn’t need to rely on regularly cracked solutions like BattleEye and Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-competitive">Getting Competitive</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you’ve seen the gameplay of Splitgate 2, you’ll have noticed how much it seems to feel like an <strong>esports-ready </strong>game. It takes place in an arena, like a spectator sport, and it boasts a system that lends itself to players assuming roles and competing as a team.</p>



<p>However, talking to Ian Proulx about this, that isn’t too high on the team’s agenda:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our art style and our lore is that this is a sport and not a war. We’re not trying to say ‘this is esports’, we’re trying to say ‘this is the world of Splitgate 2’, it’s the sport of the future. If you look at the branding, it’s very inspired by Formula 1, NBA, NFL, and so on.</p>



<p>In terms of esports specifically, obviously we’ve made a game that we say is easy to learn but difficult to master, and I think we’ve hit that balance a lot better this time around. Do I think that this game would be a great esport? Absolutely. I’m not really having tonnes of conversations about that yet.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Proulx did admit that if the game is ‘sticky’ and people enjoy it, then esports with naturally follow.</p>



<h2 id="h-building-something-memorable">Building Something Memorable</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Throughout the conversation with Ian Proulx, he remained on-point with the driving message that this is a shooter that is being developed with the community in mind. He used the term ‘community-first development’, talking about forming relationships with streamers and kicking off activations to generate hype, but it always comes back to supporting that community. </p>



<p>Talking about the most recent tweaks to the game, Proulx walked through adjustments and balancing measures to portals and how they work, some quality-of-life changes in button mapping, and some sizeable tweaks to the game, such as the creative decision to remove EMP grenades.</p>



<p>Movement has been ramped up, and Proulx is particularly proud of the game’s sliding mechanic, which is the result of months of painstaking work.</p>



<p>Ultimately, everything that we were shown about Splitgate 2 fills us with a sense of encouragement about the ongoing development of this title. It’s sure to be a hit, just as the first game was, but this time around, there’s more meat on the bones to keep it going post-launch. It’s a free-to-play shooter (with cosmetic MTX) and it has been built with the player in mind and nothing but passion from the developers.</p>



<p>What more could you ask for?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-players-enticed-by-ultra-realistic-competitor-inzois-character-creator-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/inzoi">Inzoi</a>, The Sims competitor from PUBG developer Krafton, is drawing in a lot of new fans through its character creator demo, which shows off its ultra realistic graphics.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-fans-are-creating-some-wonderful-and-horrific-beings-in-its-character-creator">Krafton has deployed the same strategy as the likes of Dragon's Dogma 2</a> and others by releasing the character creator portion of its game early. The Inzoi: Character Studio currently available on Steam will only be there for a few days, however, until August 25 at 9pm Pacific.</p><p>The full version of Inzoi is expected in late 2024 and is described as "a life simulation game where players become gods within the game, allowing them to change everything as they wish and experience endless new stories in various forms of life."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/ss-bed14625da4c181e3334411fe03d5b72680761a3-1920x1080-1724258287098.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>inZOI: Character Studio. Image credit: Krafton.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This already had fans of The Sims turning their heads, but the character creator demo seems to have pulled their attention altogether. The Sims 4 is almost a decade old itself, but beyond that has been criticized for only including basic features and charging users for myriad expansion packs.</p><p>"I'm not looking back," said slickkpanther on Reddit. "All I've ever wanted in a life-sim was to walk around in a nice city, look pretty, maybe grab a coffee, read a book and plant some flowers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"It sounds like a lot, but it's really not. I'm not asking for every building to be enterable. I'm not asking for hundreds of unique NPCs on screen. I'm not even asking for a realistic weather system. What I want only sounds like a lot, because the bar has been set so low by The Sims 4."</p><p>Myriad others agreed. "All life sim fans should feel the way you do," said one user in the comments. "Because, at a minimum, if Inzoi were to be successful, this would likely put pressure on EA to do better. Lack of competition has allowed EA to underdeliver with The Sims 4 and monetize the hell out of everything. It's easy for them to exploit fans, when the fans have no better options to turn to."</p><p>These comments come despite Inzoi being in its infancy, and Krafton certainly appears to have big plans for the game.</p><p>"Our goal with Inzoi is to create a world where creativity knows no bounds, and where every choice leads to new and unexpected experiences," said director and producer Hyungjun Kim. "We want players to enjoy not only the joy of crafting their ideal lives but also the thrill of navigating a dynamic, evolving world."</p><p>It's saying a lot of right things for life simulator fans too, including that mod support will be available on day one and Inzoi will be supported after launch too.</p><p>Many still have reservations, of course, seemingly because the genre hasn't had much care and attention in recent years, but even those with doubts appear quietly optimistic.</p><p>"I'm excited for this game but I have my worries," said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1ew3ymx/im_excited_for_this_game_but_i_have_my_worries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old-Cobbler402</a>. "First of all, I think that the game looks beautiful but some visual aspects regarding the Zois are worrying me. Some may be due to the game not being finished yet."</p><p>They pointed out a difference in visuals between the character creator and the live mode, which essentially emulates what actual gameplay will look like. Some other visual bugs exist too, but fans are hoping these get ironed out ahead of Inzoi's launch.</p><p>Only time will tell how this will look though. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-developer-creating-its-own-sims-in-unreal-engine-5">Krafton only announced Inzoi in November 2023</a> and the release of the character creator indicates development is progressing smoothly, but late 2024 is getting closer and closer so a release date announcement should be due soon.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/secret-level-every-video-game-in-the-new-gamescom-trailer.959991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>One of the most intriguing projects featured at gamescom 2024 isn’t a game at all, but an animated series. Prime Video’s Secret Level is an anthology series by the creators of Love, Death + Robots. Each episode is basically a short film inspired by the characters and worlds of iconic video games like God of War, Mega Man, Unreal Tournament, and Pac-Man.</p><p>The first trailer for the series gives us a brief glimpse of these gorgeously animated shorts and the often surprising ways in which they reinvent familiar gaming icons. But which games are featured in the series, and is that really Keanu Reeves piloting a mecha suit? Let’s break down exactly what we see in the trailer.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Secret Level gamescom ONL 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2>Armored Core</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/gvct3zywyaaj9v0-1724242311279.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Perhaps the biggest surprise in the Secret Level trailer is the reveal that Keanu Reeves himself is apparently involved. Reeves (or someone who looks an awful lot like the John Wick star) can be seen in footage for the Armored Core episode. Reeves’ character is shown entering an Armored Core mecha and suiting up for battle. Between this and his prominent role in Cyberpunk 2077, Reeves’ gaming pedigree is very strong these days.  </p><h2>Concord</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-56-screenshot-1724255820210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Concord is only just now making its way to the PC and PS5, but it’s already getting an animated spinoff thanks to Secret Level. We can see a shot of the steep, vertically-oriented city that was previously seen in the Concord cinematic trailer.</p><h2>Crossfire</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-48-screenshot-1724255835489.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The tactical shooter series Crossfire is one of the games featured in Secret Level, which is interesting, considering that these games aren’t normally known for their intricate stories. We see several quick shots of SWAT team characters in action, promising a tense and gritty addition to the series’ lineup. </p><h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-42-screenshot-1724255855714.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons fans were already treated to an entertaining live-action adaptation in 2023, and now they’ll get to enjoy a lavish CG-animated D&amp;D short thanks to Secret Level. We briefly see a massive dragon emerging from the shadows, as well as a shot of a sword-shaped bridge over a waterfall that leads to a fortress. Based on these shots, it looks like Secret Level is opting for a more traditional and serious take on the franchise than the 2023 film. </p><h2>EXODUS</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-40-screenshot-1724255869732.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The upcoming science fiction game EXODUS looks to be a natural fit for Secret Level, as it deals with the emotional fallout of time dilation and the way that time can pass in the blink of an eye for the human heroes fighting against the Celestials. We see that emotion on full display in a scene involving two aged characters tenderly reunited in the trailer. </p><h2>Honor of Kings</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-26-screenshot-1724255889023.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We never would have predicted that a MOBA game like Honor of Kings would be one of the ones featured in Secret Level, but that doesn’t mean we’re not interested to see how the series reinterprets this popular title. Based on the handful of quick shots seen in the trailer, it looks like Secret Level is opting for a relatively more realistic and detailed approach compared to the anime aesthetic of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Mega Man</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-47-screenshot-1724255902717.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Capcom’s long-running Mega Man series is represented in Secret Level, though this isn’t quite the Mega Man fans know from the classic 8-bit games. The series is clearly taking a much more realistic approach to the character. Well, as realistic as a story about a cyborg boy with a giant cannon for a hand can be, anyway. We see the character suiting up to take on Dr. Wily’s Robot Masters. </p><h2>New World: Aeternum</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-21-screenshot-1724255922651.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It should probably come as no surprise that Amazon’s own MMORPG New World would be among the games featured in this series. Like in the game, this short appears to be set on the fabled island of Aeternum, as a lone hero prepares to prove his mettle and make his fortune. The quick glimpse seen in the trailer suggests this will be one of the more detailed and realistically rendered episodes of the series.</p><h2>The Outer Worlds 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-17-screenshot-1724255939548.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Secret Level will be exploring the world of Halcyon from Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds series. This short looks to have one of the most visually distinctive styles of the series, as it blends live-action characters with CG-rendered environments. As you’d expect, the striking color palette of the games is on full display here.</p><h2>Pac-Man</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-23-screenshot-1724255958549.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There’s maybe no better example of how dramatically Secret Level will reinvent some iconic gaming properties than Pac-Man. You could be forgiven for not even realizing Pac-Man is included in the trailer. Far removed from the simplistic source material, the trailer shows us a hooded, seemingly alien figure making their way through a vast wasteland. The trailer also ends with a quick glimpse of a robotic Pac-Man with razor-sharp teeth coming online. We have to wonder if Pac-Man is the villain in this peculiar but intriguing take on the franchise.</p><h2>PlayStation Studios: God of War &amp; Ghost of Tsushima</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-49-screenshot-1724255975748.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It appears that we’re getting an episode framed around the Playstation Studios lineup, as we see both God of War’s Kratos and Ghost of Tsushima’s Jin Sakai in the trailer.</p><p>The Kratos shot confirms that the series is taking its cues from the more recent God of War games, where Kratos is an axe-wielding slayer of Norse gods, rather than the original, Greek mythology-focused games. We have to assume that means his son Atreus will be tagging along for the ride. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-jin-sakai-1724255464041.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>What’s really surprising, though, is that Kratos appears to be walking through a modern city. Is this short going to be dealing with time travel? What happens when you turn cold-blooded killers like Kratos and Jin-Sakai loose in the 21st Century? And just how many PlayStation Studios characters are appearing in this episode? We can’t wait to find out.</p><h2>Sifu</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-1-11-screenshot-1724255994551.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Sloclap’s popular 2022 beat-em-up Sifu is featured in the trailer. We see a blood-soaked character entering a dojo and gearing up for another bloody fight. Later, we see a couple of quick shots of a violent brawl in a neon-drenched nightclub. It appears that Secret Level is opting for a slightly more realistic animation style compared to the relatively stylized, angular style of the game. We’re interested to see just how, if at all, the short tackles the resurrection-based combat of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Spelunky</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-50-screenshot-1724256018752.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The trailer includes a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it shot of a Spelunky-themed episode. We briefly glimpse treasure hunter Ana Spelunky stumbling inside a lava-filled cavern. It’s quite a treat seeing the quirky indie series being given such an ambitious visual makeover.</p><h2>Unreal Tournament</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-48-screenshot-1-1724256032749.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Also very briefly seen in the trailer is a quick shot from an Unreal Tournament episode. We can see an arena brandished with the logo for Riordan Dynamics, the company at the heart of the storyline in the Unreal Tournament games. The arena is clearly set up for a bloody deathmatch, with two opposing towers that remind us of an indoor version of the iconic Facing Worlds map. </p><h2>Warhammer 40,000</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-3-screenshot-1724256051064.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It remains to be seen if Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 series will ever see the light of day, but at least Secret Level has us covered with a Warhammer-themed short. The trailer opens with a scene of Space Marines cutting a bloody swath of destruction, and later we see a marine being ambushed by a much larger monster. We also see a shot of a marine barreling straight into an oncoming vehicle. Basically, this short looks to be the most action-packed and visceral chapter of the Secret Level series. </p><h2>The Mystery Game</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-39-screenshot-1724256065876.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the most intriguing scenes in the trailer is also one of the most mysterious. At one point we see images of a man being enveloped in flowing pink and blue energy, as if he’s bonding with a machine or another lifeform. We’re honestly not sure which game this is meant to represent, but we do know we definitely want to see this episode. </p><p>Let us know in the comments what game you think is being depicted in that scene, and let us know if we missed anything else in the trailer. </p><p>For more on gamescom, learn more about the decision to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Playstation</a>, and catch up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at Opening Night Live</a>.</p><p><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

While looking at these Lego sets on Amazon, something totally different also caught our eye: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bzuiawi-Indiana-Journal-Vintage-Leather/dp/B0C2YR8DG4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this unofficial Indiana Jones replica Holy Grail Diary</a>, which appears to do a good job of aligning with the journal from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.</p><h2>Raiders of the Lost Ark: Temple of the Golden Idol (1,545 pieces)</h2><h3>$127 (<del>$150</del>)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354397-81zubvhfaql._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354397" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354397-81zubvhfaql._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354397"></a><figcaption>Lego Indiana Jones: Temple of the Golden Idol</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354397-81zubvhfaql._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>This is the largest Indiana Jones Lego set, and it's packed with cool features. It lets you build a replica of the Temple of the Golden Idol, complete with interactive components that let you light up the idol, collapse a wall, or unleash a boulder to chase down Indy. Four minifigures are included in the set (Indiana Jones, Satipo, Belloq, and a Hovitos Warrior), making this great as both a playset or as a piece of décor for your home theater.</p><hr><h2>Raiders of the Lost Ark: Escape from the Lost Tomb (600 pieces)</h2><h3>$32 (<del>$40</del>)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354398-81km1syyvrl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354398" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354398-81km1syyvrl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354398"></a><figcaption>Lego Indiana Jones: Escape from the Lost Tomb</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354398-81km1syyvrl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>For a smaller and substantially cheaper project, take a look at this Escape from the Lost Tomb Lego set. It shouldn’t take too long to complete at just 600 pieces, though it still gets you four minifigures (Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood, Sallah, and a mummy). There are also some cool interactive components--such as a breakable wall that reveals a hidden passage and a movable Anubis statue.</p><hr><h2>Last Crusade: Fighter Plane Chase (387 pieces)</h2><h3>$28 (<del>$35</del>)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354399-813rtdbeawl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354399" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354399-813rtdbeawl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354399"></a><figcaption>Lego Indiana Jones: Fighter Plane Chase</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354399-813rtdbeawl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>Unlike the other two sets, which can admirably as both playsets and artwork for display, this one is most definitely a playset--but it is the cheapest way to get a display-worthy Indiana Jones minifigure. The building kit's 387 pieces snap together to create an airplane and automobile, which can be used to transport three minifigures: Indiana Jones, Indy's father, and a fighter pilot. The fighter jet has two removable wings and two stud shooters, while the car features a chest in the back that hides a pistol and umbrella.</p><hr><h3>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preorders</h3><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buy-two-get-one-free-nintendo-switch-games-and-preorders-my-best-buy-members/1100-6525928/">B2G1 Free All Nintendo Switch Games - Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom, Mario &amp; Luigi, And More Preorders</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Live Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-anthology-preorders-quakecon-2024/1100-6525656/">Doom Anthology Preorders Are Live - Comes With 6 Games, Steelbook Case, And Replica BFG</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retrorealms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retro-game-preorder-guide/1100-6525752/">Halloween And Ash Vs.

                <p>Warframe 1999 is Warframe's all-new story expansion coming later this year. This expansion places players in a more-grounded environment on an alternate earth rather than the space-themed confrontations Tenno are so used to, as seen in the Level Infinite showcase.</p><p>Warframe 1999 is set on New Year's Eve, when Arthur and his fellow Hex members battle technological monstrosities, ride atomicycles--reminiscent of a motorcycle--through the streets, solve Snake-like puzzles, and face a Corrupted Lich boy band.</p>

It will be up to players to put a stop to it, and in a first for the series, it will require players to group up. The Dark Citadel will be playable with a minimum of two players, but Blizzard is recommending a full party of four to conquer its challenges. The dungeon will become available upon reaching the endgame, and players will need to complete an introductory quest that will then unlock the activity for every character on that account.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Mercenary Companions | Gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the dungeon itself, it's separated into three distinct wings. Players will need to conquer each wing before a showdown with the dungeon's final boss. Since the dungeon is far larger (and presumably takes more time) than an average Diablo 4 dungeon, players will be able to exit the dungeon and return at a later time. A new marker system will let groups more easily communicate on where to go next.</p><p dir="ltr">Each week, players will be able to earn a Weekly Rewards cache from completing the dungeon, which will grant items and rewards earned exclusively from the Dark Citadel. Players will also earn Citadel Coins while playing through the dungeon, used to unlock exclusive cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the Dark Citadel requires at least two players, Diablo 4 will gain a Party Finder feature come Vessel of Hatred's release. The Party Finder will let players search for groups depending on various in-game activities, similar to the Group Finder in something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Details about the Dark Citadel wasn't all Blizzard shared at Gamescom. It also revealed the four mercenaries players will be able to team-up with in Vessel of Hatred, and how leveling them up will differ from mercenary systems of Diablo 2 and 3.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4354546-mercenaries_1920x1080.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354546" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4354546-mercenaries_1920x1080.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354546"></a><figcaption>The four mercenaries of Diablo 4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4354546-mercenaries_1920x1080.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">There will be four mercs to choose from; the shield-wielding Iron Wolves warrior Raheir, the cannibal berserker Varyana, the half-demon child Aldkin, and the drunken archer Subo. A player's chosen mercenary will join them when playing solo, but players will be able to select a second mercenary as a "Reinforcement." The mercenary set as a reinforcement can be assigned to swoop in and deliver an attack when certain conditions are met, like when hit by a movement-impairing effect. Using particular mercenaries will level up their Rapport, which can then be used to unlock additional skills. Each Mercenary will also sell items that can be bought with Pale Marks, a new currency earned by leveling up each mercenary.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the new features above will be in conjunction with the expansion's biggest addition, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">new Spiritborn class</a>, a monk-like warrior that wields powerful Spirit Guardians as weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard still has one Vessel of Hatred surprise left to unveil. It's teasing major leveling and progression changes will come to Diablo 4 once the expansion lands on par with its ambitious Loot Reborn update, "aimed at making leveling more rewarding." Fans are already confident a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-may-have-players-deal-less-damage-and-that-could-be-good/1100-6525197/" data-ref-id="1100-6525197">level-and-damage-number squish are in store</a>, but Blizzard will share official details during an upcoming Diablo 4 livestream on August 29. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Vessel of Hatred, and Diablo 4 Season 6, launch October 8</a>.</p>
