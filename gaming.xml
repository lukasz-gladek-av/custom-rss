With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> having received an indefinite delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">back in June</a>, that just leaves one game to test whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. While this one has been cooking for a while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-prepares-to-stake-its-claim-in-making-extraction-shooters-popular-with-an-october-release-date">it actually has a release date</a>, October 30th. There's been a few tests along the way, and it turns out the devs have one last one in them!
</p>
<p>
The good thing about this test - they're calling it a Server Slam - is that it's completely open to everyone. You don't need any kind of access code, and despite this announcement coming with the shooter's pre-order trailer, you do not in fact have to pre-order it either. This test is taking place between October 17th and 19th, across PC and console, and essentially it's just to get as many people playing as possible to ensure there are no server hiccups when the game actually launches.
</p>

<p>
Apparently this test will take place on the Dam Battlegrounds map for those in the know, and you'll be able to get a taste of the game's progression, crafting, and quest systems. It's worth noting that none of this progress will carry over to the full game, so don't get too deep into it. You'll get a backpack cosmetic as a little treat in the full game for your troubles at least.
</p><p>
I've said it before on this site and I'll say it again, I'm not particularly big on shooters, but I'm always curious about a burgeoning genre or subgenre. Sure extraction shooters aren't exactly new, but they are quite hard to recommend given how easy it can be to lose progress. Not sure if I'll be jumping in at launch, though I'll be keeping my eye on it to see how things go at least.
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders is out October 30th.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-official-50-pack-of-pokemon-cards-sells-for-0-10-each-amazon-is-liquidating-its-inventory.1305882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Starting a Pokemon card collection can be exciting but also overwhelming when you’re figuring out where to begin. If you’re just getting into it, here’s a deal that’s hard to pass up: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">an assorted lot of 50 Pokemon cards for just $5, down from $9</a>. That’s around 40% off the regular price, and $0.10 for each card. Now, you will not be opening up rare cards, and there could be duplicates that show up, but this is a wonderful way to start your collection under way without spending too much money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How to Build Your Pokemon Collection with a Budget Boost</h2>
<p>This mixed bag is a <strong>mix of standard Pokemon cards and energy cards</strong> from a variety of series with a surprise feature that makes it interesting. You never know what you are going to receive in each pack, so the excitement from not knowing which cards appear adds some zip to the action. <strong>Value is in terms of quantity and mix rather than rarity</strong>, so it is ideal for beginners wanting to establish a good foundation set or for backyard collectors who want cheap means of expanding their collection.</p>



<p>The randomness does have some dups but that’s just the bet for bulk purchasing at this price level. Silver lining is that dups can be used to make trades with buddies or strengthen your deck by having multiples of a specific card. Over time, this encourages more interaction with fellow gamers and collectors.</p>
<p><strong>For $5 for 50 cards, this deal lowers the entry price for Pokemon players and collectors</strong>. It is a solid choice if you have been eager to start playing without spending a lot of money upfront.</p>
<p>Sure, you may not get the super-huge ones here, but the thrill is in unpacking the boxes, organizing cards, and discovering new favorites. And for serious players, these base cards provide the foundation for trades and deck enhancements.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-is-clearing-out-its-summer-stock-of-mini-4k-drones-prices-back-to-black-friday-lows-2000627999</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-is-clearing-out-its-summer-stock-of-mini-4k-drones-prices-back-to-black-friday-lows.1305870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Choosing the right drone can feel like a real challenge with so many options out there. But if you’re just starting out or flying for fun, there’s one key thing to keep in mind: <strong>your drone should weigh under 250 grams to avoid the hassle of FAA registration</strong> and Remote ID requirements.</p>
<p>That narrows your choices quite a bit, and luckily, DJI offers two solid options in that category. The ultimate bang for your buck <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4270/">is the Mini 4K — and right now, it’s available on sale at an all-time low of $249, down from $299, at Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4270/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Drone with Impressive Power and Precision</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 4K is not just light but it’s also designed to impress. Its small body is lightweight but it’s what it does in the air that truly counts: Loaded <strong>with a 4K Ultra HD camera and combined with a 3-axis gimbal stabilization system</strong>, it records video with silky, movie-quality smoothness. Whether capturing a sunrise, sunset, or nighttime scene, the sharpness and clarity are excellent. This means <strong>you don’t necessarily need to be an expert to create professional-grade videos</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to its brushless motors, the Mini 4K supports <strong>wind resistance as high as 38 kilometers per hour</strong> — that’s Level 5 wind resistance. It also comes with the ability to <strong>take off and fly at altitudes as high as 4,000 meters</strong>. This guarantees that your flying experience is still stable and sensitive even if the weather gets a bit challenging.</p>



<p>The increased battery life adds an important plus to your flight duration: You can purchase sets that include one battery for 31 minutes (like that one on sale at Amazon), two batteries total of 62 minutes, or even three batteries where you can fly for up to 93 minutes.</p>
<p>Casual flyers and beginners will appreciate its simplicity and safety features: With one-tap takeoff and landing, GPS-enabled “Return to Home” and automatic hovering, even those new to drones can quickly get comfortable behind the controls. Plus, the DJI Fly app offers in-app tutorials to speed up the learning process so you’ll be flying and capturing your best shots in no time. The Mini 4K also comes with intelligent QuickShots like Helix, Dronie, Rocket, Circle, and Boomerang that make tricky flying maneuvers a breeze and capture stunning shots with only a few taps.</p>
<p>If you want to try aerial photography, this drone is the ideal friend.</p>

		<p>Kojima is teaming up with Niantic to create a new… thing. It’s not a game, but will “l<span lang="EN-US">everage Niantic Spatial’s geospatial AI technology to bring Hideo Kojima’s iconic storytelling into the real world. </span>”</p>
<p>The video makes it look like some sort of AR app that might expand on the mechanism in Death Stranding that allowed you to leave markers and notes for other players. That’s just a guess but we do know NSAND is not linked to Niantic’s other big game,<a href="https://ingress.com/en"> Ingress.</a></p>

<p>“The collaboration marks a significant moment for both companies and a shared vision to push the boundaries of what’s possible in interactive storytelling. For KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS, it’s a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world,” say Kojima Productions.</p>

<p>“At Niantic Spatial, we’re building a living model of the world that people and machines can talk to, creating a new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction,” said John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Spatial. “We are delighted to be working with KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS to explore what our combined creativity and innovation can accomplish for new and existing fans.”</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/" data-ref-id="5000-590662">Baby Steps</a>, the literal walking simulator from the minds behind games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/qwop/" data-ref-id="5000-93182">QWOP</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/getting-over-it-with-bennett-foddy/" data-ref-id="5000-473119">Getting Over It</a>, is out now, and publisher Devolver Digital is celebrating with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjgjDYppxbA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relaxing "naturescape" stream</a> where the game's protagonist Nate violently falls into frame every 15 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's all as weird, jarring, and hilarious as it sounds. In Baby Steps, "unemployed failson" Nate must traverse a "mountain-sized mountain" using the power of putting one foot in front of the other using the game's unique (and by the look of it, frustrating) physics-based control scheme. The stream highlights various landscapes from the game that Nate must overcome and presents them as serene, idyllic vistas.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjgjDYppxbA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xjgjDYppxbA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Every few minutes, however, the stream takes a sharp turn as Nate comes tumbling down some rocks or faceplants into the dirt, mimicking the experience more than a few Baby Steps players are having themselves. It's never not funny, in large part because it's easy to forget it's going to happen while the stream runs in the background on a second monitor, only for the peaceful sounds of nature to be suddenly interrupted by a bumbling oaf crashing through the landscape.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who pay close attention to the stream will notice there's more than just Nate occasionally bursting into view in a physics-based cacophony. Product keys for free copies of Baby Steps occasionally flash across the screen as well, rewarding those who have become entrapped by the meditative experience of waiting for a comically proportioned man-baby to flail onto the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Baby Steps isn't quite like anything else out there, as is evident by its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/well-this-esrb-description-sure-is-a-wild-ride/1100-6534659/" data-ref-id="1100-6534659">truly wild ESRB rating description</a> that includes the phrase "human/donkey hybrids with exposed male genitalia." Originally scheduled to release earlier, Devolver wisely chose to delay Baby Steps to September 23 in order to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-silksong-induced-game-delay-doesnt-hide-its-reasoning-in-new-trailer/1100-6534273/" data-ref-id="1100-6534273">avoid the debut of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, which it announced with a video of Nate comically failing to climb a statue of Silksong's heroine Hornet.</p><p dir="ltr">Baby Steps is available now on PC and PlayStation 5, and is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baby-steps-is-steam-deck-verified-meaning-you-can-just-throw-the-whole-system-when-frustrated/1100-6534828/" data-ref-id="1100-6534828">Steam Deck verified</a>, in case you wanted the ability to throw your whole console in frustration.</p>

It housed numerous game studios operating under names like "Cauldron," "Iron," "Hidden Grove," "Battle Barge," and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Firewalk Studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It went on to raise over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/multi-studio-game-company-probablymonsters-nets-200-million-to-continue-expansion">$400 million</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/probablymonsters-nets-250-million-to-bolster-development-studios">next three years</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, eventually </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-buys-firewalk-studios-from-probablymonsters">selling</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Firewalk Studios to Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2023 for an undisclosed amount.

An internal email sent by Ryan in 2024 stated that Cauldron had been canceled by an unnamed publisher. Sources described a rolling wave of game cancelations from 2023 through 2025, where projects from Iron, Hidden Grove, and Battle Barge were "paused," some developers let go, and others moved to different teams about every 6-9 months, even as new projects were regularly greenlit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Environment artist Carol Ha-Torrez was one of the developers laid off from Battle Barge by ProbablyMonsters in 2024.

"ProbablyMonsters has always been defined by the dedication, hard work, and creativity of its teams," they stated. "In recent years, the gaming industry has been constantly evolving, and building a company in this environment means facing tough choices with no easy answers. Those choices require balancing the immediate needs of our people while understanding the impact they can have."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the same time, we have a responsibility to keep the company healthy for the long term. We believe being responsible isn’t just about getting everything right in the moment. It’s about staying true to our mission of supporting lasting careers in game development. We know this work is never simple, and we work hard every day to learn, adjust, and improve."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Through it all, our priority has remained the same: respecting employees for their contributions and treating them fairly, including giving credits to teams past and present who contribute to our projects. Building a supportive culture has always been central to who we are, and we’re focused on making ProbablyMonsters a place where teams can do their best creative work."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Battle Barge's headcount and direction shifted overnight">Battle Barge's headcount and direction shifted overnight</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In our previous conversation with Ryan, the ProbablyMonsters CEO stated that the company "looked at" the possibility of turning its canceled live service games into standalone premium titles. But Battle Barge's final voyage was far more dramatic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In September 2024 Ryan announced that former developers from Hidden Grove and Iron would be assigned to support Battle Barge's new mission: turning Project Vance into a premium triple-A title that could ship as a standalone game in 2025. The first milestone: a playable "winter build" with a November deadline.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Battle Barge's team size effectively multiplied overnight, jumping from around 30-40 to an estimated 100 developers. Sources said Ryan ignored warnings that adding dozens of workers and changing the scope of the project would make development more difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communication became arduous as developers who previously worked closely together were split into different strike teams assigned to different tasks. One group of Hidden Grove alumni was tasked with building a 10-hour campaign mode from scratch—all while trying to learn new tools, processes, and file structures that had been built over 4 years by an entirely different team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources differed on whether this was a period of "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunch_(video_games)">crunch</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" or not. Some said they kept normal hours, but Ha-Torrez called it a period of "soft crunch," where she witnessed some colleagues submitting Perforce updates at midnight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You could cut the tension with a knife," she said. Other former employees said every day they feared they would lose their jobs, especially after Ryan fired games teams chief product officer Adam Rymer on October 22, which was announced internally via a studio-wide email reviewed by Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the challenges, sources said the development team hit their assigned targets. A playable build of Project Vance was ready to go on October 28, according to one email documenting the results of a build verification test which stated the game was ready for QA testing and internal playtesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But they never had a chance to hit the finish line. On October 28, before the winter build could be finalized, ProbablyMonsters laid off nearly 50 employees and shuttered Battle Barge, rolling the remaining workers onto other projects. ProbablyMonsters then transferred the Project Vance IP and assets to Companion Group to develop </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> inside of a year.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game does not credit former Battle Barge developers. Instead there is a short note in the credits acknowledging the "dedication, creativity, and hard work" of past and present ProbablyMonsters employees. A company spokesperson alluded to this message when asked about Companion Group's involvement in the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The credits for the game reflect the contributions of many teams involved in its development. We respect the work of all teams, past and present, and those contributions are acknowledged in the credits."</span></p><p>The credits of Storm Lancers, which include employees of ProbablyMonsters and Companion Group. Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer reviewed a recording of the Zoom call where laid-off workers demanded to know why there had been no layoff notification as required by the WARN Act. The WARN Act mandates that eligible employers issue advance notice of layoffs if an office or plant is being shuttered, resulting in 50 or more full-time employees losing their jobs. Approximately 54 people had joined the Zoom call.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ha-Torrez and others said it felt like the company planned layoffs and project changes to avoid issuing these notices. Said strategy is "very common" among employers said KUSK Law partner Don McGowan, an external legal expert consulted during this reporting. When asked if the strategy is legal, he said he doesn't feel it's consistent with "the obligations the law places on employers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the recorded call, ProbablyMonsters associate general counsel Kristen Daniels repeatedly stressed that the number of laid-off employees did not cross the mandated threshold. "We've done the math very carefully," she said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="QA employees were regularly in the crosshairs">QA employees were regularly in the crosshairs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to our sources, like former test lead Douglas Martin, the chaos and confusion at the heart of ProbablyMonsters came from Ryan himself and the cadre of former Bungie colleagues and close friends who staffed his C-suite. Ryan's erratic behavior apparently impacted ProbablyMonsters' centralized QA team well before the shift in direction for Project Vance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2022 he ordered all QA employees to return to the office full-time, even those hired remotely or who were working with remote teams. Some testers lived hours away from the studio. Martin said Ryan was only in the office himself one or two days a week.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He recalled a meeting where Ryan explained to QA testers why they would not receive any additional compensation for having to commute into the office (despite the additional expenses some would incur). "You guys are already paid at the top of the market. You can afford to commute," he said, according to Martin.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After returning to the office, testers were told that Ryan personally monitored when they swiped badges to enter and exit the building. During this time, the division's staffing levels fluctuated, with leads like Martin and department heads like central services head Ron Henseleit being suddenly ousted from the company. Candidates for open QA positions would be interviewed, only for the position to be axed, sometimes allegedly at Ryan's direction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">QA tester Jessica Gonzalez, formerly a workplace organizer for A Better ABK at Activision Blizzard, told Game Developer she recalls being "strung along" for a job at ProbablyMonsters after receiving a verbal offer from Martin in 2024. Martin remembered making the decision to hire Gonzalez and telling her she'd have an offer letter soon—and then being told not to send it. The position was closed a few weeks later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Martin recalled the incident and said "there was no reason not to hire" her, adding that he still feels "really shitty" about what happened to Gonzalez.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">QA workers were also regularly blamed for problems completely outside their control. One former tester recalled that Ryan frequently said QA was responsible for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development not moving at a faster pace, sometimes in meetings with QA staffers from Firewalk Studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At one point, QA testers were tasked with examining network code at Hidden Grove, something they were never trained to do. Later, they became the final point of validation for new Project Vance game features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This latter directive was allegedly issued during a period when all our anonymous sources were aware Ryan had moved his desk into a newly formed "QA bullpen" that many joked was a "panopticon." Ryan apparently insisted that this was not a surveillance measure, but one that would allow him to be the first to check submitted builds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This earned him the moniker of "the world's most expensive tester."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Surveillance, blame games, and &quot;talking shit&quot;">Surveillance, blame games, and "talking shit"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Martin explained to Game Developer that he and Ryan were fellow test leads on the original Xbox in the early 2000s. He had no plans to work with the future ProbablyMonsters CEO after that first encounter, only taking the job at ProbablyMonsters after being assured by then-QA director Prodipto Roy that Ryan had changed his ways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Martin said that seemed to be true—until the shutdown of Cauldron in 2023. Multiple sources told Game Developer that the troubles at the company started around this time. The former test lead alleged that Ryan was surrounded by close allies who enabled his behavior while behaving just as badly themselves. "There's a lot of people working with Harold who are enabling him and doing the same thing," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During this period of tumult, ProbablyMonsters greenlit new projects and hired developers to work on them, only to reverse course without public fanfare, including one from a team called "Icaro" that was internally announced in July 2024, only to be canceled in December of that year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources described multiple occasions where developers interviewed at the company, only to have their offer letters rescinded or put on hold at Ryan's direction. One prospective employee reportedly moved to Washington state to work in-office and leased an apartment only for Ryan to "nuke" her position and rescind her offer letter days before she started.</span></p><p>Character models, 2D art, and shaders from Project Vance are visible across Storm Lancers. Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple sources also claimed that Ryan surveilled employees. He issued regular warnings about remote workers taking any time away from their desks, despite Battle Barge leadership previously stating employees were free to manage their own time and make up work later in the day if needed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan apparently issued these warnings after joining the Battle Barge "AFK" Slack channel where workers would drop notices about their status. He denied internal rumors at the time that he was monitoring employees in a company-wide Slack message reviewed by Game Developer. In it, he claimed these rumors had driven developers to "make up" work filed in project management tool Jira.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources also said Ryan and other members of senior leadership regularly disparaged colleagues behind their backs. "He loves to talk shit," said a former QA tester when describing said comments. Ryan allegedly verbally disparaged Project Vance around some employees, and word of his displeasure with the game spread through the studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan took additional swipes at his former colleagues from Firewalk Studios in a series of Slack messages sent while ProbablyMonsters employees discussed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firewalk-and-sony-ground-concord-promise-to-explore-options-for-improvement">the sudden shutdown of </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firewalk-and-sony-ground-concord-promise-to-explore-options-for-improvement">Concord</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "As game developers who always seek to love what we do, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should serve as proof of the cautionary tales about building for yourself vs your audience," he said in one message.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In another one sent after Firewalk was shut down, the CEO simply said "they refused to listen for years."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unkept promises, impossible goals">Unkept promises, impossible goals</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ha-Torrez, Martin and all our other sources said Ryan’s behavior flew in the face of promises by ProbablyMonsters to build a positive workplace culture. Ha-Torrez provided a copy of the welcome letter sent by Ryan where he stated that he started the studio in part to make triple-A games "without the burden of developers experiencing difficult cultures, unpredictable compensation, and unstable employment."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I am committed to continuing with the vision of putting people first," he wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One veteran developer pointed to the outsourcing of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and building it off years-old assets from Project Vance as a clear red flag for Ryan's vision of the company. When this developer read our interview with Ryan, they said it felt like the CEO was claiming he figured out a model for making games quickly and sustainably. They were worried other studios would use his model as inspiration.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan's behavior and the chaotic layoffs surrounding Cauldron, Iron, Hidden Grove, and Battle Barge drove all the developers we spoke with to express doubt over Ryan's promise that the studio is on the path to sustainability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's not real," said the veteran developer, alluding to Ryan's professed vision for "short-term" games that act as a financial buffer for larger projects.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fancy a kickabout? After launching in the much warmer June (why is it already so cold, it's only bloody September), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a> has finally received its first proper season, elevating it into a true, blue live service game. This comes with, as you may have guessed, a season pass, which comes with a pair of themes for your football stadium, one being iceberg oriented, the other providing a volcanic atmosphere, alongside some new cosmetics too.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the season pass, there are two pretty big additions with this update. First up is crossplay! You know how this works I'm sure, but to spell it out, it means those of you on PC will now be able to play with your console friends, whether you own the game on Steam or through the Epic Games Store. Always a neat thing to have! Then, there's the addition of a 3v3 ranked mode. Typically matches are 5v5, so this will obviously make for a mode with some tactical differences. Sort of like heading to the local park with your mates!
</p>

<p>
This season also brings some fixes and tweaks through a new patch too. Reactivity and precision should be better now, and whatever the exploit known as the "Ippy Slide" has been nerfed too. Yay? You'll also find that goalkeeper dives have received a rework so that they're more effective against volleys, and as detailed in a press release, "skill-based matchmaking parameters are now stricter, especially in ranked matches, ensuring more evenly matched teams."
</p><p>
Apparently season 2 of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game will also introduce a much more personal 1v1 game mode, and throughout 2026 there'll be new features introduced like clubs and tournaments systems, World Cup-themed events, and "more." Look forward to that, I suppose!

              <p>Boom! Bang! Kablam! Etc. and so on. There will be a lot of that happening today as a big new event on Steam has a whole host of fantastic retro-inspired first-person shooters on sale for the rest of the week.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/boomstock2025">On September 23, Boomstock 2025 started on Steam</a>. The event celebrates “all boomer shooters and retro-inspired” FPS games and features a ton of new trailers, demos, and of course, a load of games on sale. This includes some genuine bangers, like<em> Dusk</em>, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Mullet Madjack</a></em>,<em> Project Warlock</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/"><em>Selaco</em></a>, and<em> Sulfur</em>.&nbsp; But don’t wait too long, as the event wraps up on September 27, which is just a few days away. If you need help picking out a new shooter to buy, here are some of the best and biggest deals we spotted from the event:</p> <ul> <li><em>Nightmare Reaper</em> – $15 ($25)</li> <li><em>Brutal John 2</em> – $9 ($13)</li> <li><em>Selaco</em> – $19 ($25)</li> <li><em>Forgive Me Father</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Forgive Me Father 2</em> – $15 ($25)</li> <li><em>Wizordum</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Dusk</em> – $7 ($20)</li> <li><em>Sulfur</em> – $16 ($22)</li> <li><em>Zero Protocol</em> – $7 ($12)</li> <li><em>Project Warlock 1+2</em> – $12 ($27)</li> <li><em>Mullet Madjack</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40K Boltgun</em> – $11 ($22)</li> <li><em>Blood We</em>st – $9 ($25)</li> <li><em>Heavy Bullets</em> – $2 ($10)</li> <li><em>Viscerafest</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Supplice</em> – $15 ($22)</li> <li><em>Wild Bastards</em> – $9 ($35)</li> <li><em>Shadow Warrior</em> (2013) – $3 ($30)</li> <li><em>Shadow Warrior 2</em> – $3 ($30)</li> <li><em>HROT</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Gravelord</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Quatermain and the Cult of Cthulu</em> – $2.50 ($3)</li> <li><em>Hard Reset</em> – $1.50 ($15)</li> <li><em>Hard Reset Redux</em> – $2 ($20)</li> <li><em>Serious Sam 2</em> – $2.50</li> <li><em>Mycopunk</em> – $11 ($14)</li> <li><em>Graven</em> – $5 ($23)</li> </ul> <p>I’d also like to shout out some demos for upcoming games that you can play for free right now. You totally should check out these games if you love classic shooters. Or <em>Tetris</em>. You’ll see what I mean. Anyway, here are some Boomstock demos worth playing:</p> <ul> <li><em>Sportal</em> – A boomer shooter all about using sports equipment like bats and tennis rackets.</li> <li><em>Blocks for Babies –</em> <em>Tetris</em> meets <em>Doom</em>. It mixes 2D and 3D gameplay. It’s an odd one, but worth checking out.</li> <li><em>Slyders</em> – This one is part<em> Serious Sam</em> and part roguelike, which is already a great pitch, but then you add in a cool cartoon fox protagonist, and you’ve got something special.</li> <li><em>The Last Exterminator</em> – This is the <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> sequel we deserved. This isn’t a new demo; <a href="https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-3d-last-exterminator-demo-boomer-shooter-pc-1850918547">I covered it last year</a>, but it’s a part of the event and still worth checking out.</li> </ul>

<p>There's an old saying that life is not about how many times you fall down but how many times you get back up. In my roughly 13 hours of walking through the surreal mountain wilderness of <em>Baby Steps</em>, I'd conservatively estimate I easily fell down 1,000 times.</p>
<p>If so, I got up 1,001 times, which is the entire point.</p>
<p>When I say "fell down" here, I'm not being metaphorical. In <em>Baby Steps</em>, the only real antagonist is terrain that threatens to send your pudgy, middle-aged, long-underwear-clad avatar tumbling to the ground (or down a cliff) like a rag doll after the slightest misstep. You pilot this avatar using an intentionally touchy and cumbersome control system where each individual leg is tied a shoulder trigger on your controller.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of 3D games, where you simply tilt the control stick and watch your character dutifully run, each step here means manually lifting one foot, leaning carefully in the direction you want to go, and then putting that foot down in a spot that maintains your overall balance. It's like a slightly more forgiving version of <a href="https://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">the popular '00s Flash game <em>QWOP</em></a> (which was also made by <em>Baby Steps</em> co-developer Bennett Foddy), except instead of sprinting on a 2D track, you take your time carefully planning each footfall on a methodical 3D hike.</p>

<p>At first, you'll stumble like a drunken toddler, mashing the shoulder buttons and tilting the control stick wildly just to inch forward. After a bit of trial and error, though, you'll work yourself into a gentle rhythm—press the trigger, tilt the controller, let go while recentering the controller, press the other trigger, repeat thousands of times. You never quite break into a run, but you can fall into a zen pattern of marching methodically forward, like a <em>Death Stranding</em> courier who has to actually focus on each and every step.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>As you make your halting progress up the mountain, you'll infrequently stumble on other hikers who seem to lord their comfort and facility with the terrain over you in manic, surreal, and often hilarious cut scenes. I don't want to even lightly spoil any of the truly gonzo moments in this extremely self-aware meta-narrative, but I will say that I found your character's grand arc through the game to be surprisingly touching, often in some extremely subtle ways.</p>
<h2>Does this game hate me?</h2>
<p>Just as you feel like you're finally getting the hang of basic hiking, <em>Baby Steps</em> starts ramping up the terrain difficulty in a way that can feel downright trolly at time. Gentle paths of packed dirt and rock start to be replaced with narrow planks and rickety wooden bridges spanning terrifying gaps. Gentle undulating hills are replaced with sheer cliff faces that you sidle up and across with the tiniest of toe holds to precariously balance on. Firm surfaces are slowly replaced with slippery mud, sand, snow, and ice that force you to alter your rhythm and tread extremely lightly just to make incremental progress.</p>

<p>And any hard-earned progress can feel incredibly fragile in <em>Baby Steps</em>. Literally one false step can send you sliding down a hill or tumbling down a cliff face in a way that sets you back anywhere from mere minutes to sizable chunks of an hour. There's no "reset from checkpoint" menu option or <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">save scumming</a> that can limit the damage, either. When you fall in <em>Baby Steps</em>, it can be a very long way down.</p>
<p>This extremely punishing structure won't be a surprise to anyone who has played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/"><em>Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy</em></a>, where a single mistake can send you all the way back to the beginning of the game. <em>Baby Steps</em> doesn't go quite that hard, giving players occasional major checkpoints and large, flat plains that prevent you from falling back too far. Still, this is a game that is more than happy to force you to pay for even small mistakes with huge portions of your only truly irreplaceable resource: time.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>On more than one occasion during my playthrough, I audibly cursed at my monitor and quit the game in a huff rather than facing the prospect of spending 10 minutes retracing my steps after a particularly damaging fall. Invariably, though, I'd come back a bit later, more determined than ever to learn from my mistakes, which I usually did quickly with the benefits of time and calm nerves on my side.</p>

<p><em>Baby Steps</em> is also a game that's happy to let you wander aimlessly. There's no in-game map to consult, and any paths and landmarks that could point you in the "intended" way up the mountain are often intentionally confusing or obscured. It can be extremely unclear which parts of the terrain are meant to be impossibly steep and which are merely designed as difficult but plausible shortcuts that simply require pinpoint timing and foot placement. But the terrain is also designed so that almost every near-impossible barrier can be avoided altogether if you're patient and observant enough to find a way around it.</p>
<p>And if you wander even slightly off the lightly beaten path, you'll stumble on many intricately designed and completely optional points of interest, from imposing architectural towers to foreboding natural outcroppings to a miniature city made of boxes. There's no explicit in-game reward for almost all of these random digressions, and your fellow cut-scene hikers will frequently explicitly warn you that there's no point in climbing some structure or another. Your only reward is the (often marvelous) view from the top—and the satisfaction of saying that you conquered something you didn't need to.</p>
<h2>Are we having fun yet?</h2>
<p>So was playing <em>Baby Steps</em> any fun? Honestly, that's not the first word I'd use to describe the experience.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>To be sure, there's a lot of humor built into the intentionally punishing designs of some sections, so much so that I often had to laugh even as I fell down yet another slippery hill that erased a huge chunk of my progress. And the promise of more wild cut scenes serves as a pretty fun and compelling carrot to get you through some of the game's toughest sections.</p>

<p>More than "fun," though, I'd say my time with the <em>Baby Steps</em> felt meaningful in a way few games do. Amid all the trolly humor and intentionally obtuse design decisions is a game whose very structure forces you to consider the value of perseverance and commitment.</p>
<p>This is a game that stands proudly against a lot of modern game design trends. It won't loudly and explicitly point you to the next checkpoint with a huge on-screen arrow. You can't inexorably grind out stat points in <em>Baby Steps</em> until your character is powerful enough to beat the toughest boss easily. You can't restart a <em>Baby Steps</em> run and hope for a lucky randomized seed that will get you past a difficult in-game wall.</p>
<p><em>Baby Steps</em> doesn't hand you anything. Your abilities and inventory are the same at the game's start as they are at the end. Any progress you make is defined solely by your mastery of the obtuse movement system and your slowly increasing knowledge of how to safely traverse ever more treacherous terrain.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBaOE-FpIBw?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>It's a structure that can feel punishing, unforgiving, tedious, and enraging in turns. But it's also a structure that leads to moments of the most genuinely satisfying sense of achievement I can remember having in modern gaming.</p>
<p>It's about a miles-long journey starting with a single, halting step. It's about putting one foot in front of the other until you can't anymore. It's about climbing the mountain because it's there. It's about falling down 1,000 times and getting up 1,001 times.</p>
<p>What else is there in the end?</p>

                <p>In response to the Department of Homeland Security's video using Ash Ketchum to promote ICE, The Pokemon Company's ex-legal chief said he "wouldn't touch" it, suggesting some possible reasons why the company might not pursue legal action.</p><p>This week, Homeland Security <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a video to X</a> of an arrest compilation. In between footage of ICE agents handcuffing people at their homes and in their cars are clips from the OG Pokemon TV series, with the famed "Gotta catch 'em all" theme playing in the background. When Ash Ketchum looks up at the sky, the text "The Department of Homeland Security" populates the screen in Pokemon's iconic yellow-and-blue font. As a Poke Ball closes, the camera zooms in on wrists in cuffs. And at the very end of the video, those arrested appear as Pokemon cards with their "crime" described under their picture.</p><p>Fans were understandably upset about this, with many in the comments begging for The Pokemon Company to sue the DHS. However, the company's former legal chief, Don McGowan, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained to IGN</a> why The Pokemon Company likely won't do anything about the video.</p><p>"I don't see them doing anything about this for a few reasons," McGowan started. "First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are insanely publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand. Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p><p>It's unclear what The Pokemon Company proper will do or say in response to the DHS's co-opting of Pokemon and Ash Ketchum. The video is still up and has been reposted by the government body's official account, so it appears as though DHS is happy to continue using Ash and the "Gotta catch 'em all" theme as ICE promotional material.</p>

			<p>NetEase has revealed the new convergence mode K'un-Lun: Heart of Heaven map that will be arriving in Marvel Rivals later this week, on September 25, 2025. The Summer Special Vol.2 is also now live in the game, and players can start to earn free cosmetics from the limited event until it closes on October 17, 2025. </p>



<p>This is the latest update since Marvel Rivals' <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/">Season 4 debuted earlier this month on September 12</a>, which also brought a new hero, Angela, to the game. Though perhaps more important was the fact that Season 4 marked the addition of a new playable platform for Marvel Rivals, with the game making its way to PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>The map reveal trailer shows off the vistas and intricately decorated hallways that will provide the backdrop for players' clashes, though as with any shooter, you won't get to really be familiar with the map until you've had the chance to play it yourself. At least the trailer allows you to take in the work NetEase put into the visual design of the map, since you'll likely be too focused on the match to notice when in-game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>New character cosmetics for Hela will also arrive alongside the map on Thursday, which you can see in the clip NetEase shared to X (formerly Twitter) below.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Shortly after Marvel Rivals came to PS4, NetEase introduced the game's technical director, Fanfan, to players in a new video series called 'Technically Speaking.' In its inaugural video, Fanfan addressed concerns that have surfaced from players around the game's performance and offered some explanation as to what the studio is doing to try to fix the issues.</p>



<p>He also pointed to a standard test that PC players can run on their devices, to help determine where their graphical settings should be to ensure they get the smoothest, most stable experience possible during gameplay. Switching around your settings won't solve every issues players have, but it's the best place to start trying.</p>

That popularity is, in part, due to its Artifact-weapon system. Every player was granted an iconic weapon from Warcraft lore to upgrade over the course of the expansion. Because WoW's real endgame is transmog, each Artifact weapon also sported a variety of different skins and color variations for players to pursue and collect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4573453-wowlegionremixschedule.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573453" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4573453-wowlegionremixschedule.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573453"></a><figcaption>WoW Legion Remix's content schedule.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4573453-wowlegionremixschedule.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, as part of Legion Remix, players are getting a second chance at the expansion. In a <a href="https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/not-adding-non-mage-tower-artifact-appearances-to-remix/589492/2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a> from WoW community manager Kaivax, Blizzard clarified that nearly all of Legion's original Artifact-weapon appearances (minus ones available only through PvP, since Legion Remix is a PvE-only event) will be available during the event. Many of these Artifact appearances are technically still earnable in the modern version of the game, though Legion Remix's increased leveling speeds and power levels will make leveling new characters for the event and blasting through some of the prerequisites faster.</p><p dir="ltr">"In Legion Remix, you'll have a great opportunity to obtain Artifact appearances that you haven't already," Kaivax said.</p><p dir="ltr">However, there is one notable exception--Mage Tower Artifact appearances. One of Legion's most innovative additions, the Mage Tower was introduced later on in the expansion and served as a challenge mode for various class specializations. Completing the different Mage Tower challenges originally granted exclusive Artifact weapon tints. However, once Legion ended, the Mage Tower was removed, as were its rewards. While Blizzard did eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-popular-mage-tower-is-becoming-a-permanent-feature/1100-6501781/" data-ref-id="1100-6501781">bring the Mage Tower back</a> with new rewards, many of the original rewards, including exclusive Artifact-weapon tints, weren't made available.</p><p dir="ltr">Those Artifact appearances won't be obtainable in Legion Remix, either, and will thus remain unobtainable for all of those who didn't complete the various Mage Tower challenges back when it was originally available.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players have long hoped Blizzard would bring back the ability to earn the original Mage Tower appearances, first when it was reintroduced in 2022 and now as part of Legion Remix. Blizzard, however, laid out its reasoning for excluding these rewards when Legion Remix was first announced, and is continuing to stick to its guns.</p><p dir="ltr">"Many times throughout the history of World of Warcraft, there have been items, titles, and other kinds of rewards that belong in a category of the most prestigious and historic accomplishments--rewards that we believe should be preserved in a historical context for only those players who earned them at the time," Kaivax wrote in a July <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/whats-your-wishlist-for-lemix-part-1/2085628/153" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Legion Remix will launch as part of WoW's 11.2.5 patch on October 7. Like last year's Mists of Pandaria Remix event, those looking to participate won't need to purchase WoW's latest expansion but will need a subscription or game time in order to play.</p><p dir="ltr">Legion Remix will speedrun through the expansion's original content by releasing its content patches in chunks every two weeks. Players will be able to earn all kinds of new and returning cosmetic rewards, as well as level up their Artifact to even greater levels than ever before. That extra power can then be put to the test with the event's new, Diablo-inspired Heroic World Tier and Timeworn Mythic+ Keystone dungeons.</p>

Players will travel the seas, explore new lands, and build cities as they make the best of things while the "oppressive demands" of the cat overlords are asking for more and more.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouXnSla_wUI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ouXnSla_wUI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Establish waste management and healthcare facilities, ensure buildings are properly heated and maintained, and send forth your mice to fell trees, mine mountains, and tend to the fields and fish," reads a line from the game's description. "The cats will demand their due, and your own citizens will abandon the colony if their needs aren't met on a daily basis--you must strike a perfect balance between the needs of the mouse and the demands of the cat."</p><p>Players must build complex systems to like pipelines for water flow, conveyor belts, and ramps to move goods quickly from one place to another, and spend time R&amp;D efforts to find new technologies to "bring a bright future for mousekind."</p><p>"There's only so far a mouse can be pushed before it must push back--the demands of the cat grow more unreasonable by the day, and they care not for the suffering with which these demands are met," reads a line from the game's description. "Come rain or shine, the shipments must be fulfilled to feline satisfaction lest they call upon their henchmen to violently remind you of your duties. Will you forever serve this oppressive paw?

		<p>3D Realms and Anshar Studio have announced that Painkiller will get a roguelike mode called Rogue Angel, the day the game launches. This new mode is separate to the story mode and will take players to an area of Purgatory where the levels are procedurally generated which are home to a mix of bosses. Players will be able to collect weapons, tarot cards, and items as they progress through the levels to take on the challenges that will lay ahead.</p>

<p>Painkiller’s story puts you in Purgatory where you have been given a chance to redeem yourself after transgressing against Heaven.

<p>There are two versions of Painkiller available for pre-order including the standard version and the deluxe edition. The standard edition is priced at €39.99/£34.99 with a pre-order bonus of the Iron Crusade skin pack. This pack includes skins for all four of the game’s characters, who are Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. The Iron Crusade pack also has skins for six of the game’s weapons, with those being the Electrodriver, Stakegun, Shotgun, SMG, Hand Cannon and Rocket Launcher.

              <p>LEGO has just rolled out its new Advent calendars, and they’re giving early shoppers a real treat. Every year it’s the same story: prices are friendliest at launch then as December gets closer, demand sends them climbing back up.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4264/">the LEGO Minecraft advent calendar (2025 edition) is going for only $38 instead of the usual $44</a>. No wonder it’s already the fan favorite among all the LEGO calendars this season, from Harry Potter to Star Wars – but <strong>Minecraft is the #1 best-seller on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4264/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>LEGO just released its new Advent calendars, and they’re treating early buyers to a welcome bargain. Year after year: prices are kindest at introduction, then closer to December, demand pushes them on the rise. Currently, the LEGO Minecraft Advent Calendar 2025 is available for as low as $38 rather than its normal price of $44.99, which is its lowest ever on Amazon. No wonder it’s already the holiday favorite of all the LEGO calendars available this year, whether it’s Harry Potter or Star Wars—but Minecraft is in the spotlight.</p>



<h2>A Christmas Deal That Brings Minecraft to Life</h2>
<p>Why this set is exciting is pretty simple: children and adults like counting down to Christmas, and LEGO and Minecraft is as good a sure bet as you’re ever likely to get. Instead of a second box of chocolates, <strong>you’re getting 24 buildable surprises</strong> that extend the suspense through the morning.<strong> Constructed from 300 pieces</strong>, the set creates a full-sized Minecraft world to discover one day at a time.</p>



<p><strong>8 classic Minecraft mini-figures are shipped inside</strong>: Alex and Steve are present, of course, but you also get a Creeper, stray, drowned, zombie, snow golem, and even a villager in Santa clothes. They all come with holiday-themed accents that still fit the vibe of the holiday countdown without losing the characteristic Minecraft look.</p>
<p>What’s really cool is <strong>the way the pieces interact with one another</strong>: There’s something new every day and collectively, they build a Minecraft-themed winter village scene. That playmat background in the box acts as the glue to hold everything together so instead of having 24 separate builds, kids see their own Lego world come together over the space of a month.</p>
<p>This Advent calendar isn’t a separate collection: it’s <strong>compatible with the entire range of LEGO Minecraft</strong>. For someone who already has Minecraft Lego pieces lying around, this slots right into the existing collection. Kids can expand on their worlds, bridge scenes together or start with it and build something even bigger.</p>
<p>And there’s more than just nostalgia at play: LEGO calendars like this one don’t stick around at low launch prices. Historically, these drop right around release week before climbing steadily into mid-November, as the frenzy for Advent calendars kicks in. Waiting until December almost guarantees you’ll pay list price—or risk a sell-out altogether.</p>
