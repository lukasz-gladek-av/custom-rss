			<p>Unlike other entries in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> isn't all about sneaking around and killing enemies unseen, but stealth is still a big part of the experience, especially if you like using Naoe a lot. While Yasuke can hold his own in a fight against multiple enemies, the shinobi from Iga is almost always at a disadvantage in open combat, as her toolkit is more geared towards stealth gameplay and taking down enemies without being discovered.</p>
<p>Unless you are equipping the best possible gear at any given time, however, Naoe is not always able to kill enemies in a single strike by approaching them silently and using the Assassination ability. Whether it's due to an enemy's high health or armor, there will be times when an Assassination attempt will result in open combat, which can be a massive issue for the young shinobi.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250325132249_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you want to improve Assassin's Creed Shadows' stealth gameplay features without having to constantly hunt down the best possible gear, there's an easy way to make sure both Naoe and Yasuke will always perform<strong> lethal Assassinations</strong>. At any time during the game, enter the O<strong>ptions menu</strong> and access the <strong>Gameplay</strong> tab.&nbsp;<span>Here, pick the&nbsp;<strong>Difficulty Tuning</strong> option, where you can set the Combat Difficulty and the Stealth Difficulty and <strong>turn on Guaranteed Assassinations</strong>.</span>&nbsp;By turning on this option, all your successful Assassinations will automatically kill the target, regardless of the remaining health.</p>
<p>While turning on Guaranteed Assassination in Assassin's Creed Shadows may feel a bit like cheating for some, it is a massive game changer for stealth gameplay, as without it, the Assassination ability leaves something to be desired most of the time. With it on, however, you don't have to worry about anything else other than sneaking around and being a proper, lethal assassin!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update 1, which is set to introduce a new (or perhaps that should be returning) monster and more to the game next week.</p>

<p>Per a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>showcase that aired earlier today,&nbsp;Title Update 1 will arrive on Friday, April 4th. The main attraction when it comes to this update is the introduction of Mizutsune, a water monster that made its first appearance in 2016's 3DS game&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll need to be High Rank level 21 or over to take on Mizutsune, and once you reach this level, you'll be able to grab an Extra Mission after speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest. That's the mission in which Mizutsune waits for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-mizutsune.jpg?itok=biImuV5Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-mizutsune.jpg?itok=rfjIgQcj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first title update is heading your way soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just Mizutsune that's coming as part of this update, of course. You can also look forward to battling a new Arch-tempered version of new monster Rey Dau, which will be added to the game in a new quest "at a later date".</p>

<p>Zoh Shia, another new monster introduced in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, can now be fought as part of repeatable quests, although you will need to complete a new HR 50 mission in order to access it.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a new hangout spot for you and your fellow hunters, then you can head over to the new Grand Hub, which serves as a place "for hunters to gather and socialize", according to Capcom. There's also a fun new minigame to try out there.</p>

They are, as with any other form of human-invented categorization, arbitrary. The notion of labeling any specific game as one “type” is inherently nonsensical, all art existing on an infinite spectrum, the boundaries of labels drawn utterly subjectively. That’s been the case forever, and it’s notable that about 15 years ago there were growing calls to abandon genre titles altogether as they felt so needlessly restrictive and confusing.</p><p>Of course, instead, we went in exactly the opposite direction and quadrupled down on the concept, as we entered the Era of Tagging. As we desperately tried to maintain some sense of order while the number of games released swelled from “a manageable few” to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousands a month</a></span>,” we relied on genre tags to try to establish some notion of control. Except, oh dear God, it was done with no sense, understanding, meaning...it’s been sheer semantic vandalism, and the result is carnage.</p><figure id="" data-id="684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-recommend-id="image://684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Scott Olson / Staff<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-recommend-id="image://684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s really important that everyone’s on the same page regarding the subjective nature of genres. And for help, let’s look at fruit! You have, no doubt, either been the person, or been subjected to the person, loudly announcing that tomatoes are, in fact, not a vegetable actually, because they have internal seeds and so they’re a fruit. But, of course, tomatoes are actually a berry. Although a berry <em>is</em> a type of fruit. But it’s eaten, to quote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></span>, “as a vegetable.” Because “vegetable” is the word for the part of any plant that’s eaten as food. So <em>all fruit</em> are vegetables. So tomatoes are, of course, vegetables. And fruit. And berries. And broccoli is a flower. Pistachios and coffee beans are drupes, which are fruit. Avocados are maybe a drupe, maybe a berry, but definitely a fruit. Figs are an infructesence, filled with a multitude of single-seeded fruits (well, drupelets) created as a result of the pollination from specialized fig wasps, all surrounding the central “false fruit.” And peanuts are a legume. Let’s call the whole thing off.</p><p>The point is, <em>none of this is real</em>. These are all arbitrary categories invented by humans, into which the subjects do not usefully fit. Vegetation was just getting on with it, until we came along and tried to divvy them up into supermarket sections. And so it is for video games. Apart from the already existing bit.</p><figure id="" data-id="cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-recommend-id="image://cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-recommend-id="image://cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the very start of gaming, it just made sense to say, “Oh, those games are all adventures written entirely in text. Let’s call them ‘text adventures.’ And these ones are all about making that pixel blob jump between these platforms. They can be ‘platform games’.” That was useful for a good, solid ten minutes, before the imaginations of developers allowed for the merging of ideas, taking inspiration from here <em>and</em> there, and seeing what the results might be. In fairness, there were a fair few years when games could be quickly understood as “graphic adventures,” “god games,” “role-playing games,” or “strategy games,” albeit alongside the always-confusing category of “arcade games,” which originally meant games that were first released for arcade machines, and thus spread across a multitude of genres, but sort of came to mean games where things went “pew pew” and there was a high score table.</p><p>But even then, people were combining strategy and RPG, or including what were always called, in the snarliest of tones, “arcade sections” in graphic adventures. And then first-person shooters came along, so we needed “third-person shooters” to be a thing, and then the angle you looked at something from became a genre, hence “isometric,” and down into the madness we spiralled. I would say the moment all hope was lost was the point at which anyone, anywhere, thought “action game” might be a useful descriptor for <em>anything</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-recommend-id="image://a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="767" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-recommend-id="image://a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="767" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, as I mentioned, post-millennium people began talking about the need to ditch genres as a concept entirely. I remember being involved in heated discussions at various gaming magazines over whether they would stop listing a game’s “genre” as part of the review, given how the decision was really being made based on the personal view of the reviewer, rather than anything inherently born of the game itself. When we were running <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>, the team would frequently argue  over the useful/uselessness of tagging games by genre. It seemed, across the industry, that this terminology might be on the way out.</p><p>And then Steam arrived.</p><p>So, obviously genres never went away. Some games just <em>are</em> the next big first-person shooter, or the real-time strategy game that—oh so ironically—“redefines the genre.” People like to know if something’s a fruit or a vegetable, even if neither term means anything useful in context, and we all knew that this new <em>Monkey Island</em> game was a “point and click adventure” whether we wanted to or not. They served a function, even if it was wildly imperfect, and often deeply unhelpful. (I always think of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> as the perfect example of a game series that can never be usefully classified, hence the absolute blithering nonsense of “action-adventure,” as if that isn’t a term that could be ascribed to just about anything short of a puzzle game.)</p><p>Up until this point, genres were pretty much decided by the developers, even if it was often begrudgingly. The need for a press release meant they had to call their game <em>something</em>, and  “defying genre” too quickly became associated with extremely off-putting braggadocio. Most instead opted for hyphenates, picking two of three genres their game sort of loosely fell into, describing their game as “first-person-strategy-adventure-typing-sim” or what have you. It was only more proof that the whole conceit was nonsense.</p><p>But then the floodgates opened, and everything got flipped upside down. In the last 15-or-so years the explosion of online stores, most especially Steam, and the ease of access to development tools like Unity and Unreal has caused the numbers of games released to grow explosively. From 2008 to 2012, around 300 games were releasing a year onto Steam. In 2012, Valve launched Steam Greenlight, via which games could be voted for to be allowed to release on store, and by 2017 that number had reached 7,000. That year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1265922321514182595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1265922321514182595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve ditched Greenlight</a></span> and replaced it with Steam Direct, where anyone could release a game on Steam if they paid $100. In 2020, around 10,000 games were released. By 2023 it was 14,000. Last year, 2024, that number hit 18,892.</p><figure id="" data-id="fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-recommend-id="image://fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1998" data-height="1124" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-recommend-id="image://fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1998" data-height="1124" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While developers can select their own genre categories, Steam, as Valve is so wont to do, handed over much of the responsibility for the labelling of genres to its users. And as anyone who’s ever met a group of other people will know, they’re <em>idiots</em>, and giving them the ability to tag games on the online store has led to a whole new form of chaos. Where a decade-and-a-half ago we were taking steps toward a beautiful genre-free future, we’ve now instead just taken a sharp left and jumped off a nearby cliff. Genres now mean <em>nothing whatsoever</em>.</p><p>I first became frustrated by this phenomenon by the demolition of the “adventure” genre. It was, for my entire life, used to describe...well, “adventure games”! These began in the late-70s, early-80s as text adventures, and during the ‘80s evolved into graphic adventures which, once mice became commonplace, would become known as “point-and-click adventures.” (The term has a rather quaint, anachronistic tone nowadays, given that the act of pointing and clicking is hard to remember as revolutionary, but it was meant to distinguish these games from those graphic adventures in which you primarily engaged via a text parser. To this day, among decent-minded people, “point-and-click” has semiotic meaning, a game of the ilk of <em>Monkey Island</em>, <em>Day of the Tentacle</em>, <em>Gabriel Knight</em>, or <em>The Longest Journey</em>. You move a character around scenes, gather items into an inventory, chat with other characters, and solve puzzles by using inventory items on the world.)</p><p>Yet, click on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the “Adventure” tag in Steam</a></span> and you might as well have clicked on a tag for “Game.” The first few games it suggests to me are <em>Pathologic 2</em> (a first-person RPG), <em>Into The Necrovale</em> (a top-down hack-and-slash roguelite), <em>Dark Deity 2</em> (a turn-based strategy RPG!), and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> (an open-world action-RPG). See! Those are literally the first four I saw under the tag, each a wildly different type of game, and none of them in any sense an “adventure.” With half of them, it’s hard to even argue that they’re about <em>having an adventure</em>.</p><p>But it’s so, so much worse than that. Because, you might say, “Oh get over it, old man. We cool kids use ‘adventure’ to describe...games...that exist! Use something more specific!” So OK, I know, I’ll search for something far more precise, the unimpeachably clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure_point_click&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure_point_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Point &amp; Click Adventures.”</a></span></p><p><em>Mr. Prepper</em>: A survival crafting sim.</p><p><em>Steps of Debauchery</em>: A porn visual novel.</p><p><em>Urban Jungle</em>: A “relaxing” puzzle game about growing plants.</p><p><em>Let’s Minesweeper</em>: An online multiplayer tile puzzle game.</p><p>SERIOUSLY?!</p><p>However, I absolutely cannot deny that all these games contain the ability to point a mouse and click. Much like <em>Doom Eternal</em> and <em>Civilization VII</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dan Kitwood / Staff<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And so, my opening thesis is proven correct, all opposition is demolished, and everyone in the whole world owes me and everyone else an apology.</p><p>The same phenomenon is true across all genres on Steam, and it’s just the same on Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo’s online stores. These terms have become, for want of a better word, clickbait. People search for this genre term, so stick it on the game. I just looked up “Real-Time Strategy” on Steam (a genre for which I have no interest) and it immediately offered me <em>DOTA 2</em>, then threw in a good handful of turn-based strategy and tower defence games, and <em>so</em> many city builders.</p><p>15 years ago we were arguing that genres were useless because they needlessly boxed in creativity, applying artificial labels to a medium that inherently defied them. It felt reductive to describe a game as Type C instead of Type F, a process that failed to usefully communicate nuance. We are now so bloody far through that looking glass, and have emerged in a place where it’s the genres themselves that defy classification, where they’ve all become gobbledegook words that mean nothing and can be applied to anything. We wanted to be post-genre, but we’ve instead become post-meaning.</p><p>Why does it matter? Well, because I want to be able to find new point-and-click adventures on Steam, for one thing, and cannot find them buried beneath an avalanche of games that let you use your mouse on the menus. But beyond that, it matters because it’s just more empty cacophony in a world where those with power are trying to destroy any sense of meaning.</p><p>Is there a fix? No, I don’t think so. Sorry, that’s not very satisfying, is it? I think, like vegetation, we’ve just muddled ourselves to the point where we don’t know where we’re supposed to go in the gaming supermarket to find the games we want to consume. It’s too late. We broke it. We’re stuck with some useless nothing now.</p><p>Although, if you want a pithy closer, you could argue the AAA publishers are doing their bit by only investing in open-world action games, soulslikes or hero shooters. That certainly refines things a little.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All eyes in the video game industry are watching to see when Grand Theft Auto 6 will release. The potential impact on the industry is expected to be very large, but several publishers planning to release games around the same time are ready to delay just to get out of its way.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-don-t-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">“We Don’t Want to Be Anywhere Near That”</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Christopher Dring</a> of the recently launched outlet The Game Business, “three major video game publishers” are ready to delay their games to avoid GTA 6. Dring says that the boss “of one of the world’s biggest game publishers” told him: “Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market. We don’t want to be anywhere near that. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles.”</p>



<p>This past weekend at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco, Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson was told by a few developers that they’re “waiting to see what GTA 6 does.” Back in December, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that competing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishers are “waiting as long as possible to commit to their release date.”</a></p>



<p>The launch of GTA 6, tentatively scheduled for October 2025, reportedly isn’t just scaring off major new releases. According to Dring, two developers of “top 10 live-service games” are not planning any significant updates during the GTA 6 launch window. One studio boss reportedly said that they would “nudge” their releases ahead or backwards three weeks just to avoid GTA 6. The studio heads that spoke to Dring spoke of other potential issues, like a crowded schedule of other games trying to avoid GTA 6, but those problems seem preferable than trying to compete with a potentially industry-altering release. However, as one industry consultant noted at GDC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/if-gta-6-delayed-tank-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting on GTA 6 only for it to delay could “tank” those developers</a>.</p>



<p>Are game developers perhaps being too cautious of the GTA 6 release, or are they wise to get out of the way? Let us know down in the comments below! Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

Although Hollow Knight: Silksong technically has more followers on Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>, that data shows that over 52,000 people have wishlisted InZoi prior to its March 27 launch, skyrocketing its follower total to over 244,000.

However, he has announced that he has ceased all work on the project after being struck by a takedown from Rockstar owner Take–Two.</p><p>Dark Space created the free-to-download map solely based on the official trailer shots of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> and some unverified leaks, then uploaded gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. GTA fans who have been feeling deprived of any new information about the upcoming game downloaded the modded map off FiveM en masse. That's when he noticed messages from YouTube about his videos being taken down due to a copyright strike. </p><p>In an explanation video, the creator says that Take-Two requested that his videos be removed, resulting in his first copyright strike. Multiple strikes can result in the termination of an entire channel.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7LmLfJAuR_U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I've also removed the download link to my mod, even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space said in the video. "I think it's smarter to get in front of them than waiting for their email that will never come. To avoid another copyright strike from Take-Two, I'm not going to use any footage from Grand Theft Auto in this video." He went on to explain how he ended up in this situation, giving a brief history of the modding and map-making community for GTA and how they were trying to guess how big the map was going to be in GTA 6.</p><p>"So why did they remove my video and take away my month's income that I spent two months hard to earn? Well, my guess is that the map is a little too accurate," he continued. "They must feel some sort of threat from it existing because they feel that having a playable version of the map to drive around in could ruin the surprise and newness of GTA 6 when it releases."</p><p>That kind of removal request seemed almost inevitable. Former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij recently commented on the frequent takedowns by Take-Two, saying they are "entirely predictable."</p><p dir="ltr">"They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests," he <a href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1883238047015149881" rel="nofollow ">tweeted</a> back in January. "The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.) There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to be released this fall on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. There has not been an announcement date for a PC release but that will likely be coming later.</p>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> nudging toward its one-month anniversary, Capcom has whipped out another showcase, this one detailing the game's first free content update. And while we already had a pretty good idea what to expect thanks to earlier teases and reveals, we've now had the full run-down - including a confirmed 3rd April release on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the monsters, Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 adds Mizutsune, first seen in 2015's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-generations">Monster Hunter Generations</a> and now back to rain bubbly mayhem on unsuspecting players. He'll be available at Hunter Rank 21 and above, and is unlocked by talking to Kanya in the forest. Mizutsune can be farmed to make new Hunter and Palico gear.
</p>
<p>
Players looking for a more significant challenge can also take on Monster Hunter Wilds' first arch-tempered beast - a variant of Rey Dau, who'll be available as part of a limited-time Event Quest running from 30th April to 21st May BST. Players will need to have reached Hunter Rank 50 or above to accept the quest, and can forge the Rey Day (gamma) and Felyne Rey Dau (gamma) armour by gathering sufficient materials.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Title Update 1 introduces big boss Zoh Shia as a farmable monster with its own Hunter and Palico equipment to forge. In order to fight it again after completing story mode, players will need to accept a special quest available at Hunter Rank 50 and above - after which Zoh Shia can be accessed through the Environment Overview screen and during the Wyvern's Wakening in the Ruins of Wyveria.
</p>
<p>
And if you're looking for somewhere to relax inbetween all that hunting, there's some good news: Title Update 1 also brings a new social area known as The Grand Hub. This can be unlocked by talking to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord Hunter, at Rank 16 and above, and provides players will a range of new activities to undertake in their downtime.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a variety of convenient local amenities, it features what appears to be a proper canteen for pre-hunt meals, alongside tables for arm wrestling and a new Barrel Bomb bowling mini-game. Players can unlock useful items and pendants by honing their bowling skills, although it does require Barrel Bowling Vouchers. These can be earned in various ways, Capcom notes, including through login bonuses. And as an added treat, players will occasionally find the so-called Diva offering her song of worship when they visit the hub at night, so they can settle back and enjoy the show.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Once players have unlocked The Grand Hub, the Squad Information Counter will relocate here from the Windward Plains, and it's also the place to find the Arena Counter for Monster Hunter Wilds' new Arena Quests. These see teams of no more than two players competing for the fastest times as they take on monsters using predetermined equipment. Title Update 1 also adds Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests - both available as limited-time Event Quests - that up to four players can tackle using any equipment in order to earn pendants and other rewards.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, The Grand Hub will serve as the focus for Monster Hunter Wilds' new seasonal events, starting with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance on 23rd April. This celebration of spring sees The Grand Hub getting a bit of a makeover, alongside festival-specific meals, and various opportunities to obtain new equipment, pop-up camp decorations, gestures, and more.
</p>
<p>
That's it for the big Title Update 1 features, but Capcom still had a little more to share. Once the update arrives, it'll also be possible to change Alma's outfit (and, later, glasses) from the Appearance menu at camp. There'll be a free outfit included, and presuably more to purchase using real money from the Monster Hunter Wilds store. Speaking of which, players can grab a selection of free classic gestures in the store when Title Update 1 arrives, and the previously announced Cosmetic DLC Pack 1 will also be available to download by Premium Deluxe owners and Cosmetic DLC Pass holders. And still in the realm of paid cosmetics, there'll be new pendants to attach to your weapons, and new camp gear options to purchase - including a big old barbecue and giant stuffed bears to lounge around on.
</p>
<p>
To recap, Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 arrives next Friday, 3rd April. And looking further into the future, more Event Quests are promised - with rewards including a lovely flowing scarf - and a smaller update releases at the end of May. This'll introduce an unspecified collaboration with another Capcom game and "other additional features", including a list showing the endemic life you've captured. As for Title Update 2, that's coming this "summer" and, judging by Capcom's teaser trailer, will see the return of water leviathan Lagiacrus.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is already one of the best games of the year, but Capcom and the development team have never left Hunters hanging for very long without anything new to do. Just like Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, it looks as though Wilds is going to be well supported after launch, and the first example of that is Title Update 1, which will arrive on April 3rd (PDT) and April 4th (BST) with a host of new things to get your sword into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase | March 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZoCy3F4J_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On April 4th, Hunters can look forward to the game’s first new creature, with the arrival of Mizutsune, the Japanese-inspired dragon-like creature, whose special bubble attacks can fill the battlefield with colour and chaos. It’s a welcome return, and as one of the most beautiful monsters in the series storied roster, expect it to look even more spectacular in Monster Hunter Wilds updated graphics. There will of course be new armour and weapons to be crafted from Mizutsune’s</p>
<p>April 30th will see the arrival of Arch-tempered Rey Dau, a meaner, tougher version of the creature. You have to wonder after all the talk about the game being easier, whether this fight is going to be truly brutal, with the team cranking the difficulty up. I can only hope that’s the case. Heck, I might even fail a mission! There’ll be new armour in the shape of the Rey Dau Gamma and Felyne Rey Dau Gamma armour sets.</p>
<p>Zoh Shia, the game’s biggest boss, will now be available to hunt at Hunter Rank 50, Zoh Shia will also appear during the Wyverns Awakening in Wyveria, and there’ll once more be new armour and weapons to craft from the many many items you’ll be able to farm from them.</p>

<p>Finally, we got a look at the new location The Grand Hub. This is the all-new Gathering Hub, and alongside your hunting-prep, you can get back into arm wrestling and meal times together, both of which make a very welcome return. It’s going to be available once you reach Hunter Rank 16, so if you’ve been there since launch there’ll be no waiting at all! While you’re messing around there’s also a new barrel bowling game, where you can earn in-game rewards to deck your hunter out with.</p>
<p>There’ll be new Arena Quests too, as you now race to achieve the fastest hunt times against hunters from around the world. There’s now a ranking screen where you can see the fastest times posted by the world’s best. There’ll be special pendants and rewards to earn, the rarity of which will increase depending on your ranking. These quests can be undertaken by up to four hunters, or you can bring support hunters with you, so it’s not a solo affair either.</p>
<p>Further improvements include Alma gaining the ability to change her outfit, and even the ability to change her glasses, while classic gestures from the older games will also return, and we got a look at the contents of the first batch of Cosmetic DLC, entitled Pack 1.</p>
<p>The first seasonal event is also coming, with the Celebration of Spring punctuated by the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance, which is due to start on April 23rd, running until the 7th of May with special decorations and equipment available to earn. If you ever took part in the similar events for the previous games, you’ll be able to earn exclusive armour sets that are often amongst the outrageous in the series. We’ll have to see if that continues.</p>
<p>More updates will be on their way, and they’re already touting a Capcom collaboration for the end of May as part of Update Ver.1.011, as well as even more features for us lucky Hunters! </p>
<p>Finally, they announced that the second Title Update will also launch in the summer, presumably bringing even more monsters and quests. The biggest mic drop for the end of today’s feed came in the closing moments with a teaser of Lagiacrus, the lead monster from Monster Hunter Tri (and my favourite monster of all time) who looks to be joining the game in Title Update 2. Happy Hunting indeed!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-nintendo-switch-2-will-have-a-3-phase-launch-plan-for-its-games.1144113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With Nintendo Switch 2 just one week from its official full reveal, this year’s annual GDC was buzzing with talk around the future of the console. One such discussion was around the Nintendo Switch 2 launch date, which according to people that I spoke to at the event falls in June. </p>



<p>But that’s not all, according to various sources, the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch its games in a three-phase strategy, starting with primarily first-party games on launch. </p>



<p>According to sources, the second-stage will arrive in October-November for third-party studios, most of which are expecting the dev kits for the Switch 2 to be sent in June. Finally, it was said that the third phase for games will be in the holiday period.</p>



<p>In addition to the talk of the three-phase launch plan, Insider Gaming has also learned that select media and creators will be attending Nintendo Switch 2 hands-on next week, where they’ll get hands-on with the console and some of its launch games for a few hours.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to be fully revealed on April 2nd, so we expect more in-depth hardware coverage and perhaps some of its launch games too. A launch price along with the official release date is also expected to be announced during the event.</p>



<p>According to various gaming insiders, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo is also planning a Nintendo Direct later this week</a>, but its contents is currently unknown.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal on April 2nd? Let us know down in the comments below! Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

It will add Mizutsune as a huntable monster, the Grand Hub Area, and more. A second free Title Update is planned for release this summer, with Lagiacrus teased as a new huntable monster. <span id="more-952186"></span></p><p>Here is the roadmap of upcoming updates:</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MH-Wilds-Title-Update-1_03-25-25_Roadmap.jpg"></a></figure><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Title Update 1</strong></p><p>Title Update 1 features the arrival of the bubbly leviathan Mizutsune to the Forbidden Lands alongside other new challenges and features like Arch-tempered Rey Dau, the Grand Hub gathering area opening its doors to hunters, the first Festival seasonal event, and more.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Scrubs in Bubbles</strong></p><p>Last seen in <em><a title="Games > Monster Hunter Rise [80 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em>, the Bubble Fox Wyvern Mizutsune slips into the Forbidden Lands on April 4. Starting at Hunter Rank 21, players can unlock the mission to hunt Mizutsune by speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest, but hunters should prepare for the leviathan’s graceful attacks and immobilizing bubbles or risk ending up in the wash. Arch-tempered Rey Dau will also debut in an Event Quest for players above Hunter Rank 50, offering an increased challenge beyond that of Tempered monster hunts, plus a new Rey Dau Gamma armor-set to forge as a reward. The Hunter Rank 50 mark will also unlock a mission to once again hunt Zoh Shia, after which the fearsome monster will appear during the Wyvern’s Wakening in the Ruins of Wyveria for additional hunts and the ability to gather Zoh Shia parts for high-rank hunter and Palico equipment.</p><p>Arena Quests, Challenge Quests, and Free Challenge Quests will also appear as limited-time Event Quests. Arena Quests and Challenge Quests can be completed by up to two players using pre-determined equipment. Meanwhile, Free Challenge Quests have no equipment restrictions and can include hunting parties of up to four players. All new quest types can be completed solo, cooperatively in cross-platform online multiplayer, or using Support Hunters. Replay for faster clear times and earn a spot on the leader board for special pendants as rewards. New Event Quests will continue to appear on the Quest Board and will include opportunities earn special armor, quickly raise your Hunter Rank, collect cooking ingredients, and more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_952187"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Gathering Forces and New Hunting Choices</strong></p><p>Title Update 1 introduces the Grand Hub to <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>—a massive gathering space for hunters to engage in new ways, such as competing in the new Barrell Bowling minigame to earn useful items and pendants. Hunters can also gather in the Grand Hub to observe the village of Suja’s traditions, including the Diva’s nightly vocal performance. Talking to Tetsuzan in Suja after reaching Hunter Rank 16 unlocks the Grand Hub, at which point the Squad Information Counter will relocate from the Windward Plains so hunters can conveniently manage their Squads in the communal area. The entrance to the Grand Hub will also host the Expedition Record Board, where the newly added Arena <a title="Platforms > Quest [135 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s’ fastest global clear times will be displayed alongside Arena Quest limited bounties.</p><p>Each season, a unique celebration will be held in the Grand Hub. These will begin with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance, which runs from April 22 to May 6. During festivals, the appearance and available meals in the Grand Hub will change, and hunters can obtain limited-time equipment, gestures, Pop-Up Camp decorations, and more. In addition to seasonal Event Quests, most previously held Event Quests will also make a return. Arch-tempered Rey Dau will appear as part of an Event Quest at the conclusion of the festival in May. Hunters should keep their eyes peeled for an upcoming Capcom collaboration with another title near the end of the month as well!</p><p><strong>Don’t be Blandgonga</strong></p><p>Classic gestures are making their return as free downloadable content in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, alongside Cosmetic Downloadable Content Pack 1 for Premium Deluxe Edition and Cosmetic Downloadable Content Pass holders. Looking to style out more than just your hunter? A new outfit for your trusty handler Alma and the ability to change her glasses will be available for free, alongside new Camp Gear options for your Pop-Up Camps throughout the Forbidden Lands. Hunters looking to flex their catalogue of endemic life should stay tuned to future updates, which will include a list of all the critters they have gathered.</p></blockquote><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,126 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,937 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,703 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and the full showcase below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dawnfolk-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maybe you have this problem too: There’s a new, or new to you, game you want to play, but you can’t seem to get in the right headspace to learn its ropes. Maybe you’re too tired or stressed out or distracted to give your attention to a bunch of new jargon and menus and button presses. Enter <em>Dawnfolk</em>, a recent city-builder that’s both complex and approachable.</p><p><a href="https://dawnfolk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dawnfolk</em></a><em> </em>came out in February, but I only learned about it last week thanks to past colleague <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/03/dawnfolk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Walker</a>. Its world is laid out as a grid, with each tile representing a biome such as fields, mountains, or deserts. You expand your civilization by filling each tile with buildings, which both earn and cost you resources. All of this becomes a balancing act: Tents and houses give you more people, but those people need to be fed. You build farms to generate food, but those farms cost materials to create. You build mines in the mountains to generate materials, but those mines need people to work them, and now you can’t generate more materials without getting more people, but you’re out of tiles to build homes for those people and need to spend your light resource to expand.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlocking undiscovered tiles costs light, with tiles costing more light the farther they get from the center of your city. It’s a resource I didn’t think about much until I desperately needed it, either to grow the map or to fight the darkness storms that occasionally threaten your civilization. Light can be generated from specific buildings, and it can also be farmed from certain kinds of tiles. You get some warning before darkness storms occur, which means I often found myself putting my city-building on hold to frantically amass it, all while facing the same problems I had before my priorities shifted.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dawnfolk - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZUoNPtd0JM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This is the nature of city-builders, but unlike other games, I’ve yet to find myself in a downward spiral in <em>Dawnfolk</em>. I wasn’t always flush with resources, and I sometimes found myself with nothing to do while I waited for resources to generate (you can speed up time, but I kind of liked just letting it pass), but I could always do what I needed to with enough thought and patience. Things can get hectic when you’re facing several challenges at once and have to balance multiple needs, but like the game’s tiny map, so far it’s always felt contained and approachable. I’ve only played the first two of the game’s many scenarios, and not yet touched the endless or puzzle modes I’ve seen in its menus, and while there’s depth in terms of upgrading your buildings to give them new abilities, or to laying out your cities to take the best advantage of their adjacency bonuses, it all feels easy to get your head around. It was satisfying to see how quickly my handful of tents became a sprawling civilization, and even when this growth introduced new challenges, I never felt like things were out of control. </p><p>Some tiles and scenarios require playing little minigames, each contained to their tiny space. You hunt deer in a forest by shooting minuscule arrows at minuscule critters; light needs to be collected from light wells by moving a tiny jar; darkness storms and monsters are fought with itty-bitty swords and shields. You can upgrade a building to play the minigames for you, or turn light wells into light farms that eschew the need for collection, but so far I love how sometimes I’m briefly playing a whole different kind of game. It helps each tile feel like a whole world in itself, and helps the game’s map feel varied and alive.</p><p>There’s a storyline running through <em>Dawnfolk</em> about the origin of the storms and the nature of the companion character who narrates events and teaches you how to play; the menu is full of tiles you unlock with an additional resource to play new modes. All this shows me how much there <em>is</em> in this game that I’ve only scratched the surface of, but instead of the pressure I can sometimes feel when a game hints at its depth, this all feels pleasantly exciting. So far, <em>Dawnfolk</em> feels abundantly relaxed, a lovely little world with so much to do, but one that neither feels too easy or too overwhelming. There’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308630/Dawnfolk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> on Steam if you want to get a feel for it, and the game is also available on <a href="https://darenn.itch.io/dawnfolk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">itch.io</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-seasons-change-nature-review"><h3>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Gets Nature Right</h3></a><p>In Assassin's Creed Shadows, nature is the star of the show.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo’s long-awaited Pokémon Legends Z-A sequel is reportedly playing it safe by adding no new Pokémon. This may come as both a shock and disappointment to fans waiting to see what new species were going to be added to the ever-growing Pokédex.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-platforms-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> is the next Pokémon title in the tall grass. It’s been a while since Scarlet and Violet, so it feels like the right time for fresh blood. It’s an ironic sentiment, as a leak has outed a lack of new Pokémon in the upcoming sequel to Pokémon Legends Arceus.</p>



<p>While nothing is official with leaks or rumors, the source is very reliable, and it’s looking like a quiet one on the incomings front.</p>







<figure><figcaption>The classics still work. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reliable and regular Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Centro Leaks</a> is back at it again. In a March 25 message on their X page, they said: “<strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A will not introduce any new Pokémon species</strong>.”</p>



<p>With 1,025 Pokémon registered in the total Pokédex, everyone was waiting with bated breath to see who Z-A would add. The news feels out of left field, more so when you consider that Legends Arceus at least added seven fresh-faced Pokémon, with an additional two variations on top of these.</p>



<p>Alas, it isn’t to be for Pokémon Legends Z-A. It appears the RPG will use a mix of Mon from the previous several generations. There could always be a surprise or two, so we won’t count our chickens just yet.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Pokémon Legends Z-A will not introduce any new Pokémon species.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Either way, it’s not all doom and Gloom, though. The return of Mega Evolutions is part of the recent Pokémon Legends Z-A leaks. If this news isn’t enough for you, check this out: A total of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-will-bring-27-new-mega-evolutions-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27 brand-new Mega Evolutions will appear in Legends Z-A</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killzone-remastered-trilogy-%E2%80%9Cwould-be-successful%E2%80%9D-says-series-composer.1144086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/killzone-remastered-trilogy-would-be-successful-says-series-composer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Could a Killzone remastered trilogy have success in the current era of gaming? If you ask series’ composer Joris de Man, that could be the case.</p>



<p>Killzone is one of the more beloved first-party franchises from PlayStation. But since 2014’s Killzone: Shadow Fall, the series as laid dormant as developer Guerrilla Games has since put full focus into the Horizon franchise. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/killzone-composer-would-love-a-remaster-trilogy-dont-know-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a>, de Man talked about the franchise and bringing it to a new generation of players.</p>



<p>“I know that there have been petitions for it,” de Man said regarding bringing back Killzone. “I think it’s risky because, I can’t speak for Guirella or anything… I don’t know if it will ever happen. </p>



<p>“I hope it will because I think it is quite an iconic franchise, but also I think it kind of has to take into account kind of the sensitivities and the shift in, I guess, what people want because it is quite bleak in some ways.”</p>



<p>When asked about if that meant a new Killzone game or a remaster, de Man believes a remaster would perform better.</p>



<p>“I think it remastered one would be successful,” he said. “I don’t know if a new game would be as much. I don’t know if people have moved on from it and want something—I don’t know, sometimes I get the sense that people want something a bit more casual, a bit more quick.”</p>



<p>Would you like to see Killzone return either with a new game or a remastered trilogy of some sort? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

You'll start by rolling for cards to craft a unique deck, and we'd recommend taking some time to roll as many times as possible and creating your perfect pack before you jump over to story mode.

                <p dir="ltr">A fun myth to hear about relates to a friend's uncle working at Nintendo to get the scoop on secrets. But what if your buddy's aunt actually did work at Valve, and his CD-burning gifts to you sparked Valve's utilization of DRM decades ago? That's apparently what happened, according to former Valve chief marketing officer Monica Harrington.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-drm-was-inspired-by-the-cmos-nephew-who-used-a-usd500-check-id-sent-him-for-school-expenses-and-bought-himself-a-cd-rom-replicator-he-sent-me-a-lovely-thank-you-note/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a> reports that Harrington told the unlikely Valve DRM origin story featuring her 19-year-old nephew at the Game Developers Conference. "At the time, consumer-level piracy was just becoming a real issue," Harrington said. "My own nephew had just used a $500 check I'd sent him for school expenses and bought himself a CD-ROM replicator, so he sent me a lovely thank you note essentially saying how happy he was to copy and share games with his friends."</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that CDs were the distribution model for PC games decades ago, before digital storefronts existed. So the fact someone could easily rip a game and share unlimited copies with friends was a threat to companies. As such, Harrington credits her nephew's antics for sparking Valve to act with a DRM strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because of gamers like my nephew, we implemented an authentication scheme," said Harrington. "Customers had to validate and register their copy with Valve directly. Soon gamers were flooding message boards, and they were saying, 'The game doesn't work.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Harrington added that Valve co-founder (and her ex-husband) Mike Harrington remembers it a bit differently, as he believes the company was working on DRM already. But Monica Harrington stresses that she was making a big deal about an authentication system to everyone at Valve after hearing about what her nephew did.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the only story Monica Harrington shared about Valve's early days at GDC. She also discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dramatic-half-life-deal-that-altered-the-fate-of-valve-forever/1100-6530291/">the dramatic Half-Life deal that altered the fate of the company forever</a>. Meanwhile, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-seemingly-bans-all-steam-games-that-require-watching-advertisements-to-play/1100-6529356/">Valve seemingly banned any games that required watching paid advertisements to play</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Valve's digital storefront <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undertale-sees-new-peak-for-steam-concurrent-players-nearly-a-decade-after-launching/1100-6530156/">Steam broke a new concurrent-players record with over 41.2 million users</a>.</p>

The game's deep reliance on 20th century ideological and philosophical concepts wouldn't translate to mass entertainment without excessive iteration on text. To do so, they created a system that made text "as addictive and as snappy as Twitter," taking inspiration from messaging apps and notification systems to do so. "You have to do everything you can with the meaning of the text to make it as punchy as possible and to make it as personal as possible," Kurvitz said at the time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/jenny-jiao-hsia-s-consume-me-leads-2025-s-igf-awards-finalists" target="_self" data-discover="true">Jenny Jiao Hsia's Consume Me leads the list of 2025 IGF Awards finalists</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which brings us back to Francis' advocacy for word-based animation. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn't exactly the first game to use this technique!

<p>Civilization 7 is getting its latest update that aims to solve a number of issues players have had with the latest game in the legendary series. In a new post on Steam, along with a subsequent explainer video, developer Firaxis listed some of the improvements and additions coming in Civilization 7’s Update 1.1.1.</p>



<p>Some of those updates include the addition of Quick Move as a toggle option, Mount Everest as a new natural wonder, the ability to rename Settlements and commanders, and various UI updates.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the developer update video on the patch, creative director Ed Beach also touched on a new “Start Position” option in relation to map generation. Beach says the default setting called “Standard” will feel “a lot like Civ 6 where the continents are move varied and less predictable.” There is also a “Balanced” option that “puts everyone on an even playing field”.</p>



<p>There’s even a restart button to allow players to quickly restart a match with the same settings and Civilizations if they don’t like their starting position. </p>



<p>Regarding the game’s UI, there are new notifications for when you are under attack as well as new indicators for crises in the status bar. The rest of the patch notes for Civilization 7 Update 1.1.1 can be found in the dropdown below or via their <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p>
