		<p>After plenty of rumours and build up, Nintendo has confirmed that a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase will take place tomorrow, 31st July, at 2PM BST / 3PM CEST / 9AM EST / 6AM PDT.</p>
<p>Watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase – 31/07/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-9mHP826oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Nintendo Direct will be around 25 minutes long and, as it’s a Partner Showcase, it will put the focus on third party titles from publishing partners, with games for both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Naturally there’s an awful lot of speculation about what could be included, with games like Hollow Knight: Silkson, Hades 2 (which will be a timed console exclusive), Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Professor Layton and The New World of Steam, Two Point Museum and more all already announced for 2025.</p>

<p>We also wouldn’t put it past Nintendo to sneak in a first party announcement or two as well. Everyone is desperately keen to know when Metroid Prime 4 will release, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is also expected this year. Actually, the perfect announcement would be an Age of Imprisonment release date, and a Switch 2 update for Age of Calamity to lift its 30fps cap.</p>

			<p>VOID Interactive's Ready or Not arrived on consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-drops-on-consoles-on-july-15/">15 days ago</a> from the time of this writing. In its first four days on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S shelves, it sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-past-1-million-copies-sold-consoles-10-million-total-copies-sold/">1 million copies</a>, bringing the game's total sales to 10 million between consoles and PC. In the remaining 11 days, it sold another million copies, marking another huge milestone for the tactical shooter by hitting 2 million copies in just two weeks, and 11 million copies sold since its initial PC launch.</p>



<p>"<em>First, thank you to the players - for showing up, playing hard, and bringing order to chaos</em>," VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/julio-rodriguez-2591bb10_readyornot-consolelaunch-2million-activity-7356271625538846720-imwP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> announcing the milestone. "<em>Next, to the VOID dev team for building what we believe is the quintessential tactical FPS of our era — and to our friends and partners for helping us bring RON to console.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ready or Not hits 2M copies sold on console. Image credit: VOID Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ready or Not's console launch is clearly going well, but its success on PS5 and Xbox Series devices hasn't diminished how upset its PC player base has been since the console update, which brought a number of changes that didn't sit well with PC players.</p>



<p>Players have called out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english">changes </a>to certain aspects of the game censorship, and while it's clear from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash">review bombing on Steam</a> that a good chunk of the player base agrees, another element to this that players on PC are upset with is what players are calling a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadyOrNotGame/comments/1md3lai/i_have_some_questions_regarding_the_recent/">"<em>downgrade</em>"</a> in the graphics to align with the console versions.</p>



<p>We'll see how VOID Interactive responds in the coming weeks, and if there are any meaningful retractions from the studio to appease the players it has upset.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-paragon-antiquary-ritualist/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-unveils-paragon-antiquary-and-ritualist-elite-specs.1257069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet unveiled the second trio of elite specializations that will be introduced in the upcoming expansion Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity. Following the Troubadour, the Galeshot, and the Luminary, <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-three-elite-specializations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed last week</a>, this time it's all about the Paragon, Antiquary, and Ritualist.</p>



<p>The Ritualist is an elite specialization for the Necromancer. It's inspired by the original Guild Wars Ritualist profession, and it summons weapon spells that affect nearby allies. It also summons the spirits of Anguish, Wanderlust, and Preservation to attack foes.</p>



<p>The Antiquary is the new elite specialization for the Thief. As purveyors of rare artifacts, Antiquaries use their Pilfer skill to call upon the thieving inclination of their Skritt companions. They steal from enemies to create random improvised weapons. The Antiquary can use its unique skills while on cooldown, but doing so may cause detrimental effects, making it a risky proposition.</p>



<p>Last but certainly not least, there's the Paragon, a new elite specialization for the Warrior. With spear and shield in hand, these protectors of Elona build up their motivation resource by using burst skills. They can channel this motivation into vocal shouts, such as chants, refrains, commands, and echoes. These affect the surrounding area, either punishing enemies or supporting allies of the Paragon.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Presumably, ArenaNet will share the final three elite specializations for the remaining classes (Revenant, Engineer, and Elementalist) at some point next week. As a reminder, Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released on October 28</a>; beyond the new elite specializations, it'll offer brand new zones, new raid encounters, a new Fractal, a new Convergence, a new Homestead map, three new Mastery tracks for the Skimmer aquatic mount and various new armor, weapons, legendaries, and relics. The story itself centers around the Inquest's nefarious plan for the island of Castora.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase Announced for Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-tomorrow.1257066/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, so while we won't be getting info on first-party Nintendo titles, we will get to learn what third-party publishers are cooking up for the gaming giant's ecosystem.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950541896012493166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the Partner Direct showcase for July 2025 will air tomorrow, July 31st, at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern. That's around 2pm BST and about 3pm CEST, so make sure to set your alarm accordingly.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, you can expect "roughly 25 minutes" of info about upcoming Switch 2 and Switch games from the company's "publishing partners", although none of those partners are mentioned by name in Nintendo's post.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-star-wars.jpg?itok=au-Yq94W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-star-wars.jpg?itok=I76n2xBt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>could get another, erm, outing during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>We already know that games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">set to arrive on the Switch 2 in the near future</a>, so Ubisoft could choose to show off some more gameplay footage of its open-world adventure running on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>

<p>It could also be time for some third-party publishers to reveal ports of some of their most popular games for the Switch 2; Capcom could choose to bring more&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games to the platform, for instance, or EA could reveal that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">the recently-revealed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</em>is, in fact, also making its way to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a third-party showcase, one game is likely to be on everyone's mind, namely Team Cherry's&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Will we finally get to hear about a release date during this Direct?</p>

<p>I'd say there's a non-zero chance of that happening. Xbox recently announced that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo" rel="nofollow">will be playable at its booth</a> during this year's Gamescom, so that might line up pretty nicely with a Direct release date announcement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.jpg?itok=54K-Wd15 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.jpg?itok=RiUxOJy7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Come on, Nintendo. Please? For us?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, since Team Cherry is sort of hitching its wagon to Xbox (what with the game landing on Game Pass on day one and its inclusion as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">new ROG Ally reveal this summer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>might be a no-show during tomorrow's Direct as well.</p>

<p>Either way, you can check the show out tomorrow, July 31st, at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern. Join us here tomorrow for all of the reveals and news from that show as well!</p>

Nintendo’s hosting its next Direct presentation on Thursday July 31st bright and early at 9 AM ET. You can watch the direct on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gZoLrfLcIVg">here</a> and, of course, in the Nintendo Today app.</p><p>According to Nintendo, the 25-minute presentation will be a partner showcase, focusing on third-party titles for the Switch and Switch 2. (Sorry, y’all are gonna have to wait a little longer for more news on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630255/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>.)</p><p>A handful of older games are finding new life (and new audiences) on the Switch 2 like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and I expect there will be many more announcements of studios bringing their backlogs to the console. And for new games, <em>Silksong</em>, the long, <em>long</em> awaited sequel to Team Cherry’s <em>Hollow Knight</em> might <em>finally</em> get to see the light of day.</p><p>Last month, rumors from prominent insiders and leakers swirled that a Direct would be announced for the end of the month. They also speculated about what games would be shown which included a<em> Persona 3 Reload</em> port and, of all things, a new <em>Animal Crossing</em>. But we’ll find out for sure what Nintendo will give us next when the presentation airs tomorrow at 9 AM.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/715733/nintendo-direct-annoucement-july-2025-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

Ahead of its release, Nintendo has uploaded a new gameplay trailer revealing more details and reminding players of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-try-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-drag-x-drive-next-month-but-theres-a-catch/1100-6533193/" data-ref-id="1100-6533193">upcoming Global Jam demo</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ls_NtQ0s8k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Ls_NtQ0s8k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This will kick off on August 9 and runs through August 10, but the catch here is that you'll need an active Switch Online membership to access it. If you're interested, the demo will be available to download later today and the sessions will take place at the following times:</p><h2>Drag x Drive Global Jam playtest times</h2><h3>August 9</h3><ul><li>3 AM - 7 AM PT / 6 AM ET - 10 AM ET</li><li>5 PM - 9 PM PT / 8 PM ET - 12 AM ET</li></ul><h3>August 10</h3><ul><li>9 AM - 1 PM PT / 12 PM ET - 4 PM ET</li></ul><p>As mentioned above, the new overview trailer also provided plenty of details on how to play Drag x Drive. The Joy-Con 2 controllers are used to control each wheel on the wheelchair via mouse controls, and you can swipe forward or backward to control your momentum and direction. While a table is probably best for using these controls, Nintendo added that "most" flat surfaces--like your legs--will do just fine in a pinch. I've also tried the mouse controls on my oblivious cat as he naps on my bed next to me, and his squishy body worked surprisingly well as an impromptu mousepad while creating art in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Drag x Drive is one of two big releases for the Switch 2 in August. An upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land launches on August 28, and it'll include a brand-new expansion alongside updated graphics.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is also out in October, and Nintendo announced a new Direct livestream for July 31. The company says there'll be "roughly 25 minutes of information" on upcoming games to expect here, so it'll be interesting to see if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> gets a proper release-date confirmation.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, July 31, 2025. It'll be a 25-minute-long presentation of games from Nintendo's publishing partners, so it's unlikely that we'll get announcements like the release date for Metroid Prime 4. But it could be the kind of place where we see the release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, but it's the kind of news to expect instead of any news about Nintendo's first-party titles, as those are the kinds of announcements Nintendo would likely hold for a dedicated 'Nintendo Direct.'</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There have been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">rumors circulating </a>about a Nintendo Direct happening before the end of July, as a follow-up to the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, to let players know what's coming next for the console. Those rumors were seemingly correct, though not about it being a full-fat Nintendo Direct that would include first-party announcements.</p>



<p>Which could, of course, mean indie titles like Silksong and Hades II show up. Though it could also, and potentially even more likely, mean that we see more ports of games that are already available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series devices that the Nintendo Switch wasn't capable of running, but the Switch 2 can run perfectly well. </p>



<p>Games like Assassin's Creed Shadows, Hi-Fi Rush, Assassin's Creed Mirage, or news of a release date for some of the major ports already announced, like Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whatever's there, thankfully we won't have long to wait to find out, as the direct will kick off tomorrow morning at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST.</p>

Instead of a new 3D <em>Mario </em>or <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>deep-dive, the Nintendo Direct will focus on third-party games. </p><p>We’ll presumably get release dates for the upcoming ports of<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>and <em>Elden Ring</em>, but hopefully news about new ones as well.

Are we finally getting <em>Sea of Thieves </em>or <em>Diablo IV</em> on Switch 2?</p><p>Some personal predictions for the event include finally getting a release date for <em>Hades 2</em> (a timed-console exclusive for both Switch 1 and 2) and a mention of Call of Duty’s future on Nintendo’s platform, which Microsoft promised to support with the multiplayer military shooter following for the first time in years. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, one of this year’s best selling coop games and a cross-gen one to boot, also feels like an obvious pickup. </p><p>The mention of the OG Switch suggests players who haven’t upgraded will have some fresh games to look forward to this fall as well. With over 150 million units sold, it wouldn’t be surprising if Nintendo continues to support the older platform for a little while longer. </p><p>At 25 minutes, this won’t be the big Nintendo Direct fans are really waiting for. That’s more likely to come in September. But it should help fill in some of the question marks still outstanding in the Switch 2's first year. And with more powerful specs in tow, this fall could be one of the biggest for a Nintendo console in quite some time.</p><p> If <em>Borderlands 4 </em>can sneak its way onto the handheld hybrid, even at 30fps, who knows what other current-gen games can make the leap. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-elden-ring-ff7-time-date-1851787326]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">"It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illustration of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star)," the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" rel="nofollow ">statement</a> explains. "After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards. As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it's ready."</p><p dir="ltr">It also notes that a "broader investigation" is underway to make sure that there is no other plagiarised art in the game. The cards are still available to pull in-game, but as <a href="https://x.com/spragels/status/1950470860118380792" rel="nofollow ">shown by some users online</a>, instead of any art there is just text that reads "New Art Coming Soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Lanjiujui also <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610" rel="nofollow ">released a statement</a> earlier today following The Pokemon Company's, thanking it for its "attentiveness and swift action in removing the image."</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a Direct, which is set for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Direct will take place on 31st July, at 2pm UK time. It will be roughly 25 minutes long, and include information about games from Nintendo's publishing partners. This will include titles coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>So, what can we either hope for or expect from tomorrow's broadcast? Well, we could always start prepping our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong summoning circles once again. It has to show up some time soon… right? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">Xbox has a playable demo for Silksong at Gamescom this year</a>, but we know that Team Cherry's sought after Metroidvania is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">also primed for both Switch consoles</a>, so it could happen…</p>
<p>Personally, I would also love to hear or see more from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5's Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>. This chap was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">announced during a Nintendo Direct back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could perhaps hear about a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> on Switch 2. FromSoftware's incredibly successful game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">announced for Switch 2 back in April</a>, though with no date attached to it. The edition coming to Switch 2 will be the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">which includes the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>, as well as new armour and a new Torrent appearance customisation feature. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">Two new classes are also on the way as part of Elden Ring's Tarnished Edition</a>.</p>
<p>We also may hear more from Supergiant Games, which in April announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">Hades 2 would be a timed console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is still in early access on PC, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release">developer is gearing up for its full fat release (hopefully) very soon</a>.</p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer will be watching along to bring you the news as it happens. What do you hope to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-3]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview.1256985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s fitting that as Summer continues to blaze its way towards Autumn, we’re being treated to another entry in the Story of Seasons franchise. While the influence of early Harvest Moon and Story of Seasons games have been felt through the cosy gaming genre for decades, the farming and relationship-focused series has continued to plough its own furrow. This time, it’s a remaster of the classic DS outing, Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar, sprucing it up for the modern day, while bringing it to Nintendo’s brand-new Switch 2 platform, with a flurry of exclusive improvements in tow.</p>
<p><iframe title="STORY OF SEASONS: Grand Bazaar – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lI0QZKEdHbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the series is best known for its farming action, and a plot of farmland remains the foundation of your experience here, this is actually a game about business. Zephyr Town’s success and its populace’s well-being revolve around the Grand Bazaar, and your time, effort and focus have shifted to selling your produce and goods at the titular market.</p>


<p>Here, the Bazaar takes place at the end of every week, and you build your produce and wares accordingly, ready to sell them for the most profit. You’re handed a stall and a bell, and you have to attract people’s attention before making sure they’re served as quickly as possible. It’s not exactly frantic, at least not in this early portion of the game, but it’s a fun and welcome change of pace from the daily tasks you’re normally embroiled in. As you grow and expand your offering, so too does the market around you come back to life, bringing more visitors to the area, and increasing your standing with the local community.</p>
<p>Ready to begin your new life in Zephyr Town, there’s a very limited character creator here, that only really lifts itself into modernity by getting you to choose your birthday and offering you different pronouns. Still, you can unlock new outfits as you progress, and alter your appearance as you see fit, so there’s still fun to be had making the character your own.</p>

<p>You’ll likely want to make them as charming as possible, because relationships are an integral part of Grand Bazaar. Speaking to characters daily – or greeting them with a quick hello – will improve your standing with them, and you can build up a friendship, and even propose marriage, with your digital soulmate.</p>

<p>Special moments will appear on the map from time to time – with a helpful icon to show that they’re available – and these deepen your understanding of that character, learning about their love of cooking or grabbing a good cup of coffee from the cafe. Here in the preview a lot of time was spent talking to Sophie and Freya, both of whom seemed drawn to my hardworking farmer. We’ll see where it goes!</p>
<p>To be honest though, the highlight of the character roster has to be the mayor, Felix. He is uproariously upbeat and driven, wanting you and your farm to bring trade and prosperity back to Zephyr Town. I had to talk with him every day, just to see if I could make him say something brilliant in his booming voice, and he’s already an icon in my eyes. Interactions are definitely lifted by extensive voice acting, whether in whole during cutscenes or in part alongside written dialogue, and the entire town feels alive and real to you as you explore and chat with the locals.</p>
<p>As a remake of a DS game, Grand Bazaar’s art design and visual quality have seen a stratospheric jump. Now fully 3D, Grand Bazaar looks every bit the 2025 cozy farming sim, with an art style that lends it a Pokemon-esque feel, albeit one with a stable framerate. It goes to show just how good a game can look with a clean and charming aesthetic, and it serves to show up how rough the Switch version of the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-review/">Tales of the Shire</a> looks in comparison.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 edition uses all that extra processing power to pump everything out at a higher resolution, and there’s a sharpness and vibrancy to the visuals that definitely add an extra level of class. Besides that, there’s enhanced frame rates – seemingly taking them up to 60fps – but otherwise this is, to all intents and purposes, the same game you’re getting on the original Switch.</p>

<p>Where the new hardware adds something extra, is in the addition of mouse controls. However, I have to say that I’m pretty disappointed in how they’ve been implemented. I was hoping for a time-saving point and click option for your farming, much like we saw in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, but instead this is a tool for menu management more than anything else. I really hope that someone rethinks this, because it would massively improve players’ quality of life. All it has to do is make farming easier – hopefully that’s not too much to ask.</p>
<p>Grand Bazaar’s positioning as a remake, rather than an all-new entry in the series, is an interesting choice. In terms of quality, the original game sits somewhere in the middle of the series; the fundamentals of farming and trading form a solid foundation, while some of the design choices – such as the way that crafting was handled utilising the windmills – proved to be needlessly finicky. Through our hands on though, it feels like smart updates have been made to make the game more appealing, and I found myself easily drawn into the easy-going action.</p>
<p>Story of Season: Grand Bazaar is clearly familiar, embracing the tick of farming alongside the tock of building relationships, but the addition of the weekly Grand Bazaar gives you something more concrete to work towards. Everything is very focused, Zephyr Town, your farm and the Bazaar only taking a few minutes to walk around, but within that there’s a life to build which feels full of possibilities.</p>

		<p>Two new gameplay videos have been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, exploring the new Fusion system and Heavy Armor mechanics that will enhance the game’s player customisation. Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 5th September 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Fusion" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iSXGKlruTww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fusion will give you the option to forsake your humanity and fuse in Immortal Factors that are retrieved from fallen enemies. Factors come in three types –&nbsp;Might, Shell, and Skeleton – which determine the skill that they will offer, but fusing them to your body will mutate your character into something inhuman.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, though, you can always buy your humanity back for a fee, losing all the skills in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Heavy Armor" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZGFh8HHEjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But maybe you won’t need to indulge in body mods, since there’s customisable Heavy Armor that can be applied to your Arsenal mech in the thick of battle, calling it in when the call gauge is full to let you dish out more powerful attacks. In a brilliant move, your regular mech actually climbs into the bigger mech, meaning that you have a pilot inside a mech, inside a mech.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope we get a third game in this series so that we can have mechs piloting mechs piloting mechs. How far can this rabbit hole go?</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/11/daemon-x-machina-review/">Daemon X Machina review</a> back with its original Nintendo Switch release, Miguel wrote, “Daemon X Machina sets the bar for robot action games. The addictive mecha fighting is almost flawless, but it’s complemented by so many other incredible parts to the game. There’s a rich, unique world filled with incredible and memorable characters, endless and addictive customisation, gorgeous visuals and a jaw-dropping soundtrack. Daemon X Machina rarely stumbles, and even when it did, I still couldn’t help but be impressed by this amazing new experience.”</p>

<figure><a title="Ho-Oh Pokémon TCG Pocket: Wisdom of Sea and Sky" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c658c692ace3f/ho-oh-pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Overnight, The Pokémon Company was hit by allegations of plagiarism ahead of the release of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion, <strong>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</strong>. And today, with the release of the expansion, TPC has pulled the card — plus one other card — in question.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">social media</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-suddenly-pulls-card-design-embroiled-in-plagiarism-controversy-as-company-admits-production-issue-and-launches-wider-investigation">IGN</a>), TPC "deeply apologize[s]" for the error, which affects the Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star) cards drawn by SIE NANAHARA, which it puts down to a "production issue". The expansion was datamined yesterday by fans, which is where the card art for Ho-Oh came from.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards". The art has been replaced in-game with a "temporary placeholder".</p>

<p>The team is also "conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game."</p>
<p>The accusations focused on the Ho-Oh card specifically, which appears to be based on fanart art of the Legendary bird from <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu" tabindex="-1">lanjiuji</a>, which they published in 2021.</p>
<p>lanjiuji, confused at the potential plagiarism, shared some <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950044196842459644">comparison pics on social media</a>, and even at a quick glance, you can see that the resemblance is pretty darn close.</p>
<p>They have since released a <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610">statement</a> acknowledging The Pokémon Company's response, stating "My original post stemmed solely from perplexity upon encountering questionable images online, with no means to verify their authenticity as game assets".</p>

<p>"Relieved by the timely resolution, I also thank those who contributed constructive perspectives." the statement concludes. lanjiuji also potentially refers to a figure based on the artwork, created by PC House, which <a href="https://x.com/KetX2L/status/1950099518168432873">someone has linked in the replies</a>. The Ho-Oh art appears to be a commission from the company.</p>
<p>The situation has sparked discussions around Pokémon and its legal terms surrounding fanart — which seemed to suggest that The Pokémon Company owns any publicly shared artwork, and that it doesn't need to notify anyone if the company decides to use it.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/legal/information">legal statement here</a>, but whatever it says, today's decision implies that, while Pokémon <em>could</em> use your art, it wants to avoid doing so.</p>
<p>So, while we wait for the art to be replaced, let's have a look at that placeholder art, then:</p>

<p>Well, at least people are having fun with the temporary cards...! Alongside the new expansion, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week">huge overhaul to trading too</a>, which is a bit of a boon given how much it was criticised when it first dropped.</p>
<p><em>Have you been following this situation? Are you diving into the new expansion today? Let us know down below.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Looks Like Battlefield 6 Won't Cost You $80]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-battlefield-6-wont-cost-you-80.1256976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has declared that it has no intention of raising its games' prices to $80 anytime soon, so it looks like upcoming releases like&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, as well as already-confirmed titles like&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 26</em>,&nbsp;will still cost you $70 this year.</p>

<p>In an earnings call with investors (courtesy of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-no-80-games-for-now-were-not-looking-to-make-any-changes-at-this-stage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>), EA CEO Andrew Wilson answered an investor's question about whether EA was considering pricing its games at $80, since some of its competitors are beginning to do so.</p>

<p>Wilson said that EA wants to "capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible", and that while the company will continue to seek "opportunities to deliver great value...through various pricing schemes", there are "no dramatic changes planned yet".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-80-ea-andrew-wilson-explosion.jpg?itok=m4An-f78 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-80-ea-andrew-wilson-explosion.jpg?itok=Z8pd041E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA says it doesn't have any plans to change its games' prices yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Wilson's comments come after Nintendo revealed earlier this year that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">main launch title</a> for the Switch 2, would cost $80 (although that cost is drastically reduced if you pick the game up as part of a console bundle).</p>

<p>Xbox was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">originally due to follow suit</a> with its holiday releases, including Obsidian's&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and Activision's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, but after widespread criticism, the company revealed recently that its main lineup this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">will remain at $70</a>.</p>

<p>As for Sony, the Japanese gaming giant seems to be maintaining its $70 pricing structure for now, with recent release&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>coming in at that price alongside future titles like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, just because these companies say their games will remain at $70 for the time being, that doesn't mean they won't suddenly increase prices next year, or the year after. It's tough to say at this stage.</p>

If some rather telling pre-sell text is to be believed, it looks like it's set for an October release, and we'll be getting our first glimpse of gameplay tomorrow.</p>

<p>"Our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value," he said. "We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p><p>During EA's previous earnings call three months ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">Wilson said much the same thing when asked about $80 games</a>, so his new comments are no surprise.</p><p>A European leak recently suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6533386/" data-ref-id="1100-6533386">Battlefield 6's standard edition would cost €80 ($94 USD)</a>, but EA has yet to make any official announcements. If preorders do in fact open on July 31, we should find out soon.</p><p>To date, Nintendo is the only major company to offer a new game for $80; it did so when it launched Mario Kart World earlier this year. However, players can get the game at a perceived discount through a $500 Switch 2 bundle. Microsoft was set to follow suit with $80 games later this year, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">the company backtracked and canceled those plans. </a></p><p>According to one analyst, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">consumers are ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, adding that every publisher in video games that believes it can raise prices will do so over time. As mentioned, that hasn't happened yet beyond Mario Kart World, but the average selling price of new games could be above $70 when things like deluxe editions are factored in. Beyond that, games make money through microtransactions, and it's expected that Battlefield 6 will have them, too.</p><p>Not every publisher is raising prices, though, as 2K Games will launch Mafia: The Old Country in August for $50. Parent company Take-Two said this decision was made to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">help the game reach as wide an audience as possible</a>, while publisher 2K said the price point reflects how the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">not open world and doesn't require a huge time investment</a>. "We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments," 2K said.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sandfall Interactive has released a new update for its widely-praised turn-based RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, adding among other changes a Battle Retry prompt.</p>
<p>This has been one of the "most requested" quality of life improvements, the developer said. This new feature does exactly what it says on the tin - if faced with a defeat, players will now notice that a pop-up window appears in the game, which will allow them to give things another go.</p>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>'s retry mechanic, which was a popular inclusion to Atlus' fantasy RPG when it was released last year. This mechanic allowed players to restart a battle without any consequences if things weren't exactly going the way they had hoped they would. If only real life came with a button like that…</p>
<p>But, I digress. Other tweaks within Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's latest update include the Pictos menu now clearly displaying the Lumina cost of each ability, which the team said will allow for "better planning".</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive has also added separate volume sliders, which means players can now independently adjust the volume for exploration and combat phases.</p>
<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 below:</p>
<p><strong>Performance and Visuals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS &amp; XeSS Enhancements: Added Frame Generation and Low Latency Mode support for both DLSS and XeSS (compatible GPUs only). Enjoy smoother gameplay and lower input lag!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality of Life Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Battle Retry Prompt: A new pop-up window appears after defeat, giving you the option to quickly retry the battle.</li>
<li>Lumina Cost Display: The Pictos menu now clearly displays the Lumina cost of each ability for better planning.</li>
<li>Autoplay Dialogue: Added an optional autoplay feature for dialogues outside cutscenes. You can toggle it in the settings and during dialogues.</li>
<li>Separate Volume Sliders: Audio settings now lets you independently adjust the volume for exploration and combat phases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added icons to Lune’s Stains to improve readability and accessibility for colorblind players.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the Rocher holding a crystal occasionally despawning after reentering the Stone Wave Cliffs</li>
<li>Fixed some players being teleported behind the Monolith upon loading a save</li>
<li>Fixed Gameplay modifiers being applied to a New Game save when enabled on other saves</li>
<li>Fixed landing as Esquie without the party spawning, leading to input loss</li>
<li>Fixed the Fog on Flying Manor covering the screen and blocking the view on Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Achievements </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed journals vanishing after loading a Save File that was created at the exact moment of picking up that journal</li>
</ul>
<p>The following two trophies should now pop for you when you load your save if you were affected by these bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed "Expeditioner" and "Trailbreaker" achievements not unlocking if the characters reach a level higher than 33 or 66 after a battle</li>
<li>Fixed 'Connoisseur' and 'Follow The Trail' achievements not unlocking after collecting all required items on some savefiles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environmental Polish</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Various environmental bugfixes, tweaks and visual polish across multiple levels for a more immersive experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing, the team promised "more to come in the future", thanking the community for its continued support of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released back in April, and in May the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur may be a painting with a limited colour palette, but the result is a bold and striking vision," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's four star Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-patch-130-adds-fan-favourite-retry-button-as-used-in-metaphor-refantazio-to-make-redoing-boss-fights-a-breeze]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A bit update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is here, with version 1.2.0 of the hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> kart racer making a few positive changes for the game’s balance and progression.</p>
<p>Key features include that the 150cc AI has been made a smidgeon less aggressive, with a common complaint being about how difficult it is to achieve a three star rating in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour races. There’s also a change for online multiplayer course selection, where traditional three-lap races will appear more frequently for players to choose – Nintendo previously reduced their prevalence because everyone was constantly choosing these over the point-to-point races that have become the open world racer’s bread and butter.</p>


<p>For completionists, there’s further good news as the Free Roam map will now indicate that you’ve gathered all of the P switches, ? panels and Peach Medallions by changing the colour of the number.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there’s a little bit of balancing here, a few bug fixes there, as Nintendo continue to finetune the game that millions are now playing.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Mario Kart World Version 1.2.0:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player”, added “No COM” to the COM rules.</li>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player” and “Multiplayer”, added “Mushrooms only” to the item rules.</li>
<li>You can now choose “View Replay” after downloading ghost data in “Time Trials”.</li>
<li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in “Knockout Tour” and “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>When using CameraPlay in “Multiplayer” and “Online Play”, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.
<ul>
<li>If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the “Free Roam” map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.</li>
<li>Made COM weaker in everything other than “Battle”.</li>
<li>Made homing of Boomerang weaker.</li>
<li>Decreased the probability of getting a Triple Dash Mushroom in the low position, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Changed it so order of getting ? Block is higher than in the past, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Made it so there is a wheel spinning animation if the player presses the A button (acceleration) too early when starting a race while driving.
<ul>
<li>Player will not lose speed even when spinning wheels.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where in “Online Play”, the player would not dash even when getting on a Dash Panel.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the points in a team race in “Wireless Play” would display incorrectly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable on the menu screen after the player was retired in “Balloon Battle” in “Wireless Play”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a Peach Medallion would sometimes disappear when doing Rewind in “Free Roam”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when the player pointed the cursor at their own character or course and pressed A on the “Free Roam” map.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when the player quit a mission in “Free Roam” right before entering a pipe.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where the player would get caught on the back of a leaf when using a Bullet Bill in “Acorn Heights”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would not be able to slip through a vase that is placed on the road in “Shy Guy Bazaar”, when using a Boo.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would slip through the ceiling in “Dry Bones Burnout”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would sometimes hit a fence when throwing a red shell on the first turn in “Moo Moo Meadows”.</li>

<figure><a title="Yomawari" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4627021c6556/yomawari.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're all on tenterhooks awaiting news of a Nintendo Direct that may never arrive, and publisher NIS has only upped the speculation after it accidentally lifted the lid on a new Switch 2 game before swiftly deleting the announcement post.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1md0f07/nis_announced_a_new_2026_game_for_ns2nswps5pc/">Reddit</a> forum by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Joseki100/">Joseki100</a>, the Japanese NIS Twitter account was briefly home to the reveal of a new farming game in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yomawari_the_long_night_collection">Yomawari</a> series, accompanied by a 30th July 2026 release date. The post was swiftly removed, but not before more than a handful of people had nabbed a screenshot (you'll find it below, shared to BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/knoebel.bsky.social">Knoebel</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Running the reveal through Google Translate, this one appears to be called '<strong>The Garden of Honolulu</strong>', and seemingly boasts the same chibi art style as we'd expect from a Yomawari game. Naturally, we won't know anything for sure until the game is revealed properly (as in, for more than a few minutes), but hey, at least the key art looks cute.</p>

<p>Now, as many have pointed out on Reddit, the game does <em>feel</em> like a Direct announcement, one that was potentially scheduled too early and accidentally let slip before anything was made official. There have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumblings of a July presentation</a> for a good few weeks now, and there are only two days left to fit in that window, so don your tinfoil hat as you will.</p>
<p>Whether it ends up being a sign of an upcoming Direct or not, it looks like we'll have another cute farming sim on our hands next summer. You can never have too many of those, right?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/">Devil May Cry 5</a> was CAPCOM's best-selling game for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, boosted by the Netflix anime show's launch in April.</p>



<p>In its report for Q1 FY2026, the Japanese publisher confirmed that the fifth entry in the series sold 1,782,000 units in April-June 2025, the only game by the publisher to achieve more than 1 million sales in the quarter. Street Fighter 6 is also reported to have been doing well, and thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 release, the latest entry in the legendary fighting game series has now surpassed five million units.</p>



<p>Looking at the report's Unit Sales ranking, it's impossible not to notice how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> hasn't performed all that well. The game only sold 477,000 units in the first quarter of the fiscal year, a sheer drop from the high sales reported in its launch window and barely surpassing Monster Hunter Rise. Hopefully, the development team will be able to turn things around and address the issues that have been putting off many players.</p>



<p>Besides confirming Devil May Cry 5's solid performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, CAPCOM has also reported significant growth, with net sales increasing by 53.7% year-on-year to ¥45,502 million, operating profit increasing by 90.8% to ¥24,597 million, and profit attributable to owners of the parent increasing by 72.8% to ¥17,238 million. Impressive results, considering the publisher hasn't released any major titles in the quarter.</p>



<p>As a longtime fan of the series, I am happy to learn that Devil May Cry 5 is doing great on the market so many years after its release., showing CAPCOM how there's still a strong interest in Dante, Vergil and Nero's story. Hopefully, it won't take long to see another entry in the series, although longtime series director Hideaki Itsuno leaving CAPCOM<a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/"> last year </a>likely impacted whatever the publisher is planning for the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has pulled a new immersive&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em> card depicting Generation II Pokemon Ho-Oh, citing a "production issue" and pledging to conduct a "broader investigation" into the ways in which it commissions artwork.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>website, the company says that the card in question has been "replaced with a temporary placeholder", as has its Lugia counterpart (although the issue doesn't appear to apply to the Lugia card as well).</p>

<p>Just in case you're in the dark on this one, Redditor SPARKisnumber1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1mc1y2b/leaked_hooh_immersive_art_seemingly_plagiarized/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted a Reddit thread</a> yesterday alleging that artwork for an immersive Ho-Oh card for the latest&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">Wisdom of Sea and Sky</a>&nbsp;</em>was plagiarized from a 2021 fanart piece.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=JwCokNKF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=eWp07F3p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has pulled a Ho-Oh card over a "production issue" (although not the one shown here; that's just for illustrative purposes).</figcaption></figure><p>According to The Pokemon Company, the artist who drew the card in question, Sie Nanahara, was given "incorrect materials as official documents", so it sounds as though the company gave her the aforementioned fanart and essentially told her to copy or trace it.</p>

<p>However, without further official details, all we can do on that front is speculate. What we do know is that the Ho-Oh card is no longer in the game (although The Pokemon Company stops short of admitting plagiarism, of course), and it will be replaced with new art "as soon as it's ready".</p>

<p>Additionally, the company says it will conduct "a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game", so if there is any other plagiarised art based on fan work in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it'll likely be found and replaced soon.</p>

<p>Let's hope that's not the case, though. I'm sure The Pokemon Company doesn't want to end up in a similar situation to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Destiny 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">Marathon</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie when it comes to plagiarized art.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see how this situation develops, but in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>expansion is out now on both Android and iOS.</p>

                <p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has released a statement condemning the recent crackdown on games featuring adult themes on PC storefronts, calling for "greater transparency and fairness" in the moderation of adult games. The statement comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">Itch.io caved</a> to pressure from payment processors--themselves targeted by anti-porn lobby group Collective Shout--and abruptly delisted or deindexed a number of games with adult themes.</p><p>While IGDA stresses that it is not defending the circulation of harmful material--which many of the delisted games would certainly qualify as--it says that the current enforcement of these policies is vague and lacks transparency, leading to "delisting and deplatforming legal, consensual, and ethically developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators."</p><p>"Developers report games being delisted or hidden despite prior approval or longstanding presence on these platforms," the statement says. "The lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and an absence of appeal pathways leave creators with no clear path to compliance or recourse."</p><p>"Further reports suggest that recent policy changes are driven in large part by pressure from payment processors like Visa, Mastercard, and others, who may threaten to withhold payment processing services from platforms hosting adult content," IDGA continues. "As a result, financial institutions are now influencing which stories can be told and sold in games, with minimal transparency or public accountability."</p><p>IDGA is calling for clearer guidelines from both platforms and payment processors to "distinguish prohibited content from lawful adult expression," saying it's important that games as an artistic medium can tell stories about "intimacy, pleasure, trauma, or identity."</p><p>IGDA is also calling on platforms to provide clearer communication and specific reasons to affected devs, including "structured appeals and revision pathways" when a game is found to be potentially in breach. It also recommends the formation of advisory panels made up of experts and marginalized creators, as well as regular transparency reports on what enforcement actions have been taken.</p><p>"This issue is not just about adult content. It is about developer rights, artistic freedom, and the sustainability of diverse creative work in games," the statement concludes. IGDA's statement calls on platforms, payment processors, and games industry leaders to come together in meaningful conversation on the issue.</p><p>The organization also provides contact details for Visa and Mastercard, urging people to get in touch with the major payment processors to make their concerns around financial censorship heard--and gamers have been doing just that. Gaming communities across social media have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">organized campaigns</a> to put pressure on the two payment processors, flooding both companies with calls and emails registering their concern about censorship on gaming platforms.</p>

                <p>A big new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> is here, bringing with it several smaller but likely welcome tweaks, alongside a change sought after by many. In the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> for version 1.2.0 of the game, which is available to download now, Nintendo noted that it has "increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in 'VS Race' and wireless races." This has been a point of frustration for players, as many prefer to do a standard three-lap race as opposed to the new game's intermission races.</p><p dir="ltr">An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-mario-kart-world-patch-is-driving-players-up-a-wall-in-a-bad-way/1100-6532749/">update last month</a> even made it harder to do three-lap races, so this tweak to make them more common again will probably go down well (as long as the likelihood of getting three-lap races has received a significant boost, anyway). In terms of other notable changes, while playing in free roam, when you manage to get all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the "colors of the various numbers will now change." NPCs are also weaker in every mode apart from Battle, and those of you who rely on Triple Dash Mushrooms in a low position will be disappointed to know that the chance of getting that item has been decreased.</p>
