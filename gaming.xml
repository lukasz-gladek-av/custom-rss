            <p>
Activision and Microsoft have reportedly approved the creation of a new "smaller" team within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> - mostly comprised of employees from Activision's mobile-focused King division - to develop new "AA" games based on existing Blizzard properties.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip">Windows Central's Jez Corden</a>, whose sources say the new initiative reflects an eagerness at Microsoft to "explore and experiment" with smaller teams within the larger organisation, in response to the "monstrously ballooning costs" of AAA game development.
</p>
<p>
Corden notes Microsoft has seen success with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a> and Grounded, both built by comparatively small teams - and, of course, 2023's Hi-Fi Rush, created by a small team within Tango Gameworks, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-insists-hi-fi-rush-a-break-out-hit-for-xbox-amid-claims-it-underperformed">heralded as a "break out hit" by Microsoft</a> after its release.

<p>
And if you're wondering why Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">closed Tango Gameworks in May</a> if the studio had already demonstrated success using a development approach it was looking to adopt further, Corden claims Microsoft <em>did</em> see Tango as fitting into its new strategy - but its geographical location made "inter-studio collaboration logistically difficult".
</p>
<p>
Back to Blizzard's new team, Corden says it's "geared up for agility, eschewing some of the bureaucratic bloat" of larger teams. But as to what it'll be working on <em>specifically</em>, that remains unclear. The goal, though, is reportedly to create smaller-scale, lower budget titles built around Blizzard's existing franchises - which could potentially mean anything from current hits like Overwatch to long-dormant series such as StarCraft.
</p>
<p>
Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-empires-25-anniversary-console-launch-xbox/">told Wired</a> back in 2022, roughly a year before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision was approved</a>, that he was "excited to sit down with the teams at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> and King to talk about back catalogue and opportunities we might have there."
</p>
<p>
All of which just leaves the question of <em>platforms</em> Blizzard's reported new studio might be targeting, given it's being populated by King developers who've historically created games for mobile. Corden notes a mobile focus would make sense for the new team, given Microsoft is currently looking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-actively-working-with-partners-on-mobile-store-phil-spencer-says">launch an Xbox gaming store for iOS and Android</a> following new EU laws demanding Google and Apple open their platforms up to competitors. But with Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">exploring a multi-platform strategy for its releases</a>, anything is possible.
</p>
<p>
Today's report follows the news Microsoft's gaming revenue grew 44 percent in its last quarter, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-sales-decline-continues">declining Xbox console sales</a>, in large part thanks to its $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. Without Activision Blizzard on its books, that growth would be just three percent.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's is also starting to leverage its acquisition on Game Pass. Diablo 4 became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-will-make-a-hellish-addition-to-xbox-game-pass-this-march">first Activision Blizzard game</a> to arrive on the streaming service back in March, while Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">launched for members this July</a>. Additionally, Black Ops 6 comes to Game Pass on 24th October, but only for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers, following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">recently announced service overhaul</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-game-hardware-content-and-accessories-spending-falls-by-5-in-june-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For June 2024, video game hardware, content, and accessories spending was <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366670282248225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down by 5% compared to June 2023</a>. Despite this, it still brought in a hefty $4.6 billion. Despite this, the first half of the fiscal year saw a small 1% increase in spending compared to 2023, which saw the overall income reach $27.3 billion.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/">content spending</a> dropped by 2%, bringing in a profit of $4.1 billion. Surprisingly, mobile gaming content spending grew by 12%, combined with a 4% increase in non-mobile subscription content spending, such as Xbox Game Pass. Despite the increases in these categories, a 26% drop in console content spending offset it.</p>
<p>Some of the top-selling games for June 2024 include Elden Ring, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Hogwarts Legacy, and, most surprisingly, Kingdom Hearts: Integrum Masterpiece. The surprise comes from the huge change in rank positions. Last month, it was at 399, and now it's soared to the top and sits at number three on the ranking. However, this huge change in sales most likely comes from the fact that the games were all recently available on Steam, which fans of the franchise have been waiting for. Previously, it was only available on the Nintendo Switch via Cloud saves.</p>
<p>Looking at the most played games for PlayStation, many of them are free-to-play games. Roblox, Multiversus, and Fortnite are among the top three. However, games like Elden Ring and Grand Theft Auto V also made their way into the top ten games played in June 2024.</p>
<p>In terms of mobile gaming, Roblox remains one of the top games, with a 15% increase in revenue month over month. This increase was predominantly driven by a UA campaign, which increased downloads by 22%.</p>
<p>June's video game hardware spending fell by a further 37%. During the first half of the year, the Nintendo Switch suffered the most, with a decline of 48%, followed by the PlayStation 5, which declined by 28%, and the Xbox series, which fell by 18%.</p>
<p>Despite the heavy decline for the PlayStation 5, the console was the most sold console out of the three, leading the month's hardware market in unit and dollar sales. Followed by the PlayStation 5, the Nintendo Switch ranked 2nd in terms of unit sales, with the Xbox Series coming 2nd in dollars.</p>
<p>Overall, June 2024's spending was a little bit rockier than June 2023's, but there still remains an element of positivity for the month. Shadow of the Erdtree helped bolster Elden Ring, and Roblox has gained a huge resurgence in audiences of all ages, which may continue to help the mobile market sales increase.</p>

<p>Naming a game must be incredibly hard. How many more <em>Dark Fallen Journeys </em>and&nbsp;<em>Noun: Verb of the Noun</em> games can fit into the market? And yet certain games just appear with a near-perfect, properly descriptive label.</p>
<p><em>Metropolis 1998</em> is just such a game, telling you what you'll be doing, how it will look and feel, and what era it harkens back to. You can verify this with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287430/Metropolis_1998/">its "pre-alpha" demo on Steam</a> and <a href="https://yesbox.itch.io/archapolis">Itch.io</a>. There's plenty more to come, but what is already in place is impressive. And it's simply pleasant to play, especially if you're the type who wants to make something entirely yours. Not just "put the park inside the commercial district," but <em>The Sims-</em>style "choose which wood color for the dining room table in a living room you framed up yourself."</p>
<p>You start out in a big field with no features (yet) and the sounds of birds chirping. Once you lay down a road, you can add things at a few different levels. You can, <em>SimCity</em>-style, simply plot out colored zones and let the people figure it out themselves. You can add pre-made buildings individually. Or you can really get in there, spacing out individual rooms, choosing the doors and windows and objects inside, and realizing how hard it is to shape multi-floor houses so the roof doesn't look grotesque. You can save the filled-out house for later reuse or just hold on to its core aspects as a blueprint.</p>

                    It takes a bit to get used to it, but the detailed building designer is full of wonderful little pieces, like this classic speaker cabinet with the black and red wire clips visible on the back.                  </p>

<p>The game is still early in development, so its mechanics are not introduced in tutorials, and the interface requires a lot of clicking, reading, and wondering. I got a reasonable feel for it after about 30 minutes of tentative placing and bulldoze-deletion. You can save your game and come back to it, though the developers note that your saves may not transfer to future versions. You're putting your time in now, so you'll be ready to start fresh when the game releases into early access ("ETA sometime between Q4 2024 and Q2 2025"). If you're into this kind of fine-toothed builder, a fresh start is a gift, anyway.</p>

<h2>Bank robberies and zombie scenarios ahead (maybe)</h2>
<p>What will the game look like when it's finished? Developer YesBox has <a href="https://yesboxstudios.com/roadmap/">a detailed roadmap</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://yesboxstudios.com/blog/">a blog</a>&nbsp;detailing how it's going. The very small team, seemingly a solo developer with art help from two others, <a href="https://yesboxstudios.com/blog/2022-06-13-november-december-2021.html">started off in December 2021</a>&nbsp;and has achieved quite a lot, including an algorithm seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0l87hwmkI">ready to handle big populations</a>. A key promise of the game is that you won't just lay down zones and wait for people and problems to show up. You will lay down specific buildings, like hospitals and police stations, and manage the usual concerns of traffic, zone demand, and the like. The "Post-1.0 Aspirations" hint at the game's direction: "Visible Crime (e.g., watch a bank robbery)," "Zombie Mode (your police vs. your zombie population)," and "Live in your own city" in a "<em>Sims</em>-like mode" imply more of a toybox mentality than a "Highly realistic ports and infrastructure" ambition.</p>

<p><em>Metropolis 1998</em> is not alone in seeking out city-builder fans living in the long wake of any proper&nbsp;<em>SimCity</em> release. But unlike games like&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, it's not seeking the kind of mechanical complexity that would see it, say, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/the-rent-is-too-dang-high-in-cities-skylines-2-so-the-devs-nuked-the-landlords/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1">figuring out eerily familiar housing cost crises.</a> Building this kind of game is still fiendishly complex, of course. But how that complexity is presented to the player is something else.</p>
<p>The most interesting line in the roadmap<span>&nbsp;is "player starts with land purchased from successful business exit." I can't help but think of&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/stardew-valley-review-a-pastoral-contemporary-escape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a>, which can also sprawl to ridiculous levels</span>&nbsp;but has at its core the arc of a person who got tired of the rat race and inherited a farm. I'm looking forward to this invitingly retro and human-scale city-builder, with patience and respect for what seems like a massive developer undertaking.</p>

The union and game companies such as Activision, EA, Take-Two, and WB Games <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit an impasse over AI protections for performers</a>, part of negotiations that have gone on for 18 months. Zeke Alton, a member of SAG-AFTRA and an interactive negotiator who has lent his likeness to games such as <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, says that it has been a long and difficult road. He feels that public support, and support from within the entertainment industry, has been critical in the steps that SAG-AFTRA has made. It just isn’t there yet in terms of a deal.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re looking for protection against the use of generative AI to create synthetic performances to replace us,” Alton told Aftermath, elaborating that this is not an issue unique to video games and pointing to the <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/ai-nurse-chatbots-nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nursing industry</a> as an example. But Alton feels that performers are the canary in the coal mine: “If we can’t get protection, then it sets a precedent where no one can get protection.”</p><p>But Alton remains hopeful. He feels as though unionization at studios like <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a> and within pockets of <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has been a wakeup call. “It’s gotten to a point where people are realizing they can’t just be beaten around by the C-Suite anymore. They’re starting to realize that the ability to maintain a living wage in this country comes from standing together and withholding your work. Not only do developers understand that what we’re asking for is extremely reasonable, but even AI companies themselves agree.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Kazuma Hashimoto</figcaption></figure><p>He spoke positively about SAG-AFTRA’s previous deal with AI firm <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-replica-studios-introduce-groundbreaking-ai-voice-agreement-ces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Replica Studios</a>, which was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/01/10/video-game-voice-actors-criticize-sag-aftra-over-agreement-with-ai-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive</a> among union performers. “They [Replica] gave us consent, control, and compensation for both digital replicas and generative AI for synthetic performers. So it seems unreasonable that a few companies in the room are trying to gather all the rights to have the opportunity, should the tech allow, to completely replace us.”</p><p>Torian Brackett, a voice actor in Los Angeles, shares a somewhat similar sentiment regarding the deal between SAG-AFTRA and Replica, stating that it seemed to be a good template that would allow voice actors to operate on their own terms. But he feels as though corporations see AI as a “shiny new toy” that they want to use at the expense of their performers. While he doesn’t see generative AI going away any time soon, Brackett believes consumers have a fair amount of power, and that the power of the dollar simply cannot be ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's really the consumers that will decide whether, you know, if they'll accept this, and it's going to keep happening,” Brackett said. “But I'm very heartened by what I see in the gaming community. I'm a gamer as well, and people seem, across the board, not interested in hearing AI voices. [Performers] are the people that bring us to tears and elevate the experience we have when we pick up that controller or sit at our keyboard. And they [players] see the value in it. So I hope our bargaining partners will see that same value when it comes to voice acting, when it comes to emotion, when it comes to the entire industry of performance that ties into gaming.”&nbsp;</p><p>More than anything, Brackett hopes negotiations end soon and that some kind of agreement will be made and the contract signed. In 2023, film and television actors covered by SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-06-29/what-to-know-sag-aftra-strike-actors-hollywood#:~:text=SAG%2DAFTRA's%20strike%20against%20major%20media%20companies%20stretched%20118%20days." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went on strike for nearly four months</a>, shortly after members of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-01/writers-strike-what-to-know-wga-guild-hollywood-productions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writers Guild of America began a nearly five month strike</a> of their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Ray Rodriguez, Chief Contracts Officer for SAG-AFTRA, shared that this contract wouldn’t just cover voice actors, but extend further to include performers across the industry. “The strike came to be because we have not been able yet to reach agreement on the protective terms that we need for the use of artificial intelligence involving our members and their performances in video games. So we've been bargaining for 18 months — this contract actually expired in November of 2022, and we started negotiating a month before the expiration of the contract.”</p><figure><figcaption>Kazuma Hashimoto</figcaption></figure><p>Rodriquez shared that a significant number of video game producers are signatories,&nbsp;but this does not make them staunchly pro-union. “I'm not sure that even all of the people who are assigned to our contract would necessarily describe themselves as pro union. I think they gladly or grudgingly acknowledge the importance of union performers, because they need them to work on their games. And that's their incentive, not necessarily to make a social statement in favor of labor, although we'd love that,” he said.</p><p>This hasn’t deterred SAG-AFTRA in their desire to expand their footprint and eventually cover all performers in the video game space. Rodriguez said that this fight is for the entire community, and more broadly, everyone, which seems to be a common sentiment across the board.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't think anybody wants other people to have the right to take your voice and your image and digitally replicate you without your consent and not pay you, and use you in ways that generate profit for multibillion dollar corporations,&nbsp; that's just not a circumstance that I think is tolerable to anyone,” he said. “And I think people really need to see that they have an interest in the outcome of this fight and all the fights that we have had on AI and that we're going to need to have on AI in order to make sure that basic rights like that stay protected.”&nbsp;</p><p>This includes the protection of performance capture artists, whose inclusion in AI provisions is at the heart of the strike. As Rodriguez <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously told Aftermath</a>, the companies currently want AI protections to extend to performers only if their likeness is recognizable–but, as Rodriquez said to Aftermath in July, “you could be doing the stunts that form the movement for Spider-Man, but what the player is going to see is Spider-Man. So that requirement of identifiability really leaves movement performers out of the scope of coverage."</p><p>Jasiri Booker, a performance capture artist who has worked on Insomniac’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and several other projects currently under NDA, said that performance capture artists are represented by SAG’s Interactive Media Agreement, but companies have been using a gray area to hire performance capture artists as non-union. “Because what we do gets animated, it’s not viewed as a true performance,” he said. “As far as the strike and what’s on the negotiating table for us, it’s protection against AI. The ability to be informed and to give our consent if a company does want to train an AI program off of our library of moves, that’s kind of the main big topic for us.”</p><figure><figcaption>Kazuma Hashimoto</figcaption></figure><p>Seth Allyn Austin, a performance capture artist who has also worked on numerous titles under Insomniac, such as <em>Spider-Man</em>, and several others under NDA, jumped in to share that a lot of this ended up coming to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. “It doesn’t take a whole army of performers like it does for TV or film to create a project; we could go in essentially one at a time and work, but then learn that we still don’t qualify for health insurance because we’re under a non-union contract. And that’s when stuff got real.”&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about who he felt was causing negotiations to lag, Austin said that it would be difficult to pinpoint any individual studio. “Video games are an interesting space where you have developers and publishers making games. But the bargaining group of those individual studios can’t come to an agreement to cover us. They won’t come together collectively to give us the protection we want.”</p><p>Booker clarified that this strike is not a fight between those looking to unionize and those involved in the hands-on process of making games.“This is not against animators, this is not against designers, this is not against directors. There is this weird invisible ‘they’ that always exists, these kinds of people that have jumped into the video game market during COVID-19 and are now looking for a return on their investment. They’re trying to milk this industry and the performers out there for everything they’re worth and that means, for them, cutting as many people out as possible.”</p><p>Austin said that even the more “bread and butter” jobs, such as locomotion, are just as important as more evocative motion capture, and he fears that if those opportunities are taken away, the barrier of entry into performance capture could increase significantly. “When I worked on <em>Spider-Man,</em> I was brought in to flip. But then they [Insomniac] learned that I could act, and my career and my usefulness in that space grew because they gave me that opportunity. And if those simple jobs are taken away, there is going to be an entire generation of performers that won’t have the same opportunities we had.”</p><p>Booker and Austin don’t believe that AI could replicate the performances given by actors, or at least not yet. That was something both actors stressed, with Booker believing that those pushing the narrative about this technology and its integration in games don’t understand that it doesn’t, or won’t, work in the way that they believe it does.&nbsp; “AI is a tool and it could be helpful,” Austin said. “But any tool used inappropriately becomes a weapon.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis group Circana has released its US sales data for the gaming industry in June 2024, and given the release of a certain high-profile DLC expansion, the month's best-selling game probably won't come as a surprise.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366822606786676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">always-dependable Mat Piscatella on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the best-selling game for June was&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, almost certainly driven by the release of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">on the 21st of that month</a>. Given that&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>had sold five million copies at last count (which was less than a week after the DLC's release), it's fair to say the expansion has been an unqualified success.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what's trailing behind&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>on the all-format sales chart, <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i>&nbsp;is in second place, and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>, a collection of many of the games in that venerable franchise that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam">launched on Steam in June</a>, is in third.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it looks like the strong sales performance of that collection is based entirely on its Steam release. Hey, publishers! Release your games on Steam!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-integrum-masterpiece-circana-us-sales-data-june-2024.jpg?itok=MojB0A26 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-integrum-masterpiece-circana-us-sales-data-june-2024.jpg?itok=q8tglr_M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece&nbsp;</em>was released on Steam in June, and it looks like it's done pretty well sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>On a year-to-date basis, the best-selling premium game as of June 2024 is still&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>taking the second and third spots.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was June's most-played game on both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, although on PC, the title goes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. Admittedly, that's probably because Circana is using Steam as the basis for its data, and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Steam.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>was also the best-selling premium game on both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S for June, while&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>was the month's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-financials-q1-2025">best-selling game on Switch</a>. Again, though,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>isn't available for Nintendo's platform, although it's pretty amusing to imagine what an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>Switch port might look like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-luigis-mansion-2-hd.jpg?itok=cdNeWhax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-luigis-mansion-2-hd.jpg?itok=pXv28L2A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>has done pretty well for Nintendo in June.</figcaption></figure><p>In hardware terms, the PS5 led June's sales figures for both unit and dollar sales. The Switch trailed behind in second place in unit sales, while the two Xbox Series models combined took second place for dollar sales.</p>
<p>As always, it's well worth reading Piscatella's <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366670282248225" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full thread</a> if you want some more nerdy stats about gaming industry sales. July's figures will inevitably be released in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for those as and when we get them.</p>

After a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173544/valorant-ps5-xbox-release-date-riot">brief beta period in June</a>, the console version of <em>Valorant </em>will be available in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Brazil and features all the same gameplay, heroes, and abilities as the PC version.</p><p><em>Valorant </em>on console won’t have crossplay support because Riot Games wants to maintain “competitive integrity.” That means PC players won’t be getting controller support, either. The game will support cross-progression, so any skins and progression will carry over between PC and console. Both PC and console players will also receive simultaneous platform releases, including balance patches, new agents, map updates, premium content, and more.</p><div><figcaption>Valorant<em> Xbox gameplay.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Riot Games</cite></p></div><p>Riot Games has also made some tweaks to the console version of its 5v5 tactical shooter, largely to make it more controller-friendly for hip-fire gameplay. “Focus is a new shooting mode that behaves essentially like hip-fire, but with reduced sensitivity,” explains Arnar Gylfason, production director of <em>Valorant</em>. “This way, players can use hip-fire whenever they need speed in moving their camera / aim, but utilize focus mode whenever they need precision. This also approximates the shooting mechanic to what console players are used to in shooters, all of this without losing the added value <em>Valorant</em>’s aim down sights provides.”</p><p><em>Valorant </em>is now available to play for free on PC, Xbox Series S / X, and PS5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie have reportedly cancelled Payback, an unannounced project in the Destiny universe from former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> game director Luke Smith and project lead Mark Noseworthy. Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">brutal cost-cutting</a> this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">Gamespot</a>'s Tamoor Hussain, Giant Bomb's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y">Jeff Grubb</a> and Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737">Jason Schreier</a> (the source of the "a while ago" quote), as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">Eurogamer</a>. Payback's existence came to light in April, though Bungie have yet to formally comment on the subject. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny2Leaks/comments/1c0c0zg/dont_read_too_far_into_payback/">According to one self-alleged leaker</a>, the name is a reference to "Bungie getting payback against themselves by creating something they hope everyone will love". I don't quite follow this explanation, but the leaker in question did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny2Leaks/comments/1b17fzi/comment/ksg63he/?context=3">correctly predict</a> the introduction of Destiny 2's Prismatic character subclass, so they're more trustworthy than the average redditor with a bridge to sell.</p>
<p>Payback's cancellation seems to have paved the way for Smith and Noseworthy's departures. Gamespot sources claim that executive restructuring during this week's layoffs means the pair have "no path forward at Bungie". </p>
<p>The shockwaves from Bungie's headcount reduction continue to spread. As Nic wrote earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">insiders allege that the cuts have been in the works for a while</a>, regardless of the success or not of Destiny 2's excellent recent expansion The Final Shape. Many of The Final Shape's senior team are now gone, including <a href="https://x.com/Sphynxian/status/1818677295424717041">senior narrative designer Robert Brookes</a> and <a href="https://x.com/kperng/status/1818703463645430268">narrative lead Kwan Perng</a> - a miserable reward for yanking Destiny 2 out of the nose-dive instigated by the disastrous Lightfall expansion.</p>
<p>Aside from laying off staff, Bungie have also transferred 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment. Some of those roles will form a new PlayStation studio working on an untitled "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe". Those remaining at Bungie will double down on development of the Marathon reboot and future Destiny projects.</p>
<p>This week's layoffs were announced by Bungie CEO Pete Parsons, who confessed that Bungie leadership have been "over-ambitious" in their handling of the business. Parsons has been lying low on social media after it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">discovered</a> that he'd spent $2,414,550 on cars since September 2022, including a Porsche costing over $200,000 in the wake of a previous round of layoffs last October.</p>
<p>$2,414,550 is a tiny dent in the outgoings of a video game developer that even now has around 850 people on the books, but still - I wonder how many narrative designers you can hire for $2,414,550? Payback is certainly the word: laid-off Bungie <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818677930622685516">developers</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MyNameIsByf/status/1818671790538809555">Destiny players</a> continue to call on Parsons to do the decent thing and resign his position.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was therefore always important for him to build an inclusive studio whose team members reflected the game he wanted to make.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Specifically, the writer must be a woman, must be able to understand instinctively rather than me doing research and trying to vaguely understand,” he says. Indeed, almost all of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamartichoke.com/">Team Artichoke</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s members are women, including artist Beidi Guo, writer Lara Barbier, and content designer Albertine Watson. Although the team is made up of part-time roles, Yu being the sole full-time developer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (an arrangement admittedly down to what he’s able to afford to pay), they’re all equally credited as team members, as evidenced on the studio’s homepage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There’s this obsession with art having this magical intrinsic value outside of the people that create it, but for me, the goal is to bring the people together. There's so much joy in working with others and getting the best out of everyone but also watching stuff come together and seeing how ideas mix together constantly.”</span></p><p>Image via Team Artichoke.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One important perspective he had learned was shaping </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s arc, which was going to have a progression one might associate with other cozy community sims. “At the beginning it was like, Artemis is trying to impress the gods [until] she's finally good enough,” he explains. “But the more I spoke to [the team], the more it became, 'You will never be good enough'-that’s the whole point of gatekeeping.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making sure narrative aligned with the mechanics was also important. For instance, when art came back that depicted Penelope (queen of Ithaca and Odysseus’s wife) as a Black woman, having Artemis come down as this white immortal ordering a Black mortal around suddenly felt very wrong. “Artemis doesn't understand the troubles that the mortals are going through, she shouldn't have the solutions,” Yu explains. “It should be coming from the mortals themselves.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Subverting the usual expectations of other life sims where you go into a town and effectively become its mayor creating a place in your own image, Artemis is helping the community of Ithaca. But also rather than doing this as a white savior, the gameplay is designed so that the mortals are doing the work to solve their problems, while Artemis is more of a support in a collaborative effort.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Artichoke Studios values people and process">Artichoke Studios values people and process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a part-time team, that does mean a slower development process, with no set release date for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but Yu accepts and embraces this. “As long as we're making the game we want to make and it comes out okay in the end, I think that's the higher priority,” he explains. “I tell everyone on my team, this is the rate, this is what I can afford. If you can find work that pays better, always prioritize that. Even if it did harm the project, the people are more important than the project.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In getting the best out of everyone with what they can give to the project as fairly as possible, everyone is also paid a flat day rate, a practice Yu had learned from working with Die Gute Fabrik. “It’s great because it made it so you don't have a concept of juniors anymore,” he explains. “You never say, 'we'll just give juniors the junior tasks' - everyone just has tasks. Everyone asks questions to everyone else, everyone ramps up, you're never thinking, 'this person makes less so we expect less of them'. It was just such an incredible experience to be part of that, so I wanted to replicate that as much as I can.”</span></p><p>Image via Team Artichoke.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also a practice that means avoiding the alternative other studios might be tempted to take, lowballing staff or where they feel compelled to work for free. Yu even mentions a team member who, as a newcomer to the industry, had not been expecting to be paid the full rate advertised. “I'm like, of course I'm going to pay the full rate advertised - I hired you because you can do the work I need, and this is how much the work is worth to me.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to hiring people, it has also been important that job descriptions do not exclude people based on arbitrary parameters like number of years of experience or number of games shipped. “It's like, here's what we need you to do, and if you think you can do that, please apply,” he says, adding that this has also attracted people both new or outside of the industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“When you don't pay well, you naturally add bias and discrimination into your process for people, you can easily weed out certain massive demographics of people,” Yu concludes. “If you're trying to tell a story that's about gatekeeping and exclusion, you need those people on your team because they have these great stories to share about it.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Yu acknowledges his decisions may not be 100% satisfactory for everyone, and not all studios can afford to work slowly, at least not if its team members don’t have other projects to sustain themselves, the intention is there to make an environment where people can enjoy working in where they’re treated fairly, an issue he still thinks isn’t very common in the industry.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Riot Games' free-to-play hero shooter Valorant launches today for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-hero-shooter-valorant-is-running-an-open-console-beta-and-its-live-right-now">recent console open beta</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game will not offer crossplay between its existing PC version and consoles "to maintain Valorant's renowned standard for competitive integrity", Riot has said.
</p>
<p>
In a press release issued today, Riot did at least promise future game updates would release simultaneously, so all additional maps and characters will arrive at the same time.

<p>
Today's launch caps off a four-year journey for Valorant from PC to consoles, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-is-prototyping-valorant-on-consoles-but-only-if-its-certain-the-console-port-can-deliver-the-experience">previously saying it was not "entirely sure" the game translated to console play</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Riot Games delivers a masterclass in competitive integrity, soulless precision and zealous, life-consuming obsession," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-review-exacting-infuriating-sublime">Eurogamer's Valorant review</a>, published back in 2020. "By design Valorant is a severe, soulless and uncompromising experience. That's often to its detriment, but it's more often to its success."
</p>
<p>
Valorant has repeatedly hit the headlines as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-outlines-plans-to-start-monitoring-valorant-voice-chat-in-a-bid-to-combat-disruptive-behaviour">Riot grapples</a> with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-pledges-harsher-more-immediate-punishment-for-voice-and-chat-toxicity">toxic elements</a> of the game's community. In May this year, Valorant's studio head said toxic players should go "play something else, we won't miss you." Said Riot Games boss Anna Donlon: "If you want to make evil statements under the guise of s**t talk, you aren't welcome here."
</p>
<p>On a more positive note, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-changers-making-valorant-esports-inclusive-for-women">Riot's Game Changers programme for Valorant</a> has aimed to make its esports scene more inclusive for women.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Frontier Developments has shared a 15 minute deep dive into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> and the new water parks that are the new star attraction in this them park management sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet Coaster 2 | Deep Dive 1 - Coasters and Water Parks Combined" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/82gEWEdDn78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game Director Rich Newbold and Senior Executive Producer Adam Woods are on hand to give the demonstration, showing off a work-in-progress sandbox from a development build of the game.</p>
<p>They show off the geometric and custom shape pools you can make, the way that water flumes can be constructed – still balancing excitement, fear and nausea, just like the regular coasters – the new needs for things like changing rooms, wider concourses and more. Guests have also been redesigned to give more diversity of character models, broader animations to show how they’re feeling, and even the ability to get a nasty sunburn if you don’t supply sun screen for your guests!</p>
<p>Flat rides and coasters are obviously still very plentiful, and Frontier have made new rides and revamped previous ones. The humble teacups ride is now more plain to allow you to apply more customisations and themes, such as adding more of an underwater theme with scenery that can animate and move around with the ride. All rides will come with pre-defined, selectable patterns, too.</p>

<p>The next deep dive video will be exploring the new and the improved tools that players will get to use to create and manage these parks, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more on show in the deep dive, and we got a chance to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/planet-coaster-2-preview-slip-and-slide-into-the-wet-stuff/">preview</a> the game ahead of its big announcement last month. I said, “It’s been a hot minute since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> released back in 2016, and since the last expansion arrived in 2019. It’s high time to dive back in, and Planet Coaster 2 looks set to delight with its new options and deeper management.”</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 is coming out this autumn across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-blizzard-aa-team-might-give-microsoft-its-smaller-games-report-says.943200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-blizzard-aa-team-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new internal studio has reportedly been formed at Blizzard, with a view towards making smaller AA-level projects within the company's existing franchises and IP.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report by Windows Central</a>, Microsoft and Activision have created a "new smaller team within Blizzard comprised of King and various other employees", and that team will work on games in franchises like&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em>,&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>,&nbsp;<em>StarCraft</em>, and more.</p>
<p>Windows Central's report points to the fact that many employees of King.com, which is a Microsoft subsidiary thanks to its inclusion within the Activision Blizzard umbrella, have recently changed their LinkedIn profiles to reflect a move to Blizzard. According to Windows Central's "sources", those moves represent the creation of a new internal development outfit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-blizzard-aa-studio-charge.jpg?itok=wA_FTyiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-blizzard-aa-studio-charge.jpg?itok=Y2UbnCCo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New games based on Blizzard franchises like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>might be coming soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The report says that the new studio, which mainly comprises employees from King, is part of a desire on Microsoft's part to "curate and serve these franchises more prolifically than Activision itself did" prior to the tech giant's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">record-breaking acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>As Windows Central points out, King's involvement in the creation of this studio could indicate that the games being created are intended for mobile, but given that Microsoft appears to be adopting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-microsoft-financials-q4-2024">platform-agnostic approach</a>, we might also see them on PC and Xbox consoles as well, and perhaps even on other platforms in future.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Microsoft is keen to create games that avoid what Windows Central calls "the monstrously ballooning costs facing AAA game development", a subject about which Microsoft is reportedly anxious. Creating smaller studios that can collaborate with the larger organization is one way in which Microsoft is looking to alleviate these costs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starcraft-2-blizzard-aa-studio.jpg?itok=NfwmPErA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starcraft-2-blizzard-aa-studio.jpg?itok=imcUMDBX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>StarCraft&nbsp;</em>games could be on the way, although they may not be what you're used to.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping up with Microsoft news, then you might be wondering how the company's decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">close&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>studio Tango and&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>developer Arkane Austin</a> ties in with this new Blizzard studio's formation, and, indeed, with Microsoft's stated aim to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">develop more "smaller games"</a>.</p>
<p>Well, according to Windows Central's report, Tango was indeed the right kind of studio for the job, but its location in Japan made "inter-studio collaboration logistically difficult". Seems like a bit of an overreaction to close the studio down completely for that reason, but I'm not privy to Microsoft's internal conversations, I suppose.</p>
<p>Microsoft's decision to create smaller games, and its reported concern about the spiraling costs of AAA development, come amongst widespread layoffs and studio closures in the gaming industry, including staff being let go at companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft itself</a>, among many others.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of games this new Blizzard studio creates. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Once Human's maintenance is now complete, and the F2P open-world shooter is back online with a plethora of QoL improvements and optimisations, including a desperately-needed revision to vehicle handling.</p>
<p>Whilst players received a bundle of Stardust and health-related items to make up for the downtime, Once Human's long-promised controller and Steam Deck support is still nowhere to be seen (although, confusingly, the "controller" in-game item remains in place).</p>

<p>In terms of Memetics, you can now pick up memetic specialisation memory fragments in the wild and trade them between players. All memetic fragments will be destroyed at the end of the season – which is in a couple of weeks time – and cannot be sent to Eternaland, so be mindful of that.</p>
<p>The team has also "enriched" the Highway Pursuit game mode, added a new route, and fixed the starting time to 9pm local time on all servers. The map has also been revised to make it easier to see landmarks, as well as send invitations to other players via chat channels.</p>
<p>There's loads more – combat, planting, trading, wilderness, deviations, cosmetics, performance, camera; pretty much everything's had a tweak, it seems – so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/">head on over to Steam for the full details</a>.</p>
<p>Starry Studio has also provided a new storage crate to all players in compensation for "recent server stability" when unsuccessfully trying to implement cross-character paid content sharing.</p>
<p>The team also outlined what to expect from the new August Event.</p>
<p>"On Nalcott Island, the month of August itself is an anomalous event," the team teases. "During this 'forgotten summer', we will receive additional produce from harvesting every week. More events will be gradually unlocked in the game. All Metas are welcome to participate!"</p>
<p>In terms of controller support; despite a lot of players hoping support would come in this patch, the team says it's hoping to roll out functionality by "mid-August".</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460?emclan=103582791472471292&amp;emgid=4329732329530020404">players affected by the territory glitch</a> should find any resources they used to build their base returned to their backpacks.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it earlier this month for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back.</p>
<p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In recent weeks, King employees have swapped their LinkedIn information, saying they are now working in Blizzard. This comes in conjunction with <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-doesnt-agree-with-ftc-comments-regarding-price-hikes/">Microsoft</a> and Activision's new team, which has been created within Blizzard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This team</a> takes employees from King and other various Blizzard employees and is now a focused team dedicated to working on Blizzard's "AA" games, such as World of Warcraft, Overwatch, StarCraft, and more.</p>
<p>The expansion doesn't come as much of a surprise, as Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard last year for a hefty $72 billion. This gave Microsoft leverage over some of its major franchises, such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. With the acquisition, Microsoft has already seen a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2024-q4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge 61% growth year-on-year</a> in its gaming division, largely driven by Activision Blizzard's current games.</p>
<p>To continue boosting their growth, Microsoft and Activision have teamed up to create a new team within the Blizzard subsidiary. The aim is to continue curating and keeping their most beloved franchises alive, such as Diablo, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch. StarCraft has been dead in the water for some time, and it is possible that this new team will revive the beloved franchise and give it a new lease of life instead.</p>
<p>Since many of the employees joining the team are from the King subsidiary, it's very possible that they are working on mobile ports of these games or on making Diablo Immortal a better game for those who continue to play it. Alternatively, it's possible that they will be working on new mobile games that are set to be released in Xbox's mobile game store, which is planned for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Microsoft is keen to experiment with utilizing smaller teams that are more agile and have more potential when working on AA games. These teams will also be integrated into the larger teams, giving them access to bigger projects as and when they need it. There is plenty of potential for AA games at the moment, with games like Balatro, Palworld, Vampire Survivors, and Stardew Valley doing extremely well in current markets, regardless of age.</p>
<p>Despite their willingness to try and experiment with smaller teams, Microsoft is also responsible for closing down Tango Gameworks, the developers behind the well-loved title Hi-Fi Rush. The decision to make smaller studios and work on indie-style games may come as a shock considering the brash decision to close down Tango Gameworks, but we'll have to wait and see what's in store for the players with this new team.</p>

Everywhere you look, there’s another great narrative being spun from the Games, such as Simone Biles and the U.S gymnastics team’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/simone-biles-and-mykayla-skinner-instagram-drama-explained&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/simone-biles-and-mykayla-skinner-instagram-drama-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>very </em>funny beef</a></span> with a former team member who tried (and failed) to talk shit about them before they took gold. But perhaps no sport at this year’s Olympics has given us more new icons than shooting, with many of its competitors making up a murderers row of sharpshooters who look like the hardest motherfuckers alive.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196923,196922" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It began with Kim Ye-ji, a South Korean shooter who made waves for her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paris-olympics-2024-shooter-korea-cool-kim-yeji-1851609276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paris-olympics-2024-shooter-korea-cool-kim-yeji-1851609276">now-iconic demeanor, style, and incredible posture</a></span>. Since then, the Olympics has somehow kept producing shooters who all seem like they could be the main characters of some game or movie. Yusuf Dikeç, a shooter from Turkey, is the latest phenomenon to emerge from the Games, and let me tell you, I think <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/hitman&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/hitman"><em>Hitman</em></a></span>’s Agent 47 should be very scared of this man.<br></p><p>Similar to Ye-ji, Dikeç began going viral for his shooting stance. However, unlike the South Korean crackshot, Dikeç started making the rounds for his relaxed appearance and lack of any significant equipment. Ye-ji became a quick favorite for her stylized pose and steely-eyed look, but by comparison, Dikeç’s star is ascending because homeboy looks like he could barely be bothered to show up. Dude straight up doesn’t look like he gives a fuck, and yet he managed to take home silver in his category.</p><p>When asked about his lack of equipment, do you know what Dikeç said? “I did not need special equipment. I’m a natural, a natural shooter.” The aura coming off this guy is <em>unbelievable</em>, and just like Ye-ji, it’s inspired people around the world to now idolize him, turn him into a meme, produce fan art, and reinterpret him and his stance into their favorite video games and anime. </p><p>Ye-ji and Dikeç have emerged as the stars of the shooting category, but they aren’t the only competitors to have popped off online. Sarabjot Singh from India has also been turned into a bit of a meme, as well as Choe Daehan, another shooter from South Korea, whose very pronounced shooting style is probably best seen rather than described:</p><p>And then there’s this legend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/upcoming-star-wars-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A road map of all your next trips to a galaxy far, far away.</h2></div><div><section><p>With Disney and Lucas Arts giving the go-ahead for a range of developers to craft new stories in the Star Wars universe, there's never been a better time to be a fan of Star Wars video games. Whether it's Respawn's recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> or Zynga's free-to-play arena shooter, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-review">Star Wars: Hunters</a>, we're visiting a galaxy far, far away more frequently than ever before and getting some great games along the way.</p><p>Better yet, it seems this current pipeline of big new Star Wars releases won't be drying up anytime soon. Looking forward, there are still a bunch of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-games-in-order-canon-timeline">canon Star Wars games</a> on the way, ranging from remakes of iconic RPGs to sprawling, open-world adventures and interactive story experiences. To keep you clued in on all the intergalactic action yet to come, we've made a list of every major Star Wars game currently announced and in active development as of August 2024.</p><h2>Every Upcoming Star Wars Game</h2><p>As of right now, there are a total of <strong>six </strong>upcoming Star Wars games currently announced to be in development. The list below will run through each of these games, noting everything we know so far.</p><h3>Star Wars: Outlaws - August 30, 2024</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/07/25/star-wars-outlaws-world-1690314393129.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Starting with one right around the corner, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars: Outlaws</a> is slated to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC on August 30, 2024. Developed by Massive Entertainment, the studio behind The Division series, it'll tell the tale of Kay Vess: a wandering outlaw looking to assemble a team to pull off the heist of a lifetime as she attempts to rob the powerful head of one of the galaxy's most threatening crime syndicates.</p><p>Boasting a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-the-final-preview">massive open world to explore</a>, freeform combat encounters that can be completed stealthily or all-guns-blazing, and narrative choices that affect your reputation with factions, Outlaws appears to be a massive playable heist movie that throws you directly into some of the most wretched hives of scum and villainy in the galaxy.</p><div catalogid="e75dd931-1911-43db-b0fb-8e7c20d016dc" id="198974"><div id="198974" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><h3>Star Wars Eclipse - Early Development</h3><p>Announced back in 2021, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars Eclipse</a> looks to be Quantic Dream's twist on the Star Wars universe, with the Detroit Become Human developer promising a narrative-focused adventure that reacts to your decisions.</p><p>Although details are currently pretty slim, we do know that <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/how-star-wars-eclipse-links-the-high-republic-to-prequel-trilogy-jedi-fallen-order">it'll take place in the High Republic Era</a>, meaning it will be set around the same time as the recent Disney Plus show, Star Wars: The Acolyte. Quantic Dream also revealed that, despite their previous games focusing largely on dialogue and storytelling, Eclipse will definitively be an action-adventure and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-eclipse-fundamentals-quantic-dream-action-adventure">the team has made changes to accompany the heavier focus on action sequences</a>. </p><p>Although we don't know exactly what that means for the game just yet, we could be looking at the studio moving away from its heavy use of quick-time events and embracing a new approach to combat and chase sequences. Regardless, it's safe to assume Eclipse's core focus will be telling a branching narrative that evolves and adapts to your choices, so be prepared to make tough decisions and live with the consequences.</p><h3>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake - In Development</h3><p>The return of a bonafide classic, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a> was first revealed back in 2021 as a PlayStation 5 and PC exclusive. Developed by Saber Interactive, it aims to be a full, from-the-ground-up reimagining of BioWare's seminal 2003 Star Wars RPG of the same name.</p><p>The original Knights of the Old Republic dropped players into the Old Republic era, casting them as an amnesiac soldier who wakes up on a crashing Republic ship. Escaping the craft before it's destroyed, the protagonist sets out on a quest to uncover their murky past and defeat Darth Malak: a ruthless Sith lord and the commander of an army of Sith warriors. Boasting tactical combat, a deep morality system and a full galaxy to explore, Knights of the Old Republic was heralded as not only one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-games">best Star Wars games ever made</a>, but one of the best RPGs of all time.</p><p>Despite recent reports that the remake's development had halted, Saber Interactive revealed to us in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">an interview back in April</a> that it's still "alive and well." Although the full details of the remake aren't currently known, it's sure to try and recapture the magic of the original game, while updating its systems, visuals and gameplay for modern audiences.</p><h3>Amy Hennig's New Star Wars Project - In Development</h3><p>First announced back in 2022, Skydance Media unveiled that it was working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amy-hennig-star-wars-skydance-new-media">a new game set in the Star Wars universe</a>. Better yet, the studio revealed it would be bringing in former Uncharted director, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-captain-america-black-pather-amy-hennig-game-revealed-state-of-unreal-2024">Amy Hennig</a>, to work on the project. </p><p>With Hennig currently hard at work on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-captain-america-black-pather-amy-hennig-game-revealed-state-of-unreal-2024">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, details on her venture into the Star Wars universe are few and far between, although the announcement did reveal that it will be a cinematic action-adventure that tells an original story. Considering Hennig has an aptitude for thrilling adventures with engrossing narratives, her take on a galaxy far, far away is definitely one to watch, even if it seems to be in the very early stages.</p><h3>Bit Reactor's Star Wars Strategy Game - In Development</h3><p>Another Star Wars title that's still in early production, EA announced back in 2022 that Respawn Entertainment was producing a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-respawn-bit-reactor-strategy-project">Star Wars strategy game</a>, with developer Bit Reactor taking the reins.</p><p>Similar to Skydance Media's Star Wars title, outside of the base details, we know very little about what to expect from the project other than it'll tackle the series from a strategy perspective. However, Bit Reactor is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-respawn-ea-jedi-fallen-order-sequel-fps-strategy-xcom">comprised of former Firaxis veterans heralded for their work on the XCOM franchise</a>, so there's a very good chance we're in for a treat.</p><h3>Star Wars Jedi 3 - In Development</h3><p>One that shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering the acclaim of its two predecessors, EA and Respawn Entertainment have confirmed that they are indeed working on a third Star Wars Jedi game. Following the cancellation of Respawn's in-development Star Wars first-person shooter earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-fps-is-canceled-but-work-on-next-jedi-game-black-panther-and-iron-man-will-continue">the company confirmed they were committed to offering a sequel to the Jedi series</a>, announcing it was in the works.</p><p>Considering it's definitely early days for the threequel, there's very little to go off, although it appears <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-jedi-survivor/Cal_Kestis">Cal Kestis</a> will be back in the saddle as the lead protagonist. Cameron Monaghan, the actor who potrays Kestis, revealed during the Star Wars: Jedi Game Series Panel at Ocala Comic Con last year that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cal-kestis-actor-in-the-process-of-making-star-wars-jedi-3">he was already working with Respawn on a third entry</a>.</p><p>If the previous two Jedi games are anything to go off, this third title will likely focus on players once again exploring the galaxy as Cal Kestis, going head to head with enemies in intense third-person lightsaber combat, using force-based abilities to traverse precarious environments and solving physics-based puzzles.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

                <p>There's another Silent Hill game reportedly in development, this time being worked on internally over at Konami. After years of the Silent Hill series being dormant, Konami recently let other third-party studios tackle it. However, it looks like Konami will still continue to make its own Silent Hill games.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1819243908007624765" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insider Dusk Golem</a>, Konami still has a couple other unannounced projects in the works, including a new Silent Hill game. However, they didn't provide any other information, such as whether it'd be another remake.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 Remake Extended Gameplay Showcase | Silent Hill Transmission May 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>Konami is committed to releasing new Silent Hill games after a strong Q1 2024 performance, with the Silent Hill 2 remake launching later this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-townfall-teaser-trailer-revealed/1100-6508442/" data-ref-id="1100-6508442">Silent Hill Townfall</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-release-date-trailers-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6510045/" data-ref-id="1100-6510045">Silent Hill F</a> are still in development with no official release window announced yet. There's not much information about former, but the latter is the nineth mainline entry in the series.</p><p>The two most recent entries in the series are <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-ascension/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill: Ascension</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-the-short-message-review-in-my-restless-dreams-i-flee-that-town/1900-6418173/" data-ref-id="1900-6418173">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>. Unfortunately, the reception for both games has been negative from both fans and critics alike.</p><p>Silent Hill 2 remake is set to launch on October 7 for PC and PS5. A new Silent Hill movie is also in production right now, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-shares-return-to-silent-hill-movie-teaser/1100-6523860/" data-ref-id="1100-6523860">Return to Silent Hill</a>, which will see both Pyramid Head and Dark Nurses returning from the original movies.</p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has shared the unfortunate news that they have delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2</a> indefinitely.</p>
<p>Prison Architect 2 had already been delayed a couple times, most recently aiming for 3rd September and with the announcement that the development was being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/prison-architect-2-developer-double-eleven-breaks-up-with-paradox-interactive/">handed over from original studio Double Eleven to new team at Kokku</a>, but even that has been pulled back as they “re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready.”</p>


<p>There will be minimal communication about the game’s development through the coming weeks and months, until such a time that Kokku and Paradox feel ready to share something substantial.</p>
<p>Given the form of this delay, all pre-orders are being refunded automatically, though you will be able to request an expedited refund, as <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/">detailed in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the latest blow to Paradox’s game line up. Cities: Skylines 2 launched last year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">to great dissatisfaction from players</a>, with developer Colossal Order having now spent the better part of the year optimising the game and reworking gameplay elements. Last year’s The Lamplighters League also underperformed, and more recently, Paradox cancelled and shut down the studio behind their The Sims competitor, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-cancelled-by-paradox/">Life By You</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the Prison Architect 2 statement in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have some difficult news to share: unfortunately, we will not release Prison Architect 2 on September 3rd because we need more time to improve both the game’s performance and its content. Our continuous internal reviews and beta test groups have highlighted areas that we need to focus on more, mainly performance and content, which we need to address before launch to ensure that you, the players, get a good experience in the game. We need to raise the quality a bit more to meet the standards we’d like to achieve with this sequel.</p>
<p>We are confident that the sequel to Prison Architect will be great, and we’re looking forward to showing you all the new ideas brought into it: the switch to 3D, multi-floors, and the new behavior system that all bring a new dimension to the game and open new gameplay possibilities for the players. However, we want to make sure the game lives up to the franchise’s legacy and is released in a state that satisfies both you, our players, and the Prison Architect 2 teams at Kokku and Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>At this stage, we can’t commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready. Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>With this indefinite delay, preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and the preorder items will be added to the base game.</p>
<p>This decision aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to reviewing and improving the quality of our released content. We are confident that delaying Prison Architect 2 is the best path forward for the game, allowing us more time to deliver a high-quality experience that honors the legacy of Prison Architect.</p>
<p>This is not the announcement we hoped to make, but it is necessary, as we believe this will result in a better game for you. Thank you for your patience, and we’ll see you again soon.</p>
<p>The Prison Architect 2 Team</p></blockquote>

Its 2005 release made it the last <em>Pokémon </em>game on Game Boy Advance, and the first of seven in the ongoing series. However, it wasn’t the first <em>Mystery Dungeon</em> game, Chunsoft having used the same name for many previous crossovers, including <em>Final Fantasy</em> and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/shiren-the-wanderer-isa-mystery-dungeon-game-withoutpokmonor-chocobos-thats-all/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/shiren-the-wanderer-isa-mystery-dungeon-game-withoutpokmonor-chocobos-thats-all/"><em>Shiren the Wanderer</em></a></span> series of games, since 1993. While those games all have the same core systems, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team Red</em> was a perfect combination that makes it shine.</p><p>After three generations of mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games, one of the biggest draws of<em> Red Rescue Team</em> was that it put you in the shoes of the Pokémon. There is a mystical story that begins with you, as a normal human in the world, being somehow transformed into a Pokémon. The specific monster you transform into is decided by a short personality test. I remember starting over the game multiple times the first time I put in my cartridge, in order to get exactly who I wanted: Mudkip.</p><p>The world of <em>Red Rescue Team</em> is a quaint town populated by talking Pokémon, all with their own lives. It’s all adorably rendered in the GBA’s beautiful graphics, and even two decades later there’s a wonderful charm to it.</p><p>The gameplay loop centers on exploring multi-floor roguelike dungeons, with the aid of your team (all cute talking Pokémon), in search of specific NPCs you have been hired to rescue. You progress through dungeons by moving on a grid via a turn-based system, and enter combat against enemies you encounter. Exploring every crevice of a dungeon is a thrilling and sometimes dangerous adventure, and it offers a different take on <em>Pokémon </em>battles. As a little kid who had played her copy of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/think-pokemon-omega-ruby-and-alpha-sapphire-are-too-eas-1663809165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/think-pokemon-omega-ruby-and-alpha-sapphire-are-too-eas-1663809165"><em>Pokémon Sapphire</em></a></span> until the internal battery died, it felt so fresh and exciting.</p><p><em>Red Rescue Team </em>also has an amazing story. On top of figuring out how and why you were turned into a Pokémon, every NPC you meet is a great character to spend time with as you unravel their own secrets. Mixed with a fun story about chasing down a rival rescue team, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</em> packs a lot of narrative into its deceptively small package.</p><p><em>Red Rescue Team</em> actually has a Switch remake in the form of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/being-the-one-human-in-a-world-of-pokemon-is-pretty-coo-1842084962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/being-the-one-human-in-a-world-of-pokemon-is-pretty-coo-1842084962"><em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</em></a></span>. It’s pretty great and has its own unique painterly art style. It does cost $60, though. So if you are intrigued by the game, just wait till the original version drops on Switch Online on August 9. I’d also recommend the GBA version over the remake, just for the endlessly charming graphics. Now when are we getting a <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky</em> remake?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, the Dead by Daylight team revealed its 2024 roadmap for live updates coming to the game through November 2024.</p>



<p>These live updates will include various improvements for quality of life, as well as tweaks and updates for perks and killers.</p>



<p>August will be the busiest month in the roadmap, with 10 new updates. Players will see quality-of-life and gameplay updates for scratch marks and Midwich Elementary School. </p>



<p>The first killers to receive new tweaks are Doctor, Nemesis, and Dredge. The first perk tweaks include Dance With Me, Deception, Diversion, Chemical Trap, and Mirrored Illusion.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're more than halfway through the year 📅 time to check in with the live updates the team will be working on for the rest of 2024. </p><p>As always, timelines may change, but we'll keep you updated as we progress. <a href="https://t.co/Dnw68eMpqp">pic.twitter.com/Dnw68eMpqp</a></p></div>— Dead by Daylight (@DeadbyDaylight) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>In a highlight from the roadmap of live updates, the Dead by Daylight team is planning perk updates for Leverage, Hex: Crowd Control, Distortion, and Blood Rush. </p>



<p>These changes will arrive sometime between September and October 2024, and they could shake up the meta more so than minor tweaks.</p>



<p>Naturally, the developers did warn fans that “timelines may change, but we’ll keep you updated as we progress.” There are no exact release dates, but the roadmap adds that the monthly release windows are “subject to change based on development needs.”</p>



<p>Most recently, Dead by Daylight kept the summer season busy with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-roadmap-revealed-for-july-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major July updates</a>.  Those included the anticipated 2v8 mode and cross-progression. It also featured the somewhat divisive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lara-croft-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-july-16-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addition of Lara Croft</a>.</p>

But its implementation in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon hasn't evolved a whole lot to provide enough variety that'll sustain its extensive storyline. It drags on and on without much change, which is why it's a good thing it's been structured in segments for quick-shot, handheld-friendly dungeon exploration."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For more from the world of Pokemon, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-skipping-2024-is-a-good-thing">our feature on why a mainline Pokemon entry skipping 2024 is a good thing</a> and our look at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Pokemon TCG's 'small but brilliant' Shrouded Fable expansion.</a></p><p><em>Have a tip for us?
