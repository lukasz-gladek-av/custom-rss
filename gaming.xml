            <p>
The legendary Horiyuki Sanada, star of hit Amazon TV series Shogun, is in talks for a role in the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima film.
</p>
<p>
That's according to veteran movie tipster <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/105254279?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_source=android">DanielRPK</a>, who shared word of the discussions over the weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Sanada, who played Toranaga-sama in Shogun, is also known for his roles in The Last Samurai, Sunshine and Lost. He's next set to appear on cinema screens in another video game adaptation: Mortal Kombat 2.

<p>
While this isn't yet a confirmation of Sanada's involvement by PlayStation Studios itself, fans are already celebrating the actor's potential involvement - and speculating who he might play. 
</p>
<p>
The obvious choice is Lord Shimura, the uncle and protector to Ghost of Tsushima's protagonist Jin. 
</p>
<p>
"As much as I want the cast of the game to reprise their roles, he would be a killer Shimura," one fan wrote on reddit.
</p>
<p>
"He's pretty much perfect as Lord Shimura," wrote another. "I would be very surprised if he was cast as anyone else."
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-wick-director-making-ghost-of-tsushima-movie">announced a film adaptation of Ghost of Tsushima in 2021</a>, helmed by Chad Stahelski (director of John Wick: Chapter 4 - which also stars Sanada).
</p>
<p>
Progress on the project has been relatively slow, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-adaptation-names-its-writer">Takashi Doscher named as its writer in 2022</a>. But Stahelski has continued to discuss the project, and has said his desire is for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-will-be-a-complete-japanese-cast-in-japanese">"a complete Japanese cast, [speaking] in Japanese" throughout</a>.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Sony's Sucker Punch studio, Ghost of Tsushima originally launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020, and finally arrived for PC last month. As ever, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ghost-of-tsushima-on-pc-delivers-impressive-upgrades-over-ps5">Digital Foundry has cast its beady eyes over the Ghost of Tsushima PC port</a>.

This week is the week of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/summer-game-fest-2024">Summer Game Fest 2024</a>. Ah, SGF! The Geoffers, as they call it down Los Angeles way. The Not-E3s. The Midsomer Keighleys. Jumping G.K's Game-a-Palooza. The AAAArghs. The Second Fall Of Babel. Trailarmageddon. The Sparkling Stink. SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">their latest State of Play showcase</a>, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT. I'll be out there covering the event in LA from Thursday to Monday while the remainder of Rock Paper Shotgun hold the fort on London time.

<p>
It's a period of frightful bounty for the Maw, our resident Hadean icon of videogame news consumption. Look forward to trailers, celeb cameos, surprise demo releases, around a million hours of interlude music, and hands-on impressions fresh from the creaking furnace chambers of my jetlagged brain. Still, SGF isn't All She Wrote this week. A few brave developers and publishers are releasing new games alongside the event, like individual rockets plunging into Uncle Geoff's Fervid Fireworks Show. Here are a few that have caught our eyes.
</p>
<p>
Monday 3rd June sees the release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online/">Elder Scrolls Online's Gold Road expansion</a>, which Katharine (RPS in peace) considers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-onlines-new-gold-road-expansion-might-just-make-me-an-mmo-convert">a solid gateway drug to MMOs in general</a>, together with lurid 90s room-escaper <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1484760/Tamarindos_Freaking_Dinner/">Tamarindos Freaking Dinner</a>, in which you deliver pizza to a mansion full of Tim Burton-esque munsters. On Tuesday 4th June, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2336880/Destiny_2_The_Final_Shape/">Destiny 2's Final Shape expansion</a>, a project whose success or lack thereof will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-face-a-full-sony-takeover-and-more-layoffs-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-flops-according-to-reports">reportedly determine whether Sony mounts a full takeover of Bungie</a>, together with a pair of fairly handsome strategy games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195410/Songs_of_Silence/">Songs Of Silence</a> (which looks a bit like a deck of Tarot cards) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985050/Field_of_Glory_Kingdoms/">Field Of Glory: Kingdoms</a> (which looks a bit like a medieval manuscript). There's also asymmetrical horror outing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556100/Killer_Klowns_from_Outer_Space_The_Game/">Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game</a>, which Nic will be upset if I don't mention. Wednesday 6th June sees the release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113010/Chornobyl_Liquidators/">Chornobyl Liquidators</a>, which is "not a fantastic tale of exploring the Zone" but "a story about real people facing a real threat", and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206410/Kristala/">Kristala</a>, a Soulslike with a touch of Robin Jarvis. And on 7th June, finally, the "deceptively cute" (aren't they always?) factory sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1955110/Star_Stuff/">Star Stuff</a>.
</p>
<p>
As ever, let me know if we've missed anything I would feel deeply embarrassed about missing, and enjoy the week. You can follow our routine news coverage in the liveblog below, which I'm going to extend into Sunday so you can follow the deterioration of my writing abilities in real-time. Onward, to SGF! Keighley &amp; Friends! The Endless June! The Geoffervescent Circus!

        <p>The funding round was led by Play Ventures</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Hypersonic Laboratories has raised $7 million in a series A round led by Play Ventures.</p>
<p>AppWorks, WTIC, KB Investment, and Alex Ekvall also contributed to the round, with the funding going towards further development of Helix.</p>
<p>The sandbox platform aims at facilitating the creation of role-playing mods and servers. Helix is due to launch in a closed alpha later this year.</p>
<p>Helix initially launched as a web3 platform with an NFT marketplace, but the team recently switched to web2 and removed any blockchain and NFTs.</p>
<p>Hypersonic previously raised $4 million, having been founded in 2019 by CEO Jack 'Maker' Kim.</p>
<p>He commented: "It shouldn’t be that hard for the millions of people out there who want to mod or play modded games, but until Helix, there’s just never been a professional toolset or platform built by modders, for modding.</p>
<p>"Our team, cumulatively, has built mods and modding frameworks with more than 100 million total downloads – all in their own free time. Imagine what they can do now that they’re actually being paid to do it!"</p>

            <p>June has arrived and with it comes the usual cavalcade of video game announcements, all presented in a series of livestreamed showcases.</p>
<p>The season technically kicked off last week with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">PlayStation's State of Play</a>, but the barrage of trailers will ramp up from Thursday, with Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest showing on the following day, culminating with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-forward-set-for-june-10-news-in-brief">Ubisoft Forward on Monday, June 10</a>.</p>
<p>In between, we'll see the latest announcements from Xbox, IGN Live, Devolver Digital, Wholesome Games, and more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also confirmed it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">will release a Nintendo Direct at some point in June</a>, which will show off titles it has coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. The platform holder has said this broadcast will not mention the console's upcoming successor.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/welcome-to-cooking-week.887838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/welcome-to-cooking-week-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Kirby image via Nintendo.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food and cooking mechanics have a long history in video games, evolving from health power-ups to sidequest and mini-games and eventually into a creative pillar holding up entire genres. As we start out our week focusing on cooking games and restaurant simulators, let’s examine some of the most popular themes across the genre and explore what developers can learn and apply to their own delicious side dishes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of the earliest uses of food in video games come from the classics; in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pac-Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1980), we saw fruit used to award points based on how long the player could survive in a level. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Burgertime</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1982), food preparation is at the core of a challenge rooted in skill, with players stacking different ingredients like lettuce and tomato to assemble a hamburger. In games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gauntlet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1985), large chunks of meat are used in health restoration, inspiring the classic and oft-quoted line: “Warrior needs food badly.” Whatever the era in gaming, food and cooking have served many design goals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As games grew in complexity, so did our context for the use of food, leading eventually to games that allowed you not to just eat but to cook. Among the earliest were games like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cooking Mama</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2006) on the Nintendo DS, which simplified the process of cooking down to easy visual steps and used the device’s second screen touchpad to mimic techniques like slicing or chopping vegetables. Another, 2012’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (based on the 1999 PlayStation title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ore no Ryouri</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which we explore in an interview with developer David Galindo later this week) used cooking as more of a concept, focusing on quick time button sequences to mimic the preparation and assemblage of a dish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the years since open-world survival games have risen in popularity, so too has the concept of in-game cooking. It can be seen as a staple in games as broad as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don’t Starve</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2013) to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with a wide range in complexity. Some cooking games focus on gameifying the techniques of cooking. Others focus on the utility of food, like power-ups or health items while others still use it to reinforce a game’s crafting systems, adding an element of worldbuilding by teaching the player the regional flora and fauna.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why does cooking in games appeal to us, both as players and game makers, so much? Well, on the more obvious side, human beings have evolved to take cues about a food’s texture, flavor, and freshness from its appearance, and our appetites rely on that appeal. Think of the entire industries that have sprung up around food plating and presentation, be it the factory that manufactures food models for restaurant displays or fancy Michelin-starred restaurants that incorporate elements of traditional visual arts into each dish. What we see is a big part of enjoying what we eat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This visual aspect combined with personal tastes can also turn cooking into a mode of self-expression. What we cook is a reflection of our skills, our opinions, our resources, and our history. As with other art forms, the joy is as much in its creation as the final product. (This topic is evoked briefly in our upcoming interview with the developers of TapBlaze later this week, “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would not exist if not for Costco.”)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are many themes that cooking touches on, each speaking to its different roles. Cooking is a part of our everyday lives, a symbol of routine, stability, even boredom. It’s also a part of our special occasions, our holidays and family gatherings: times that call for scarce ingredients and hours of tedious but worthwhile labor. With that in mind, here are some of the themes, mechanics, and stories we'll explore in full this week.</span></p><p>Image via Visai Games.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Food, family and heritage">Food, family and heritage</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Venba</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a strong recent example of a game that depicts the complicated intersection of cooking and family, touching on racism, identity, and parental sacrifice while walking us through a trial-and-error process that reinforces the procedure of certain techniques in Tamil cooking. On top of crafting game mechanics out of dishes and cooking equipment unique to Indian cuisine, Venba also gave opportunities for the player to think about why we cook, and the emotions that are poured into the act of service, whether we’re connecting with our roots or sacrificing our time and energy for the benefit of someone we love.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One title that more directly attempts to educate players about a culture is the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rooster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a point-and-click adventure game that celebrates Chinese culture through its visual style, music and ancillary features like papercrafting and cooking. Developer Deborah Chantson opined on this topic in “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-upside-of-using-culture-and-personal-stories-as-game-pillars">The Upside of Using Culture and Personal Stories as Game Pillars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">” earlier this year, discussing the merits of using personal heritage in game design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another game to take this approach is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://creativags.itch.io/cacaocafe">Cacao Café</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which replicates the agricultural and culinary practices around the production of chocolate in ancient Mexica culture. We discuss this more in the article, “Exploring ancient Mexica culture through cooking in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Café</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">” later this week.</span><br></p><p>Coffee Talk also bears an element of self-expression, allowing players to create foam art on the drinks they serve to customers. Image via Toge Productions.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Food, community and socializing">Food, community and socializing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community can be many things, but the act of communing itself is well depicted within games, where service and hospitality often play a key part not only in our perception of this act but our role within it. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/914800/Coffee_Talk/">Coffee Talk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the player is a barista whose job is in part that of a confidante, similar to that of the bartender in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/">VA-11 HALL-A</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As you listen to a customer’s story and pour them a coffee, there’s a lovely mirror between the thought and care put into actively listening to them and the drink you make based on their verbal tip-offs and emotional cues.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other games use cooking to reflect relationships in other ways; take for example </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Sword</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shield</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which let the player set up camp and make curry for their Pokémon, choosing different ingredients based on the strengths of their team to build stronger friendships, in turn giving the player a superior edge in battle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another aspect explored in food and community is its role in socializing. One dish that shows up in many indie games is hot pot, traditionally a meal that is served for a group of people,&nbsp; becoming a metaphor about the unique stresses of eating as a group, as seen in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://keanerie.itch.io/hot-pot-panic">Hot Pot Panic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This is somewhat subverted in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rachelqxl.itch.io/hot-pot-for-one">Hot Pot for One</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which depicts the loneliness of being an ex-pat in a new city by walking players through the sad experience of having all the ingredients for a social dinner, and not enough friends to share it with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This topic is explored more this week in the Q&amp;A, “Why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are a dish best served cold”, where developer Keven Brown discusses why they chose to create a game that reflects more on the social aspects of eating and cooking than the technical logistics, and what it says about the utility of eating versus the camaraderie of its creation. It is also warmly dissected in our upcoming Featured Blog from senior editor Bryant Francis, entitled “Strategy games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> let us think about the bigger picture of cooking,” similarly reminiscing about the value placed on food outside of its immediate necessity, and how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> supports that through its design.</span></p><p>In Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2, players manage not only incoming orders but the janitorial and kitchen responsibilities of running a restaurant, too. Image via Vertigo Gaming Inc.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cooking and performance anxiety">Cooking and performance anxiety</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the other end of the spectrum are the games where the focus is timing, performance and successful execution of a specific skill. There are many series that model this by combining a light facsimile of actual food preparation with the frenzy of fast-paced restaurants, sometimes contextualized as a simulation (like</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Chef Life: A Restaurant Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/deep-dive-balancing-the-authentic-culinary-experience-with-chef-life-a-restaurant-simulator">whose developers shared with us their formula for achieving that balance in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Sacrificing authenticity for simplicity, these games center on customer service, challenging players to master timing as each ingredient is prepped, cooked, plated, and served.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interesting to note that it’s often the addition of selling labor that adds the element of stress; whereas </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Venba</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or the cat cafe game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Calico</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> evoke comfort and safety, restaurant and food prep sims like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overcooked</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are all about performing in high-pressure situations. This is taken to an extreme with the surreal horror game</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851380/Happys_Humble_Burger_Barn/">Happy’s Humble Burger Farm</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where players who botch too many orders will find themselves attacked by a violent fast food mascot. We can also see that dynamic subverted by the antics of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1977530/Onearmed_cook/">One-armed Cook</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where the challenge of cooking is played for comedy by limiting the player’s skills to the use of a single arm, to frustrating but slapstick results.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stressful though they may be, these simulators also reflect another of cooking’s many sources of appeal: the fantasy of self-sufficiency, be it as a Pizza Tycoon managing a restaurant or the pride and sense of accomplishment in preparing food for yourself. This is depicted to a certain extent with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where learning to cook provides better benefits in terms of your character’s needs but also, by way of ingredients either collected or grown, can reflect their interests and economic security. (For a little Sims-related fun, read my blog post later this week, called “This ain’t your</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Sims 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">French Toast”, exploring the world of fan culture surrounding video game cooking with a recipe from my personal oeuvre).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Image via Nintendo.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cooking and worldbuilding">Cooking and worldbuilding</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In-game cooking also serves a role in telling the player about the world around them, giving game designers, artists, narrative designers, and writers a powerful tool for crafting living and believable worlds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take, for example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battle Chef Brigade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a match-3 game where recipes aren’t so much cooked as they are strategically assembled by collecting sets of the same ingredient. While the game doesn’t give any insight into the cooking process or what a recipe looks like, its core premise does rely on the aesthetic appeal of food, using the game’s combat sequences and the gathered ingredients of each “dish” to tell us key things about wildlife within its universe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This use of cooking also frequently factors into open-world games, where its purpose as a performance booster is also supplemented by what it tells the player about the environment. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, plants reflect their region and in turn, create potions and meals that strengthen Link’s resistance to the most immediate elements. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, flora reflects not just the imagined effects on local vegetation in post-nuclear Appalachia but also the influence of pollution, geology, and other aspects of the area’s real history. Closely related to both is the world of potions that also dominates game lore, not just in RPGs and survival games but in other genres as well; in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the heroine Melinoe collects resources to produce Incantations at her camp’s giant cauldron, not only adding permanent beneficial boosts to the game but also supplementing key stories from Greek mythology to further explore the complicated relationships within its pantheon.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">All these themes will be dissected in more detail through interviews, blogs, and features that highlight how cooking is used in games and why. Keep an eye out for these articles as the week progresses.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Q&amp;A: Why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are a dish best served cold</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Featured Blog: Strategy games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> let us think about the bigger picture of cooking</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Deep Dive: Cooking up a palatable food prep experience in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Q&amp;A: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would not exist if not for Costco</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Featured Blog: This ain't your </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sims 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> baked French toast</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Feature: How </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ore no Ryoumi</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> inspired </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> An interview with David Galindo</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Q&amp;A: Exploring ancient Mexica culture through cooking in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Café</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And don’t forget, if you have a cooking-related topic you’d like to write out, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#244c4b48485d0a435641414a644d4a424b5649450a474b49">reach out</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or submit a post through our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://reg.gdconf.com/blog-submission">blog submission form</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">; we would love to feature your article during Cooking Week.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-overpowered-sniper-rifles-are-finally-getting-nerfed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiants-overpowered-sniper-rifles-are-finally-getting-nerfed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="196" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There’s good news for <em>XDefiant</em> fans who are sick to death of being destroyed by enemies using sniper rifles, as executive director Mark Rubin has confirmed a significant nerf is on the way. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">The discourse around sniper rifles has rumbled on since release day, with fans claiming that weapon class has been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-players-claim-ridiculously-overpowered-weapon-is-ruining-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruining the game</a>. Specifically, the fact that the rifles didn’t feature any flinch when being shot by an opponent caused huge frustration, as enemies were able to aim perfectly even when they were getting slammed with bullets. </p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">Thankfully, that’s about to change, as confirmed by Rubin himself in a tweet on June 1. Responding to a tweet that asked if snipers would ever be balanced, the <em>XDefiant</em> executive producer stated that the class was “a bit buggy right now,” asking fans to let them fix the sniper and then re-evaluate. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">They are a bit buggy right now. Let us fix them and then re-evaluate.</p>— Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelsofMark/status/1796961536747209111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">As for how they intend to fix them, Rubin wrote: “Right now we are adding flinch so if you are taking hits you can’t just turn, point, click, and delete people. Should be in an upcoming patch.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Right now we are adding flinch so if you are taking hits you can't just turn, point, click and delete people. Should be in an upcoming patch.</p>— Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelsofMark/status/1797006243363737751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, Rubin didn’t specify when these tweaks would arrive, although it’s possible that we may have to wait until <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-xdefiant-season-1-possible-release-date-and-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> begins to see such a significant change. Still, it will definitely be a welcome adjustment, with fans replying that it’s “good it’s coming” and “exactly what [they] were hoping for.”</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">I for one echo those comments, as I’m sick of getting sniped from a guy who has eaten three of my SMG bullets and somehow still got perfect aim. With this change, it feels like <em>XDefiant</em>‘s weapon classes will feel more balanced and have their own unique advantages, something that the game has been crying out for. </p>

        <p>A documentary and a drama series are set to release based on 2023's Doom Guy: Life in First Person</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>John Romero's autobiography is set to be adapted as a series, and will also be the subject of a documentary.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-documentary-drama-john-romero-quake-wolfenstein-1235944457/">Deadline</a>, 'Doom Guy: Life in First Person' will become a documentary directed by Rob McCallum, who's mainly known for 2023's Mr. Dressup: The Magic of Make-Believe.</p>
<p>The series adaptation doesn't have a director attached to it yet, but both projects will have Naomi Harvey serve as executive producer, via Golden Possum Productions.</p>
<p>John Romero's book came out in 2023, in which he goes through his life and career, from his childhood to the creation of Id Software, up until now. Considered the inventor of first-person shooters, Romero currently is the chief creative officer of Romero Games, which he created in 2014.</p>
<p>Romero commented: "Talking with both Rob and Naomi, I knew they were the perfect team to bring Doom Guy to life. Our backgrounds and aspirations have uncanny similarities, and I trust them to tell the story."</p>

        <p>Sources claim publisher told staff in April that it will no longer support indie-focused label</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Take-Two is planning to close or potential sell its indie-focused publishing label Private Division.</p>
<p>That's according to an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">IGN report</a>, which cites sources familiar with the matter who say almost all Private Division staff have been laid off. Take-Two has declined to comment.</p>
<p>Management reportedly told employees in April that Take-Two would no longer support the publishing label, with only a handful of staff left to handle the remaining publishing deals. These include Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked, Wētā Workshop's Tales of the Shire, and an unannounced title from Pokémon developer Game Freak.</p>
<p>At least two other publishing deals are said to have been dropped. Bloober Team revealed last week it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/private-division-reportedly-drops-publishing-deal-with-bloober-team">lost its deal with Private Division</a> for an unannounced survival horror game, while IGN reports the other was with One More Level, the developer behind Ghostrunner.</p>
<p>Take-Two is said to be in discussions with potential buyers for Private Division, with an unnamed private equity firm showing interest.</p>
<p>The publisher has also been looking into selling the Kerbal Space Program IP, potentially with Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games included.</p>
<p>All of this follows a series of reports that indicate Private Division is shrinking. Take-Two reportedly <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-shuts-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-private-division-suffers-mass-layoffs">closed both the label's subsidiaries</a>, Rollerdrome developer Roll7 and Intercept Games.</p>
<p>CEO Strauss Zelnick later said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-roll7-and-intercept-games-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">neither studio has technically been closed</a>, but a WARN notice indicates Intercept will be shut down this month with staff confirming there have been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/intercept-games-facing-layoffs-by-end-of-june">widespread layoffs at this studio</a>.</p>
<p>Private Division's changes follow Take-Two's announcement it was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-laying-off-5-of-staff">laying off 5% of all staff</a> as part of its third cost-reduction program in just over a year.</p>

			<p>A new Tomb Raider UE5 cinematic video has been released featuring fan favorites Angelina Jolie and Christoph Waltz.</p>
<p>Created by digital artist 'Lorenzo_CGI', this 'The Last Revelation teaser tribute' is a short cinematic video in Unreal Engine 5.3, and it looks really impressive. In the video, we can see Angelina Jolie portraying Lara Croft and Christoph Waltz portraying Mr Von Croy. No AI or deepfakes were used in order to create this video, which might make it even more impressive. "For this project, I used texturing xyz for the skin texturing, and for the hair cards for Lara I used ( with some retouch) the hair from 3d scan store", the artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lDmnoz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>. "For the creation of the environment, I tried to replicate the environment of the game, with some differences, with the help of the assets from Megascan."</p>
<p>He added, "For the animation I used a combination of motion capture made by me (see the picture of the cheap helmet) with the help of Metahuman animator and the amazing tool Metapipe and the software iclone from Reallusion."</p>
<p>You can check out the new cinematic video below. Be sure to write what you think about this video below. Although this is merely a fan project, it might provide a glimpse of what's possible with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming new Tomb Raider game within Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>

<p>The next Tomb Raider from Crystal Dynamics was announced to be in development back in 2022. Here's what the studio's General Manager had to say about it back then:</p>
<p><em>Crystal Dynamics is proud to be a part of the launch of Unreal Engine 5. This new engine translates into next-level storytelling and gameplay experiences. And that's why we are thrilled to announce that we have just started developer of our next Tomb Raider game, powered by Unreal Engine 5. Our goal is to push the envelope of fidelity and to deliver the high-quality cinematic action-adventure experience that fans deserve from both Crystal Dynamics and the Tomb Raider franchise. We can't wait to take this journey together. Thank you, and congratulations again to the Epic Games team.</em></p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as more information about the next Tomb Raider game comes in.</p>

		<p>Diablo IV’s latest season started on the 14th May aiming to redefine the game’s loot system. Called the Season of Loot Reborn, it makes some pretty massive changes to that loot system, and little else. Still, the loot is the heart of a Diablo game so the ability to save legendary affixes to imprint onto other items and upgrade loot by tempering it could be a welcome change, so I decided to once again take on the seemingly infinite forces of hell to get my loot on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdSehRhUOXM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will get the none-loot based stuff out of the way first, because it is incredibly scarce. This season revolves around the Iron Wolves, members of whom have been disappearing mysteriously. Usually the season’s quest is available immediately upon entering the Endgame, but here you’ll need to find an Iron Wolves medallion that must be dropped from monsters during Helltides. This will trigger the side quest and finally let you go and investigate some missing Iron Wolves. These quests are short, re-use enemies from the Helltide, and are just generally a bit uninspired. That’s all the story you’re getting in this season.</p>


<p>There are a bunch of other changes though. In addition to being available to players in all world tiers now, Helltides themselves have a few more activities to engage in, even if they are pretty same-y all things considered. There’s also a huge Bloodmaiden public boss fight you can trigger and cross your fingers there’s someone to help you out nearby. On top of all this, there’s also a new heat system, where as you kill more enemies in the Helltide, you’ll progress through three tiers of notoriety with the hellspawn, each tier bringing more and tougher enemies, until it reaches maximum and triggers an onslaught and a boss called the Helborne.</p>
<p>This all makes Helltides a little more varied, even if it’s just a variety of slightly different ways to encounter and then slaughter legions of enemies. Thankfully you’ve got a few more tools to help gear yourself for this particular hellish threat. The biggest, and perhaps most important change of the Season of Loot Reborn is the way legendary affixes are now handled. Previously you could complete dungeons to unlock some affixes that could be imprinted onto items, but many of the best ones had to be found on gear. Now when you scrap a legendary item at the blacksmith, its affix is added to your library, ready for you to imprint onto any compatible item as many times as you like. If you scrap a legendary item that has the same affix with better rolls it’ll upgrade the one you have.</p>


<p>This has a profound effect on the game, now you can transfer your strongest legendary traits onto new gear as the original gets levelled out of its usefulness. Certain abilities can be permanent fixtures in your build – I’m playing a sorcerer this time around and I’ve had one legendary affix since I was relatively low level that splits the single beam of fire from Incinerate into three that each do more damage. I’m level 66 now and it’s still as fun as it is effective.</p>
<p>You can also now upgrade items using the new tempering system. In amongst all the loot – and there is a lot of it – you’ll find new recipes dropping that give you the ability to temper your gear with certain upgrades. You activate this recipe in your inventory to learn it and then make your way to the blacksmith to apply it to some gear. It’ll give you one of a small selection of upgrades with the opportunity to reroll a few times should you get one that’s less useful. There were quite a few times where I used all my rerolls trying to get a useful upgrade for my all fire sorcerer only to end up with one that upgrades ice blast.</p>
<p>This is a bit frustrating but I suppose that’s RNG for you. These upgrades aren’t exactly very powerful on their own but if you tailor them to your build they could give you a little extra impact or survivability where you need it most. Then there’s also the Masterworking system, which allows you to improve affixes that are already on your items once you unlock it at World Tier 4.</p>
<p>This is all mostly welcome changes. The legendary stuff means that you’re now more chasing for affixes rather than particularly well rolled items, which means you can use more loot but also does a lot to diminish how special it is when you finally get that item that’s rolled just right. It cuts down on frustration though, so overall it’s a positive. The changes to Helltide are mostly positive as well, but there is one frustration that keeps popping up and I don’t think it’s one that can really be fixed by seasonal changes: the difficulty is all over the place.</p>

<p>My sorcerer, in the past week, has destroyed the Hellborne that spawns after you fill the Helltide heat metre in seconds multiple times. Now I’m level 66 and when the Hellborne spawns, I know that I am about to die. This is despite slaughtering literally hundreds of enemies, including numerous elites, within a second or two each in the run up to the Hellborne spawning. Even despite killing the Seething Abomination in the PVP areas without any issue at all, or despite defeating Kixxarth the Helltide Assassin solo, which I had never managed to even come close to on any of my previous characters, the Hellborne just destroys me in a second whilst I barely dent its health.</p>
<p>It’s not that enjoyable having to watch the heat bar fill up when you know instant death is on the end of it, but it’s even worse twenty levels after you were able to do it easily or when everything else in the game might be a bit too easy. The Legion events and the World Bosses aren’t a challenge, but this one thing turns up and one shots me the moment I stop moving long enough to cast a spell. The only other thing with this issue I’ve encountered is the Bloodmaiden that can be spawned also in Helltides, which has a few attacks that are hard to avoid that deal disproportionate amounts of damage, but she’s meant to be a public event boss with multiple players fighting her off.</p>
<p>Obviously this problem is caused by the level scaling system that underpins all of Diablo IV. You can level up whilst fighting and find that the same enemies are now more difficult if you’re not careful and it effects the whole experience. Early on, it’s shockingly easy, but later on it’s only mostly easy except for extreme and unpredictable difficulty spikes that very suddenly and unexpectedly ends your life.</p>
<p>However despite this particular issue, I have been having a lot of fun with Diablo IV. Whilst I feel the move away from finding powerful items to just collecting affixes isn’t ideal for me, it does help to account for some of the issues the former approach has, namely items that become essential to your build outliving their usefulness before you have an adequate replacement. It allows you to mix and match your legendary traits more easily and enables unbelievably powerful builds to be a constant if you want them to be, which has the knock on effect of allowing you to try other options since it’s so easy to go back if needed.</p>

<p>It also helps that it’s so unbelievably generous with loot. I’ve found more legendaries in the last week and a half than I have with whole characters in the past, it’s astonishing if not a little overwhelming. Of course, there are only so many you can equip, so you end up scrapping a lot of legendary items and collecting their affixes instead. One place of particular looting note is the Iron Wolves caches you earn for levelling your reputation with them, some of which guarantee Unique items, which if you’re not familiar is basically an extra-legendary item with particularly powerful abilities and stats that can define your build. Uniques are even rarer than legendary items and with these caches you can guarantee you find one long before you’re likely to otherwise.</p>
<p>On top of the loot, Diablo IV’s gameplay – that is, the actual fighting of lots of monsters with your awesome abilities – is still the best in the genre. There are definitely issues specifically with how the game is multiplayer only, the level scaling that’s likely a result of that, that it’s a live service with a battle pass and seasons yet provides precious little content each season and stretches it out as much as it can, or even that it has a store that charges extortionate amounts of money for purely cosmetic horse armours. But, it sure as hell plays better than all of the competition.</p>

It's not the first time AI has raised eyebrows as some artwork featured in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bigby-presents-glory-of-giants-review-dm-knowledge-aplenty"><em>Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants</em></a> had AI involvement, the potential for AI has also caused <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books">wrongful witchhunt in the past too</a>, most recently with artwork from the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Players Handbook</em>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/principal-ai-engineer-at-wizards-of-the-coast-3828183411">Principal AI Engineer </a>job listing, posted a week ago, announces that they're "looking for someone who believes that crafting high-value, shared technology to accelerate creation and testing of content with [Machine Learning] systems engineering is key to delivering high-quality player experiences."</p>

<p>Reaching out to Wizards of the Coast TechRaptor received the following statement from Wizards of the Coast:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Our stance on AI hasn't changed. This job description is for a role for future video game projects.&nbsp;You can reference our AI FAQ&nbsp;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="0" data-ogsc="" href="https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A key quote from their policy includes "we require artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG and the D&amp;D TTRPG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final <em>Magic </em>or <em>D&amp;D</em> products."</p>

<p>With the provided statement and their AI Art FAQ Wizards of the Coast is drawing a very clear line in the sand between their stance on AI use in Artworks, primarily when it comes to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> as well as <em>Magic: The Gathering,</em>&nbsp;and for AI use in other aspects of product development.</p>

<p>It was only last month that it was announced that Larian, developers of the wildly popular Baldur's Gate III, would <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/larian-is-finished-with-baldurs-gate-were-going-to-move-away-from-dandd-and-were-going-to-start-making-a-new-thing/">not be creating any DLC for Baldur's Gate III and would also not be working on future installments in the Baldur's Gate franchise</a>.

            <p>"Something big is going on behind the scenes" at Starfield.</p>
<p>That's according to players who have been poking around in Steam's backend. By monitoring the updates made to the Steam files via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1716740/">SteamDB</a>, some players claim that Bethesda has made more changes in May than March and April combined.</p>

<p>"It's pointless trying to decipher the changelogs on Steamdb, but one thing is certain from experience: when there are a lot of changes, something big is coming," opined <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1d5uzkz/something_big_is_going_on_behind_the_scenes_there/">u/JarusinTheStars</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/starfield-update-patch-dlc-coming-soon-rumour/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"And over the past week (and more generally since May 1st), there have been more changes than ever since launch, sometimes more than 10 per day. For example, there were around 50-60 changes between the February and March updates. And around 100 between the March and May updates.</p>
<p>We've almost surpassed that figure in less than a month."</p>

</span></p><p>Consequently, this player believes that on the day of the Xbox Showcase – 9th June – Bethesda will present the Shattered Space expansion as well as the June update, and they reckon it'll be "even bigger than the last one".</p>
<p>Whilst there's no doubt that the Reddit user is right about the number and frequency of recent SteamDB updates, the rest is – naturally – only conjecture at this point. Thankfully, we don't have to wait too long for an update that proves JarusinTheStars' theory either way; the Xbox Showcase is just next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-may-patch-adds-60fps-target-for-series-x-land-vehicles-footage-also-teased">Starfield's May update</a> - yes, the one that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-shattered-space-expansion-out-in-autumn-city-map-stuff-due-soon">teased by Bethesa's Todd Howard</a> - is now live, bringing with it the previously promised surface map overhaul, alongside a new 60fps target mode on Xbox Series X. Additionally, Bethesda has shared a brief look at land vehicles, coming to Starfield in a future update.</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us at the time, Todd Howard, played down the absence of land vehicles prior to Starfield's launch, insisting it was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-lack-of-ground-vehicles-is-a-deliberate-choice-bethesda-says">deliberate design decision</a> that allowed the studio to "make it an experience where we know how fast [players are] seeing things." But last December, Bethesda teased that "new ways of travelling" were on Starfield's Horizon.</p>

<p>The same listing describes Astro Bot as a "standalone, full-sized adventure that offers over four times more worlds, 300 bots to rescue, and dozens of new powers and features to discover". It also confirms that Astro Bot is strictly a single-player experience that will only be available on PS5.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it also makes it very clear that Astro Bot does not include microtransactions, assuring players that there are "plenty of coins" to collect and spend in the Gatcha Lab.</p>
<p>Sony announced the new Astro Bot game during this week's PlayStation State of Play. It's simply called Astro Bot, is once again developed by Sony's Team Asobi, and launches for PlayStation 5 on 6th September. It's Astro's first starring role since 2020's PS5 launch title Astro's Playroom.</p>
<p>"[The] announcement of Astro Bot was so bittersweet for me," wrote Eurogamer's Ian in his fabulous feature, I<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">t's hard to stay excited about the PlayStation VR2 if even Astro Bot won't wear one</a>.</p>
<p>"Like everyone, I'm pumped for a new Astro Bot game, they're such joyful, heart-warming and uplifting games - and on top of that this new one looks a bit like a StarFox x Mario Mash-up. 'How can that not be a Game of the Year contender?!' I thought, as I watched the reveal. But then, as the trailer passed the one minute mark without showing footage of anything that looked like VR gameplay, my heart started to sink. That sunken heart then broke completely in two when, at the very end of the trailer, big bold words saying "COMING TO PS5" appeared. So no PSVR2 support at all?! For a character that technically only became big thanks to Astro Bot Rescue Mission on PSVR1? What gives?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24168870/nvidia-sff-ready-enthusiast-geforce-card<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia just gave the PC gaming industry a reason to shrink its biggest graphics cards and produce smallish cases. It’s not what I expected, but I think it might actually help. Read before you judge, friends — I was definitely ready to call out some Nvidia BS, but I’ve mostly come around.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141884/nvidia-will-greenlight-gpus-for-tiny-sff-gaming-pcs">When leakers revealed last month</a> that Nvidia would help steer its graphics card partners toward smaller gaming PCs, I began to daydream. Might we finally see a genuinely small Nvidia powerhouse like <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/9621/the-amd-radeon-r9-nano-review">AMD’s old R9 Nano</a>? Could Nvidia at least convince partners to produce two-slot GPUs like many of its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24039832/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">Founders Edition cards</a>? </p><p>Unfortunately, no. Nvidia’s just-announced “SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Cards” aren’t actually that small — even a 2.5 slot thick, 304mm long, and 151mm wide RTX 4070 can qualify. That means supposedly “SFF” GPUs will not fit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725010/ncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued">into my SFF case</a>, and I have a hard time calling these “SFF” at all. </p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s optional guidelines specify these maximum dimensions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This still looks like a pretty large case to me.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But if you, like me, want to help smaller gaming PCs get a larger foothold, this could<em> </em>help —  because it’s not just about the cards; it’s about knowing you can fit a certain amount of graphics horsepower in a given case because both the case and the card identify themselves as compatible with one another.</p><p>“I’m giving them a guideline to say, hey, leave this much space, and then you’ll be able to fit an enthusiast graphics card in there like a 4080, a 4070. That’s the purpose of this program,” Nvidia senior desktop products director Justin Walker tells me. </p><p>Indeed, the list of cards that Nvidia is sharing today only includes RTX 4070 or higher: it’s not promoting a fat 4060, for example.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a list of validated cards and cases so far. It’s not exhaustive, but these partners are on board.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Images: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Today, figuring out if a given card will fit is often a matter of painstakingly trolling manufacturer websites for length, width, and height <em>twice</em>: once for the card and once for the case. Now, you might just be able to look for “SFF-Ready” and move on with your day. You may still have to hit up those manufacturer websites, though, as Walker says there’s not necessarily going to be a Newegg sort filter for “SFF Ready” or a badge on the actual product yet.</p><p>He tells me these guidelines should reduce uncertainty for case manufacturers, too: “I’m making a small case, and I want it to fit a high end graphics card... right now I have no idea, there’s so many sizes and shapes. Right now I don’t know how to make a case that fits everything.” Now, there’s a target.</p><p>While I personally still wish Nvidia had tried harder to shrink the sizes of partner cards themselves — again, their own Founders Edition cards are generally just two slots thick! — there is some hope for more such GPUs. Walker says it’s no mistake that there’s only a single RTX 4080 on the SFF-Ready list, and he hopes more partners will rise to the challenge.</p><p>“It takes a lot of work and a very intentional design to put a 4080 in this form factor,” he says. “I get that it’s not a tiny Mini-ITX thing, but I want to let someone be able to put a 4080 into that case.”</p><p>Speaking of which: just a few days ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/kopite7kimi/status/1795710634820268111">hardware leaker kopite7kimi attested</a> that Nvidia’s RTX 5090 Founders Edition card will have a dual-slot cooler.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest is upon us, taking its rightful place as the de facto summer video game experience after the shuttering of E3 last year. </p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">As is also tradition, Keighley has released his annual “Geoff’s Trailer,” a hype real spliced together of the biggest and best announcements that fans can expect at <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/summer-game-fest-2024-exact-date-time-and-how-to-stream-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Summer Game Fest 2024: Geoff's Trailer (Watch Live Show This Friday in 4K!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZ2Clscn0Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">There’s not necessarily any surprises in the trailer, but it does do a good job of setting the tone fans can expect from the show. There is, of course, a <em>lot</em> of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> in here, which makes sense. The DLC is imminent, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/elden-ring/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>‘s premiere was at Keighley’s Game Awards broadcast, so it should have a big showing here. </p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">There are other, similarily big games featured, too, hinting we may see more over the next week. The trailer features glimpses of the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-window-trailer-and-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero</a></em> and what looks to be the next Batman game, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/first-new-batman-arkham-in-years-is-a-meta-exclusive-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta-exclusive </a><em><a href="batman: Arkham Shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a></em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">Summer Game Fest will air live on various platforms, including YouTube and Twitch, on Friday, June 7, at 5 PM ET/2 PM PT. The show will be a live production with trailers, reveals, and news of the biggest games from a plethora of devs. </p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">In addition to the main SGF show, there are a number of highly anticipated ancillary programs over the surrounding days, including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/devolver-direct-2024-when-and-where-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devolver Direct</a> and the much-hyped <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase + Call of Duty Direct</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">There will also be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-admits-its-making-a-new-console-in-the-most-casual-way-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some kind of Nintendo Direct</a> soon, though details remain scarce. Though Nintendo is unaffiliated with Summer Game Fest, they do tend to schedule their presentations around the same weekend, so it may be sooner rather than later. </p>

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A leak from a reasonably reliable source seems to hint that the Rabbids, Rayman’s iconic lagomorphic foils, could soon appear as a joinable faction in XDefiant. Where’s the limbless wonder when you need him?</p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">The leak comes to us courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/AgainTx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1795831710501982657%7Ctwgr%5Ec7ac00410ff2e9aac1f0a2285667ae623b3ae30f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwin.gg%2Fnews%2Fnew-xdefiant-factions-leak-shows-assassins-creed-rabbids-r6-sige%2F">AgainTx</a>, a data miner who has provided credible information about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/second-xdefiant-double-weapon-xp-event-weekend/">weapons, abilities, and features</a> that made their way into XDefiant after the game’s initial launch. According to AgainTx, the Rabbids are just one of several new factions that will debut in XDefiant’s second year. Many of these factions are <a href="https://www.vg247.com/xdefiant-leaks-future-factions-might-include-assassins-creed-rabbids">based on Ubisoft games that have not yet received any representation</a> in XDefiant, including Assassins Creed, Rainbow Six, and The Crew.</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, many of AgainTx’s posts regarding this potential leak have been taken down to do copywrite strikes made against them by Ubisoft. While this means I can’t technically back up AgainTx’s claims, the fact that Ubisoft is going out of its way to censor their content does lend an air of credibility to them and their work.</p> <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="942" data-injectable="true">If this leak turns out to be accurate, I’m amazed it’s taken this long for the Rabbids to appear in XDefiant. The Rabbids have come a long way since their debut in Rayman: Raving Rabbids back on the Wii, to the point where they’ve effectively become the unofficial Ubisoft mascots. While I’m not afraid to admit that I feel the Rabbids’ whole “so-random” schtick is a little played out, I’d be lying If I said I’m not excited by the sheer madness they could introduce into the straight-laced world of a first-person shooter like XDefiant.</p>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">Of course, this is still all speculation, and there is a real possibility that AgainTx will be proven wrong once XDefiant’s second year starts. Only time will tell, but it seems like this leak could be a fun, or at least funny, one if it turns out to be true.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168903/furiosa-villain-immortan-joe-actor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="t2gXIF">George Miller’s <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164264/furiosa-best-prequels-george-miller-mad-max-franchise">complements and enhances</a> the impact of his 2015 blockbuster <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a><em> </em>in a lot of ways, but there’s only one I can’t stop thinking about: How little the new movie has to say about Immortan Joe, the original movie’s iconic arch-villain. </p>
<p id="erCsDA">Sure, Joe’s lack of interaction with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24162575/anya-taylor-joy-furiosa-souvenir-prop-prosthetic-arm-chris-hemsworth">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>’s Furiosa could be simply because Hugh Keays-Byrne, the actor who first put Immortan Joe on the screen, died in 2020. Lachy Hulme assumes the role for <em>Furiosa</em>, but perhaps George Miller reduced it out of respect for Keays-Byrne, who he worked with for many years.</p>
<p id="dQcJNm">But I’m skeptical. Joe’s consistent secondary status in Furiosa’s origin story fits the overall themes of <em>Furiosa</em> too well to be a coincidence: Immortan Joe, the demon of Imperator Furiosa’s last stand, wasn’t her nemesis at all. In fact, he wasn’t her <em>anything</em>. </p>

<p id="E3pDWM">This is in great contrast to <em>Fury Road</em>, where their beef seems <em>deeply personal</em>. Max Rockatansky wanders into somebody else’s narrative in <em>Fury Road</em>, as his stories usually go. This time, those somebodies are Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and Immortan Joe. </p>
<p id="pBZqpR">While <em>Fury Road</em> only subtly hints that Furiosa was once one of Joe’s captive harem of wives and incubators — the white wrappings of Furiosa’s top evoke the Wives’ impractical shifts — Theron confirmed that piece of her backstory <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/05/14/mad-max-fury-road-charlize-theron-shaving-her-head-eating-dirt-and-being-part/">in interviews</a>. So Furiosa seems to have really personal reasons to hate Joe. And his response to her betrayal is presented as a towering rage, cresting mushroom cloud-like out of all proportion to her ability to withstand him. </p>
<p id="Qysz6h">Not to diminish the agency of the Five Wives in their own escape, but Joe considers them property that’s been stolen from him, not allies who betrayed him. Furiosa, however, he considers a traitor, worthy of his personal anger. And in the end, she’s the one who gets the honor of finally taking him down, underscoring her place on the same narrative level he occupies as <em>Fury Road</em>’s primary villain. </p>
<p id="bMELcL">Which is why it’s so wild that <em>Furiosa</em> says, quietly and implacably throughout its entire run time, that Joe actually isn’t even a main character in her story. Sure, he buys her, but then he forgets she even existed. He didn’t take anything from her that hadn’t already been taken, didn’t teach her anything she hadn’t already learned from someone else, didn’t give her anything she hadn’t already taken for herself. When they do share scenes, and even trade dialogue, there’s no interpersonal ire or affection in either direction. In spite of their characters’ intensity, Hulme and Taylor-Joy keep a neutral distance of emotion. </p>
<p id="IEnILb">It turns out, in <em>Furiosa</em>, that Furiosa’s life was actually framed by the completely different, utterly pathetic figure of Dementus, the Wasteland warlord who tortured her mother to death, sold Furiosa into slavery, killed her closest friend, and cost her her right arm. And just as emphatically, <em>Furiosa</em> says, Furiosa moved beyond revenge years before she ever stood against Joe. </p>
<p id="XDc91n">What you saw in <em>Fury Road</em>, <em>Furiosa</em> says, was the furthest thing from personal to Furiosa. Immortan Joe was never The Guy. He was just <em>the guy in the way</em>. And the “guy” part might be the most important one.</p>

</p>
<p id="VRPMea">The conversation that immediately surrounded <em>Fury Road</em> was about Immortan Joe as a Wasteland illustration of the death cult of capitalism and toxic masculinity. His very recognizable philosophy reduces all non-elites to things — women to Wives (sex slaves, forcibly impregnated) or Mothers (enslaved to produce breast milk for food), and men to War Boys (emphasis on <em>boys</em>), interchangeable cannon fodder addicted to the lie that they can only find purpose in violence for the True Leader. </p>
<p id="bLCboE">This was all emphasized by the emasculating nature of Furiosa’s rebellion. After all, by the language of a country-and-Western song, she’s wounded him in the most devastating way a man can be wounded, by stealing his wife (Wives), his money (water), his car (the War Rig), and maybe even his dog (Nicholas Hoult’s hapless character Nux, if we want to stretch the metaphor a little bit). </p>
<p id="rdDnNq">Immortan Joe is an electrifying villain, and <em>Furiosa</em> doesn’t exactly skimp on him! A scene contrasting Dementus’ shaky appeal to the self-interest of the masses with the unshakable belief created by Joe’s death-cult propaganda is among the film’s most chilling. But there is an eternal risk in presenting such an operatic villain who also represents such a wide-ranging theme. If you’re not careful, making them powerful and capable enough to claim villain status also risks making them look aspirational. You can swing right around to <a href="https://collider.com/darth-vaders-most-cool-bad-ass-moments/">making them seem cool</a>. </p>
<p id="ZDZL78">Which is why it’s so damn smart of <em>Furiosa</em> to put this final nail in the coffin of Joe’s emasculation, by establishing that <em>Fury Road</em>’s sense of personal beef was all on Joe — on <em>his</em> fear, and <em>his</em> vulnerability, not on Furiosa’s. He isn’t even important<em> to the woman who’s unmanning him</em>. </p>
<p id="m6TZKd">In a cliche reversal for the cinematic ages, Immortan Joe was, for Furiosa, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjZ5I8l32CI">just Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="125" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Fans who were looking forward to <em>Little Nightmares III</em> will unfortunately have to hold on, as the game has now been delayed. </p> <p data-characters="150" data-current-count="150" data-injectable="false">In a post on the official <em>Little Nightmares</em> Twitter, developer Supermassive Games revealed the game was being delayed, and would now release in 2025. </p> <figure data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">“As much as we can’t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves.” Supermassive <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> in the statement. “Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we’ve made the decision to shift the game to 2025.”</p> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">“We’ll be sharing more about <em>Little Nightmares III</em> later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.” the developer promised. </p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false"><em>Little Nightmares III</em> was announced in 2023 with a 2024 release window. It is the first in the franchise to be developed by Supermassive. The game will follow two young protagonists, Low and Alone, as they explore a haunting 2.5D world that focuses on exploration, platforming, and puzzles. </p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">The previous games in the franchise were developed by Swedish-based Tarsier Studios, who had to leave the franchise when they were acquired by Embracer Group after the release of <em>Little Nightmares II</em>. Tarsier Studios does not currently have an announced project. </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false"><em>Little Nightmares</em> has been a cherished franchise since its 2017 launch. The original game followed Six, a girl who had to escape the horrifying vessel known as The Maw. Though Six retuned for 2021’s <em>Little Nightmares II</em>, the character and compatriot Mono do not appear to be returning for <em>Little Nightmares III</em>. </p>

<p data-characters="198" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-1-0-release-date-full-roster-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunch of <em>Multiversus</em></a> has already been a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-fans-are-split-on-jasons-ridiculously-chunky-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly divisive affair</a>, but fans took note that the game was missing some features. However, the dev assures the game is bringing those features back. </p> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="164" data-injectable="false">Several features that were available in what PlayerFirst and the community are generously calling the Beta were missing, which obviously rubbed fans the wrong way. </p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">But Tony Huynh, the co-founder of Player 1st Games, took to social media to assure fans that those features would be restored soon. </p>  <figure data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks you for the feedback! The team is hard at work on it. Some of the missing settings and features from the open beta are incoming, team colors, end of game stats, swapping side and neutral attack, adjustable input buffer settings, etc. More info soon!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/multiversus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#multiversus</a></p>— Tony Huynh (@Tony_Huynh) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1796903398920581259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">“Many of these features are currently implemented and are in testing and we had planned, but were left out due to time as we had to rebuild every screen and feature again to support our new netcode and Unreal Engine 5 switch.” Huynh revealed on his <a href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1796903400497684726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter/X</a> account. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">When <em>Multiversus</em> finally returned after its long hiatus, fans were quick to note features were missing that had added to the game’s online multiplayer. These components included leaderboards, match stats, a co-op vs AI mode, and a <em>Smash Bros</em>-like free-for-all mode that added random items. </p>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">Also missing was the ability to play as an unowned character in training mode. Without this option, players are left with no means of test-driving a new character without unlocking them.</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="false">In their place was a brand new season pass with unlockables and a new single-player driven “Rift” mode. The reception to the new <em>Multiversus</em> has been fairly mixed, but hopefully this is just a small bump for this already controversial game. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-top-5-best-call-of-duty-zombies-celebrity-guest-stars.887580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-top-5-best-call-of-duty-zombies-celebrity-guest-stars/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-top-5-best-call-of-duty-zombies-celebrity-guest-stars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="383" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">What started out as a little bonus mode in 2008’s <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em> has become a global phenomenon. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-call-of-duty-zombies-modes-ranked/"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s <em>Zombies</em> mode</a> is a staple of the franchise, with complex lore, a sprawling multiverse, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-cod-zombies-maps-ranked/">varied maps</a>, and numerous now-iconic original characters behind it. Not to mention, more than a few celebrity guests have gotten in on the zombie-killing action.</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">While the likes of Tank Dempsey (Steve Blum), Dr. Edward Richtofen (Nolan North), and Samantha Maxis (Julie Nathanson) have carried the mode from game to game, several notable pop culture favorites have briefly come along for the ride. Malcolm McDowell, Jeff Goldblum, the late Ray Liotta, and more have featured in the mode, and that’s just in Treyarch’s titles. Sledgehammer Games’ <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em> and <em>Call of Duty: WWII</em> boast celebrity guest stars of their own.</p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">While every celebrity cameo in the <em>Call of Duty Zombies</em> lineage has been fun, some are just a bit more special and noteworthy than others. Here are the top five best the Treyarch franchise has offered up to date.</p>  <figure data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-helena-bonham-carter-as-madame-mirela" data-injectable="false">5. Helena Bonham-Carter as Madame Mirela</h2> <p data-characters="556" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em>‘s<em> Dead of the Night</em> takes players to the manor of skilled archaeologist Alistair Rhodes (Charles Dennis), where all kinds of paranormal entities threaten the lives of those present. Alongside Gideon Jones (Kiefer Sutherland), Jonathan Warwick (Brian Blessed), and Godfrey (Charles Dance) is Christina Fowler, aka Madame Mirela, as portrayed in voice and likeness by Helena Bonham-Carter. She turns in a solid vocal performance here, and considering her entertainment track record, she was a perfect fit for the <em>Zombies</em> mode.</p>
 <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Bonham-Carter has made a career out of taking projects of the supernatural and macabre variety. <em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</em>, <em>Corpse Bride</em>, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and more fill her filmography. She’s also among director Tim Burton’s most frequent collaborators, in addition to being his former romantic partner. Bonham-Carter took the role of Mirela seriously, too, telling <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/games/2464098/how-helena-bonham-carter-changed-her-call-of-duty-black-ops-4-character">CinemaBlend</a> that she personally crafted Mirela’s accent and channeled Mrs. Lovett, her <em>Sweeney Todd</em> character, to get her <em>Dead of the Night</em> performance just right.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-ron-perlman-as-floyd-campbell" data-injectable="false">4. Ron Perlman as Floyd Campbell</h2> <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="871" data-injectable="true">Kicking off <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em>‘s <em>Zombies</em> mode, Treyarch put its latest celebrity-loaded map at the forefront. <em>Shadows of Evil </em>takes place in the run-down, paranormal Morgue City, where seedy inhabitants do vile things to get ahead. One of these individuals is Floyd Campbell: a washed-up boxer who’s willing to kill if it means getting to the top of his profession. Ultimately, he pays the price for his underhanded tactics. Ron Perlman’s unmistakable face and rumbling voice couldn’t be more suitable for the grizzled journeyman fighter.</p>
 <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">Much like Bonham-Carter, Perlman is no stranger to odd, paranormal fictional universes. He’s a mainstay in the works of director Guillermo del Toro, from <em>Cronos</em> to <em>Hellboy</em>, where strange is the name of the game. The surreal French fantasy flick <em>The City of Lost Children</em>, starring Perlman as carnival strongman One, also boasts a similar aesthetic to <em>Shadows of Evil</em>. All of this experience, coupled with the fact that Perlman told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7xcra2x6fs">IGN</a> he’d always wanted to play a boxer in some form, drove home the fact that no one could play Campbell quite like him.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-joe-pantoliano-as-al-the-weasel-arlington" data-injectable="false">3. Joe Pantoliano as Al “The Weasel” Arlington</h2> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="831" data-injectable="true">One of, if not the absolute best <em>Zombies</em> map to date, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em>‘s <em>Mob of the Dead</em> features four mobsters attempting to escape Alcatraz Island via a shoddily-built plane. Not only are they unsuccessful, but they’re trapped in a time loop, forcing them to fend off endless waves of zombies, die, and repeat their failure over and over again for eternity. The mastermind of their initial escape plan is Al “The Weasel” Arlington, modeled after and voiced by Joe Pantoliano to utter perfection.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">In a cast chock-full of crime genre legends, Pantoliano very much stands out as <em>Mob of the Dead</em>‘s MVP. The <em>Sopranos</em>, <em>Matrix</em>, and <em>Bad Boys</em> actor was a prime choice to bring out Weasel’s meek and insecure yet innovative and intelligent personality. It’s just too bad that when the character returns in <em>Black Ops 4</em>‘s <em>Blood of the Dead</em>, he only does so as a bird in spirit form, thus preventing Pantoliano from getting another shot at the role.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-danny-trejo-as-himself" data-injectable="false">2. Danny Trejo as Himself</h2> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of the Dead</em> from <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops I</em> is the first <em>Call of Duty Zombies</em> map to feature a celebrity cast, and it goes all-out. When their horror film set is overrun, Robert Englund, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Michael Rooker have to fight off waves of zombies in the middle of Siberia. Danny Trejo joins them, signature machetes in hand, to slaughter the incoming undead. All four actors thrive with the material provided, but Trejo takes it to another level as only he can.</p>
 <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">To say that the <em>Machete</em> and <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em> actor brings enthusiasm and gusto to the project would be a massive understatement. Trejo put his all into his lines, bringing a bit of comedy as well as plenty of badassery to match his tattooed, weaponed-up character model. The actor told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M9lIk19EyI">XboxViewTV</a> all about his experience working on <em>Call of the Dead</em> back in 2011, and while he’s not much of a gamer himself, it’s abundantly clear that he had a ton of passion for the endeavor.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-george-a-romero-as-himself" data-injectable="false">1. George A. Romero as Himself</h2> <p data-characters="619" data-current-count="919" data-injectable="true">Continuing on with <em>Call of the Dead</em>, it’s worth remembering who was directing the film that Trejo, Rooker, Englund, and Gellar were working on when they were ambushed by the undead. That person was none other than George A. Romero, who’s overpowered by zombies during the intro cutscene and turned into one himself. Throughout the game, he wanders the map with a stage light in hand and loads of one-liners. If you make Romero mad, he’ll fly into a rage, sprinting after you with his weapon of choice. All in all, there’s not a single soul more fitting to appear in a <em>Call of Duty</em> map than him. </p>
 <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">Romero is single-handedly responsible for crafting the modern image of a zombie through revolutionary films like <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>. Even years after his death in 2017, he continues to inspire the horror genre and those working within it. <em>Zombies</em> simply wouldn’t exist without Romero, so it’s only right that the visionary director was included in what has become one of the mode’s most beloved maps.</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">For those unaware, <em>Black Ops 4</em>‘s <em>Tag Der Toten</em>, a <em>Call of the Dead</em> reimagining, features Romero’s signature glasses sitting on a table. This is both a fun <em>Call of the Dead</em> Easter egg and a tribute to the man who paved the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-games-based-on-movies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-best-games-based-on-movies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="246" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There was a time when movies based on games and games based on movies were tied in terms of suckage, but we started to see a bunch of fantastic games based on movies long before we saw great game-to-movie or TV series adaptations such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fallout-characters-in-the-amazon-series-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout.</a></em></p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">That’s because there’s no actual curse regarding video game adaptations — so long as the game studios get the budget, time, and artistic liberty required to make them. Here are the games that will bring you the closest to actually living in the world of your favorite movies.</p>  <figure data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">The Thing</h2> <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">If you’re sad about that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/shame-we-never-got-the-thing-as-a-point-and-click-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Thing</em></a>‘s 2011 prequel which threw away the practical effects of the original in favor of <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/the-thing-prequel-director-regrets-using-heavy-cgi-and-shares-details-on-scrapped-sequel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wonky CGI</a>, then the video game might prove a good alternative for you. Sure, it features even more computed-generated imagery than the infamous sequel, but it does a great job of putting you in the action of a situation similar to the events of the original classic. 2002’s The Thing video game even features mechanics that add a lot of replay value by always keeping players guessing who the thing might be. It’s like living that masterfully chilling final scene — for eternity.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Star Wars Episode I: Racer</h2> <p data-characters="594" data-current-count="894" data-injectable="true">A lot of people seem to have changed their minds regarding the prequel trilogy when they saw the sequel trilogy. I’ll meet them halfway and admit that <em>Episode I</em> is a good movie — if the only part of it that you recall is the podracer scene. It’s well-directed, features some great effects, and, weirdest of all, for something out of the prequels, it’s thrilling. LucasArts had the genius idea of just excising this gem imprisoned in that terrible movie and giving it room to breathe and grow. Why is Disney yet to make a series about podracing, or, better yet, another game?</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via WB</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max</h2> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true">Even though it came out just a few months after the massive <em>Mad Max: Fury Road,</em> the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mad-max/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Max</a> </em>video game failed to gain the traction that I believe it deserved among gamers — likely because it came out on the same day as <em>Metal Gear Solid V</em> . It made driving around the wasteland a surprisingly smooth experience, gave players a way to stay in that wicked universe outside of just having them rewatch the movie until the end of times, and even enriched <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the canon</a> with elements we’d later see in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mad-max-movies-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Furiosa.</em> </a></p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Sadly, director George Miller <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/george-miller-didnt-2015-mad-162604475.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t too keen on it</a> and has said that he’d like to see Hideo Kojima taking a stab at a <em>Mad Max </em>game, but I think he’s underestimating this gem by Avalanche.</p>  <figure data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Alien: Isolation</h2> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">A considerable number of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-horror-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien</a></em> fans consider James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> superior to the original film. I believe that the only work in the franchise capable of rivaling the original is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-alien-isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a>. It makes the Xenomorph scarier than any other <em>Alien</em> property as it puts you in a maze as the prey with your wits as the only weapon on hand. </p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Bonus points for a mechanic where the game uses your microphone to detect any noises you make and alert the Xenomorph. Turns out someone can hear you scream in space, and that somehow makes it worse.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by FOX</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</h2> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"><em>The Chronicles of Riddick</em>‘s tie-in came out in 2004. This means that the FPS that was already <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/butcher-bay-sold-purely-on-word-of-mouth-better-than-word-of-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting an uphill</a> battle because of the whack property it was connected to even had to face off against the likes of <em>Doom 3, Far Cry, Halo 2, </em>and <em>Half-Life 2.</em> </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">Miraculously, <em>Butcher Bay</em> is an order of magnitude above the movie that spawned it and also one that held its own in the best year in the history of FPS titles. You won’t find any groundbreaking gravity gun action in here, but the first-person stealth gameplay rivals that of the <em>Thief</em> and the <em>Dishonored</em> series.</p>  <figure data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Goldeneye 007</h2> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">You’ve probably heard of this one because it’s one of the greatest games of all time. Whether you’re more about wanting to be James Bond on a campaign to save the world or want to have some of the best split-screen action ever put on a split-screen, this is the one for you. </p> <p data-characters="91" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Many have tried to recapture <em>Goldeneye 007’s</em> magic, but only <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-split-screen-games-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very few have succeeded.</a></p>  <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Aspyr Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic</h2> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">Many games have already proven that the best way to adapt <em>Star Wars</em> is to ignore the source material and forge your own path ahead. <em>KOTOR</em> is the best example of the bunch, as it goes four thousand years into the past to tell a tale better than what we saw in most of the films. </p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">No other <em>Star Wars</em> film, game or TV series has ever done such a great job of making you feel like a true Jedi or Sith. Unfortunately, it seems like it’ll stay that way for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Spiderman 2 (2004) - Still the best web-swinging." width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikiuidSRcTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-spider-man-2" data-injectable="false">Spider-Man 2</h2> <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true"><em>GTA 3</em> changed the entire landscape with its 3d free-roaming, and few games benefitted more than the <em>Spider-Man</em> series. </p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">The leap between the video game adaptation of the original <em>Spider-Man</em> game to the second was enormous, with most of it coming from ditching the regular level system in favour of allowing players to freely web-swing around a pretty good rendition of New York City. Even today, Spider-Man 2’s web-swinging is incredibly fun. </p> <figure data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Westwood</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Blade Runner</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"><em>Blade Runner</em> was a flop when it was released in 1983, only finding its true audience with later releases, like the 1992 Director’s Cut. Despite this, 1997 saw Westwood making the counterintuitive decision of braving through hell to make their own video game adaptation. The company ended up revolutionizing both the gameplay and look of point-and-click adventure games.</p> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">My only gripe with the <em>Blade Runner</em> video game is that it sometimes sticks too closely to the film even though it supposedly tells a new story. Still, at least it mimics one of the greatest films of all time.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by LucasArts</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Indiana Jones and The Fate Of Atlantis</h2> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">One of the best things about being a gamer is that you don’t have to be as disappointed at <em>Indiana Jones</em> as movie fans. Not crazy about <em>Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull</em> or <em>Dial of Destiny</em>? Then perhaps you’ll be happy with one of the excellent video game releases. </p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">1992 saw the release of <em>Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis</em>, a point-and-click adventure title made in the old LucasArts SCUMM engines. Quite simply, <em>Fate of Atlantis</em> is possibly as good as <em>Raiders Of The Lost Ark</em> and perhaps better than <em>Temple Of Doom</em> or <em>Last Crusade</em>. An excellent game that filled a gap when there was no new Indy for a long, long time. </p>

            <p>"Come one, come all" – Diablo 4 is about to celebrate its first anniversary, and Blizzard has "a goblin's heap of rewards" to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>As a thank you "for being part of the Diablo community through another year of fighting back the demonic forces of Hell", the March of the Goblins will kick off next week across both Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal, which is also marking its second anniversary.</p>

<p>First off, you can claim a free cosmetic gift from the Shop in Diablo 4 from 6th June, and you'll have "until 20th June to claim all of these gifts". At the same time, you'll see a boost in Treasure Goblin activity across the Sanctuary, "with Horadric scholars foretelling the contents of their greed-filled bags rumoured to be richer than ever before".</p>
<p>"The townsfolks are predicting that greed shrines will appear with increased frequency, bolstering the riches of these shrewd goblins. Even stranger still, while in Dungeons, Goblins are supposedly appearing in pairs… with some tall tales insisting an even larger pack of them together," the team teases in a lengthy <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24096024/celebrate-the-diablo-anniversary-with-march-of-the-goblins">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>But that's not all. During the "anniversary edition of Mother's Blessing", you can earn a 25 percent XP bonus and a 50 percent multiplicative increase in gold, too, for a full 10 days.</p>
<p>"Lilith blesses all her children, as this bonus applies to both Seasonal and Eternal Realms, and all World Tiers," the post explains. "This bonus also stacks, so pair it with Elixirs and the Urn of Aggression to maximize your experience gains while killing Monsters. Use this limited-time boost to carve through ranks of the Battle Pass, climb to higher Levels and World Tiers with burning swiftness, complete your Season Journey, and level multiple characters to their maximum potential."</p>
<p>As for Diablo Immortal? From 6th June until the end of the month, you'll be able to loot treasure in the Trial of Plunder and take on Diablo 4's Avarice in the Gold-Cursed Goliath boss fight. And the goblins are marching through Immortal, too, offering anniversary-themed weekly tasks to boost your gold and progression.</p>
<p>"The Gold-Cursed will not be easily felled in his rampage," Blizzard explains. "Competing in the Trial of Plunder has a chance to earn you a Gold-Cursed Portal, which can be used to summon a portal that teleports you to Avarice immediately. There is also a chance to encounter a Gold-Cursed Portal randomly in the wild, teleporting you directly to slay this greedy behemoth."</p>
<p>Players will also be able to claim a "mysterious band news quality 2, five-star Stormvault Legendary Gem", too.</p>
<p>For the full rundown, head on over to the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24096024/celebrate-the-diablo-anniversary-with-march-of-the-goblins">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst the franchise has long been associated with its dedicated PC fanbase, an email sent from Xbox president Sarah Bond in April intimated that Diablo 4 – which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">acquired by Microsoft as part of its $68.7m acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, of course – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-the-number-one-platform-for-diablo-4-players-says-xbox-president">is more popular on the Xbox console system</a>, even though the RPG is also available on PC and PlayStation consoles, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2’s</a></em>&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>expansion is just a few days away, and alongside everything new coming to the game, the existing status quo will change. Some Exotic armor effects are due for tweaks, both to support the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/we-now-know-all-of-destiny-2s-prismatic-subclass-abilities/">new Prismatic Subclass</a> and to adjust the meta as needed.</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Bungie has been using the window up to&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape’s</em>&nbsp;release to highlight how&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>would change. The studio has already detailed some&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-new-exotic-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Exotics</a>&nbsp;and what players could expect from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-weapons-and-perks-will-change-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons in the new expansion</a>, and now it’s showing the alterations being made to existing Exotic armor.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">General changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">While most of the changes to Exotic armor affect the Class that can use the item, Bungie outlined a few alterations that would hit on a more global scale. The first of these is simple, but it helps meld more Exotic effects into the new Prismatic Subclass. Exotic effects that require a specific Subclass element will only need a matching Super in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. This opens up buildcrafting opportunities, as Prismatic won’t technically be any one element.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">A welcome update to all Exotic armor is that the gear will support an Artifice slot in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. Traditionally, Artifice armor could only be earned in Dungeons on Master difficulty, but more recently, Bungie extended the offering to the Competitive PvP playlist. The bonus slot on this gear allows players to add a zero-cost +3 boost to any chosen stat. Guardians will be able to Masterwork Exotic armor as usual and then purchase the Artifice slot for 1 Exotic Cipher and 10,000 Glimmer.</p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Ammo Finder armor mods are also set to see a slight change. As they are, a player’s death resets progress toward another ammo drop, making reliable gains difficult for those who die frequently. Bungie is altering the effect to persist through death but compensating by increasing the number of kills to create an ammo drop. As another small bonus, the unique Raid mods only available on Raid armor will be free to equip in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Warlock</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Mantle of Battle Harmony&nbsp;</strong>– This Exotic has always had a pretty solid effect, increasing Super energy gained while uncharged and then switching to an elemental damage buff matching Subclass choice. The 2-second cooldown between Super energy gains will be removed, and more Super energy will be granted based on the type of enemy defeated.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Ballidorse Wrathweavers</strong>&nbsp;– Ballidorse Wrathweavers will still improve Shatter damage for the Winter’s Wrath Super, and it will also provide max stacks of Frost Armor to nearby allies. The user gets Frost Armor once the Super ends and Rifts also grant full stacks of Frost Armor when using the Frostpulse Aspect.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Secant Filaments</strong>&nbsp;– The Exotic already grants Devour when using a Warlock Rift and allows Guardians to disrupt enemies from within the Rift. Now, Secant Filaments will also refresh the Devour buff when reentering the Rift.</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Verity’s Brow</strong>&nbsp;– The effect is unchanged, providing a grenade damage buff and offering grenade energy, but instead of triggering from elemental weapon kills tied to a Guardian’s Subclass, it will now function off of elemental weapon kills tied to grenade choice.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Sunbracers</strong>&nbsp;– Sunbracers allows players to throw multiple Solar grenades after eliminating a foe with a powered melee charge. Now, the number of possible grenades has decreased from 5 to 4, and each Solar only lasts an additional 2 seconds, down from 4.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Cenotaph Mask</strong>&nbsp;– This Exotic quickly became popular, allowing Warlocks to generate ammo for their team by marking Champions or other formidable adversaries with trace rifle fire. Players can no longer trigger Cenotaph Mask’s effects multiple times on a single target, and the visual mark indicator will now be hidden from the user.</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Titan</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Ursa Furiosa</strong>&nbsp;– In addition to its existing effects buffing the Sentinal Shield Super and refunding Super energy based on guarded damage, Ursa Furiosa will allow Guardians to move faster while guarding with the new Unbreakable Void Aspect and reward scaled Super energy for blocking damage.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Eternal Warrior</strong>&nbsp;– Eternal Warrior remains largely unchanged except for removing the requirement to run an Arc Subclass.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Armamentarium</strong>&nbsp;– Besides the existing effect that adds an extra grenade charge, the Exotic will also grant Orbs of Power for grenade kills.</li> </ul>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Khepri’s Horn</strong>&nbsp;– Khepri’s Horn provides Barricade energy for Solar kills, and Barricades send forth a returning Scorching wave. The wave has been improved, increasing PvE damage by 100%, applying Scorch each time it hits foes, and working with both Ember of Eruption and Ember of Ashes.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Heart of Inmost Light</strong>&nbsp;– Hear of Inmost Light’s functionality is unchanged, buffing players’ other two abilities after using one. However, its three buffs have been consolidated to save UI space.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Synthoceps</strong>&nbsp;– This exotic still buffs Handling and Reload Speed on top of granting a melee and Super damage bonus when surrounded. That said, Bungie decreased the time the buffs remain active from 8 seconds to 5.</li> </ul>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Severance Enclosure&nbsp;</strong>– Severance Enclosure creates an explosion when defeating enemies with a powered melee, amplifying the effect with Finishers or against more difficult enemies. Bungie tweaked the effect only to go off after players spend a melee charge to eliminate an enemy. The explosions now also require line of sight to trigger, and knockback has been lessened.</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-hunter" data-injectable="false">Hunter</h2> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Assassin’s Cowl&nbsp;</strong>– Like Severance Enclosure, Assassin’s Cowl will also require an expended melee charge to trigger its effects. However, those effects remain unchanged, granting invisibility, health, and shields after players use a powered melee to defeat an enemy.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Triton Vice&nbsp;</strong>– Triton Vice buffs glaives, increasing damage and reload speed when enemies are nearby. Glaive melee kills overflow the weapon, and projectile kills cause a detonation. Bungie is removing the previous requirement for the glaive to match Guardians’ Subclass for the projectile detonations to function. Additionally, the buffs granted for being surrounded will linger for 5 seconds.</li> </ul>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>The Dragon’s Shadow</strong>&nbsp;– This Exotic lets a Hunter dodge reload all weapons, buffing movement speed, and weapon handling. It will also apply its effects when using Ensnaring Slam or the upcoming Ascension Arc Aspect.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Foetracer</strong>&nbsp;– Currently, Foetracer grants a weapon matching the element of your Subclass a damage bonus when players damage an enemy with an ability. It also creates elemental pickups when enemies are defeated using a weapon that’s the same element as your Subclass. In&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, Foetracer will function based on the element of the ability used rather than the equipped Subclass.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>The Sixth Coyote</strong>&nbsp;– This Exotic grants another charge of dodge. Bungie has updated The Sixth Coyote to include the Reaper armor mod, granting Orbs of Power when players eliminate a foe after dodging.</li> </ul>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Renewal Grasps</strong>&nbsp;– Renewal Grasps increase the size of the Duskfield grenade effect, reducing damage to allies and making enemies deal decreased damage. Bungie is updating Renewal Grasps to incorporate Frost Armor, replacing the generic damage reduction. Players will gain one stack of Frost Armor upon entering the Duskfield grenade and an additional stack every 0.9 seconds.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Star-Eater Scales</strong>&nbsp;– This Exotic allows players to earn more Super energy from Orbs of Power and Orbs of Power collected while at full Super energy provide a damage buff, overshield, and healing when the Super is cast. This can stack up to four times. For<em>&nbsp;The Final Shape</em>, Bungie tweaked Star-Eater Scales, making the full buff effects require 6 Orbs of Power pickups while at full Super energy, up from four. The Super energy gained from Orbs of Power while using the Golden Gun Super has decreased from 2% to 0.5%.</li> </ul>

  <p id="rE75RJ">How do you top something that’s already ridiculously, joyfully, emphatically over the top? That’s the big existential question George Miller faced in making <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em></a>, the hard-charging prequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. The first film is maximalist to a fault, with screaming, bald, white-painted War Boys gleefully spray-painting their teeth chrome before throwing themselves to their deaths, and chase after chase featuring a giant War Rigs and nigh-infinite smaller vehicles covered in skulls, chains, creepy dolls, and anything else the designers could graft on.</p>
<p id="Ln9UN0">But nothing in the movie is more over the top than the Doof Warrior, the fan-favorite hard-rocker who bungie-hops around a giant stack of speakers, dressed in red long johns and his <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller">dead mother’s face</a>, wielding a fire-spitting guitar as he plays sick licks to inspire Immortan Joe’s hyped-up collection of Valhalla-minded dummies to go even harder in combat. Recently, a group of Polygon staffers were discussing <em>Furiosa</em>, and someone asked, “Who’s the Doof Warrior equivalent in this movie?”</p>
<p id="RKgotJ">The most obvious answer is that there isn’t one — at least, there isn’t someone who’s ridiculous in the same way and on the same level. But one of the best things about <em>Furiosa</em> is that Miller isn’t just trying to copycat himself, so he doesn’t, say, throw a flame-spewing brass band into his new movie to up the ante on something that was already perfect. But in terms of who <em>Furiosa</em>’s breakout character might be — who might inspire fan art and fan engagement, once more people have seen the movie — well, we’ve got different opinions on that one. Witness us!</p>

<p id="yeJ5pH">Jack is in some ways the exact opposite of the Doof Warrior — quiet where DW is showy, content to disappear into a crowd instead of living for the spectacle, and a much more stylish dresser. (Red PJs are <em>so</em> pre-apocalypse.) But I think he may be the character who goes the distance in the fandom, because like the Doof Warrior, he stands out as radically different from everyone else. There’s just so little space in the Mad Maxiverse for people who do their jobs without yelling about it constantly and trying to make every success seem bigger and more praiseworthy than it actually is.</p>
<p id="HvXoFO">And his connection with Furiosa seems designed to leave a mark on viewers — maybe even a bigger mark than it leaves on Furiosa herself. She’s so revenge-driven that she doesn’t have much room in her life for other people, but she makes room for Praetorian Jack, maybe because he’s polite enough not to take up more space there than she’s willing to give. There isn’t a lot of space in the Wasteland for tenderness or compassion, either, as Dementus tells us. The fact that Praetorian Jack manages to bring that into the franchise, too, makes him memorable even as one of the series’ most undemanding characters. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="WAvtOV">The only thing the Wastelanders of the Mad Max franchise respect more than power and violence is branding. Surviving on the Fury Road is all about picking a theme, scrapping together a cool costume, and giving yourself a nutso name that people are too scared not to call you. And the person who does all that the best in <em>Furiosa </em>is the Octoboss. </p>
<p id="8pQF36">Dementus’ onetime ally, who eventually makes it clear that he’s out for his own gains instead, fills all the criteria of one of the Wasteland’s great weirdos. He’s got a terrific helmet, pitch-black and probably impossible to see out of, with towering horns that surely affect his balance, and a squad of loyal riders who will die at his command. But just as importantly, he also knows how to go out like a badass. Sure, he gets shredded at the end of his ill-fated attempt at conquest, but God, what a beautiful, tentacle-y mess he leaves behind him! As an added bonus, his octopus costume also gives us one of the movie’s most stunning visual moments, and one of the clearest indicators that Miller is going for something far more painterly and strange than the look he attempted in <em>Fury Road</em>. —<em>Austen Goslin </em></p>

<p id="3LpqMd">Quaden Bayles’ War Pup has just one job: He runs the Bommyknocker, the contraption attached to the rear of the War Rig. Immortan Joe’s mechanics are very proud of the Bommyknocker, and when it hits the road for the first time, War Pup is excited to finally use this ultimate weapon on the Fury Road — which is relatable, because I spent that whole sequence similarly excited about eventually seeing what the Bommyknocker could do! But in the Wasteland, we’re all punchlines. Right when it’s time to finally use the Bommyknocker, War Pup takes a bullet to the brain, and he never gets to see how freaking metal it is in action. </p>
<p id="H53Z80">To me, War Pup is most like the Doof Warrior in that he has a very specific function that the audience is hyped to see, but he also seems much more interesting than the limited role he has in the Wasteland. Maybe we’ll learn more about him in some form or another eventually, but meanwhile, the actor who plays him has a story that lives up to the hype. Bayles went viral in 2020 after a bullying incident, picked on for his achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. When Bayles’ story was noticed by Australian news media, <a href="https://ew.com/movies/george-miller-bullied-australian-boy-furiosa/">Miller reached out to give him a small role</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23321766/three-thousand-years-of-longing-review-george-miller-mad-max-fury-road"><em>Three Thousand Years of Longing</em></a> — and liked him enough to keep working with him on <em>Furiosa</em>. Witness him! —<em>Joshua Rivera </em></p>

            <p>Embark has pushed out a hotfix for The Finals, addressing the extraordinarily frustrating exploit that enabled players to track opponents through walls.</p>
<p>In a brief update on the <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/2104">official website</a>, the team said the update was designed "for many of the issues introduced in Update 2.10.0" earlier in the week, starting with the broken aim assist to "prevent tracking enemy contestants through objects such as walls, terrain, etc".</p>

<p>The hotfix also fixes enemy healthbars – they were not only persisting on screen longer than intended, but also popped up through walls and terrain, too – and another issue where players <em>couldn't</em> track contracts in rookie/challenger/pro/master circuits.</p>
<p>The team has also reverted a change that removed directional weapon binding for controllers, and fixed the incorrect message that pops up when players are "restricted from playing". The update also addresses another exploit wherein players could fire the FAMAS, Throwing Knives, and the R93 (among other weapons) "at a much higher rate" "during animation cancelling".</p>
<p>The Finals seemed to get off to a strong start when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-the-finals-has-stealth-dropped-and-is-available-right-now">surprise-launched in December</a> last year - its 5v5 action proving popular enough that its developer, Nexon subsidiary Embark Studios, quickly found itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-ups-anti-cheat-measures-following-popular-launch">scrambling to deal with an influx of cheaters</a>. Since then, however, the destruction-focused free-to-play shooter has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destructive-shooter-the-finals-hasnt-performed-as-well-as-expected-says-publisher">"lower than expected" performance</a> according to publisher Nexon, contributing to a shortfall in its forecast revenue.</p>
<p>"Embark Studios' multiplayer shooter dazzles in the moment, but its AI voices are symptomatic of a broader issue with artistic vision", wrote contributor Rick Lane in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-review-mechanically-thrilling-thematically-wanting">three star review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169568/microsoft-copilot-plus-gaming-pc-nvidia-amd<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia and AMD are gearing up to launch gaming laptops that include the AI Copilot Plus features that Microsoft just announced for Qualcomm-powered laptops. At Computex today, Nvidia briefly teased that “RTX AI PC” laptops are on the way from Asus and MSI that will eventually include Copilot Plus PC features.</p><p>“Newly announced RTX AI PC laptops from ASUS and MSI feature up to GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs and power-efficient systems-on-a-chip with Windows 11 AI PC capabilities,” says Nvidia in a <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-brings-ai-assistants-to-life-with-geforce-rtx-ai-pcs">blog post</a>. Nvidia confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> in a briefing that these laptops will come with AMD’s latest Strix CPUs.</p><p>AMD hasn’t officially detailed its AMD Strix laptop CPUs yet, which it will undoubtedly announce during its own <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/computex.html">keynote later today</a>. Nvidia has also dropped a hint that the first AMD-powered Copilot Plus PCs might not get Microsoft’s round of AI features at launch, though.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s RTX AI laptops with Copilot Plus features are coming soon.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>“These Windows 11 AI PCs will receive a free update to Copilot+ PC experiences when available,” says Nvidia in a blog post. That suggests that Microsoft might not be ready to launch Recall and the other AI-powered Windows features on AMD chips, or that there could be some period of exclusivity for the Windows on Arm Qualcomm-powered hardware that launches on June 18th. Either way, we’ve reached out to Nvidia to clarify what its brief mention of this free update means.</p><p>Nvidia is also in a battle of sorts to remain relevant for AI-powered tasks on laptops. While Microsoft is pushing ahead with offloading AI models to NPUs, Nvidia is gearing up to make its GPUs useful in this AI battleground on PC. Nvidia is leaning hard into its branding of “RTX AI laptops,” noting that its GPUs are more capable of running heavier AI workloads than an NPU.</p><div><figcaption><em>The RTX AI Toolkit arrives in June.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>It’s even launching an <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ai-toolkit">RTX AI Toolkit</a> in June that includes tools and SDKs for model customization, optimization, and deployment. These tools will take something like Meta’s Llama 2 model and optimize it to run with far less VRAM requirements and with more performance. </p><p>Nvidia is also collaborating with Microsoft on the underlying AI models that are being built into Windows 11. “The collaboration will provide application developers with easy application programming interface (API) access to GPU-accelerated small language models (SLMs) that enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities that run on-device powered by Windows Copilot Runtime,” says Nvidia.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161688/microsoft-windows-copilot-runtime-build-2024">Microsoft announced its Windows Copilot Runtime</a> at Build last month, and Nvidia says its work to accelerate AI models using RTX GPUs will be released in developer preview later this year. Microsoft’s Windows Copilot Runtime is designed to make it easy for developers to add AI-powered features to their apps, all while relying on NPU hardware to accelerate those features, or GPUs from Nvidia soon.</p><p>Since NPUs are currently at the ~40 TOPS performance mark and Nvidia’s PC GPUs can handle more than 1,000 TOPS for AI acceleration, there are clearly some big differences in performance for developers to think about here. NPUs are designed for smaller models and important high power efficiency in laptops, but GPUs can do a good job handling larger models with higher performance in PC desktops where battery life isn’t relevant.</p><p>It’s going to be interesting to watch this AI battle on PC shakeout, especially as Microsoft holds the keys to lighting up these experiences natively in Windows for Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and its many OEM partners.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, seven years later, G-Assist is back as a real demo of a powerful GeForce AI assistant that Nvidia might eventually bring to life for game developers and RTX GPU owners.</p><p>Project G-Assist is only a tech demonstration right now, but it’s a brief look at how an AI assistant could guide you through PC games and even configure optimal settings for you based on chat inputs in the future.</p><p>In a demo, Nvidia shows G-Assist responding to voice queries asking “what’s the next early game weapon and where do I find the crafting materials for it?” inside <em>ARK: Survival Ascended. </em>The assistant can even understand what’s happening on the screen as you play, so it can tailor itself to how many skill points you have in a game and help guide you through. Microsoft showed off a similar demo for its vision of how its Copilot AI assistant could <a href="https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/1792623877744623806">guide <em>Minecraft</em></a><em> </em>players through the game last month.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s G-Assist demo.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Nvidia’s own AI assistant can also optimize and tune PC settings, including providing charts of PC latency and frames per second over the past 60 seconds. It can scan your system and notice you’re only playing at 60Hz when your monitor supports 240Hz. You can also ask the assistant for recommendations to increase performance in a game, hit a 60fps performance target, or even overclock your GPU.</p><p>I’m a sucker for a slick demo as much as the next person, but until G-Assist is an app I can download and play with, I’m hesitant to buy into the AI hype given how generative AI regularly makes mistakes. The fact that Microsoft and Nvidia are both demonstrating AI assistants that could eventually guide people through games makes me think that this will progress from demo to reality real soon. though.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA's Computex 2024 keynote was largely focused on AI, but there were also a couple of <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-brings-ai-assistants-to-life-with-geforce-rtx-ai-pcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> for gamers, starting with the fact that Star Wars Outlaws will support NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 after all.</p>
<p>We already knew that the game developed by Ubisoft Massive would support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reveals-star-wars-outlaws-black-myth-wukong-and-naraka-bladepoint-are-all-getting-dlss-3-and-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS</a> Super Resolution and Frame Generation, in addition to <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ray-traced global illumination and RTX Direct Illumination</a>. However, it looked like Ray Reconstruction would be left out of it, possibly because Massive preferred Snowdrop's built-in denoiser.</p>
<p>Today's news means the developers of Star Wars Outlaws have decided to switch to NVIDIA's AI-optimized denoiser after all. As a reminder, Ray Reconstruction was first introduced in CD Projekt RED's <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-is-the-most-beautiful-technically-advanced-game-with-path-tracing-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> where it successfully replaced multiple denoisers with a single one that improved the quality of ray tracing and slightly enhanced performance. Later in 2023, Remedy also launched Alan Wake 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-gets-stunning-debut-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a>. The same feature will be added to NARAKA: Bladepoint and Black Myth: Wukong. It's also already available in RTX Remix.</p>
<p>Speaking of RTX Remix, NVIDIA announced today that its AI-powered game remastering toolkit will go open source later this month. This will allow the community of over 20K modders to streamline the way assets are replaced and scenes are relit, increase the number of file formats supported for the RTX Remix asset ingestor, and add new models to the RTX Remix AI texture tools.</p>
<p>In addition, NVIDIA is exposing the capabilities of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-remix-toolkit-updated-by-nvidia-with-many-qol-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Remix Toolkit</a> via a REST API, enabling modders to integrate RTX Remix with digital content creation tools such as Blender, modding tools like Hammer, and generative AI applications like ComfyUI. Perhaps the most exciting RTX Remix news is that NVIDIA will provide an SDK for the RTX Remix Runtime to enable modders to extend the renderers into other applications and games beyond DirectX 8 and 9 classics. This may increase compatibility with DX10+ games, which at the moment is close to non-existent.</p>

		<p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is set to premiere on Netflix on October 10th, as confirmed by the streaming service. This show should not be confused with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/tomb-raider-amazon-phoebe-waller-bridge/">Tomb Raider show officially that is being created for Amazon&nbsp;</a>being written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, with Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft being an animated series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft | Official 'Danger' Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JNouqX9P14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft picks up where the recent game trilogy left off, which included Tomb Raider 2013, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The series serves as a narrative bridge connecting the new trilogy with the earlier Tomb Raider games that are set further along in Lara Croft’s life. While the exact number of episodes has not been confirmed, Netflix did make the initial order for two seasons.</p>
<p>Hayley Atwell has been cast in the role of Lara Croft, with Earl Baylon reprising his role as Jonah Maiava and Allen Maldonado voicing Zip. Tasha Huo, who previously worked on The Witcher: Blood Origin, serves as the showrunner for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft and is also involved with the Red Sonja project.</p>

I also went to the company’s US headquarters to open up an ROG Ally X with my own screwdrivers and play with the new build. I took plenty of pics, because I want you to nerd out with me. </p><p>But first, let me remind you what the ROG Ally X <em>is not</em>. Here’s what I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision">last month</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Don’t call it an Ally 2: when it ships in the second half of the year, the Windows-based Ally X will have the same AMD Z1 Extreme chipset and the same 7-inch 48–120Hz VRR screen. It’s not quite like&nbsp;the Steam Deck OLED, where Valve got AMD to revise its chip for better battery life and stability and added a larger, brighter, gorgeous new OLED panel with improved response time and slimmer bezels.</p></blockquote></div><p>The ROG Ally X is a revision, not a sequel, and it’s a pricier one. It still runs Windows, and I still firmly believe Windows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20been%20almost%20a%20full%20year%20since%20Asus%20released%20the%20ROG%20Ally%20and%20over%20two%20years%20since%20the%20Steam%20Deck">drags gaming handhelds down</a>. But the Ally X might be the best Windows handheld yet — because Asus has crammed a monster 80 watt-hour battery into a handheld that <em>doesn’t feel </em>heavy, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on">one that fits my average-sized hands better</a> than any Windows handheld I’ve tried. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->18</p><p><figcaption><em>Want to see some comparisons to the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck? Here’s a quick hardware tour:</em></figcaption></p></div><p>At 1.49 pounds (678g), the ROG Ally X is only 0.15 pounds (70g) heavier than the original, and it’s only 0.18 inches (4.5mm) thicker at its thickest point. It’s almost exactly the same weight as the original Steam Deck, and almost half an inch thinner, but with twice as much battery capacity inside. </p><p>How? While the bigger battery added over 120 grams of weight, Asus was able to offset half of it by making other components lighter. Krohn says a stronger, thinner, lighter chassis offered the biggest savings — the weight of the talcum-filled ABS / polycarbonate composite went from 176 grams to 134 grams by the time Asus was done. (I did run into one side effect of the stiffer plastic blend: it’s harder to pop it open for repair.)</p><p>The Ally X has lighter circuit boards, too, shaving away lots of unnecessary board, and a lighter cooling module — including 23-percent smaller fans that are actually <em>more</em> powerful, because the company’s in-house design team created its own custom set of 77 ultra-thin blades that trump the 47 of the original. Krohn says you might see the Ally run a couple degrees cooler, and the thinner blades help reduce the audible noise bump at around 5,000Hz, too. </p><p>And, there’s a new series of vents that let the Ally X cool its touchscreen more effectively — up to 6°C cooler.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->11</p><p><figcaption><em>Let’s tour the Ally X internals, starting with the 80Wh battery.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The joysticks are another place where they’re both better <em>and</em> lighter: completely revised modular boards now use the same high-grade potentiometer based ALPS sticks you’ll find in a PS5 or Xbox gamepad, with far tighter throw than the original Ally, delightfully tacky concave tops a la Steam Deck OLED, wider bases for better dust resistance, and low friction <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene">POM plastic</a> stems for smoother action when they scrape against the joystick ring’s edge.</p><p>They’re rated to 5 million rotation cycles, up from 2 million, and if that’s not enough, they’re modular — ready for a drift-resistant <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsBw3nxAzfY/">Hall Effect magnetic joystick upgrade kit</a> that Gulikit already has in development. (Krohn says not enough gamers prefer Hall Effect sticks for them to come standard, which... maybe?)</p><p>And, Asus has seemingly addressed almost all of the biggest complaints about I/O: </p><p>You get a full-length M.2 2280 PCIe 4 SSD slot now, one which supports double-sided drives too, opening up both the highest capacity and the most cost effective storage options on the market. </p><p>Asus has also ditched its proprietary XG Mobile eGPU port for a second USB-C port, one that offers all the benefits of Thunderbolt 4 too: 40Gbps speeds, 100W USB-C PD charging, DP 1.4 video output, and 4 lanes of PCIe for standard eGPUs. (No <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152087/ayaneo-plans-ornate-ag01-graphics-starship-egpu-dock">Oculink</a>, sorry.)</p><p>Both ports are top-mounted, but Krohn says that lets even the weaker one offer 100W charging and 10Gbps data.</p><div><p>And yes, Asus says you get a <em>new</em> SD card reader that is <em>not</em> the same as the one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20Asus%20still%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20that%20the%20Ally%E2%80%99s%20SD%20card%20reader%20ever%20had%20any%20fault">that Asus won’t admit has an issue</a>.</p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The ROG Ally X one-pager. 24GB RAM means the GPU and system basically no longer need to share.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Here are some of the smaller details I learned:</p><div><ul><li>The D-pad is not only eight-way now, it’s also larger and more comfortable. I vastly prefer it.</li><li>The face buttons are 3mm taller, inside a longer tube for more stability. I found they have a flatter press.</li><li>The speakers have a slightly larger chamber for slightly more volume and bass.</li><li>The haptic actuators have moved to the edges of the device, beneath palms, for more pronounced feedback and weight distribution.</li><li>The shoulder buttons are mounted differently on the board so they don’t break as easily in a fall.</li><li>The triggers are wider and made of smoky semi-transparent plastic that looks cool.</li><li>The rear intake vents are slightly larger.</li><li>The joystick tops are now attached with screws, so you could theoretically 3D print your own tops or stem extenders.</li><li>Similarly, the new back buttons are screwed into the rear shell now, so you could theoretically move their position in your own 3D printed rear shell.</li><li>There’s a ring around the fingerprint power button now to find it easier by feel.</li><li>The Turbo mode still operates at 25W, but Silent has been bumped from 10W to 13W, and Performance from 15W to 17W. </li><li>The battery is now rated to have 80 percent remaining capacity after 3 years of cycling, up from 70 percent</li><li>The handheld uses a different IMU now.</li><li>It still has magnetic Hall Effect triggers, but revised slightly to make sure they don’t interfere with the speakers or vibration motors.</li><li>While it does support 100W charging now, it still comes with the same 65W adapter.</li><li>It’s not compatible with existing cases and mounts, but Asus is in touch with fan favorites <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23769329/jsaux-valve-steam-deck-pc-gaming-accessories-china-interview-hands-on-testing">JSAUX</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163651/steam-deck-magsafe-gopro-fingers-brilliance">Deckmate</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23924719/dbrand-killswitch-asus-rog-ally-steam-deck-update">Dbrand</a> to offer new ones.</li><li>Existing Ally owners will be able to migrate settings to an Ally X with a cloud backup.</li></ul></div><div><p>Last but not least, there’s an easter egg in the comfy new grips — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture">just like the PS5’s controller is studded with incredibly tiny PlayStation symbols</a>, the ROG Ally X’s grips are covered with “ROG ROG ROG”:</p></div><p>I can’t wait for a review unit of this handheld, because battery is king in handheld gaming PC world, and the Ally X is about to be king of handheld battery packs. Just don’t necessarily expect it to dethrone the Steam Deck OLED, because there’s only so far Asus can go without a more efficient chip and screen — and because I’m still not sure how I feel about Asus’ <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/asus-tone-deaf-response-to-ongoing-rma-support-issues-isnt-going-to-encourage-me-to-keep-recommending-asus-tech/">deteriorating reputation</a> for support.</p><p>Some small news today there too, though: <a href="https://twitter.com/ASUS_ROGNA/status/1797131331446669510">Asus has just announced</a> that all ROG Ally devices in North America now have a two-year warranty.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
