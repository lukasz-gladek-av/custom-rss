            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Early Access. Survival. Crafting. It’s a combo that you’re likely familiar with if you’ve spent a reasonable amount of time browsing the Steam store. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="27306349-cc50-4431-8f1d-c08818c5fe74" href="https://techraptor.net/games/aloft" rel="nofollow"><em>Aloft</em></a> is the next in a long (and seemingly never-ending) line of these games, aiming to carve its own slice of the survival crafting pie.</p>

<p><em>Aloft </em>doesn’t make the strongest first impression, unceremoniously dumping you into a cave after limited character and world creation. Your only real hint at what’s going on is a single sentence during the loading screen, which talks about an “eternal storm” leading you to a broken world.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long before you go through the motions of any survival game, picking up stray wood and stone to craft a hammer that will serve you for hours to come. From there, you learn how to build platforms, more items, and tools, then escape your rocky confinement into the outside world.</p>



<p>This outside world is where <em>Aloft</em>’s main selling point comes into play. Rather than one large open map to explore, this is a world made up of many smaller islands. After crafting a glider and flying out to neighboring islands, you soon learn how to create various sailing parts like a helm and sails.</p>

<p>Rather than crafting some sort of airship, you instead use these parts to commandeer one of the aforementioned islands. Once claimed, an island acts not only as a base of operations but also as the main way to traverse across the vast sky.</p>

<p>Traversing is something you’ll be doing a lot of. While worlds are randomly generated, they each follow a set pattern: each world is split into three rings, with each ring split into sections on the map. Sections are populated with clusters of islands, with some holding key points of interest.</p>

<p>Exploring islands is <em>Aloft</em>’s main gameplay loop, as you scour them for resources and crafting recipes. Cutting down trees, opening treasure chests, it’s all that you’d expect from a survival crafting game.</p>

<p>Where things differ is the island ecosystem mechanic. Some islands you come across will be in a state of decay, missing certain vital parts to keep the ecosystem alive. This can range from not enough animals to a lack of fungi or flora.</p>



<p>Most resources on the island stay locked until you satisfy all conditions, which are easy enough to check via a craftable field guide. At first, I thought this could be an interesting way to have the player think about their impact on the environment, carefully picking and choosing resources instead of ransacking everything.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s a shallow system that rarely impacts your playstyle. Most of the time you can just leave islands that require extra work, opting to find one that has a complete ecosystem instead. Even if you do choose to fix things, it’s generally little more than planting a row of flora or trees.</p>

<p>Aloft is full of these shallow mechanics and systems, most of which barely increase in complexity by the time you reach the end of Early Access content.</p>

<p>Combat is simple — all tools double up as weapons — and is clearly not a big focus. In fact, there are only three enemy types, alongside some larger growths that impede progress on some islands. The only real times I found myself in danger was thanks to lag spikes, something relatively common on any of the bigger islands.</p>



<p>This has the knock-on effect of making cooking mostly inconsequential right now. You can forage or grow a number of crops, with <em>Aloft </em>currently allowing you to cook a wide variety of dishes. But most serve very little purpose right now, especially since dying has no consequences.</p>

<p>I found myself crafting little more than basic clean water, since that allowed me to swing faster — a useful buff for both combat and gathering. This also serves the double purpose of staving off the desert heat in<em> Aloft</em>’s current final biome, though even that has very little going on right now.</p>

<p>As of the Early Access launch, <em>Aloft </em>only contains three biomes — two are almost identical, with the last being desert-themed. On top of this, there's a noticeably limited pool of islands that be spawned into a world. You’ll run into the same islands many times, with most having no defining features or reasons to visit.</p>

<p>To stop you from just making a beeline for the next map marker, the world throws a couple of roadblocks at you. Between the outer and middle rings on each side, you’ll have to make it through a field of floating rocks. The south and north sides of the map require progressively better sails, with the crafting recipes being found on random islands.</p>



<p>Because of this, you end up reaching a new cluster of islands, giving them a quick look for said recipes, then moving on to the next. With how plentiful most resources are, there’s not much point in lingering unless you really need to.</p>

<p>In between islands, you’ll use your trusty island-turned-ship, fitting it with new sails to go faster or one of many crafting stations. Crafting is all there really is to do when traveling to a new island, as there are no random events or items to look out for. You'll likely find yourself tabbing out often since you'll otherwise be waiting for minutes with nothing to do.</p>

<p>And honestly, that’s mainly my problem with <em>Aloft</em> right now. After a few hours, the gameplay loop ends up as a bland mix of quickly checking repetitive islands, and then spending my time away from the game while your ship makes its way forward.</p>

<p>Releasing too soon is a pitfall I’ve seen Early Access games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c8e4ab6f-2b6f-4d5c-93ad-467e250af935" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nightingale-preview" rel="nofollow">Nightingale</a> fall into, and I wonder if<em> Aloft </em>has done the same thing. Realistically there are only a few hours of actual meaningful content here, stretched out across 15-20 hours or so of repetitive exploration before you exhaust everything.</p>

<p>More can absolutely be added during Early Access, with the Steam store page promising more biomes and “challenges to overcome”. But as of right now, a unique gimmick doesn’t set <em>Aloft </em>apart from other, more engaging titles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-for-spring-includes-new-rides-and-more.1081935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap for spring, and it's promising new rides, gameplay improvements, and more for the theme park management sim.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2688950/view/547849766230295443" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on Steam</a>, Frontier reveals the full roadmap, which covers the period between February and May. It begins with Update 2, which will arrive in February, bringing with it custom billboards and speakers, new rides, and several adjustments to the core gameplay.</p>

<p>Following that, you can expect Update 3 in March. That one will bring more guest and raft movement on special pieces, as well as more stock coasters, a returning ride from the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>, and more gameplay improvements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring-full.jpg?itok=Q3F94g0e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring-full.jpg?itok=679Sjxvb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>is getting lots of new stuff in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>More updates are on their way in April and May, but Frontier is remaining cagey about exactly what those updates will contain. Suffice it to say they'll probably be on the same level as the preceding two, so expect new rides, gameplay improvements, and other stuff.</p>

<p>Whether or not this roadmap will be enough to placate&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>'s more vocal critics remains to be seen, but I think it's unlikely. There's nothing particularly transformative here.</p>

<p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was sitting at a rather disappointing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mixed rating</a> on Steam, with over 6,600 reviewers weighing in on the theme park management sim.</p>

<p>Complaints include Frontier's approach to the release of DLC, as well as technical issues, unintuitive gameplay, and a lack of features when compared to the first&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>. I think it's probably going to take more than a few extra bits and bobs to convince some of these players the sequel was worth it.</p>




<p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was released for PC and current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in November</a>. It's the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>, and it boasts a new focus on waterpark features, as well as gameplay improvements and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009610" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

While the original PlayStation 4 game focused on B-movie silliness and branching storylines based on player decisions, the movie version will employ an entirely different premise to try to recreate that effect.</p><p>Rather than choose who lives or dies in an interactive setting, the <em>Until Dawn</em> movie will see its victims killed again and again in different ways until they can figure out how to survive the entire night together. “The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again,” director David F. Sandberg says in the new teaser trailer. “Every time they come back to life, it’s like they are in a new horror genre.”</p><p><em>Until Dawn </em>won’t feature any of the original game’s characters, either. Almost all of its high-profile cast, led by Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere, are absent as well. The only person who has returned, as revealed in the first trailer on Tuesday, is Peter Stormare. But instead of playing the fourth wall-breaking psychiatrist Dr. Hill, it seems like he’ll be taking on a more sinister role to fill the apparent absence of the cannibalistic wendingos that served as the first game’s violent antagonists. </p><p>“Hey so, there’s definitely something here,” reads one of the top YouTube comments on the trailer. “However if this wasn’t labeled I would have had no idea that was <em>Until Dawn</em>.” Users on X were less generous. “We’re going to make a film with the same name as a popular videogame but we’re not actually going to base the story on the game in any way, shape or form,” one wrote sarcastically.

The official Pokémon online store, both in the UK and the U.S., was acting strangely: the new special set (so-called because it will be released in boxed and tinned products throughout 2025, but not be sold as individual booster packs) was marked as “UNAVAILABLE” the moment it was put in the store. After a while, “UNAVAILABLE” switched to “SOLD OUT,” and that was that. Somehow, despite never being possible to buy, it was gone.</p><p>The very same thing happened at the end of last week with the announcement of March’s next full set, Journey Together. At this point,  it has become very apparent something is going horribly wrong.</p><h2 id="h813004"><a id=""></a>It’s impossible to buy new Pokémon TCG cards</h2><p>For reasons too dull to get into, about a year-and-a-half ago, I got into the habit of refreshing the Pokémon Center websites for the UK and the U.S. a pretty troubling number of times a day. This reflex stuck and has proven useful in the long time since, helping me get the scoop on new products, and indeed ensuring I could buy myself the special Pokémon Center version of each set’s Elite Trainer Box (ETB), which invariably sold very quickly.</p><p>So it is that I tend to notice new product on the site long before press releases go out, and being in the UK, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914">often get the jump</a></span> on what will be added to the North American site later the same day. And so it was that I discovered Prismatic Evolutions was on sale far before any official announcements, and indeed that it was not possible to buy.</p><p>I contacted TPCi at the time—November 6—via their UK PR department (TPCi is notoriously difficult to get in touch with), with an incredibly innocuous question about how the products appeared to be sold out before ever actually being available. Was it a glitch? Was it unprecedented demand? Either way, you’d imagine the company would like to make it clear to customers. But instead, I received a response that read, “Pokémon does not have any additional information to share on the below.”</p><p>Perplexed, I left it, because—as I say—I’m aware how hard it is to get any information from TPCi, and even a “no comment” was a rare treat. Then, come January 9, the same thing happened again. Journey Together had yet to be officially acknowledged as a set by TPCi, but there it was on the Pokémon Center. Four products—the 36-pack booster box, the ETB, a six-pack booster bundle, and individual packs—all listed as available to buy on the “New Releases” page of the store, but all marked as “UNAVAILABLE” when you clicked through. Weirder, I noticed this time, was that it didn’t say it was unavailable <em>immediately</em>, but rather after the tiniest fraction of a second. For that split-second before, the usual, yellow “ADD TO BASKET” button would flicker.</p><p>I tried a bunch of times to see if I could click on it before it changed, eventually succeeded, but received only a strange error message. And then, after about an hour, the New Releases page updated the products to be “SOLD OUT,” and even more tellingly, a front page giant banner for the new product that was latterly added to the site was entirely removed.</p><p>So, obviously, I got in touch with Pokémon’s UK PR to ask what was happening, but despite repeated attempts over the last five days, haven’t heard anything back.</p><figure id="" data-id="6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-recommend-id="image://6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-recommend-id="image://6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h813005"><a id=""></a>Collecting Scalps</h2><p>So what’s going on?

To be clear, these are the sorts of items that would usually be stood in huge piles in your local card store, and easily available in Target and Walmart.</p><p>What’s brought this about is likely more complicated. Prismatic Evolutions is one of those sets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-151-scarlet-violet-tcg-pull-rates-etb-charizard-1850860867&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-151-scarlet-violet-tcg-pull-rates-etb-charizard-1850860867">like 2023's 151</a></span>, that will bring lots of people to the hobby. It’s an Eevee-based set, and it’s had a lot of buzz. That’s one factor. Then there’s <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, which has been a phenomenon, drawing in tens of millions of players, inevitably a gateway for vast numbers to want to collect the physical cards too. And, of course, there’s momentum. Once prices start going up, more people try to take advantage of those increases, buying up stock to increase scarcity, driving prices up further, and so on. We’re definitely in that vicious loop right now.</p><p>You might say we’ve been here before, first in 2016 when <em>Pokémon GO</em> caused a vast amount of new interest in the TCG, and then to the most outlandish degree in 2020 and 2021, when Logan Paul sparked a wild surge in prices after paying $150,000 for a Base Set Charizard, leading to a lockdown-driven crazy spike in interest in classic cards. However, what marks this situation as different is the cards it involves.</p><p>Both previous spikes were about classic cards, seeing the prices of old collections increasing exponentially, and in many cases, still maintaining that value today. But in both situations, while newer sets certainly proved a lot more popular, they were still widely available. The only exception to this would be Japan’s Clay Burst set that in 2023 astonishingly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-trading-card-game-tcg-stock-japan-iono-grusha-1850349547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-trading-card-game-tcg-stock-japan-iono-grusha-1850349547">caused Japan to sell out of <em>all</em> Pokémon cards</a></span>, but the Iono card responsible didn’t cause anything similar in the rest of the world when it was later released in English.</p><p>The reason it’s so different this time is that it’s affecting the brand-new sets, and that’s an issue for two important reasons. Firstly, it breaks the entire hobby for regular people. If you’re someone (like me) who tries to pick up an ETB and then buys a bunch of loose packs here and there, you’re now just shit out of luck. Casual collectors can’t try to get a few nice cards for their binders. Kids looking to spend their allowance on a $5 pack will go home disappointed. That really sucks, and it’s going to badly affect the reputation of the game.</p><p>And secondly, <em>the game</em>. These cards, while often bought in the gambling-lite hope of pulling a rare card, actually exist to be the playing cards for a massively popular game. And if you can’t buy the new sets at sensible prices, you can’t keep up with the meta, can’t redesign your decks, and just can’t join in anymore. There are millions of people, kids and adults, who meet up every week for clubs, who will be negatively affected by this sudden inability to buy <em>anything </em>new. (Browsing my usual online store right now, there’s not a single item from the last three full sets I can buy right now.)</p><figure id="" data-id="c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-recommend-id="image://c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-recommend-id="image://c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h813006"><a id=""></a>Bring in the YouTubers</h2><p>As I was preparing this article, I noticed that the astonishingly popular Pokémon YouTuber, “PokeRev,” uploaded a video last night, commenting on very similar problems.</p><p>With almost 3 million followers, the streamer who most know as “Rev,” real name Nick, has a lot of reach. He sources his cards as a retailer, rather than a customer, invariably receiving crates of stock of each product, which is opened daily on his channel, and almost always given away to viewers. As such, he tends to get new sets before they’re available to buy, and presumably to the frustration of TPCi, opens hundreds of packs long before their shelf date. (Pokémon PR in the U.S. very generously sends me advance sample packs of each new set, so I can write about them on <em>Kotaku</em>, and Nick almost always gets his product before even these arrive.)</p><p>But in his most recent video, PokeRev is unusually candid, almost emotional, as he discusses the lack of availability of recent sets. Stating it began with November’s set, Surging Sparks, he explains how the resale prices of brand new cards have gone through the roof, as availability in stores has become minimal. And that things have become so extreme at this point, that as he tore into Prismatic Evolutions in the last few days, he’s been feeling a sense of guilt, that he knows his viewers aren’t going to be able to buy it for themselves. (Rev plans to give all his bulk to local card stores, on top of giving product away to viewers.)</p><p>I’m certain PokeRev’s speaking out is likely to cause more consternation within TPCi than my coverage, and I imagine others will jump on board too, so hopefully we might finally see the company pushed into addressing this issue. Because, for them, selling out is selling out, whether it’s bots or kids buying the cards. The only way to make them care is reputationally. (And please, please don’t pay the scalp prices—that motivates the situation and ensures it can’t improve.)</p><p>In the meantime, if you were hoping to enjoy a pack from the newer sets, or to update your deck for competitive play, then...damn. You might want to make a loud stink about it, in the hope that something will get done.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Balatro has a ton of content to unlock, challenges to beat, and fiery points totals to earn. Our Balatro Trophy Guide and the full list of achievements delve deeper into the game’s more challenging tasks—and your patience and free time are bound to be tested.</p>



<p>I’ve lost count of my Balatro runs at this point. I’m not sure I’d even want to know to be honest, as my losses would outweigh my wins. Yet, I love it, and it’s easy to see why it was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game of 2024</a>. If I want to be the ultimate Balatro master, I need to get every Trophy and Achievement, and the evidence suggests this might not <em>ever </em>happen.</p>



<p>All the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-plasma-deck-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plasma Decks</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-brainstorm-joker-in-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainstorm Jokers</a> in the world can’t make this endeavor easier—and I wish the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Balatro Seeds</a> counted toward progress!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-balatro-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Balatro Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful sight. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Balatro has 32 PlayStation Trophies and 31 Xbox Achievements to unlock to complete the list.</strong></p>



<p>The shiny Platinum Trophy is the big difference between Xbox and PlayStation. Getting all Achievements is necessary for all Gamerscore, whereas getting every Trophy rewards you with a Platinum on PS4 and PS5. Achieving full completion earns bragging rights on either platform over friends who are trying to best Balatro too—something I’m desperately working toward.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-balatro-trophy-amp-achievement">Every Balatro Trophy &amp; Achievement</h2>



<p>Balatro’s Achievements and Trophies range from achieving scores with a ridiculous number of digits to completing Balatro—and I do mean <em>completing </em>Balatro.</p>

<h2 id="h-balatro-trophies-amp-achievements-difficulty-rating">Balatro Trophies &amp; Achievements Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>Balatro’s Trophies and Achievements are an easy 9 out of 10 on the difficulty scale.</strong></p>



<p>It achieves this rating based on the toughness of its Completionist++ objective, as well as how many hours it takes. Earning a Gold Sticker on every Joker is a stupidly difficult ask, and all it takes is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-beat-plant-boss-blind-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Plant Boss Blind</a> to mess everything up, or another unforeseen factor to have a good run end up in smoke in seconds.</p>

<p>A new teaser for the upcoming Until Dawn movie has been released by Sony Pictures. The teaser sets the stage for the movie ahead the reveal of the first trailer.</p>



<p>“As a huge fan of the Until Dawn game and how cinematic it was, I thought a lot about how we can continue the story without just giving the audience the same experience that they got when they were playing,” Writer and Producer Gary Dauberman said.</p>



<p>Director David F. Sandberg says that the movie “has sort of the same tone and same vibe” as the original game. However, he says, it “expands upon the universe”. Sandberg then touched on what he viewed as one of the more creative aspects of the game which is players making different choices and dying in different ways. </p>



<p>“The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again,” he said. “Every time they come back to life, it’s like their in a new horror genre. To survive, they have to make it until dawn.”</p>



<p>You can check out the first look teaser for the film below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The movie’s description reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one…only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening. Trapped in the valley, they’re forced to relive the nightmare again and again – only each time the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last. Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of deaths left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Until Dawn is scheduled to release in theaters on April 25. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review.1081896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I owe Donkey Kong Country Returns HD an apology. I laughed in disbelief at its initial announcement because it’s not only the third time Nintendo has sold us a version of this 2010 Wii platformer, it’s also the third Switch re-release Donkey Kong has seen despite not getting a completely new adventure in the last decade. This remaster’s reveal felt like the wrong game at the wrong time, but it only took a few minutes of running across a decently spruced up Donkey Kong Island to realize Returns is still one of the best 2D platformers Nintendo has made this century. It has all the things I want from this genre: satisfying movement that demands skill and precision, a large lineup of replayable challenges stuffed with secrets to find, and a practically unparalleled attention to detail in its superb level design that’s pretty much only rivaled by its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/01/donkey-kong-tropical-freeze-for-switch-review">Tropical Freeze</a>. Even though the remaster itself feels barebones and a few elements could have used a slightly more modern touch, this is definitely the best way to play Returns and one of the top bananas in the Switch’s impressive platformer lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I barreled through 80 levels set in jungles, caves, and more, it struck me just how few games like this are made anymore. In an era where modern platformers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot</a> mostly focus on wowing you with spectacle and joyously ushering you through their handcrafted digital theme parks, Returns stands out as it doubles down on the platforming itself. It’s full of tough levels and nail-biting moments that require you to master its central jumping, rolling, and swinging mechanics to overcome its biggest challenges. No shade to the two games I just mentioned – I adore them both – but revisiting Nintendo’s version of this classic platformer style is refreshing, and I love how it isn’t afraid to test you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Difficulty-wise, this is several steps above Mario and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">Kirby</a>, and that’s another great differentiating factor from the other platformers in Nintendo’s stable. The level design is incredibly impressive: Every stage introduces a new idea and explores it to the fullest as it ramps up the challenge without ever making it unclear what is expected of you. To reclaim Donkey Kong’s home, you’ll have to outrun hordes of ape-eating spiders, avoid enormous lethal waves, and make perfect jumps across crumbling platforms, and it’s always exciting to see what obstacle will be thrown at you next.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DK’s perfect controls and satisfying abilities keep the challenge fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to Donkey Kong’s perfect controls and immensely satisfying abilities. There’s a distinct weight to the movement in Retro Studios’ pair of Donkey Kong games, as if you can really get a sense for the heft of this big ape as you move, resulting in a platformer more focused on momentum where you’ll often have to plan your moves ahead of time and gear up for that next huge leap. The advanced rolling-jump mechanic in particular – where Donkey Kong gets a free jump in midair after rolling off a ledge – leads to some of the most rewarding platforming out there when you pull off a crazy move to save yourself or snag a hard-to-reach collectible. Your options open up even more when you break Diddy Kong out of a barrel. He both doubles your max health and adds an extremely helpful hover ability that’s a game changer in tougher sections. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If testing your mettle isn’t for you, the optional Modern Mode – which is slightly altered from the 3DS port’s New Mode – adds extra hearts to DK and Diddy’s health, expands the inventory at Cranky Kong’s shop with more useful aids (like a Green Balloon that saves you after falling into a pit), and lets you take more consumable recovery items into each level. Plus, if there’s a stage you just can’t clear, Super Kong will eventually show up and offer to automatically beat it for you. I love challenging platformers, so I stuck to Classic Mode and never looked back, but these are at least great options for people who don’t like to get stuck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one place Returns occasionally gets a little bit <em>too </em>mean is its on-rails minecart and rocket barrel levels. These areas can suffer from a lot of trial-and-error, where I frequently died to sudden enemies or obstacles I had no way of reasonably avoiding on my first attempt. This is worsened if you’re going for the hidden collectibles in each stage, where you’re almost guaranteed to miss at least some of them the first time through until you know the level’s patterns. It’s especially frustrating because everything in these sections is a one-hit kill; a problem Tropical Freeze later solved by introducing vehicle-specific health bars. To be fair, it’s not a huge issue – Modern Mode adds an item in Cranky’s shop that can make these sections less of a pain, and I still really enjoy them for how they break up the pace of the standard stages – but I can’t help but feel they could have used a bit of freshening up. Similarly, the boss fights are largely fantastic, but they still suffer from a complete lack of checkpoints, and being forced back to the beginning after dying in the final phase feels more like a waste of time than a meaningful challenge.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This really is just a new coat of paint and nothing more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The absence of any updates to these stumbling points highlights just how barebones Returns HD is as a remaster. This really is just a combination of the Wii and 3DS versions of Returns with a new coat of paint, and nothing more. It’s a competent update, but it’s nowhere near the level of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> – the <em>other </em>Retro Studios game that got a shiny updated release on Switch. It certainly doesn’t look bad, and it almost always runs at a smooth 60 frames per second, but even Tropical Freeze’s 2018 Switch port looks noticeably nicer. That’s most apparent when comparing Donkey Kong’s character model across the two games: DK’s fur looks amazing in Tropical Freeze, but just a little bit off in Returns. This is very clearly still a Wii game in HD everywhere from the levels to the cutscenes, which is completely <em>fine</em>, but I would’ve liked to see the graphics get a bit more love when the movement otherwise aged so well. Still, this is undoubtedly the best way to play Returns, as the Wii version had mandatory waggling motion controls that have been mercifully made entirely optional, and the extra 3DS levels have been rescued from that version’s downgraded graphics and co-op that required two systems and copies. That makes Returns HD the first time you can play this adventure on your TV with traditional button controls and all of its content intact, and that’s great to see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of multiplayer, Returns HD is fully playable in two-player co-op where a second player takes control of Diddy Kong, but it’s not necessarily how I would want to play through the entire campaign. It's different from its contemporary New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which was made with multiplayer in mind from the beginning, in that it feels more like a neat bonus feature tacked onto a single-player game. The camera is so zoomed in that it’s easy for someone to fall behind, and these levels are clearly designed around just one player given their abundance of falling platforms and fast-moving obstacles. There’s still fun to be found in multiplayer, and it’s by no means a <em>bad </em>experience – but unless you have a great co-op partner willing to deal with some slight annoyances (or a young child/sibling that’s just content to be along for the ride), your best bet is either flying solo or passing the controller back and forth, as was also the case back on Wii.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Platformer Hall of Fame</h3><p>Running and jumping with the best of them. Level-based platformers only -- Metroidvanias not included.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it’s a testament to the original that almost nothing was changed for this remaster and the final product is still so great. The attention to detail in its level design is remarkable. Unlike Mario, there are no unexplained floating platforms or blocks – every single platform DK runs across is seamlessly built into the landscape, often through its masterful interplay between the foreground and background, and it all culminates in one of the most impressive, cohesive worlds in any platformer. The biggest highlight of this is the factory world, which wonderfully implements conveyor belts, gears, and other machinery as the main methods of getting around. The soundtrack and settings play it a little safe (especially when compared to its sequel), but it’s important to remember that the original Donkey Kong Country Returns was tasked with bringing the franchise back after years away, so Retro Studios naturally chose to revisit some of the staples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level is stuffed with secrets to find, too, with the classic KONG letters and plenty of puzzle pieces tucked away in seemingly every corner. Sometimes exploration slows down the otherwise furious pace more than I’d like – blowing air onto all the dandelions, flowers, and candles you pass feels clunky and is an outdated mechanic that Tropical Freeze rightfully removed – but I still had a blast spending roughly 15 hours tracking down every letter and bringing my save file to 100% completion while also tackling tons of worthwhile content that appears after the credits roll. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Somehow, Donkey Kong Country Returns returned (again), but Nintendo’s third full release of this 2010 Wii platformer is almost as fresh and fun today as it was 15 years ago. DK’s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it’s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as “good enough” and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles. But Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is still a competent update and easily the best way to play one of the greatest 2D platformers Nintendo has released this century.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, perhaps the famous first-person shooter’s flight from Xbox shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-wont-rule-out-any-xbox-exclusive-making-the-jump-to-playstation-including-halo">Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer said there were no “red lines” in its first-party lineup when it comes to going multiplatform</a> — and that included Halo. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has so-far used older games released over a year ago for its multiplatform push as opposed to brand new games, but that will soon change with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which comes out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024"><u>on PS5</u></a> just a few months after it launched on Xbox and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones is the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to a rival console, and follows the multiplatform release of Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pentiment"><u>Pentiment</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded"><u>Grounded</u></a>, Tango Gameworks’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>, and Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> earlier in 2024. In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</u></a> this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said in August</a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore">As former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN last year</a>, bringing Halo to PlayStation will have been a topic of discussion at Microsoft for some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look, if Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's had its ups and downs, but look, Xbox wouldn't be what Xbox is without Halo. But yeah, I'm sure those conversations are happening. Whether they come to fruition, who knows? But they're definitely happening, I'm sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does face a potential backlash from hardcore Xbox fans who are already disgruntled after what they feel is a devaluing of the Xbox as a console, the lack of exclusives, and Microsoft’s marketing strategy for its gaming business. Losing Halo to PlayStation could spark yet another angry response, but Moore told IGN that won’t deter Microsoft from doing what’s right for its business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The question would be, ultimately, is that reaction enough not to make a fundamental business decision for the future of not only Microsoft’s business, but gaming in itself?” Moore said. “Those hardcore are getting smaller in size and older in age. You've got to cater to the generations that are coming through, because they're going to drive the business over the next 10, 20 years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo isn’t alone in coming to PS5 and Switch 2. NateTheHate reported that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is also coming to PS5 and Switch 2. Windows Central additionally reported that Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition, Hellblade 2, and Age of Mythology are coming to PS5 in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, does Halo: The Master chief Collection's release on PS5 and Switch 2 open the door to other Halo games also going multiplatform? Could the next big Halo game launch across all platforms? Last year, tech experts said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>Halo’s move to Unreal Engine 5</u></a> would make it easier for developer Halo Studios, née 343 Industries, to take the game to PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Using your old camera, you’ll explore an ethereal realm and its ties to the world you left behind, uncover its mysteries, and ultimately find your way home.</p><p>You are a weary, middle-aged photojournalist retreating from a life of disappointment in the city to find solace in your roots. But an unexpected accident leaves you stranded in an ethereal mountain realm, where you cross paths with a mysterious girl. To uncover the truth of this enigmatic world and find a way back home, you must gather clues and piece together its mysteries—all with nothing but the old camera in your hands.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Players must take in their surroundings, understand what each spirit desires, and capture the realm’s secrets through their lens.

As their journey unfolds, her presence offers a different angle that helps him see the world more clearly. It’s nice that you came along at a time like this.</li><li><strong>Wistful Magical Realism</strong> – This world is not unlike reality, yet it is slowly fading away. Humanity has long since vanished, leaving only animal spirits to inhabit its remains. They believe that so long as they capture each other’s moments, they will continue to exist.</li><li><strong>Spiritual Bonds</strong> – The spirits you encounter throughout the game may grow closer to you depending on your choices, quietly shaping what awaits at your destination.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>One of the impressive things about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> on launch day was its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-characters-every-superhero-and-supervillain/2900-5216/" data-ref-id="2900-5216">massive roster of heroes and supervillains</a>. From Spider-Man to Hela, each character looked and felt great to play as, and developer NetEase has ambitious plans to expand its cast of characters regularly. The studio aims to add two new characters in every future season, alongside updates, new maps, and more story content.</p><p>"Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes. We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves," game director Guangyun Chen said to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metro</a>. "The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero. We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community."</p><p>The first Dracula-themed season of Marvel Rivals has kicked off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/">and will see the Fantastic Four added to the game</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/the-until-dawn-movie-teaser-explains-how-the-branching-narrative-will-be-used/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first teaser for the upcoming movie based on Sony’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn">Until Dawn game</a> has revealed how the film will handle the branching narrative that is so integral to the game. Are they going to go all Clue and have<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuUrxRdJv9U"> a random ending for every time you watch it</a>? Will it be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a> where you whip out your phone to make decisions? Well…. no.</p>
<p>In the game, the characters can die in multiple ways, so you can play through it quite a few times and get completely different outcomes. A film is a linear experience, so the director David F. Sandberg has explained that within the story, time will rewind and loop back to the start, giving the characters opportunities to try something different when they restart the night, but having to confront what Sandberg describes as being different horror genres.</p>


<p>The teaser also shows that while the location is still mountainous they have not opted to film in winter and replicate the chilly atmosphere in the game, even in its original tale. We also get our first look at Peter Stromare who is playing a character called ‘Hill’ in the game. He voiced and motion captured the role of Dr. Alan J. Hill (known in-game as “The Analyst”), the psychiatrist who popped up between chapters of the game to give you tests and offer advice.</p>
<p>The film will also star Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell. It has been stated that the film is set in the same continuity as the game so we may get a cameo from some of the original cast, although I suspect Rami Malek’s fee may be slightly larger than when he appeared in the game.</p>

<p>Until Dawn is set to arrive in movie theatres on April 25th, 2025.</p>

<p>Sony recently remastered Until Dawn for PlayStation 5 which I <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">reviewed</a>, giving it a sold 8/10. “Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-until-dawn-movie-actually-looks-kind-of-interesting.1081857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-movie-first-look<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a first-look trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie, which is set to land in theaters in April, and it actually looks like the folks behind the movie have some interesting ideas for the project.</p>

<p>The trailer is more of a teaser than a deep dive, but it does feature talking heads like writer Gary Dauberman, director David F. Sandberg, and actor Peter Stormare. If you've played&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, you'll know Stormare appears in the game as the sinister Dr. Hill, a role he's set to reprise in the movie.</p>

<p>Encouragingly, Dauberman says he's a "huge fan" of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, and that his goal for the movie was to "continue the story" rather than simply "giving the audience the same experience" as they had playing the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-movie-first-look-header.jpg?itok=ICXLQOP2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-movie-first-look-header.jpg?itok=s5HtQJb9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie won't just retell the story of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sandberg, the movie will sport "the same tone and the same vibe" as the game, but it "expands upon the universe", so it won't just be a straight retelling of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s story.</p>

<p>Sandberg goes on to praise&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s system in which players make choices and see different deaths as a result, revealing that he's incorporated a form of this mechanic into the movie.</p>

<p>When characters die in the movie, Sandberg says "things start over and they get to try again", and that every time characters die, they're essentially revived "in a new horror genre".</p>

<p>Honestly, this approach is a lot more creative than I was expecting; I was fully prepared for&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>to be a generic slasher that limped out into theaters and was swiftly forgotten, but mercifully, it seems that's not the approach the team is taking.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie is set to arrive in theaters on April 25th, with a full trailer coming "soon", according to Sony. In the meantime, if you want your&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>fix, you can play the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date" rel="nofollow">recently-released remake</a>, although you'd certainly be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord" rel="nofollow">one of very few who did</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony has released a video for its upcoming Until Dawn film, giving us our first tease at what horrors await those unsuspecting teens.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting snippets to come from the trailer is how the film team is going to adapt the game's branching narrative. As those who have played Until Dawn will know, characters can die or survive depending on the different decisions made by the player. There will be a variation on this mechanic in the film.</p>

<p>"One of the creative things the game did is that people make different choices and die in different ways," explained Until Dawn's film director David F. Sandberg, adding: "The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again" (cue plenty of intense breathing).</p>
<p>So, what does this actually mean for the film's characters? "Every time they come back to life, it's like they are in a new horror genre," said Sandberg. "To survive, they have to make it until dawn."</p>
<p>Along with this news, the trailer features actor Peter Stromare, who is credited simply as Hill. "I'm very proud to be part of this evolution onto the screen," he says, before the video jumps to posters of missing teens, as an ominous ticking noise plays.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-dynasty-warriors-origins-metacritic-score/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is out, which means its Metacritic score is available. The hack-and-slash franchise has nearly 30 years of developing and publishing mileage on the clock, so let’s see if Origins has managed to land its biggest killing blow yet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-cancelled-before-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynasty Warriors 10 was canceled</a> before it was ever shown to the public. Instead, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynasty Warriors Origins</a>, one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-biggest-video-game-releases-of-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2025’s hottest games</a>. Origins features an unbelievable amount of soldiers on screen and more of the classic action that’s helped the series to ship over 20 million copies and counting.</p>



<p>As with any game’s release, reviews are everything. In today’s social-media-heavy society, review embargos are paramount. Everyone is desperate to know how a new title is received by critics, helping to sway people in their decision to buy it. Dynasty Warriors Origins’ reviews are out, so let’s dive into its final scores.</p>







<figure><figcaption>A beautiful blood-letting battle. Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins has a score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic.</strong></p>



<p>Individually, Origin rates <strong>85 out of 100 for PC</strong> based on 18 reviews, <strong>80 on PS5</strong> using 48 reviews, and <strong>78 on Xbox</strong>—taking into account 10 reviews.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dynasty-warriors-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins’ Metacritic page</a> is the source for all the information we’ve collated. I find the best way to aggregate a game is the review score with the most quantitative verdicts, and in this case, it’s the <strong>PlayStation 5’s 80/100 score</strong>.</p>



<p>The Xbox’s number is only based on 10 reviews, so it’s hard to gauge this figure properly. A score of 80 out of 100 is a very good result for Dynasty Warriors—but more on this later.</p>



<h2 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-opencritic-score-explained">Dynasty Warriors Origins Opencritic Score Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins has a combined score of 82 out of 100—based on 62 reviews—on OpenCritic, with an “80% Critics Recommend” percentage.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17485/dynasty-warriors-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenCritic</a> considers more reviewers than Metacritic and is considered to be a more versatile source of reviews and opinions. It also doesn’t split up platforms and takes the best from each format for one averaged-out rating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-dynasty-warriors-origins-reviews-compare">How Do Dynasty Warriors Origins Reviews Compare?</h2>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins is the highest-rated game in the franchise’s history!</strong></p>



<p>Using Metacritic, and without historical data for 1997’s very first Dynasty Warriors, I can tell you Origins’ main Metacritic score of 80 out of 100 is a record high. Dynasty Warriors 3 and 4 are the closest competitors with a rating of 78 out of 100—so congratulations to Dynasty Warriors Origins for being the best yet.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at how every other DW title compares to Origins from a Metacritic standpoint.</p>

			<p>The next big thing could be announced or revealed pretty much any day now, but there’s still a last few jobs to finish while the Nintendo Switch remains Nintendo’s latest and greatest. Among them is putting the final pieces of the puzzle in place for the Donkey Kong series, uniting the whole franchise on one platform. The early port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/04/nintendo-have-gone-the-extra-mile-for-donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-on-switch/">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> was joined in 2020 by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/08/nintendo-switch-online-july-update-donkey-kong-immortal-natsune-wrestling/">the SNES trilogy on Nintendo Switch Online</a>, while the tail end of 2024 saw the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/donkey-kong-land-lands-on-nintendo-switch-online/">Game Boy’s Donkey Kong Land trilogy added</a>, and now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-returns-to-switch/">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> is putting the penultimate piece of the puzzle in place. Really, the only game left to reunite the whole simian platforming family on Switch is Donkey Kong 64.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Country Returns HD — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHYL0-4XrUk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/12/05/review-donkey-kong-country-returns/">Donkey Kong Country Returns is one of the best platformers of the Wii era</a>. The two Super Mario Galaxy games were exceptional, of course, but we were also a few years on from Nintendo’s return to side-scrollers with New Super Mario Bros. on Nintendo DS, jumping to Wii in 2009. Donkey Kong Country Returns was born out of Retro Studios’ love of Rare’s trilogy, looking to bring the same kind of ethos to a new generation, and it was a huge success.</p>


<p>DK and Diddy wake up one day to find their massive horde of bananas stolen by the Tiki Tak Tribe, the pair of them chase after them through the various distinct areas of Donkey Kong Island, from jungle to beach, from cliff faces to… a whole factory zone? It’s the fairly standard set-up with a clutch of levels within each area and you have to make a path through them (each area having multiple paths and an unlockable route) to a boss that’s been hypnotised and powered up by the Tiki Tak Tribe.</p>


<p>The platforming itself is inherently familiar, as you run and jump from left to right, though it has some DK-specific tweaks. Ground pounding can stun nearby enemies or interact with the world, some enemies need you to roll through them, and there’s a whimsical way that you can stop and blow at dandelion heads and propeller flowers to reveal their secrets.</p>
<p>And there’s tons of secrets. Almost all levels have the letters K-O-N-G to collect, and a bunch of puzzle pieces that are hidden behind scenery or in bonus areas. It will take a good deal of hunting to find them all, the rewards being some extra challenging levels, or things like gallery art, music and other extras.</p>
<p>Grab a DK barrel and Diddy can join in, hopping onto DK’s back to provide you with a second batch of hit points and boost your jumping with a jet pack. Alternatively, Diddy is player 2 in co-op, keeping that jet pack jump separate and having a pop gun in place of DK’s ground pound. This can actually lead to the game being quite a bit more challenging, since you don’t have both players with the expanded movement of Diddy’s jet pack.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns is renowned for being a challenging platformer, and that absolutely holds true. Though it’s moderately forgiving by giving you multiple hit points, and there’s usually a couple of checkpoints and lives are plentiful, the mine kart and rocket barrel levels are all insta-kill stages that can become quite frustrating through trial and error.</p>
<p>Everything brought to the game with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/05/17/quick-review-donkey-kong-country-returns-3d/">the Nintendo 3DS port</a> is brought forward to Nintendo Switch, so for the game difficulty you have a choice of “modern” mode with three hearts per ape and “original” mode with two, and you have more flexibility with buying things from Cranky Kong’s shop and equipping them in the inventory. Across both modes, multiple deaths eventually see you offered the help of Super Kong, which will have an AI play through the level for you, though you forego any of the things he collects.</p>

<p>Visually, this looks pretty much like you would expect it to. If you didn’t go back and look at comparisons, you’d happily assume that it’s just the game on Wii running at a higher resolution. The art direction absolutely holds up to this day – the silhouetted levels really stand out as a stylistic treat – though it does feel of its era in some ways and DK definitely isn’t as lusciously hairy as he is in Tropical Freeze. Curiously, catching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=donkey+kong+country+returns+hd+comparison">a few comparison videos,</a> it does seem as though the Switch visuals are a tad more muted, with lighting highlights having a cooler tone to the more golden hues of the original. It’s a cleaner looks to the game, that’s for sure.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-country-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> is set to return yet again. The fourth entry in the Donkey Kong Country series bounded onto Wii in 2010, was revived as Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D on the 3DS in 2013, and now, over a decade later, Nintendo returns to the well with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD for the Switch. You definitely can’t say The Big N hasn't recouped their original investment on this one.</p>
<p>Is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still a barrel-blasting bash here in 2025? Or has this once-ripe banana gone bad? Grab your red tie, it’s time to go to work on this one...</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As with the previous versions of the game, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD opens with the Tiki Tak Tribe (a bunch of sentient tiki masks that replace the series’ previous crocodilian baddies) stealing DK’s banana hoard. Naturally, DK grabs his buddy Diddy and charges off to pound some sense into them. That’s about all you get in terms of story, which shouldn't surprise anyone even passingly familiar with this franchise.</p>
<p>As the title on the box implies, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD updates the original game’s standard-def image, giving everything a sharper, more high-contrast look. Donkey Kong Island looks nice enough in HD, although the game’s visuals don’t quite wow like they did 15 years ago. While some effects and background elements do look slightly “off” in this version, most of the game’s less-attractive moments are simply a case of the higher resolution and brighter lighting highlighting shortcomings in the original assets. At least the game runs at a nice, smooth 60fps most of the time, with the few minor hiccups I noticed being countable on a single hand.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For those coming to Donkey Kong Country Returns for the first time, our fuzzy hero’s abilities are simple, with no real power-ups to speak of aside from occasionally being able to hop on Rambi the rhinoceros. DK can jump, bounce on enemies, roll, pound the ground, and in a quirky addition for this game only, blow on items like flowers and pinwheels. DK feels a bit heavy and unwieldy at first compared to platforming contemporaries like Mario, but you should get used to controlling the big ape fairly quickly. The original game required a bit of Wiimote waggle to use some abilities like the ground pound, but, to the relief of most I suspect, you can now execute all actions with simple button presses. That said, the game’s control scheme still isn't perfect -- ground pound and your roll attack being assigned to the same button can result in accidents where you tumble into oblivion without meaning to.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In addition to his own abilities, DK can sometimes free Diddy from a barrel, who will hop on your back, doubling your health and giving you a limited rocket-boost for crossing gaps. Diddy's abilities are a nice level-up to DK's, but partner barrels are often irritatingly limited, and while you don't technically <em>need </em>Diddy to complete any of the game's challenges, some of the tough-as-nails later levels feel pretty insurmountable without his rocket boost. The game also offers same-couch co-op with one player controlling DK and the other Diddy, although the mode doesn't offer any real benefit. In fact, if you and your buddy both die at the same time, as will happen often during more frantic sequences, you'll lose <em>two </em>lives instead of one. Co-op can certainly be fun, but realistically, it's often more trouble than its worth.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of level design, Donkey Kong Country Returns was designed to be a continuation of what Rare laid down with the original SNES DKC trilogy, with simple, challenging stage layouts that push the player forward at a steady pace, as well as plenty of precarious jumps, things to swing on, barrel cannons, and yes, those dang mine carts. Everything feels a bit more fluid here due to the game being fully polygonal, replacing the sometimes-stiff pre-rendered visuals of the original DKC games, but not everything always feels as smooth as it could.</p>
<p>In retrospect, developer Retro Studios was clearly still finding their footing a bit here. While there's plenty of variety to be found in DKCR, with individual levels serving up unique challenges like outwitting a giant octopus, running from a horde of bugs, avoiding crushing waves, and more, there are times when the game gets in a bit of a rut, serving up several similar levels in a row. This is particularly egregious once you get to World 4, as Retro, in their infinite wisdom, decided it should exist entirely of minecar and rocket barrel levels. Unlike the next entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a>, minecart and rocket barrel levels are one-hit kills in DKCR and will eat your lives for lunch, as they really require rote memorization to get through. I feel like World 4 might be a breaking point for some newer players.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Return’s difficulty may be something today’s players struggle with in general. This is a <em>hard</em> game, and that's coming from somebody who's played through more than his share of difficult platformers -- including this one back on the Wii! Playing the game again, it serves up a lot of moments where the challenge doesn't feel particularly fair, with deadly hazards you can't reasonably foresee coming and "gotcha" style platform layouts. Tropical Freeze was a lot better about presenting intense, challenging levels that didn't feel unfair.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There are ways to mitigate DKCR’s challenge, like visiting Cranky's Shop to buy extra lives, a temporary expansion to your heart meter, and other helpful items using the Banana Coins you find strewn around levels. You can also take advantage of the Super Kong feature, which will become available once you've died several times on a level. Super Kong will play the level for you, with you being able to take control whenever you like, which is a neat enough trick but not terribly satisfying, particularly when you realize that none of the collectibles grabbed after Super Kong is activated count toward your totals. Players can also choose to play on "Modern Mode" from the beginning of the game, which is essentially a rebranding of the "New Mode" from the 3DS version of the game, which gives you more hearts and some additional items to buy at Cranky's shop.</p>

<p>This slightly tweaked new difficulty option is pretty much all you can expect in terms of new content in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – aside from that, you just get what was included in the 3DS version. That said, there's no denying there’s a good amount of content here. The main campaign will take you a solid dozen hours to complete, and those looking to track down all those devilish K-O-N-G letters and puzzle pieces and beat all the maddeningly difficult secret levels will take at least twice that long. Still, one can't help but feel like more could have been done here. Donkey Kong Country Returns was a cutting-edge 2D platformer back in 2010, but it's been surpassed by a number of other games since then, with the superior Tropical Freeze being the most obvious point of comparison. With a few tweaks, the game could have been brought closer to modern standards, but as is, this silverback is starting to show its age.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</p>

			<p>A couple of projects I saw at Gamescom 20024 had their behind-closed-doors previews embargoed until a much later date, and one of them, a dark fantasy game called Project Pantheon, is now being revealed. It's a blend of two highly popular genres: extraction and action RPGs. The latter is very familiar ground for the developer Wolcen Studio, a team known for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cryengine-powered-action-rpg-wolcen-to-release-in-q1-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">namesake game</a> (formerly titled Umbra and crowdfunded via Kickstarter).</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology and targeting PC (there's already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Project_Pantheon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Steam page</a>), Project Pantheon will soon enter public testing. A Closed Alpha Test is scheduled to take place on January 25-26 and February 1-2 for European and North American players, with servers that support other regions coming up in a few weeks.</p>
<p>At Gamescom, I met with Game Director Andrei Chirculete, who provided me with a thorough overview of the game and also answered several questions. Wolcen Studio currently has around 110 employees between France and Romania and they are working on three projects of various sizes. Project Pantheon is the one closest to release, with a targeted Q4 2025 early access launch window and the plan to employ a seasonal system with a new season coming roughly every four months. Find the transcription of our conversation below.</p>

<p><strong>What was the original pitch for the game?</strong></p>
<p>When we started working on this project, one of the most important things for us was building it as a live game. We will consider it successful if it's still rather going strong in ten years from now on the market.</p>
<p>All the pillars we have here are in support of that. Right now, we're working hard on the combat side. We want to get good, fluid combat, and then, of course, every feature and mechanic we are putting in the game needs to have replayability because we're working on two fairly difficult genres. In both extraction and action RPGs, difficulty and progression systems are important to keep at the core of the game, and because we have a PvP component, we also need competitive systems. We have very strict anti-cheating stands. Last but not least, one big change for us as a company is that we are going forward with a community-driven development. When we started putting Project Pantheon together, the first thing we asked ourselves was, how do we make an MVP of this, put it in front of the community and start developing the game with that community?</p>
<p><strong>What's the world going to look like in Project Pantheon?</strong></p>
<p>Instead of a classic fantasy setting, the game takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe where all the different mythologies coexist, but all the gods have been mysteriously wiped out. Death is our central character. He's a cosmic entity that kind of picks up the pieces of a broken universe, and he recruits the players as his new Reapers. To get to the bottom of what happened, for one thing, but also helped him manage this situation, let's say. Let's have a look at that in the context of the extraction game. Death will give players a corner of his own universe as a base of operations, and that's the safe space where players can try on different things. They have access to crafting and other functionalities.</p>
<p>Eventually, they can head out from there to different maps in different mythologies, such as Olympus, Valhalla, or something like that. The goal sgenerally will be to follow objectives, kill other players, and go through various PvE encounters (including some bosses), but ultimately, the goal is to survive and extract back into the sanctuary. If the players manage to do that, they get to keep everything they've accumulated along the way; if they don't, they will lose what they've got, excluding the progression. The progression they get to keep, like, the quest progression.</p>
<p>The sanctuary is essentially a collection of buildings that you have to upgrade. Well, first, you have to build them, then operate them, and each one has a very distinct functionality attached. For example, storage space and crafting. There's a playing area that allows the players to test their play style. There are also some passive bonuses, for example, when you respawn after dying, what kind of bonuses. There are even some aesthetic options, such as changing the lighting in your sanctuary. On the loop side, something we're doing differently compared to traditional action RPGs is that we've moved a lot of what the playstyle means from the character to the gear that he is wearing.</p>
<p>You are what you wear. All the abilities, passive and active, come from the gear that the player is equipped with, and this feeds into a system related to the in-game economy, which we think is the secret sauce to extraction games. We believe you can't really have a feeling of anxiety about losing an item or extracting with an item and being super happy about it unless that item actually holds value in the in-game economical model.</p>

<p><strong>Can you talk about the art direction of Project Pantheon?</strong></p>
<p>There are three main important pillars here: post-apocalyptic, grounded fantasy, and mythologies. On the post-apocalyptic side, we're trying to build a fantasy post-apocalypse. Think Valhalla destroyed or Mount Olympus in ruins, not zombies or nuclear fallout or anything like that. On the grounded fantasy side, we are speaking to our roots with our fantasy, and we're trying to really build everything by focusing on the logic of how the world ended up where it is. For each faction, we're looking into how they reached a certain point, and of course, with each mythology, we're looking at the technology level, what they would have access to in terms of armor, weaponry and so on.</p>
<p>On the mythology side of things, we're going to start with Norse and Egyptian for early access and then adding Greek and Aztec throughout the early access. We will add more mythologies post-launch. Each mythology has several maps, about three, each with a unique boss attached to them.&nbsp; Each mythology also brings its own storyline and between fifty and sixty quests. Of course, some new, unique characters are introduced with each one.</p>
<p>There are between five and six factions for mythology, and then we have the items, which in my mind are the most important ones because we introduce about a hundred new items into Project Pantheon with each mythology, bringing more than a hundred abilities for the players to play with.</p>
<p><strong>How important is customization going to be?</strong></p>
<p>A lot. The sanctuary will be fully customizable. The playable character, of course, as well as stuff like armor and weapons.</p>

Of course, some new, unique characters are introduced with each one.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What does monetization look like in the game?</strong></p>
<p>We're building it as a free-to-play live service. First, we want to reach as wide an audience as possible, and more importantly, we want to avoid any kind of pay-to-win mechanics. That's why we're looking at customization options and selling them through traditional means like season passes and starter packs rather than selling any kind of advantage in the game.</p>
<p>We're also investigating the subscription model. Take as an example Dota Plus, which gives players access to a bit of analytics about their own gameplay style without actually providing them with any kind of advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Did you do some internal and external playtesting yet?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of market validation, we conducted a couple of external playtests to figure out if we're not crazy and that this game mode actually has some fans. We started out with North America and Europe, and we've done South Korean and a Southeast Asian playtest. In each case, we've had great results, with players engaged with the two in-game loops, albeit in different ways. The Western audience was more focused on the action RPG elements, whereas the Asian audience was more focused on the competitive side of things. That just reflects the different markets.</p>
<p><strong>Where are you when it comes to progress?</strong></p>
<p>We started this in February 2023 by conceptualizing the whole game. We then built a prototype until October 2023 and used that prototype for the market validation I was talking about earlier. Then we began production in April 2024. Now, we intend to have a cadence of at least two Closed Alpha tests every two months until we release the game on early access. The reasoning behind this is because of that pillar of community-driven development. We want to start forming that community.</p>

<p><strong>Is the map randomly generated in any way?</strong></p>
<p>Originally, we tested having the map be randomly generated, and what we discovered was that extraction as a game mode lends itself to player knowledge. As a player, you want to gain knowledge and learn the map so that you can be efficient when you venture into a session. The randomly generated maps simply didn't work very well, so we reverted to doing more traditional maps and then figuring out what elements we could randomize. For example, extraction spots are randomized.</p>
<p>There are some dungeons which sometimes might be there, sometimes might not. So we still have some randomization going on while you're playing Project Pantheon, but yeah, as you're going through it, you're gonna encounter some PvE combat.</p>
<p>Eventually, after going through the monsters, you're going to potentially run into some people. This obviously has a couple of choices. You can choose to stay and fight or just run away. We've seen all sorts of behaviors. The reason we like the extraction loop and why we chose it is because, unlike in the Battle Royale genre, this is a mode in which all the players can be winners. You can have multiple winners. Players could go in and fight it out, if they feel like it, but they don't have to in order to reach their objectives.</p>
<p>We also believe strongly that there's a lot of variety in playstyle with this type of game. You will have players who go in very fast, enter the map, get the job done and get out. You will have others who cherrypick everything. There's no right way to play, we just want to give everyone the tools to play however they prefer. Some players are just going to stand by an extraction point and wait for players to go extract so that they can steal everything that they've got.</p>
<p><strong>Is the amount of active skills finalized yet?</strong></p>
<p>There are six active skills. We've made the weapon more impactful in the build, so your abilities are going to come from the weapon that you're using. You also have a defensive option that comes from your boots, which will either provide you with a shield, a dash, or some other kind of defensive mechanic. We also have a special slot for an artifact item that gives you your ultimate ability. As I said earlier, the gear itself provides you with what you have as a playstyle. The armor also provides you with some passive abilities.</p>
<p><strong>How does the extraction work in Project Pantheon?</strong></p>
<p>You have to find one of these obelisks that spawn dynamically on the map, charge it up for a while, and then hold your ground type of situation.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'An important thing I want to point out is that while doing this in Unreal Engine 5, we knew that UE5 is really power hungry, so we tried to optimize everything and make it as efficient as possible so that we could achieve good performance on low-end graphics cards with 60 frames per second. Right now, we're benchmarking against GeForce GTX 1650 GPUs.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Can you talk about some of the mythologies?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. In the Norse mythology world, we have a Viking village that is inhabited by the unworthy, the unworthy being the souls of people who died dishonorably. More specifically, they didn't die in battle, bringing shame on themselves. We're always trying to bring elements of the world that make it fantastical because these are mythological planes, they are not real life. We also want to explore various myths with each mythology. For example, there are camps home to the berserker faction. These berserkers have gone so far into animal powers that they've almost become the animals they were tapping into.</p>

Right now, we're benchmarking against GeForce GTX 1650 GPUs.</p>
<p><strong>I do hope that you can still enable some eye candy if you have a powerful PC!</strong></p>
<p>Of course, of course, yes, you can go up in graphics with a strong PC.</p>
<p><strong>How many players are going to be in one session of Project Pantheon?</strong></p>
<p>We have smaller maps with six players and some larger ones with sixteen. We've tested with as many as forty players. The real thing here is that we need this community building so that we can properly test the game and see how the number of players influences its dynamics so we can fully make a decision. Right now, these are intended numbers.</p>
<p>We're also going to have social features, like being able to add friends to a party. There is even a proximity chat so that players can maybe negotiate with one another as they're playing. But those will be coming a bit later towards early access.</p>
<p><strong>Is there trading in the game? If so, how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there is an in-game auction house like that seen in World of Warcraft. You don't spend real money, just in-game money. You have to extract the goodies, and then you trade from your sanctuary.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We found the extraction genre very intriguing, specifically because it's like a Battle Royale where many players can win. But we also found that a lot of people, ourselves included, wanted to play an extraction game but not a shooter. All the currently available extraction games are shooters.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Well, Project Pantheon certainly looks interesting. I don't believe there is an extraction action RPG yet, and the concept might have potential.</strong></p>
<p>Actually, that's how we started this endeavor, in a way. We found the extraction genre very intriguing, specifically because it's like a Battle Royale where many players can win. But we also found that a lot of people, ourselves included, wanted to play an extraction game but not a shooter. All the currently available extraction games are shooters.</p>
<p><strong>You've previously made the action RPG Wolcen. Is there anything in particular that you took from that game to this one?</strong></p>
<p>For sure the classless part, and some learnings on the technical side. Wolcen was developed with some pretty old tech, which made it unsustainable in the long run. That is why when we built this new project from the ground up, we chose to go with things that we know can scale and work well, both in terms of an engine, backend system, server system, et cetera. The same learnings will apply to a future Wolcen game, but that is coming a little bit later down the line.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you a lot for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer Wolcen Studio has announced&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon</em>, a game the studio describes as a "first-of-its-kind" experiment set in a world inspired by mythology.</p>

<p>In a press release, Wolcen Studio describes&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>as an "ExtrAction RPG" offering "intense" hack-and-slash gameplay in an extraction-style framework. Think&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>crossed with&nbsp;<em>Diablo IV&nbsp;</em>and it seems like you'll be most of the way there.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why you'd want to add yet another live service game to your slate in the year of our lord 2025, Wolcen Studio's answer lies with that unique blend of gameplay styles, which director Andrei Chirculete describes as a "fusion of different, exciting gameplays".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolcen-developer-project-pantheon-combat.jpg?itok=ztnRgCOC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolcen-developer-project-pantheon-combat.jpg?itok=SXt9d-QP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>is the next game from Wolcen Studio, and yes, it's live service.</figcaption></figure><p>Lest you doubt that this is the direction&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>is taking, the press release describes the game as a "free-to-play live service game", so this will very much represent a break from the one-and-done payment model of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wolcen-lords-of-mayhem" rel="nofollow"><em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem</em></a>.</p>

<p>Wolcen Studio is promising "dynamic PvPvE combat" across a range of "diverse maps". You'll explore these maps, gather loot, and contend with both enemies and opposing players before attempting to extract with the loot you've gathered.</p>

<p>If you do so successfully, you'll be able to keep what you collected, but failure might result in "losing [your] gear for good". In other words, it's a fairly typical extraction-style gameplay loop, but with a&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>face.</p>

<p>You'll also have access to a hidden base where you can customize your loadout, experiment with gear, and engage with&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon</em>'s upgrade systems. The game will feature a "player-driven economy" too; let's hope it pans out better than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-trading-disabled-another-economy-breaking-bug" rel="nofollow">some other online games' marketplaces</a> have.</p>




<p>If you want to give this one a try, a closed alpha test is being held for European players on the weekend of January 26th, with a North American alpha test coming the following weekend. You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Project_Pantheon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publiosher Bandai Namco and developer Rebel Wolves have unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, a narrative-focused dark fantasy action RPG set to arrive on PC and current-gen consoles at some point in the future.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've heard Rebel Wolves' name before, that's probably because it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-game-director-starts-rebel-wolves" rel="nofollow">the studio set up</a> by&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&nbsp;</em>director&nbsp;Konrad Tomaszkiewicz back in 2022. Back then, the studio said it was working on an action RPG in Unreal Engine 5, and&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>is that very RPG.</p>

<p>Set in an alternate-history 14th-century Europe, the game will revolve around Coen, a man transformed into one of the titular Dawnwalkers. You've got 30 days and nights "to save your family or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-announcement-landscape.jpg?itok=PvC23Oie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-announcement-landscape.jpg?itok=GTHsShdT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>casts you as not-quite-a-vampire Coen.</figcaption></figure><p>Tomaszkiewicz says his game is inspired by "classic RPGs" and that he wants players to "feel the sense of urgency in an open-world game".</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;Tomaszkiewicz,&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>will offer "multiple approaches to saving Coen's family", and there will be "no clear division" between the main story and sidequests. You can, he says, "decide on how you spend the time".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that you won't be able to complete all of&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>'s "stories and arcs" before the 30 days and nights have elapsed, so each playthrough will be unique. That sounds like an impressive boast.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer below if you want to get a sense of what&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>'s atmosphere will be like. Technically, there's also a little gameplay footage, although it's real blink-and-you'll-miss-it stuff.</p>




<p><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-country-returns-is-a-little-easier-on-the-switch-%E2%80%94-but-still-hard-as-hell.1081776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a game about collecting bananas and throwing barrels,<em> Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> is surprisingly inventive. The game, which originally launched on the Wii in 2010, takes the classic SNES side-scroller and steadily infuses it with new ideas, creating an experience that’s at times both tense and thrilling. You’ll do everything from fly a rocket through bat-filled caves to avoid the tentacles of a giant squid. It gets <em>intense</em>. It’s also a game that’s known for being very hard. But a new port on the Switch makes it slightly easier to enjoy all of those thrills without getting too frustrated.</p><p>It’s called <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, and it’s basically what it says right there in the title: the original game but with cleaned-up graphics. Fundamentally, there isn’t a lot of difference. The premise, which involves an evil mask turning a bunch of animals against Kong, remains the same, as do the levels you’ll explore; though, as a nice bonus, the port does include stages that were previously only available in the 3DS version of the game.</p><p>And just like the 3DS version, the Switch game has two modes to play through. One, called “Original,” is exactly what it sounds like, a straight port of the Wii game. The other is called “Modern Mode.” It doesn’t actually change the difficulty but instead offers a greater selection of helpful boosts, the option to carry nine of those items at once, and an extra heart by default. There’s also a returning feature called the “Super Guide.” If you die a few times, this option will appear, and it lets you watch a playthrough of the level so you can see what you’re doing wrong. It also lets you bypass the level altogether, so you can skip troublesome stages and come back to them later.</p><p>That’s important because, like I said, this game gets <em>hard</em>. There are precarious jumps to navigate, scenes where you have to fire yourself out of a barrel at just the right moment, and multistage boss battles that will test your patience. That hasn’t changed here, but the game gives you more ways to deal with the frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s worth it because <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> is a delightful game. It may not have the whimsy or playfulness of something like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, but that doesn’t make it any less creative. While there are standard stages where you hop around, stomping on bad guys, the best parts of <em>Returns</em> have an almost cinematic feel. There are perilous minecart levels that force you to react quickly as the world crumbles around you. There are levels where you’re avoiding destructive forces — like the aforementioned squid or devastating waves — as you inch your way to the goal. It can have the vibe of a high-stakes action movie, only, you know, you’re playing a giant monkey wearing a tie.</p><p>Sure, we’re at the tail end of the Switch’s life, but you could do a lot worse for the end of a console than ports of games like <em>Returns</em> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>. The series has a sense of tension and scale that set <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> apart from other side-scrollers, and <em>Returns</em> might be the one that pushes it the furthest. Now, it’s simply a little more approachable — without losing any of its original bite.</p><p><small>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD<em> launches on January 16th on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
