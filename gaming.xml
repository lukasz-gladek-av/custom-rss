            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-acquires-tracabs-advanced-tracking-technology-for-ea-sports-titles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>it's been announced today that Electronic Arts has acquired TRACAB's Advanced Tracking Technology to help provide a more accurate and precise experience in its EA SPORTS titles. The company has reached an agreement to acquire TRACAB Technologies, a leader in advanced sports optical tracking and analysis solutions. This will prove to be highly beneficial for the future EA SPORTS titles, where it plans to leverage the power of TRACAB's technology, where it will be able to utilize advanced AI, machine learning, and real-time sports data to create realistic animation and provide an experience that is lifelike and similar to the real-world action of sports.</p>
<p>"Our EA SPORTS games are becoming living, breathing simulations of sport, and TRACAB's cutting-edge technology and expertise in real-time data capture and analysis will enable us to enhance realism, immersion, and engagement in all our experiences," says Cam Weber, President of EA SPORTS.</p>
<p>While the company has acquired the technologies, EA SPORTS is looking ahead at how it will be able to utilize TRACAB beyond games, looking into the company's vision for the EA SPORTS app to be the leading interactive sports platform in the world. It's been said by Electronic Arts that the acquisition is expected to close in EA's first fiscal quarter of FY26. The company's sports titles have been incredibly popular, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> being an instant hit.</p>
<p>"Joining EA SPORTS marks an exciting new chapter for TRACAB Technologies. Our mission has always been to push the boundaries of sports data and analysis, and with EA SPORTS' vast resources and vision for innovation, we're confident that we can create even more immersive and dynamic experiences for sports fans around the world," says Martin Brogren, GM of TRACAB Technologies.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with TRACAB Technologies, the technology utilized by the company tracks almost everything that is happening on the field or pitch at 60Hz per second. That means it's generating 600 million data points per game, as well as 65 unique data points per player and referee. It does this by capturing live skeleton data from 21 joints on each body on the pitch.</p>
<p>Doing this provides a new sense of realism for the player and can allow for more dynamic animation and real-time simulation, and it will prove to be incredibly beneficial for Electronic Arts when developing its new sports games.</p>
<p>Aside from the games being made by the company, combining the game engine with the work of TRACAB's Technologies aims to provide fans with new opportunities to create highlights and predictive simulations that they can upload on the EA SPORTS App.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-the-ea-sports-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA SPORTS App</a> is only available in Spain, but there are plans to expand it and make it available in other regions across the globe.</p>

And that’s cool I guess, but why did they include a very overused  sound effect of kids laughing? And why does it pop up not just once, but <em>twice </em>in the 15-second clip? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106">As announced last February</a></span>, Marvel’s upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766">MCU</a></span> reboot of the Fantastic Four is set to hit theaters this July.

Since that announcement last year, we’ve not seen much else of <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>. But that changed today with a small teaser that also contains a really annoying sound effect. </p><p>On February 3, Marvel teased a trailer because it’s 2025 and that’s just a normal thing we have to deal with now. In the short teaser we see some kids running and laughing as they try to cram themselves in front of an array of TVs in the display window of a 1960's store. The televisions are preparing to show a rocket launch involving Marvel’s famous family. I hope nothing bad happens! We’ll see more in the full trailer tomorrow. </p><p>But instead of enjoying this little teaser for the new <em>Fantastic Four </em>movie, I was distracted immediately by a sound effect I’ve heard oh so many times before. You’ve undoubtedly heard this sound effect, too. It’s a group of kids laughing in a weird, somewhat unnatural way and it’s popped up in games, movies, TV shows, commercials, trailers, and songs. </p><p>This sound effect is known as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Group Kids Laug PE143601</a></span>" and was found on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Premiere Edition Volume 1</a></span> sound effects library produced by Hollywood Edge in 1990. This sound effect, which was originally recorded in 1983 for <em>Indiana Jones and the</em> <em>Temple of Doom</em>, has appeared in a very long list of movies, TV shows, and more since it was added to that sound effect library in the ‘90s. And weirdly, it keeps getting used decades later. Here’s a clip from the Netflix animated show <em>Wonderoos</em> that contains the laughing kids: </p><p>Apparently, this effect (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598">like the Wilhelm Scream</a></span>) has just become a standard option for sound engineers and designers in Hollywood. As someone who instantly recognizes this sound effect the moment it pops up in a movie or game, its continued use in 2025 is annoying. </p><p>And to bring this back to the <em>Fantastic Four</em> teaser, I’m honestly shocked and perplexed that the marketing folks behind it decided to include the effect twice in such a short clip. I’d bet money that in the full movie this sound effect won’t be used twice in such a short timespan (it might not even appear at all) as it’s really distracting and noticeable when it plays back to back like that. </p><p>Anyway, I guess I’ll listen out for this annoying sound effect when<em> Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> arrives in theaters on July 25, 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Grand Theft Auto V actor Ned Luke, who played Michael in the incredibly popular game, has spoken out about his thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. He said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKXTE2S5mM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fall Damage</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1886459125304799531" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Dexerto</a>) that he's confident the game will be "fantastic," going on to say no one ever knows what to expect from Rockstar Games, and that's part of the reason why he's so eager to see what the studio is cooking up.</p><p>"You never know what Rockstar is going to do," he said. "What I tell people is, be patient. It's going to be worth the wait. From what I've seen, it's going to be amazing. They're going to blow our [GTA V] numbers away."</p><p>By "numbers," Luke was referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gtav-generates-800-million-in-24-hours/1100-6414611/" data-ref-id="1100-6414611">$800 million that GTA V earned in its first 24 hours back in 2013.</a> Luke said he expects GTA VI to make $1.3 billion in its first day.</p><p>Before this, DFC Intelligence said it was expecting GTA VI to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">40 million copes and earn $3.2 billion in its first year</a>, including $1 billion from preorder revenue alone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKXTE2S5mM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vUKXTE2S5mM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also in the interview, Luke pointed out how his character, Michael, has never been brought back to GTA Online. GTA V's other two main characters, Trevor (Steven Ogg) and Franklin (Shawn Fonteno), did come to GTA Online. A piece of GTA Online DLC revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-new-dlc-confirms-michael-is-still-alive-after-gta-5-story/1100-6499135/" data-ref-id="1100-6499135">Michael is still alive after the events of GTA V</a>, and this has led many to believe Rockstar might eventually release new GTA Online DLC that focuses on or at least includes Michael.</p><p>If Luke knows the answer, he's not revealing any secrets.</p><p>"If you look at GTA Online, for example, Michael hasn't been back on GTA Online. Maybe he's coming in a final DLC? Maybe he's not. Maybe [Michael, Franklin, and Trevor will be] in GTA 6, like [its online mode]. Maybe. Maybe not. You know Rockstar is not going to tell you anything. And if we say anything, you know they will not be very happy," Luke said.</p><p>Ogg, who played Trevor in GTA V, said previously that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-trevor-actor-wants-a-very-definitive-exit-in-gta-6/1100-6529064/" data-ref-id="1100-6529064">he wants his character to show up in GTA VI and then immediately get killed.</a></p><p>In other news, there is said to be "hope" by some in the video game industry that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA VI will cost as much as $100</a>, with other publishers raising prices as well to help the video game industry rebound. While some might want that, not everyone does, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">one prominent researcher believes the game will be $70.</a></p><p>GTA VI's first trailer was released in December 2023, and since then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">Rockstar has not said a word about the game</a>, while management at parent company Take-Two has only discussed the game at a very high level. That's expected to happen again this week, when Take-Two reports earnings on February 6.</p><p>GTA VI is set for release in Fall 2025, but some believe the game will be delayed to 2026. After all, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar Games release in the past 10 years has been delayed</a>, so it would be a break from tradition if the game is <em>not </em>delayed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-isnt-as-muscular-as-part-2s-because-it-doesnt-play-as-big-of-a-role-in-this-version<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Actor Kaityln Dever did not have to bulk up for her role as Abby in the upcoming second season of The Last of Us, despite her counterpart in Part 2 being known for her muscular physique. </p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/kaitlyn-dever-abby-the-last-of-us-didnt-need-muscles-exclusive-8784835">Entertainment Weekly</a>, The Last of Us showrunner Neil Druckmann noted that Abby in the game was able to maneuver through the world like Joel "in the way she can physically manhandle certain things". This is different from Ellie, who has a smaller and lighter frame. However, this kind of "brute" like manoeuvrability isn't so essential for Abby when it comes to the show. </p>
<p>"There's not as much violent action moment to moment," Druckmann explained. "It's more about the drama. I'm not saying there's no action here. It's just, again, different priorities and how you approach it," he continued, adding "[Dever] has the spirit of the game in her".</p>

</figure>
<p>
The Last of Us team "value performance over anything else", he added, and prioritised capturing "the essence" of a role, rather than just finding someone who looked like a carbon copy of the video game character.</p>
<p>"What I always loved about the idea was that you are going to continually be challenged as you were in season one," Druckmann furthered. "When you try to pick a hero, it's tough because we're human beings, we're not heroes. For every heroic act, there's someone who suffers on the other side who may see you reasonably as a villain. When you look at Kaitlyn, there's just something in her eyes where, even no matter what she's experiencing, you connect.</p><p>"It was important that we found somebody that we could connect to the way we connect to Bella [Ramsey, who plays Ellie]," Druckmann continued, adding the team would have "struggled to find someone as good as Kaitlyn" to play Abby.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, fellow The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin believes the second season will provide an "amazing opportunity... to delve into someone who is perhaps physically more vulnerable than the Abby in the game, but whose spirit is stronger... And then the question is, 'Where does her formidable nature come from and how does it manifest?' That's something that will be explored now and later."</p>

<p><a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-creators-set-stage-dense-episodes-season-2-exclusive-8783868">Elsewhere in the same conversation</a>, The Last of Us' showrunners hinted at how the team will adapt Part 2's story for TV in terms of its narrative structure. </p>
<p>"A big part of the theme of the second game is about perspective, how someone's hero could be someone else's villain and vice versa. It's weird to talk about a story where its structure could be a spoiler," Druckmann said. "I don't even know if it's worth mentioning where we landed because I think that's part of the fun for people familiar with the game to see how we approached that challenge in the show. I will just say that we gave it a lot of thought and tried different things. There are some deviations of where we place things."</p><p>Mazin added: "We certainly are going to mess around with time the way it was in the source material, but as Neil said, we messed around in ways that we felt were appropriate for the show.... When I say 'messed around', I mean scientifically determined in a narrative way what we thought would be most impactful."</p>
<p>This 'messing around' will also include the introduction of new characters, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara's still to be officially named role</a>. And there's another character mentioned who doesn't directly feature in the game who's set to show up during The Last of Us' season two.</p>
<p>"There is a pretty prominent character that is talked a lot about in the game, similar to what we did with Frank [Murray Bartlett] in season one, that is in this season," the showrunners teased. "There's a very, very cool casting that I hope we can talk about soon."</p>
<p>I personally have a theory as to who this will be, which I will post in the comments section below with a spoiler tag.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">second season of The Last of Us is set to debut in April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>"The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you," Mazin said in June.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part 2's story will not be told in full during season two, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">subsequent seasons expected to wrap up the narrative</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a captivating narrative filled with twists and turns, fleshed-out characters that grow throughout the game, and a satisfying conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>&nbsp;is an open-world RPG that kicks off at the end of the story. You're thrust into the action as Godwin, the secondary character you play as, before looping to the beginning. There you take control of Henry, the hero of the original&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cb6f580f-038c-4f95-90ec-a847ce31bae1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-review-thy-will-be-done" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em></a>, as he escorts <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3556962e-418e-46ca-b4c8-cdc71492dfc6" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-amorous-adventures-of-bold-sir-hans-capon-review-fools" rel="nofollow">Hans Capon</a> on a messenger mission. Things go awry as the group is attacked by bandits, the letter stolen, and the duo is left with nothing. After separating, Henry has to figure out how to get into Trosky Castle, meet with Otto von Bergow, and find Hans Capon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Immediately I was struck by how gorgeous the environment is and how realistic the people are. Small facial tweaks, wrinkles, and blemishes are present on almost every character you meet no matter their importance. The care in designing a beautiful game is fully apparent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the opening sequence of events, you'll be able to explore the first map to your hearts content. There are a plethora of side quests, tasks, and treasures to find in the great outdoors. On top of that, there are dice to play and shooting competitions to partake in. I easily could have spent 20 or more hours honing my skills before even moving forward in the main storyline. Things get complicated when you do progress in the story, as Capon and Henry are able to meet von Bergow, only to get thrust onto the frontlines of the war raging across the region.</p>

<p>The expansiveness continues into the second map, where the side quests can rival the time spent for the main quests. This region is larger than the first, with bigger settlements and more points of interest. Here, you'll find plenty of action, whether it be defeating enemy soldiers, exploring mining tunnels, high-stakes dice games, or poaching a variety of game.</p>

<p>The main story has you stealing from the king, racing after a member of the church from Rome, and slaughtering all the enemy soldiers you can handle. For those looking for the best bang for their buck, you'll definitely be able to dive into Bohemia for at least 60 hours, getting the most for your money.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-trosky-region-forest-gym.jpg?itok=3FsMtHAq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-trosky-region-forest-gym.jpg?itok=I4qs3WJx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When it comes to the quality of the story, the narrative really shines. The story is consistent, covers multiple plot points across the various characters, and the dialogue is well-developed. Characters have unique personalities, with Dry Devil being a angry drunk, Adder being consistently aroused, Otto von Bergow being a silver-tongued politician, and Katherine being the world-weary woman. Hans Capon shows the most growth throughout the game, starting as a spoiled noble who makes senseless decisions at the cost of others and transforming into a thoughtful noble who cares for those under his wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quality of the story isn't just apparent in the cutscenes and major dialogue, but also woven into the environment of the world. Passing villagers will remark on current events, nobles will discuss political choices you've made around dinner tables, and the town crier will shout out what city was last razed. The information available in the codex reflects the historical research done by the development team and this reflects in the daily life of the people.</p>

<p>The downfall to this relates to the choices you have. While you make different decisions that can affect dialogue or reputation, the impact on the main story is negligible. The largest is whether to burn down a village or not, which can dictate access to side quests later on, but doesn't do anything besides that. For the most part, the choices you're offered only relate to the summary of the actions you receive at the end of the story. From a design perspective, it makes sense, but from a player perspective, I wished the choices had more weight in the story outcome.&nbsp;</p>

There are a few bugs throughout, like missing item names, typos, and glitching through walls. This will affect certain players more than others, especially those with older PC setups. The bugs, however, didn't affect overall gameplay and were more cosmetic than anything else. The most notable issue is when you meet Zizka for the first time as Godwin, as the audio and subtitles do not match. This occurs one other time towards the endgame, but is an easy fix that Warhorse Studios can quickly address.</p><p>
The biggest issue comes with the controls. Both keyboard and mouse and controller don't quite feel 100% smooth. Some things, like general gameplay and horseback riding, are better with a controller. Others, like selecting weapons or items, feel better with a mouse. Both encounter issues with pickpocketing, which can cause you to fail the minigame due to slow reactions and having to consistently use a button to move the selector to the next item. This can also impact potion making, which requires multiple timed stages that can be thrown out of sync due to slow movements.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>&nbsp;is a solid game with tons of content available to play through. This alone makes it worth the purchase, but the stellar narrative work and visual design make it an RPG that fans of the genre should check out, regardless of having experienced the first in the series. Many of the issues with the title can be addressed through future updates, with the controls being the largest problem players may consistently have.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-timeline/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hbo%E2%80%99s-the-last-of-us-season-2-will-%E2%80%98mess-around%E2%80%99-with-the-timeline-from-the-game.1099014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-timeline/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new interview with HBO’s The Last Of Us Season 2 showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, it’s been revealed that the timeline will be slightly different from the games source material.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-creators-set-stage-dense-episodes-season-2-exclusive-8783868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Druckmann said that there’s from “deviations of where we place things” in terms of the shows timeline compared to that of the game because of how a show has its own challenges.</p>



<p>We certainly are going to mess around with time the way it was in the source material, but as Neil said, we messed around in ways that we felt were appropriate for the show,” Mazin continued. </p>



<p>Of course, it’s impossible to know exactly what Mazin and Druckmann are referring to here, but fans familiar with the second game will know that a considerable character death does occur. In theory, it would make sense to keep said character alive for as long as possible, especially because the showrunners want it to continue well past season 3.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>“I think it’s pretty likely that our story will extend past a season 3,” Mazin says. “How far past? I can’t say. And that’s not to say that there are not other stories that could be told, but this story is the one that Neil and I are telling.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-last-of-us-season-2-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Season 2</a> will have seven episodes, with the showrunners promising “high-calorie, dense episodes.” Mazin went on to say that “each one of these episodes packs quite a wallop. You will not be bored.”</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 2 is scheduled to release sometime in April 2025, but no exact release date has yet been given.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the show? What do you think the showrunners did to mess around with the The Last of Us Season 2 timeline?</p>

		<p>EA has announced Battlefield Labs, a community collaboration project aiming to get direct feedback and shape the development of the next Battlefield by a group of studios that includes Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios – now under the collective name of Battlefield Studios.</p>
<p>The announcement video also gave us a very brief first look at the next Battlefield game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Battlefield Labs testing will go live in the coming weeks and sign ups are now live at<a href="http://battlefield.com/labs"> battlefield.com/labs</a>. Initial tests will be invite only and use players and servers in Europe and North America, before expanding in future waves. Taking part does require signing an NDA, so no public chit-chat will be happening until EA is good and ready to talk about the game some more.</p>
<p>DICE will remain primarily responsible for the game engine and the multiplayer side of the game, while the focus for Criterion has been on the single player – returning for this game after skipping Battlefield 2042. They’re being supported by Motive with multiplayer maps and single player content, while Ripple Effect is working on “an experience that is really going to open Battlefield to a whole group of new players”, but Senior Producer Ryan McArthur.</p>

<p>It’s curious to see how this group has been brought together, as while the Battlefield Studios brand is new, the collaboration between these studios is familiar – all uniting on a single game project is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/03/ea-announced-plans-for-connected-battlefield-universe-in-franchise-leadership-shakeup/">a far cry from the Battlefield universe that was envisioned back in 2021</a>. Criterion has often been brought in to assist, working on vehicular content for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/13/star-wars-battlefront-ii-review/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, the Firestorm battle royale mode for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/13/battlefield-v-review/">Battlefield V</a>, and was dragged away from Need for Speed to help with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/15/battlefield-2042-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-ps4-pc/">Battlefield 2042</a>. Motive’s closest ties to the franchise has been with creating the single player for Battlefront II – it’s a little unexpected to see them seemingly take a supporting role to Criterion on this.</p>
<p>Lastly there’s Ripple Effect, formerly known as DICE LA, and a part of the Battlefield 2042 development group creating Battlefield Portal, which transported classic Battlefield games, maps and modes into the new engine. A really fascinating side to the game that was one of the highlights from its launch. It’s not clear what they’re working on for the next Battlefield, but expect some kind of adjacent genre, if they’re looking to attract a new audience.</p>

		
		

<p>The video caps off with a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG. Is it possible that we’ll get the full building destruction back from Bad Company 2?</p>

The sequel expands on the first game with a bigger, more detailed world that includes new gameplay systems and a lengthier script. Does all of this extra stuff coalesce into something compelling and meaningful?</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>VGC</em>’s Jordan Middler</a></span>, the larger mix still feels cohesive and intentional in a way the first game’s did not. “This is Warhorse Studios’ <em>Witcher 3</em> moment,” he writes in his five-star review. “<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>is an extremely confident, accomplished, dirty, hilarious, and massively enjoyable RPG. The game tries a lot of things and executes on almost all of them very well, and its commitment to being ruthless must be applauded.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em>’s Katharine Castle</a></span> was similarly impressed but less in love with the finished product. “There’s a lot to admire here, sure, but you have to do so on its own terms,” she writes in her three-out-of-five star review. “It is a hard and maddening slog at times, but one that still has its moments where it surprises and quietly delights. Like the original, this isn’t an RPG designed to make you feel good - you continue to be little more than a passenger in this historical tapestry, following along behind the horse tails of Henry’s betters, and clearing up the mess they leave behind. Some will revel in that work, but I for one won’t be chomping at the bit for another sequel any time soon.”</p><p>Early reviews make <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> sound like its side quests and the way they’re woven together across its big world are a highlight, while combat remains a bit underwhelming, and text-heavy menus make navigating and learning about some of the systems a chore. The lock-picking mini-game is apparently terrible, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/1771300/discussions/0/591760496744510997/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1771300/discussions/0/591760496744510997/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as is saving the game</a></span>, and the beginning  seems hellbent on making players struggle to overcome even the simplest challenges.

And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it’s not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn’t get in the way of the other, and you’re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot.

Not everyone will vibe with its slow-paced and oftentimes tedious approach, but those willing to meet it on its own terms will find a compelling open-world RPG that relishes in player agency and the consequences of your actions.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h19388"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>While a few failures trigger a “game over”, many produce scenarios as winding and gratifying as any victory, and in any case, living life in Henry’s shoes has taught me to take the rain with the shine. In particular, I never wanted to simply overpower people the way blockbuster games teach you to, and Deliverance 2 met me halfway, initially, by having characters dunk on me when I tried to act the tough guy, or applaud me for being a good sport when I got my arse kicked. But after a series of mandatory plot skirmishes, my Henry has become a proficient and well-appointed combatant, because that is what KCD2 fundamentally requires him to be. It’s as though the game had assumed the role of that servant girl from my intro: it won’t let me get on with my day unless I consent to my own greatness.﻿<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h19389"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-pc/#:~:text=From%20its%20memorable%20cast%20of,that%20you%20shouldn't%20miss.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-pc/#:~:text=From%20its%20memorable%20cast%20of,that%20you%20shouldn't%20miss." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Trends</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The branching dialogue options and reputation system make for some engrossing moments.

Rather, it relies on several factors, such as my standing within a community and even the dirt or blood on my clothing.

The performances are excellent, it’s a major technical step up, and evolves the game beyond its foundation into something that embraces modern audiences without losing its identity. The original game turned away many due to its slow-paced, tedious aspects and technical shortcomings, and while the sequel exceeds on a technical level by far, the biggest shame will be if people still give it a miss because of the almost simulator-like mechanics.﻿</p></blockquote><h2 id="h19391"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>WindowsCentral</em></a></span><br></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Given that I was a big fan of the original title, I went into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 expecting to greatly enjoy the follow-up, too.

Combat is a strange dance of positioning both your hands and feet relative to those of your enemies, and charging into the fray even in the late game is liable to get you cut apart.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-new-battlefield-gameplay-as-ea-reveals-battlefield-labs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has delivered the first official look at the new Battlefield game as part of an announcement around player testing and its development set-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The brief glimpse at pre-alpha Battlefield gameplay comes as part of a video revealing what EA calls Battlefield Labs and an accompanying call to arms for playtesters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, EA revealed Battlefield Studios, the umbrella branding for the four studios it has working on the new Battlefield. These are the series’ main Stockholm, Sweden-based developer, DICE, Dead Space remake and Star Wars: Squadrons developer Motive, U.S. studio Ripple Effect (formerly known as DICE LA), and UK studio Criterion, whose work on Need For Speed has now come to an end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE in Sweden is building the multiplayer for the new Battlefield. Motive is working on single-player missions and multiplayer maps. Ripple Effect is working on bringing in new players to the Battlefield franchise. And Criterion is working on the single-player campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As already announced, the new Battlefield sees the return of a traditional single-player linear campaign after 2021’s Battlefield 2042 went multiplayer only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA said its collective Battlefield Studios teams are now entering a “critical” phase of the development cycle, and want player feedback on what to prioritize, improve, and refine before release. To that end, Battlefield Labs will see EA test almost everything but not everything players see will be complete. Participants will have to agree to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before getting in.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/03/bf-labs-concept-art-1738588148146.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield Labs is designed to bring in playtesters for the new Battlefield. Concept art credit: Electronic Arts.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Even in pre-alpha, we are proud of where the game is at,” EA said. “We tirelessly playtest, but your feedback will supercharge our development as we strive to hit that perfect note between form, function, and feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is an unprecedented moment for Battlefield. We will start by testing the pillars of play, like core combat and destruction. Then transition to balance and feedback for our weapons, vehicles and gadgets, ultimately leading to where all these pieces come together in our maps, modes, and squad play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And yes, we will be testing Conquest and Breakthrough, the heart and soul of our all-out warfare experience, but BF Labs will also be a place to explore new ideas and fine-tune and improve Battlefield pillars like our class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon) to create deeper more strategic play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial invites will be limited to a few thousand participants with servers located in Europe and North America. Over time EA will invite tens of thousands more with support for further territories. It’s worth remembering that while EA is devoting four entire studios to Battlefield, last year it shut down Ridgeline Games, a Seattle-based developer that was working on a new supposedly standalone single-player Battlefield game with more of a story focus, and laid off all its staff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, EA revealed fresh details on its untitled Battlefield game alongside its first concept art. IGN also confirmed that Battlefield will return to a modern setting after stints in World War I, World War II, and the near future. The concept art suggested ship-to-ship and helicopter combat will be part of the new game, and that it will feature natural disasters like wildfires.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Vince Zampella, Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization, referenced Battlefield 3 and 4 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">an interview with IGN</a>. "I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3... Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there. But I think for me, it's that peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it's nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday… although I would say 1942 also."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The return to the modern setting represents a course correction for the series after Battlefield 2042, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/once-thought-dead-battlefield-2042-sees-huge-surge-of-players-during-free-weekend"><u>eventually found its footing</u></a> but was otherwise <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-open-beta-specialists-feedback-ea"><u>widely panned for features like Specialists</u></a> — characters that made it seem as if Battlefield was trying to be a hero shooter. Its ambitious 128-player maps also proved unpopular with fans who preferred a more focused experience. Battlefield 2042 eventually went back to supporting 64 players per map, and the next Battlefield plans to stick to that approach. Specialists are also out this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure on the next Battlefield is on after 2042’s missteps. EA CEO Andrew Wilson has called it one of the "most ambitious projects in [EA's] history," and based on the sheer number of studios involved, it’s a significant investment. The Battlefield Studios tagline is, “We’re all in on Battlefield.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, it's definitely betting bigger on Battlefield,” Zampella told IGN in the interview from 2024. “It's going in and expanding what Battlefield is. We have to have the core. The core Battlefield players know what they want. They've been with us forever, they've been amazing supporters. We need to earn their trust back and get them back on our side. And then it's expanding out and getting more players into the universe and seeing what we can do, so when you want a different experience, you don't have to leave Battlefield. You can experience more things within the Battlefield universe. So we're expanding the offerings that we're giving."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has yet to announce a release date, launch platforms, or a final title for the new Battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review.1098969/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some days I’ve moped about how I'll never get back the feeling I had the first time I played Skyrim. And then Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 arrived on a mighty steed to sweep me off my feet at full gallop. Armed with excellent, skill-focused melee combat and a rousing, action-packed medieval saga fit for a Hollywood blockbuster, it's one part sequel and one part coronation, bringing a lot of the original's ideas to fruition in the same way <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review">The Witcher 3</a> did for CD Projekt Red or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/17/greedfall-review">Greedfall</a> did for Spiders. No game of this scope and scale is without some technical scuff, of course, and its competing design goals are occasionally at war with themselves just as much as our hero Henry is internally. But even still, its majesty is hard to deny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tragic tale picks up almost immediately where Kingdom Come: Deliverance left off back in 2018, though I don't necessarily think you need to have played the first one to get up to speed thanks to the main plot being relatively easy to follow and most of the callbacks being well explained as they happen. Henry, a blacksmith's son turned unlikely warrior, is thrown into the middle of dynastic politicking and bloodshed played out by a diverse and complex cast, including your boisterous failson of a liege lord and some truly memorable entrances from real historical figures I don't want to spoil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The star that shines brightest across this expanse of countryside, though, is the city of Kuttenberg. I can't speak about this place in any terms less flattering than to say it might be one of the wonders of the modern RPG world. I don't think I've ever walked the streets of a virtual medieval city that feels this huge, detailed, and most importantly, alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layout is based largely on the actual town that still stands today, with parts of it following the modern street grid almost exactly. It's a wonderful place to simply wander around and discover all kinds of urban adventures – from resolving a dispute between two rival sword schools to hunting down a grisly serial killer. Yes, some of the NPCs obviously share the same voice actor and others share the same face – even important side characters, which can be particularly jarring. But it’s hard to get too hung up on that in a place like this. When I first arrived here I was already more than 40 hours into my 120-hour journey, and I spent multiple in-game days gleefully shopping for the sickest duds and best armor I could afford. And that's what arriving in a huge regional capital should make me want to do!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are around 100 quests, and practically every one was memorable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The quest variety is what impressed me most of all, and that extends beyond just Kuttenburg. Very rarely are you simply sent to kill some bandits or carry a package to the next town – at least without some kind of interesting twist, moment of emotional turmoil, or decision built in. There are around 100 quests in total and, having done nearly all of them, practically every single one was memorable enough that it would stand out as a highlight in a lesser RPG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, some were slightly better in concept than execution. There was one I stumbled onto completely by accident that took me deep underground and turned my sword-swinging adventure into a horror movie, but ended up being far too short for the dread to really set in. All the same, I never felt like doing side quests ever became a chore, because I knew each one would be its own little complete episode of The Adventures of Henry, stuffed with quality writing and unique objectives. It's a testament to how consistently strong they were that 120 hours did not feel way too long to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along the way are expansive, breathtakingly beautiful landscapes spread over two open-world maps, both of which are chock full of meticulously researched details of late medieval Bohemian life. There isn't a ton of variety in terms of geography – it's all wooded hills and meadows, for the most part. But that’s what the region looks like in real life. It's big enough to get lost in, and the contrast between villages and open wilderness varies things up nicely enough. I did find it odd that you can't go into most of the churches, though, since those would be near the top of my list if I were planning a tourist trip through 1400s Europe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the side quests are like episodes of a TV show, the main quest is a big-screen war movie that pulls out all the stops in its ambition, dialogue, and emotional range. Parts of it made me cheer. Parts of it actually brought me to tears. And Henry's ultimate nemesis got under my skin in a way video game bad guys rarely do, making me rethink everything I’d done up to that point in what might be one of the most memorable final encounters I've ever played through. It's mature without being edgy, it drips with historical authenticity, and it has interesting questions to ask you about what it means to be a hero or a villain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The main quest is like a big-screen war movie that pulls out all the stops.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's somewhat unfortunate, then, that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is both a mostly linear medieval action-drama and an open-world sandbox, and those two concepts don't always play well together. I'm going to skirt around spoilers the best I can, but I need to give a specific example of the worst experience I had. I need to tell you about the Hungarian Camp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one of the late-game areas, there is a military camp set up by King Sigismund, the evil conquering bastard you've been opposing since the first hour of the first game. I, of course, tried to assault it by myself the second I got there, and was immediately put down like a dog. Fair enough. But for the next 40 hours of adventuring, I was plotting my revenge. A fire was lit in me – motivation to become as much of a badass as possible. I studied with all of the best blademasters. I learned the way of the bow. I saved up for the best armor. I forged, by hand, the very best sword in Bohemia. Next time I showed up at that camp, things were going to be different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, near the end, I went back to the Hungarian Camp Rambo-style and I killed everyone there. Okay, not the cook or the tailor. And not Musa – Musa's cool. But probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 armed men. This was an empowering and gleeful rush, with difficult combat that tested all of my skills like never before. A real highlight of the entire journey. And these are enemy soldiers, let me remind you! I don't feel like this was an unpredictable or degenerate thing to do.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So it was a downer when, shortly after, I was asked to infiltrate this same camp as a spy, and Henry didn't even so much as mention that he had completely desolated the place and had a bounty on his head so large that the authorities would skip fines and prison and straight-up execute you if you're caught. This is a required story quest with no alternate path, so the ridiculous, frustrating solution was to sneak up on the unkillable quest NPCs several times to talk to them and start the next cutscene before that same NPC spotted me and went running to call the guards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also ruined my near-perfect reputation because I guess killing <em>invading enemy soldiers</em> was a crime the peasants Sigismund is actively oppressing couldn't forgive, and everyone in every town ended up hating me. But this was a major outlier in what was otherwise a hugely engrossing, marathon-length playthrough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than that one total debacle though, I truly adored almost every minute I spent with Henry and company. The tactical, skill-based sword combat is a sharp refinement of the already great system from the first game, though I felt like at higher levels, the balance of pure stats to player skill skewed too much in favor of the former. You could probably reach the credits without actually getting particularly good at the swordplay, which was certainly not the case in the first one. But it is cleaner, more varied, and smoother to play. Archery, in particular, has improved a lot.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Open World RPGs</h3><p>The best open world RPGs to play in 2025</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a blacksmithing minigame now, which I found a little bit clunky and unsatisfying, but it's still great to be able to use a sword I made myself in combat. And alchemy has been made way more intuitive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also really like the new perk system, where every level up feels like it gives you multiple choices between meaningful bonuses. In the first one, a lot of perks honestly felt more like side-grades than upgrades. There was a perk that made it so sleeping outside was more restful, but sleeping in a bed, less so. The sequel’s version only has the upside, and not the drawback, which is important if I'm going to spend my hard-earned skill points on something rather than picking it as a character background at the beginning. And while there wasn't a single quest as interesting or different as the monk arc from the original, getting to level up my scholarship and unlock new quest resolutions by destroying my enemies with facts and logic was also great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Did I mention that it runs really well on my 4070 Ti, even at 4K and very high settings? I still can't even run the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance at max settings on this same machine, and that game is seven years old at this point. So the optimization work that was done here deserves a shout. There are also plenty of bugs, but most of them are of the silly sort you screenshot to show your friends that you'd expect in an RPG with this much ambition. Only rarely did something actually disrupt my gameplay.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With tariffs by the US set to take effect on Tuesday, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) expressed concern about how they may affect the video game industry. In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/esa-statement-on-proposed-tariffs/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement on its website</a>, the ESA warned that import taxes on gaming devices would "negatively impact hundreds of millions of Americans."</p><p>The ESA, the trade association representing most of the major publishers in gaming, said that tariffs would "harm the [game] industry’s significant contributions to the US economy." The ESA ended the statement by saying it was looking forward to "working with the [Trump] Administration and Congress to find ways to sustain the economic growth" supported by the game industry. According to the ESA, total video game sales in the US <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-consumer-spending-on-video-games-totaled-58-7-billion-in-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached $58.7 billion in 2024</a>.</p><p>The US government is set to enact import taxes on Canada and China at 12 AM ET on February 4. Canada faces a 25% tariff on products imported to the US, while China, where technology products, including video game consoles, are manufactured, is looking at a 10% tariff. The Trump administration initially targeted Mexico, a hotspot for video game disc production, with a 25% import tax, but Trump agreed on Tuesday to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-sheinbaum-trudeau-017efa8c3343b8d2a9444f7e65356ae9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">halt planned tariffs on Mexico</a> for a month. All three countries have announced their own countermeasures, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-retaliation-trudeau-sheinbaum-70e067b092a3af72c2eb7ca37d532c91" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">retaliatory tariffs against the US</a>.</p><p>Trump also expressed intentions to enact tariffs on computer chips, a plan he still appeared keen on pursuing even after <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/despite-meeting-with-nvidia-ceo-trump-sticks-with-plan-to-tariff-foreign" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meeting with Nvidia CEO</a> Jensen Huang on Friday.

            <p>
If you could barely contain yourself when Minecraft added a bunch of new pig variants last month, you might want to hold onto something solid: Mojang is back with a brand-new content update for public testing, and this time we're talking <em>cows</em>.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Minecraft's <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/more-minecraft-game-drop-features">latest Java snapshot</a> includes a grand total of two cow variants. You've got your fur-covered cold cows who'll wander around those snow-covered biomes, as well as your warm cows who like to do their grazing in sandy biomes.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of which, Mojang has also introduced new ambient sounds for desert biomes, which include whispering sand, chirping crickets, rustling twigs, and howling winds. Additionally, players can place a dead bush on two outdoor sand blocks, or cluster sand and terracotta blocks together to bring some of that desert ambience back to their own bases.

<p>
Elsewhere, there's a lot going on in the world of bushes. Java snapshot players can also get acquainted with the new firefly bush, which does pretty much exactly what it sounds like - conjuring a dainty swirl of dancing lights around its branches at nighttime. It's found in swamps and other bodies of water, with players able to retrieve the firefly bush and grow it using bone meal back at base if they want to enjoy it closer to home. Additionally, the firefly bush can be placed under a block to give the block above a sparkly effect.
</p><p>
Still in the realm of shrubbery, Minecraft's final addition is the evocatively named "bush" - a new bush found in forests, birch forests, plains, windswept hills, and other green biomes. This can also be grown in bone meal if you need all the bushes, all the time.
</p>

<p>
All the above - as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-adds-new-pig-variants-ambient-falling-leaves-wildflowers-and-more-for-testing">new pig variants, ambient falling leaves, and wildflowers</a> added for testing in January - are available right now as part of Minecraft: Java Edition's latest snapshot, and can be accessed by enabling snapshots in the launcher's "Installations" tab. Mojang notes the new features are coming to Bedrock beta and preview "soon" - and everything currently in testing will get a full release at some point later this year.
</p>
<p>
Mojang hasn't yet said <em>when</em> Minecraft's first full content drop of 2025 is due, but it did previously confirm it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">changing the way it releases new content</a>. Gone is Minecraft's traditional mega-sized summer update, replaced by multiple smaller drops throughout the year.

            <p>Watch out for that falling breezeblock! It's about to-- ah, too late, you've been donked. A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka'd buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it's a lot of producers talking a big game about "levelling up" the "core experience", which seems to remain blasting a building you don't like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game's actual running and/or gunning.</p>

<p>Yup, sure looks like a Battlefield game. A rocket is fired into a building, lots of dust and rubble falls down around soldiers, a big tank parks itself helpfully in the middle of the road. </p>
<p>The producers chat from a hypescript for most of the rest of the video and hail from four different studios, all working on the game in some way or another: Dice, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect. We already knew most of what the video covers, including that the shooter will have a single player campaign, and that it'll take place in a modern or near-future setting. </p><p>The only new thing is mention of a program called "Battlefield Labs" in which members of the public can sign up for the chance to playtest the game. It seems like a fancy way of saying "sign an NDA and we'll give you a test build". EA (among other companies) commonly source playtesters from the public like this. Think of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skate-heelflips-into-my-calendar-with-an-early-access-release-some-time-in-2025">open and ongoing testing</a> done for another EA studio, Full Circle, who like to watch people play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> and presumably take notes when players fall and hurt their little bum-bums. </p>
<p>As for the four-studio unity on display, it is hard to take this display of corporate unity at face value. Criterion's role on the game means that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-have-delayed-need-for-speed-so-criterion-can-support-battlefield-6">plan to work on the next Need For Speed game is postponed</a>. And Electronic Arts did have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">a fifth crowd involved on the campaign</a> at one point - Ridgeline Games, a studio set up by Halo series veteran Marcus Lehto. But EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">shuttered that studio last year</a>. So, uh, no mention of them in this promo piece. Awkward.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
