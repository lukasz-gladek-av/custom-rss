			<p>A new Silent Hill 2 patch is now live on PC and PlayStation 5, addressing some PS5 Pro-specific issues and much more.</p>
<p>The 1.06 patch focuses on fixing various issues on both platforms, including the widely reported visual glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro. Other PlayStation 5-specific fixes include audio, map and blocker fixes, boss animations, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch also addresses many issues on PC, including the interference between saving a game and properly performing vibrations on the controllers, improved mouse sensibility and mouse input, and more. The full patch notes are available on Konami's <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/eu/en/update_106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>
<p>Despite some issues here and there, developer Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking Silent Hill 2, developing their best game to date. You can learn more about it by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Long before Hideo Kojima made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">the first triple-A walking simulator</a>, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.</p>
<p>Three sequels followed, and then Daddy Konami called time on the series. But Boktai lives on in the shape of <a href="https://chickenhat.itch.io/kura5-bonds-of-the-undying">Kura5: Bonds Of The Undying</a>, a non-canonical fangame which remixes the first game with one of its successors, Lunar Knights. It's a free downloadable experience, and as such, the old baked-in photometric functionality is gone, but the solar charging mechanic has been overhauled to work with an online real-world weather-tracking system. The 1.0 version launched this month - here's a trailer.</p>

<p>And here's some blurb from developer ChickenHat.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's neither a full remake nor a sequel, but a remix of both familiar Boktai staples and new elements that seek to recreate the magic that we all loved from the series. Kura5's weather system knows where you are in the real world, so there's no need for a solar sensor. In-game events may even play out differently depending on if you play in darkness or in light... And that's just the start!</p> </blockquote>
<p>The game gives you two characters, sun-gunning cowgirl Annie and vampire swordsman Emil. You can switch between them by playing in the day or after dark. That's right, Kura5 is designed to be played round the clock, but you can switch off the weather/day-tracking functionality and play offline if you prefer.</p>

        <p>A short, colourful FPS experiment with a free demo</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kill-the-man-in-the-house">Kill The Man In The House</a> is a video game title I can get behind. It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children's book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BPLXepRC8E">Ed Edd and Eddy</a>, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPSing</a>. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Kill The Man In The House - Kill House, I'm going to call it - you have a revolver, an uzi, and a shotgun. Press F for a satisfying kick. Press Space to double or even triple jump. Land a headshot and there's a chance you'll enter slow-mo for a brief period. Oh and red barrels explode. Follow the compass at the top of your screen to lead you to the aforementioned Man, and once he's been killed, you need to get back to your car. Fin.</p>
<p>While the assassination process is similar to lots of other minimalist FPS games, I do think Kill House' foundation is strong. The controls are responsive, the guns have character, and the gore is gratifying. Also, the layout of the demo's level is well thought out, with buildings and barrels positioned in ways to promote stylish violence.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/kill-the-man-in-the-house-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>cannibal</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Really, I think it's the game's surreal, polygonal art style and how that intertwines with the violence that elevates it beyond a normal FPS to a fun, experimental one. I love the feel of being a cold-blooded assassin seeking awful bastards who have taken up residence in kaleidoscopic reflections.</p><p>It's all about the little things, like how you start off next to your car, a bodyguard with his back turned to you -  a cue to punt him into the stratosphere. And how the demo opens up as you round a corner and the sharp corners unveil a jagged valley of reds and greens and yellows, the man's house nestled in this surreal condo. Not to mention that some enemies will slide and ragdoll upon death, leaving bloody trails that act like you've constructed your very own cobbled path to the next victim.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that there's no official release date just yet and that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2467950/Kill_the_Man_in_the_House/">Steam demo</a> is very short and composed of a single mission. But more updates are planned, with "many features and refinements to come". These include NPCs, pickupable, stackable and destructible objects, fire propagation, driveable cars, customisable loadouts, and large open-ended levels. Goodness me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The game won the fan-voted Game of the Year award at last night's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTDmABPisP8&amp;t=10102s">Golden Joysticks</a>, with Ji making the comment during his acceptance speech.</p>

<p>So what could those surprises be?</p>
<p>At the very least, Xbox players are still waiting to get their hands on the game. Its release on Microsoft's platform was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delayed as it needed more time for optimisation</a>, though rumours swirled around a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">PlayStation exclusivity deal</a>.</p>
<p>At the least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">Microsoft reiterated the delay was not due to "platform limitations"</a>. A release date still has not been given, three months after its launch, but could still arrive before the end of the year.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Ji's comment further suggests DLC is on the way. Back at launch, an FAQ on the game's website noted DLC and "non-pay-to-win in-game purchases" may be released in future.</p>
<p>After release, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win">Bloomberg</a> reported Game Science was working on an expansion for the game, following in the footsteps of FromSoftware with its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have also circulated the DLC will release in early 2025 to coincide with Chinese New Year. So perhaps Ji's surprise is merely a release date announcement this side of Christmas. Looking at you The Game Awards!</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>We have been here before. Dynasty Warriors Origins is the tenth mainline entry in a franchise that has spun out into samurai, giant robots, JRPG heroes, and even the odd Hyrulean legend along the way. But Dynasty Warriors is where it all started, where the Musou hack and slash genre began, and with Dynasty Warriors Origins the team at Omega Force are starting once more, reimagining their headline series for the modern day. Our hands on was a commanding four hours long, and crucially, when time was called, we didn’t want to stop!</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the moment-to-moment gameplay, this is classic Dynasty Warriors. While it might be a reset for the series, your approach to battle is the same here as it has been across all of the Musou games. Red indicators on the map show you where enemy strongholds and officers are, and you make your way to them to support the allied forces, and to progress the battle further, gaining ground as you go. As any fan of the series knows, it starts out easily enough, but soon you’re trying to fight on multiple fronts and juggling thousands of enemies. It’s a simple gameplay loop, but one which continues to engage and enthral, even after all this time.</p>


<p>Omega Force has given you plenty of tools to despatch those thousands of enemy troops, and combo after combo, swinging blade after swinging blade, you’ll chop those numbers back down to zero. It’s fair to say that Dynasty Warriors will immediately test the quality of your Square button, but the further you progress, the more variety you can find in this lethal game of last one standing.</p>


<p>Parrying and evading play a substantially bigger role than they have done previously, though it’s not suddenly turned Dynasty Warriors into a Soulslike. You’ll need to utilise them both to defeat the stronger enemies you come across though, and getting it right rewards you with some very cool animations, and a hefty chunk off the enemy’s guard gauge.</p>
<p>At its best, Dynasty Warriors Origins makes you feel like a super-powered warrior, capable of dispatching entire battalions of enemy soldiers by stringing together dynamic and visually rewarding combos. Even hours into our hands on, I was having a hell of a lot of fun, helped along by your steadily increasing skills, improved weaponry and new tactics.</p>
<p>One of the key differences is the addition of more meaningful RPG elements. As you progress you gain experience, and in turn rank up the main protagonist, with the skill tree broken into different military ranks. Each rank has its own skill panel, and a selection of stat boosts and new moves to unlock using your accumulated experience, though it’s entirely up to you how you choose to spec your character, and what you unlock, though in some cases you have to have unlocked a previous skill to access the next.</p>

<p>There’s nine weapon types, and your proficiency with each of these can also be levelled up, boosting damage and unlocking new combos as you do. While there’s the standard blades and lances, there’s the more unique weapons like the Rings which add in some ranged abilities alongside the melee ones. You can buy new weapons from merchants across the map, or they’ll sometimes be dropped by enemy commanders, potentially giving you an immediate boost on the battlefield</p>
<p>It doesn’t end there either, and once you’ve found the element known as Pyroxene on the world map, you can exchange each one for a random gem that you then equip for different boons and bonuses. I primarily focused on the Wellspring gem, which rewards you by recharging your health for every 100 enemies you’ve slain, and as you find more Pyroxene and level up each gem, the boosts become more favourable. I found messing with all of the different systems and swapping out weaponry for ones with special characteristics really rewarding, and made for a good balance between combat and downtime.</p>
<p>You can also build bonds with other officers. Talking and training with these characters and making the right choices will strengthen the bond, and later on in the game you’ll be able to focus on their relationships via the Shui Jing Retreat. It’s a nice addition, and though it’s one that we’ve seen before in other RPG franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/fire-emblem-engage-review/">Fire Emblem</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, it makes sense here as you forge bonds on and off the battlefield.</p>

<p>The new world map represents the Three Kingdoms period in China. You can explore this on foot, discovering secrets and side missions, but it’s not an open world, having more in common with an RPG map than something from Ubisoft. As you quell the trouble in each region you raise the level of Peace there, which in turn will give you some undisclosed advantages.</p>
<p>When in town, you’ll stay at the inn, and from here you can read your letters – some of which will advance the story – change your equipment, or plan your battle tactics. Alongside that, other utilities will be available, including weaponry shops to expand your arsenal.</p>
<p>The map only really serves as an interactive menu, but it helps to make your skirmishes and battles feel like part of a greater war, and that you are liberating areas from oppression. It’s a shame that there isn’t more of a visual reward for doing so, as you’re bringing life and prosperity back to a region, but it’s a minor thing.</p>
<p>It’s Year 6 of the Guanghe era. Drought and famine have pushed the people to the limit, but the government have done nothing to ease their suffering. You step in as an unknown warrior, joining series stalwart Guan Yu in protecting the villagers. You’re told of Zhang Ziao and his steadily growing cult of worshippers The Way of the Great Peace, and this is the beginning of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which, for anyone that’s played a Dynasty Warriors game before, is where the journey always begins.</p>
<p>You join up with Liu Bei’s army, alongside Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and the first order of business is to tackle Zhang Ziao’s horde. However, there’s more here than we’ve seen in the past, with your amnesiac protagonist wrapped up in a further mystical storyline. You encounter Zhuhe, a warrior committed to eliminating those who would sow chaos. It seems as though you might have previously been a Guardian as well, and while you might have played all of the previous games, this is a welcome new narrative thread to pull on. That’s not to say that it doesn’t still feel like a Dynasty Warriors game, as during our hands on we encountered more and more of the central cast, with favourites like Cao Cao and Xiahou Yuan all present and correct.</p>

<p>It’s been almost a whole console generation since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>, and with the jump to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> as the baseline, the visuals have taken a clear step forward, managing to be crisp, clear, and expansive while there isn’t a hint of slowdown even when there’s a huge number of enemies on the screen. The cutscenes are also of a much higher quality than we’ve seen before, and though I’m not normally a fan of the English localisation, it’s perfectly effective here. You’ll still want to play it in Mandarin to get the full effect.</p>
<p>While I mean no disrespect, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed Dynasty Warriors Origins. We’ve come to know what to expect from this series and its spin-offs, and while Origins doesn’t throw away the Musou rulebook, it makes smart changes to the formula that just make it more compelling. I can see myself pouring hours into this, and so might you.</p>
<p>And the best thing is that you can start right now, with a demo now available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Blizzard Entertainment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRgtN1sMf6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted</a> a Campfire Chat with Diablo IV developers to discuss the upcoming 2.1 patch that will go live on the Public Test Realm between December 3 and 10, exclusively on PC's Battle.net.</p>
<p>The team talked about the main features and new content that will be in the new update, starting with the long-awaited Armory feature, which allows players to save and switch between different builds easily without any respeccing costs. With the Armory, Blizzard seeks to improve player flexibility in the endgame content. They noted that controller support for the feature would not be available right away, though. Worries about accidentally selling items saved in the Armory were put to rest, too, with the developers assuring players that saved items will be favorited automatically to prevent any accidental sales. They will also have an icon indicating they are part of a saved build.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other highlight of Diablo IV Patch 2.1 is the new system based on Witchcraft powers. Players will engage with witches around the Tree of Whispers, offering a new currency called Restless Rot (earned after defeating the new Headrotten enemies) at altars to learn new witchcraft abilities through a streamlined menu system. The season also introduces a reputation system called Covens Favor for unlocking rewards, including new witchcraft powers. Additionally, players can discover lost powers by finding Forgotten Altars in the world. Over 20 powers will be available, with popular options like the poison frog summon, Doom orb, and vengeful servant. Another Witchcraft Power called Pano sucks enemies into a swirling vortex of destruction.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players will find Headrotten enemies through the new seasonal activity called Headhunts, earning the new Occult Gems as rewards. These gems are special socketables that boost defense and provide unique effects to fine-tune player builds. The developers showcased examples of occult gems like Elder Sigil, Killing Wind, and Dust Stone, each offering different bonuses based on player preferences and playstyle. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements have been made to the town around the Tree of Whispers, adding more services and streamlining navigation to enhance the player experience during Headhunts. Of course, Diablo IV Patch 2.1 will also come with a plethora of class changes and overhauls. The full patch notes will be released on Wednesday, November 27.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-was-at-some-point-a-roguelike-game-with-arkham-like-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented </a>with making this game a roguelike with Arkham-like combat early in development?</p>

<p>As you explore The Zone in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, you’ll come across an abundance of items to pick up, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-do-with-pdas-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PDAs</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-use-artifacts-in-stalker-2-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artifacts</a> to guns like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-lullaby-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lullaby</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/find-riemann-solve-safe-code-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riemann</a>. Speaking of guns, some that you find while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fast-travel-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roaming the open world</a> may have a red shield icon indicating their broken status. </p>



<p>If you’ve come across these diminished weapons and are wondering what your options are, we have you covered. Here’s what to do with broken weapons in Stalker 2, as well as what we recommend depending on your desired outcome.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-broken-guns-in-stalker-2">What to do with Broken guns in Stalker 2</h2>



<ul>
<li>Repair it at a Technician</li>



<li>Take the ammo and leave it</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to keep and use the weapon, we recommend having it<strong> repaired by a Technician</strong> like Lens in Zalissya. This should only be done if you really like and want to use the weapon, as it can be an expensive process. You can check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-repair-weapons-in-stalker-2-easy-best-method/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide on how to repair weapons</a> for a full breakdown.</p>



<p>You <strong>can’t sell broken weapons</strong>, and repairing them to sell is inefficient since you won’t make any profit. So, if you don’t want to use it, it’s best to <strong>take the ammo out of the weapon and leave it behind</strong>.</p>



<p>This all goes for broken weapons with the red shield icon, but you’ll also find weapons with a yellow shield icon.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-damaged-weapons-in-stalker-2">What to do with damaged weapons in Stalker 2</h2>



<p>A yellow shield icon in <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stalker 2</a> means the weapon is <strong>damaged but not broken</strong>. It can still be used, but it can also be sold for some quick cash. As expected, damaged weapons will sell for less, but it’s still not worth repairing them before selling, as it’ll only cut into your profits.</p>



<p>You can track a weapon’s health with the Durability stat, which is found at the bottom of the weapon tab when hovering over it in the inventory. </p>



<p>The best option here is to sell it if you’re not too fussed with the gun, but if you like the weapon and want to continue using it, get it repaired for safekeeping.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-will-not-leave-adventurers-disappointed-even-during-early-access.1042686/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a very long wait and a last-minute <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-date-gets-pushed-back-by-three-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a>, Grinding Gear Games' Path of Exile 2 is finally launching in two weeks in Early Access. However, it will be an early access game only in name, as it will boast a massive amount of content and even some endgame activities that will make the wait for the full version of the game easier to bear.</p>
<p>While I was not able to try out the game once again following the opportunity I had during <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-date-gets-pushed-back-by-three-weeks/">Gamescom 2024</a>, which left me thoroughly impressed, Grinding Gear Games made it abundantly clear during yesterday's presentation that Path of Exile 2 will even exceed my expectations, offering a staggering amount of content to sink my teeth into right from its initial release on December 6th. The Early Access version will include the first three of the six story campaign acts, which will take players up to level 25, as well as Cruel Mode. This mode, which will be removed once version 1.0 is out with the other three acts, will allow players to experience the first three acts at a higher difficulty that will take them to level 65 to be ready for the endgame content.</p>
<p>Having endgame content straight from the beginning became a focus during the development of Path of Exile 2, as the studio realized that one of the biggest issues for an action RPG at launch was not having enough. As such, after spending 25 hours completing the campaign the first time and clearing it again in Cruel Mode, players will be able to spend a lot of time clearing the random encounters spread across the Atlas, a huge overworld map filled with different areas completely separate from those seen in the campaign. The endgame content will be further expanded by systems not available during the campaign, such as Breaches, a mechanic returning from the first entry in the series, where players will have to defeat enemies as quickly as possible, and Rituals, where players will have to survive multiple waves of enemies in quick succession.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Endgame Content Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpIbaTXJD4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 will not skimp with character classes right from the get-go as well, offering players six different classes - Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Mercenary, Witch, and Sorceress - all coming with very different play styles, ranging from short-range to long-range and magical warfare. This already massive variety of combat styles will be further expanded down the line with six more classes that will bring the total number of classes to twelve. Even with just six classes, Path of Exile 2 will have a lot to offer to players who want to create unique builds, thanks to the extremely versatile customization systems in place that don't tie skills to specific classes.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 will be free to play once its 1.0 version launches, but those who wish to dive in straight away in the Early Access version will need to purchase one of the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase">Early Access Supporter Packs</a>. The basic pack will cost $30 on PC and consoles and will only grant access to the game, while the more pricey packs will include some additional in-game and physical goodies, although the physical goodies are only available for the PC versions of the Thaumaturge of the Vaal, Warlord of the Karui and Liberator of the Wraeclast Supporter Packs.

<p>From what I have experienced and what the developers Grinding Gear Games have shown so far, Path of Exile 2 has the chance of becoming one of the best action RPGs ever released, if not the very best, taking everything that made the original great and competently modernizing it while expanding the experience in so many ways that it wouldn't be surprising to see players spend hundreds of hours in the game and still not having seen the full potential of the systems and mechanics powering the game. As such, I really cannot wait for the Early Access version to release and be able to spend more time with a game that I feel I will be playing for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>If you've been waiting to hear the system requirements for the PC version of Path of Exile 2, they are below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>OS: Windows 10</em></li>
<li><em>Processor: Intel® Core™ i7-7700 or AMD™ Ryzen 5 2500x</em></li>

<p>Patch  v.1.1.248,905 is now available across PS5 and PC.

<p>Gameplay fixes across both platforms fix door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map, stops enemies getting hung up on environments, and several other bugs and glitches - the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106">full list of fixes is here</a>.</p>
<p>The patch also resolves a "minor blocker" that prevented some players from escaping the Labyrinth after getting the map, an unspecified "progression-blocking issue" in Brookhaven, and an issue where the final boss was missing for some.</p> <div>

<p>"Overall, the philosophy for any PS5 Pro update should be that we get an upgrade over the base PS5, with no noticeable trade-offs," Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan wrote earlier this week after breaking down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">Silent Hill 2 Remake's PS5 Pro patch</a>.</p><p>"The reality for Silent Hill 2 Remake's Pro upgrade though is that there are pros and cons. PS5 Pro does improve the game's performance at 60fps - and gets us to a vastly improved 30fps lock - both of which are welcome improvements."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oh, my nostalgic heart is happy to tell you that Donkey Kong Land is available now for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p>The Game Boy classic once again asks players to set off in monkey form to find that banana horde. "Cranky Kong doesn't think Donkey Kong has proven himself to be a hero yet," reads the official description. "So, he decides to work out a deal with the closest villain that he knows."</p>
<p>Yes, K. Rool, that dastardly fiend, has hidden the bananas with a little help from his cronies. And, of course, Donkey and Diddy Kong won't stand for it. You can check out a trailer for its Nintendo Switch Online debut below.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online members can get themselves access to multiple NES, Super NES and Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Those who plump for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack option will also be able to get their mitts on Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and SEGA Mega Drive games, along with other perks. That includes things like expansions for other Nintendo games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>'s Booster Course Pass.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has brought the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-boy">Game Boy</a> platformer Donkey Kong Land to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, the company having remembered that there’s another rich vein of Rare’s DK adventures that had previously gone untapped.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Land – Game Boy – Nintendo Switch Online" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_iYkwaVyGTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Donkey Kong Country trilogy from the SNES was added to Nintendo Switch Online library back in 2020, the celebrated platformers being a key part of Rare’s legacy from when they were a part of Nintendo. But alongside those games, they also released a trilogy of Game Boy games, following the naming convention of &nbsp;Super Mario Land to mark them as a bit different.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Land was released by Rare and Nintendo in 1995, ahead of Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest, and while they couldn’t hope to capture the technicolor wonders of playing on a colour TV, they absolutely kept they same art style adapted to the green-tinted greyscale – greenscale? – of the original Game Boy screen. Add to that being able to retain a lot of the same platforming controls and style, and this was another hit for Rare.</p>
<p>There’s two more Donkey Kong Land games (plus a Japan-exclusive Game Boy Color port of the third game) that could be released in future, so keep an eye out for those!</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> movies are a mixed Baggins indeed - at once thunderous and thin, like butter scraped over too much bread - but one sequence I love from The Desolation of Smaug is Bilbo searching Khazad-dûm for the Arkenstone, while trying not to rouse the titular dragon from his slumber. Don't Wake The Beast is sort of that sequence plus Spelunkified procgen levels and Thief-esque stealth mechanics.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Created by Artificial Disasters - whose other works include eco-minded reverse city-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1795470/Flooded/">Flooded</a> - it's a roguelite stealth affair where you sneak through randomly arranged dungeons, avoiding the eyes and ears of walking skeletons and the like. There are pressure plate traps and other environmental obstacles to deal with, but the biggest "terrain hazard" of them all is the screen-filling red dragon on the dungeon's lowest level. Disturb its rest, and it'll smash the scenery apart pursuing you to the exit.</p>

<p>As you rove these top-down labyrinths, you must deal with the problem of footstep noise and the rattling of any items you pick up or disturb, with sounds manifest as expanding white rings. While this is a loot-driven experience, the game has a nifty way of punishing avarice. Every pearl necklace or gemstone you pocket adds to your weight, making your footsteps louder.</p><p>Sometimes, you might have no choice but to cause a racket - blasting through a cracked wall to reach a door, for example. Thankfully, you have a zipline which is useful for speedy withdrawal behind cover. Bilbo could have done with one of those. Other player items include a Thiefy gadget that covers the ground with footfall-dampening moss, and a cloak that increases detection time. It looks like a game where complexity arises more from the terrain puzzles and enemy varieties than the acquisition of new tools, but there's a town layer with merchants and, seemingly, a few sidestories.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's possible to escape without eventually rousing the dragon, but even if you do, you can expect "new traps and dangers" on the way out. It can't be worse than having to sidestep rivers of fire, surely. </p>
<p>I dislike the cheesy voiceover in the trailer - the Statute of Cringe has officially elapsed on the practice of starting videos with "Yep, that's me - you're probably wondering, etc". But I'm guessing there won't be any chitchat during the actual catacombing, so I'll let it slide. Speaking of sliding, the only request I have at this stage is a giant hall entirely full of gold coins, where stepping incautiously might trigger an avalanche.</p>

Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS5 Black Friday Deals Are Now Live at Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l4as99" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation’s PS5 console deals</a> are also now live for Black Friday, featuring the Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle, and NBA 2K Bundle, at just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1XR8?object_uuid=9f3a3370-4438-4049-9564-f62d85e33539&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$374.99 for the Digital Edition</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdd2Bp?object_uuid=9f3a3370-4438-4049-9564-f62d85e33539&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$424.99 for the Disc Edition</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year in style. The IP is healthier than ever, and Wizards of the Coast has just released the new 2024 Player's Guide and Dungeon Master's Guide, while the Monster Manual is slated to be available on February 18, 2025. But the company is betting big on videogames, too, following the big success of Larian's Baldur's Gate 3, which earned the D&amp;D IP owner over $90 million in its first six months.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks confirmed that there's another videogame in development in addition to the ones we already knew of. Let's recap: the co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by Starbreeze in December 2023 for a 2026 release; this one will be set in Waterdeep, one of the biggest cities of Faerûn. Then there is the D&amp;D Virtual Reality game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-virtual-reality-game-announced-by-demeo-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this January by Resolution Games, and the regular Dungeons and Dragons Unreal Engine 5 game in development at <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invoke</a> (formerly Tuque, the studio that made Dark Alliance). This latter Dungeons &amp; Dragons videogame might feature some sort of PvP mode, as gleaned from a job advertisement.</p>
<p>It's not even all about D&amp;D, anyway, as Hasbro has also invested in Archetype Entertainment's sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>, featuring Matthew McConaughey as one of the main characters and developed by former BioWare designers and writers. Moreover, they've got a G.I. Joe Snake Eyes game in development at Atomic Arcade and a horror game in the making at <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-opens-austin-studio-for-aaa-game-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skeleton Key</a>. The article also said there's a new Magic title in testing with the Commander format; this would be separate from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/magic-the-gathering-arena-something-magical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic: The Gathering Arena</a>. All in all, the company is investing over a billion dollars at a rate of $100 to $150 million a year to release one or two games per year starting in 2026.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Hasbro is paring back its investments in film adaptations. Following the slightly underwhelming box-office performance of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and Transformers One, it won't co-finance any new movies or TV series. On the subject, Cocks said:</p>
<p><em>We want to reach fans where they want to play, and increasingly that is through digital expressions of their favorite brands.</em></p>

Here’s some more delicious bait for you, then. <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/mossflower-tw">Mossflower TW</a> is a campaign mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/medieval-ii-total-war">Medieval II: Total War</a> expansion Kingdoms that lets ranks of mace-wielding mice, helmeted hedgehogs, and ornery otters skitter wildly all over the venerable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game. It’s been about since Summer, and the team have been working on patching since. It seems very playable, if the footage of people playing it is anything to go by. Here’s a video by YouTuber Tharshey so you can see it in action:</p>

<p>Modder <a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/flesheatingbeans">FleshEatingBeans</a> describes Mossflower TW as “a campaign themed around the titular Redwall novel”. I’m not sure exactly how many different beasties you’ll be able to recruit, but at a glance, I count mice, hedgehogs, otters and…wait! That’s not an otter at all. It’s a weasel! Typical weasel behaviour. You’ll also get more beasts on your side as you liberate settlements. There are two factions to choose from: the pirates of Cluny the Scourge, or Redwall Abbey.</p>
<p>“We seek to follow the world presented in the books, audiobooks and an animated show as closely as reasonable,” says Mr. Beans, “while adding canon-friendly content of our own to fill out gaps and up the fun factor”. Alongside the units, there are custom structures, and also some custom banners.</p><p>The team were on hiatus, but seem to be back now. Such is the allure of several different types of battling mammal where only one type of less-interesting mammal - the lowly human - existed previously. There's a bird of some sort too, but who cares about that guy.

		<p>Ubisoft has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> Title Update 1.4.0, which makes a huge change for one of the most hated aspects of the game. Stealth sections have been revamped to remove instant fail conditions, letting players blast their way out of a sticky situation, instead of being booted back to a save point.</p>
<p>As well as removing this condition, the enemy AI has also been tweaked so that players will be better signalled if they’re being detected, letting them make the choice of whether to try and back up and get back into cover, or just reach for their blaster and start going for it.</p>


<p>Elsewhere, enemy weak points have been added to add some explosive new options, Kay’s blaster has been returned and you can use two-handed weapons more often, and there’s a new toggle for the cinematic lens, which could clean up the image for those who hate fake camera effects.</p>
<p>Hoping to bring a bunch more players into the fold, Ubisoft has chucked Star Wars Outlaws into the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales this week, cutting 25% off the price of the game digitally. Of course, shops might have other ideas if they’ve got a few too many discs that they want to shift, so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>On the whole we rather enjoyed the game (stealth sections and otherwise), with Gamoc saying our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>

<h2>Star Wars Outlaws 1.4.0 patch notes</h2>
<p><strong>FULL PATCH NOTES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could get stuck by not being able to take off using the Trailblazer after certain missions</li>
<li>Kay now holsters a two-handed weapon in more situations such as when climbing, grappling or using the speeder</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/gt7-update-1-54-gran-turismo-7-ps5-pro-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>‘s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> update is here, with Polyphony Digital bundling the PS5 Pro enhancements in with a regular content update for the enduring racing game. So, in addition to higher quality visuals on the mid-gen upgraded console, there’s also five new cars to hop in and drive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; Free Update - November 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OodQr_i9Ovs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>But for PS5 Pro owners, it’s the support for their new console that will be the most important thing. The PS5 Pro enhancements include a mode that combines visuals and performance modes of the base PS5, using PSSR to get smooth out any kinks in the process – though people were already able to get a huge performance boost at 120Hz even before this update.</p>
<p>Additionally you’re able to add ray traced reflections in race, with the option in the Display settings that lets you “Prioritize Ray Tracing/Resolution”. There’s also options for 8K resolution output here.</p>
<p>PSVR 2 owners will also get a boost with enhanced render quality in VR mode and smoother video playback by using reprojection.</p>

<p>Outside of that, you have five new cars – a Ford, a Merc, two Porches and a Suzuki – the Sophy AI has been added to Trial Mountain and Tokyo Expressway East Clockwise, there’s adjustments to the price of Legend Cars courtesy of Hagerty, and a smattering of other tweaks and fixes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dantes-ring-is-a-so-called-anti-combat-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-the-invincible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's 42nd Golden Joystick Awards, which saw Black Myth: Wukong <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triumph</a> in the Game of the Year category, developer Starward Industries unveiled a new game called Dante's Ring. The Polish studio's first game, as you might recall, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-invincible-exploring-the-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Invincible</a>, an adventure game adaptation of Stanisław Lem's sci-fi novel.</p>
<p>This time, the setting appears to be entirely original. Interestingly, Dante's Ring is being labeled an 'anti-combat' action RPG. What that means in practice is you'll be roaming a volcanic range with the goal of fighting against the environment, surviving, and possibly rescuing other folks. There's also going to be an element of choice, apparently, in how you navigate the various survivor factions featured in Dante's Ring. Here's the official overview:</p>
<p><em>The game focuses on rescue and survival, using retro equipment in a race against nature’s wrath among mystical beliefs. Will you fight a frenetic fire or flee from a pyroclastic flow? Break the door to rescue someone or stop and give first aid? Once the volcano’s hot breath reaches you, every second counts.</em></p>
<p><em>Dante's Ring offers a fresh approach to gameplay, focusing on avoiding combat and immersing you in a mesmerizing, eerie world where you pass through the gates of hell to save just one more life from its grasp.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>GAMEPLAY FEATURES</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Uncover the mystery hidden in the Ring of Fire.</em></li>
<li><em>Confront the untamed fury of fire with a range of retro-inspired equipment,</em></li>
<li><em>Traverse the terrain on foot or using retro inventions.</em></li>
<li><em>Solve intricate puzzles, break through obstacles, and carefully manage your supplies.</em></li>
<li><em>Find your own way to save people and animals.</em></li>
<li><em>Prepare for missions in the hub by selecting the equipment for your preferred gameplay styles/classes.</em></li>
<li><em>Complete quests and missions with outcomes that can influence the course of the story.</em></li>
<li><em>Scavenge for resources using retro tools on an island covered in a thick layer of ash.</em></li>
<li><em>Navigate complex moral choices and broker uneasy peace among diverse factions — all vying for survival.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Dante's Ring will debut next year on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988030/Dantes_Ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> Early Access. The full release is currently planned for 2026.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-psvr2-release-date-pushed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-psvr2-release-date-pushed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ghosts of Tabor, the high-energy extraction shooter built exclusively for VR, has been delayed from coming to PSVR2 until early 2025, the developer has revealed. It was originally intended to be released with the ‘December wipe’ but owing to a complex development path, the team has had to delay the launch by a few months.</p>



<hr>







<p>Ghosts of Tabor has been dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’ by some, and that’s damn close to being true. Since being released in March 2023, Ghosts of Tabor has turned heads in the VR space, pulling in thousands of positive reviews and really standing out as the go-to option for anyone seeking the most immersive extraction shooter experience possible.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/ghostsoftabor/status/1859658154792955972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> and the game’s Discord server, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know the excitement around the PSVR2 launch of Ghosts of Tabor is through the roof – and trust us, we share that excitement! However, I want to be completely upfront with you: porting Tabor to PSVR2 has proven to be more complex than we anticipated, both for us and our partners.</p>



<p>To deliver the experience you deserve, we’ll need a bit more time. We’ve allocated additional resources to make this final push and are working tirelessly to bring it to you as early as possible in 2025.</p>



<p>Pre-orders will open once we’ve secured a timeline and confirmed the launch date.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Ghosts of Tabor, players enter harsh environments hellbent on surviving, and to that end, they must scavenge resources, eat, drink, and fight other players, all while seeking to secure top-tier loot and successfully extracting from the map to land a win. It has been praised for its detail and depth, and from customisation to in-game trading, there’s plenty of meat on Tabor’s bones.</p>



<p>Have you played Ghosts of Tabor yet? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>A long list of Scuf controllers are discounted in Amazon's Black Friday sale, giving you a chance to upgrade your gaming setup for cheap. Whether you need something premium like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VTRJGCP?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf Instinct Pro controller</a> or want to get into mobile gaming with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D49GBG24?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf Nomad</a>, you’ll find a lot of cool gadgets on sale. The deals run through December 8, though the hottest deals may go out of stock before the event officially ends.</p><p>One of the most popular Scuf controllers on sale is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VTRJGCP?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf Instinct Pro</a>, as it’s now just $190 (was $230). Equipped with four customizable backpaddles, support for three unique profiles, and trigger stops for faster actuation, it’s a great companion for competitive shooters. The backpaddles are a particular standout, as they’ve been built to be easily accessible without the need to reconfigure your hand position so you can quickly trigger multiple actions.</p><p>Toss in a slick design, and you’ve got a winning formula. Four different colors are eligible for the discount, and they all work with Xbox, PC, and mobile.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4401152-61ks7rskzwl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401152" data-ratio="0.568" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4401152-61ks7rskzwl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401152"></a><figcaption>Scuf Instinct Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4401152-61ks7rskzwl._sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>For PC gamers seeking something a bit more affordable, take a peek at the Scuf Envision Pro. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM6XBHDN?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wireless versions</a> are on sale for $150 (was $180), though a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLPG3CNT?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wired model</a> is even more affordable at $110 (was $130). Regardless of which you pick, you’ll get five remappable G-Keys along the bottom edge of the controller, four remappable backpaddles, and mouse-like mechanical switches for the face buttons and D-pad that make it ultra responsive.</p><p>Rounding out the Black Friday Scuf controller deals is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D49GBG24?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf Nomad</a>. Built for gaming on iPhone, the device straddles both sides of your smartphone, turning it into something akin to a Nintendo Switch. If you’re a fan of streaming Xbox Game Pass or diving into the ever-changing Apple Arcade lineup, the Nomad could be a great addition to your setup now that it’s just $60 (was $100).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-falcons-esports-org-of-the-year-saudi-arabia/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Esports Awards have ended for another year, and many trophies changed hands on the night. One award that has the esports community up in arms is the title of ‘Esports Organisation of the Year’, which went to Team Falcons.</p>



<p>Team Falcons was founded in 2017 but the brand made almost no waves at all until 2022, when the inaugural ‘Gamers8’ event took place in Riyadh. This Saudi Arabian organisation is backed by the nation’s government, and many have long been sceptical about the legitimacy of the organisation and its funding.</p>



<p>A while ago, The Esports Awards signed a three-year deal with Saudi Arabia’s Esports World Cup Foundation, pledging to host the event in Riyadh for the next three iterations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-problem">That’s a Problem</h2>



<p>Team Falcons has investment from and ties to the Saudi Arabian government via the PIF and Savvy Games Group. The Esports World Cup, which took place earlier this year, is managed by ESL FACEIT, which is wholly owned by Savvy, and by extension, the Saudi government.</p>



<p>In August, Team Falcons won the grand championship at the Esports World Cup after winning more tournaments and fielding more teams than any other organisation in the world. Before, during, and after the event, Team Falcons was able to buy up some of the best esports players in the world to fill out rosters.</p>



<p>All this was achieved by an organisation founded in 2017, which didn’t really gain any traction until it started to receive sizeable investments from the Saudi government. It was part of what the community refers to as ‘esportswashing’, with the nation’s officials seeking to clean up the country’s image by investing heavily in esports and gaming.</p>



<p>Here are some facts:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Falcons started winning in Dota 2 this year after picking up some of the world’s best players</li>



<li>Team Falcons’ Counter-Strike exploits have gotten nowhere despite splashing the cash to sign huge players (like s1mple)</li>



<li>Team Falcons did nothing in Apex Legends until the Esports World Cup after signing one of the winningest players in the space</li>



<li>Team Falcons produced little in the way of results in Rocket League until Gamers8 and the Esports World Cup</li>



<li>Team Falcons secured a spot in the COD League (Vegas Falcons) despite having an awful track record in the game’s multiplayer scene</li>



<li>Team Falcons has dominated Warzone tournaments thanks to signing the most capable players in the space</li>
</ul>



<p>Before the Saudi line was tapped into, the only thing Team Falcons was really any good at was Fortnite, and a lot of the team’s earnings in that space had come from Gamers8, the Riyadh-based event that was replaced by the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>It’s surely becoming clear now how this is a problem with esports fans – it’s a matter of pouring as much money into the space as possible because there are no ‘financial fair play’ rules. </p>



<p>To win the Esports Organisation of the Year trophy at The Esports Awards, Team Falcons had to beat:</p>



<ul>
<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>Vitality</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Gen G</li>



<li>T1 Esports</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>Team Spirit</li>
</ul>



<p>Team Falcons’ crowning achievement for 2024 is winning an event that it flooded with teams to gain the maximum advantage possible. It also won that event, which is backed by the Saudi government, while being backed by the Saudi government, in Saudi.</p>



<p>But hey, congratulations on the award.</p>

It has full-size analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, and curved handles that make it comfortable to hold. The analog sticks use Hall Effect sensors, which eliminates the components that cause stick drift. The analog stick caps are swappable, and each bundle comes with an extra set of caps.</p><p>It also has a built-in kickstand for tabletop mode and passthrough USB-C for charging. A companion smartphone app allows you to further customize the Nitro Deck's features. A button on the back of the controller lets you remap the four back buttons on the fly, too.</p><p>The Nitro Deck has built-in rumble and motion controls and can be used as a regular wired controller for Nintendo Switch and PC.</p><p>The hardshell carrying case fits the Switch with Nitro Deck attached perfectly.

One of the main changes with the new model is that the right stick is now above the buttons. The original Nitro Deck's low right analog stick can take some getting used to, but after spending time with the new model, I actually prefer the original layout. The exception here is first-person shooters or games where you need to move the camera a lot. In those scenarios, the Nitro Deck+ is comfier, but you'll probably want to map the face buttons to the four back triggers and/or make use of the new "sidekick" buttons--two remappable buttons next to the sticks.</p><p>The Nitro Deck+ also adds video out with an HDMI adapter, so you no longer need to remove the Switch from the cradle to dock it and play on TV. This is a welcome feature, and the bundle that's on sale comes with the HDMI adapter. The Nitro Deck+ without the adapter is also available for $20 off, dropping the price to $50.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>You can also <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVY8TBBM?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save $10 on CRKD's NEO S wireless controllers</a></strong> for Nintendo Switch and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few games let you smite hundreds of enemies with grandiose attacks as well as the long-running Dynasty Warriors series does, and so in a sense the latest one, Dynasty Warriors Origins, is competing with its past self. But with an enhanced combat system that rewards and incentivizes parrying and perfectly dodging enemy attacks and a more significant focus on telling the story of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms novels from a new perspective, it made a great first impression. These elements were all up my alley for a new Dynasty Warriors game, and playing it left me feeling a sense of wonder, intrigue, and a hunger for more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Origins was one of those odd phenomena where the images on the screen finally matched what my younger brain had seen when playing earlier games in the series. Bases were bigger, forests were lusher, and the screen was filled with more enemies for me to slash and punch on my way to victory than ever before. The spectacle and visuals of Origins are the best they've ever been, and sure, a lot of that is thanks to the power of modern hardware, but it's also the quality of everything on display. Long gone are the barren lands and mostly identical trees of Dynasty Warriors 9's open world, the repetitive textures on buildings, or the rockfaces surrounding most levels in games before that. Origins' world and characters are full of life, and each one is detailed more than ever, from their armor to their weapons. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Dynasty Warriors Origins introduces a new overworld map mechanic to traverse between battles. This diorama-like map can be explored to find various towns or cities to purchase items, NPCs to converse with, and missions to undertake. I only got to view a small portion of the map, but I did catch a glimpse of a fast-travel button, meaning there are most likely at least enough of these areas to explore to warrant the need for such a system. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I did catch a glimpse of a fast-travel button, meaning there are most likely at least enough of these areas to explore to warrant the need for such a system. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Origins' story is told from the perspective of a new original protagonist who will be interacting with important warriors such as Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, and Lu Bu. Yes, <em>that </em>Lu Bu. Origins’ story, as the title suggests, also occurs earlier than its predecessors, so the recognizable allies and enemies all have a new youthful vibrancy in and out of combat. And that combat, by the way, felt great. Every swing of my sword or staff was responsive, and perfect parries or dodges were accompanied by flashy animations, with perfect parries giving an even more considerable advantage in turning the tides on opponents.  And combos feel better than ever when chained with special moves and other abilities meant to pre-empt enemy attacks and knock them off balance. Add that to the sounds of the yellow turban army shrieking in fear and death and the cheers of my allies as my KO counter rose into the hundreds, and it felt like the quintessential Dynasty Warriors experience I had been missing for years.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some may be surprised or caught off guard when hearing about things like perfect parries or dodges in a Dynasty Warriors game. I'm happy to report that those who want to button-mash their combos through hordes of enemies will be able to do just that on the lower difficulties, just like in the older games, but for those wanting to push themselves and challenge the harder difficulties, they'll need to make full use of these systems. Playing on Hero mode saw even regular enemies removing larger portions of my health bar, which typically only happens when facing off against named generals. I put this to the ultimate test against the man, the myth, the legend Lu Bu, who fought the entire battle atop his steed until breaking his guard. His introduction is nothing short of what veterans will expect from him; he entered the scene as if he were the game's main character, instantly deleting entire squadrons of my allies and causing them to scream in terror. Now, I don't know how he scales between all the difficulties, but on the hardest one available during my demo (Hero difficulty), I managed to trigger the second phase of his fight and reduce him to under 40% before running out of healing items against his onslaught of unblockable attacks that dented over half my health per hit. This battle alone has sold me on the combat of Dynasty Warriors Origins.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Those who want to button-mash their combos through hordes of enemies will be able to do just that on the lower difficulties, just like in the older games, but for those wanting to push themselves and challenge the harder difficulties, they'll need to make full use of perfect parries and dodges.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The only immediate downside I found with Dynasty Warriors Origins so far is the inability to play in co-op, as this series has been a staple for those wanting to play co-op online or split screen with friends and siblings. While I’m not going to completely let the developers off the hook for this, there is at least a built-in compromise: during mission preparations, you can select an allied general to accompany you, and during the mission, you can take control of them for a short period of time. This helps turn the tide in battles, especially if you are low on health or want to destroy many enemies in a shorter period. These generals are much stronger than the protagonist in the game's early hours, and while I only activated the ability twice, I learned two things. First, it was incredibly fun and gave me a great taste of other weapon types, and second, it was clear that this mechanic is meant to be one of those you activate when you need to go all-in on a fight. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You also gain access to various tactics along the way, like commanding a squadron of archers to rain arrows on enemies. These abilities are fine on their own, but if you use them at the right time or in the right conditions, they can have an even more powerful effect to devastate armies and lower opponents' morale. Morale has always been another component of Dynasty Warriors, because whichever side has the higher morale gains bonuses in combat. In Origins, this is best exemplified by the red armor plates on enemy generals that reduce the damage you deal until they are all removed. Once all the yellow and red plates are removed, they become vulnerable to powerful assault attacks that make you untargetable while dealing out significant damage to both the enemy you've broken and any unlucky enemies nearby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the customization system is back, and throughout the story, the protagonist will gain access to a handful of weapon types and skills called arts. The more you use the various weapons and arts, the more proficiency you gain to unlock new arts or upgrades for your current arts. To complement your weapons and arts, there are also several skill trees that will unlock things such as extra item slots to carry into battle, or enable the new extreme musou attacks that allow you to combine with your allies for even larger, deadlier special moves that devastate crowds and stronger enemies. Starting out, I only had access to a single sword. Still, after defeating a general, I unlocked the ability to wield their twin pikes in future missions, which will be an incentive throughout the game to challenge all the generals in a mission, not just those set as mission objectives.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynasty Warriors Origins has the potential to be the crown jewel in the venerable series with its improved focus on combat, customization, and enhanced visuals. It's been nearly 20 years since I found myself eagerly waiting to play the newest Dynasty Warriors, but with the updates and enhancements I've seen so far in Dynasty Warriors Origins, that streak is no more. I walked away from my two-hour demo session with a renewed interest in a series I once treasured and am eager to get more time with when it releases in January. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
