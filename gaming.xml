			<p>Our most loyal readers might recall that Atomic Heart suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ditches-ray-tracing-on-pc-at-the-very-last-minute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> its promised ray tracing features practically the day before its February 2023 launch on PC. At the time, the development team at Mundfish only said it would re-evaluate the potential addition of ray tracing after launch.</p>
<p>Nearly sixteen months after the game's release date, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/668580/view/4178857302249724169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today's 1.14.4.0 update</a> has finally introduced ray tracing to the PC version of Atomic Heart, albeit in a beta state. Here's what the update log says:</p>
<p><em>Added Ray Tracing (beta) support in 3 modes**:</em><br>
<em>Performance</em><br>
<em>Quality</em><br>
<em>Balanced</em></p>
<p><em>**Requires a graphics card supporting DXR with at least 12 GB of memory for proper operation. When these modes are activated, the enabled Fidelity FX Super Resolution setting is automatically disabled. When this mode is enabled, the player’s character is not reflected in mirror surfaces.</em></p>
<p>The PC version also gets a couple of bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed crashes that occurred when disabling the Fidelity FX Super Resolution setting.</em></li>
<li><em>Removed the ability to assign multiple actions to one key at once.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, all version of Atomic Heart will receive several new accessibility features:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Colorblind mode (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia)</em></li>
<li><em>Special contrast mode</em></li>
<li><em>Black and white mode</em></li>
<li><em>Highlight of various elements and objects</em></li>
<li><em>Disable camera shake</em></li>
<li><em>Auto QTE</em></li>
<li><em>Puzzles auto-solve</em></li>
<li><em>Auto-heal</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Following the launch of the base game, Mundfish released the Annihilation Instinct DLC and the Trapped in Limbo DLC. There are supposed to be two additional DLCs, but the developers still have to reveal any concrete details about them, including their release dates.</p>

The term at least partially stems from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/explore-the-haunting-world-of-animal-well-and-read-some-tips-from-the-developer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/explore-the-haunting-world-of-animal-well-and-read-some-tips-from-the-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this list of tips from the game’s developer Billy Basso</a></span>, in which Basso discloses that “<em>Animal Well </em>is designed with three different layers.” Layers that lay over one another, revealing themselves as you play and your perspective grows. Confused? We’ve got you.<br></p><h2 id="h12434"><a id=""></a>What are <em>Animal Well</em>’s three layers?</h2><p><em>Animal Well</em>’s three layers refer to three specific goals that you can chase sequentially. The first layer of <em>Animal Well </em>is a straightforward journey that involves collecting the four Flames listed on your map and descending into a distinct final area, and played on its own will offer a very satisfying experience. The second layer involves continuing on, uncovering roughly 99% of the game’s map, hunting down collectibles and uncovering secret areas with new bosses, items, and more. The third layer of <em>Animal Well </em>is designed for hardcore puzzle solvers, featuring yet another set of collectibles that require exploiting the game’s mechanics and cross-referencing information with other players.<br></p><p>For trophy and achievement hunters, <strong>know that you only need to complete layer two to technically achieve 100% completion</strong>. Layer three is reserved for those who are determined to see everything in the game, and don’t mind looking up guides or community resources to help out. That said, can you figure out which layer you’re on in <em>Animal Well</em>? And moreover, why do some players refer to a “fourth layer” when Basso himself says there are only three? We’ll dive into those topics below.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-recommend-id="image://0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-recommend-id="image://0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As mentioned above, <em>Animal Well</em>’s first layer is its most straightforward. After progressing through the opening area and obtaining your map, you’ll see four flame icons hidden in each corner of the world. These correspond with four distinct biomes, each of which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-chameleon-boss-tips-guide-how-to-beat-1851485336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-chameleon-boss-tips-guide-how-to-beat-1851485336">a boss animal</a></span> that you’ll have to deal with. Along the way, you’ll need to collect at least six items that will help you solve puzzles that block your path, and you may as well grab as many eggs as you can find. It’s standard metroidvania stuff, but just <em>so</em> much fun to play.<br></p><p>Once you collect the four flames, you can place them in the center of the map, where the statues of the four boss animals hang over you. This will unlock the “final” area of the game, which will lead you to a boss encounter that, once completed, will trigger a credits sequence. Congratulations! You finished the game?</p><figure id="" data-id="42af8b01bd508c2d2a2a106051793788" data-recommend-id="image://42af8b01bd508c2d2a2a106051793788" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Animal Well map" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42af8b01bd508c2d2a2a106051793788" data-recommend-id="image://42af8b01bd508c2d2a2a106051793788" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <strong>Your reward for completing layer one</strong>: <em>Animal Well </em>doesn’t have endings in the traditional sense, but achieve this and you’ll find a few handy items that will help you progress through what emerges as the second layer of the game. This includes the <strong>F. Pack</strong>, which will let you hold a maximum of six Firecrackers instead of three. If you’ve successfully completed a speedrun, you can also collect a figurine at the clock in this last location to commemorate your achievement. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-recommend-id="image://f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-recommend-id="image://f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The overarching goal of <em>Animal Well</em>’s second layer is to <strong>collect all 64 secret eggs that are hidden around the game</strong>. However, you’ll need to complete a few “quests” first, since <strong>you’ll need a total of twelve different usable items</strong> to complete this task. If you’re stuck on layer two, make sure to complete the following objectives:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Return to the egg room in the center of the map after collecting 8, 16, and 32 eggs to find new items essential for exploration.</li><li>Find all nine Matches in the game and place them in the dark rooms where the ominous shadow creatures chase after you.</li><li>Collect the three hidden medals and place them in the circular recesses to unlock all-new areas. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877">Check out our detailed guide about this here</a></span>.</li><li>Free the five cats trapped in cages in the bottom-right corner of the map. (We’ll have a guide on this shortly as well.)</li></ol><p>Following these steps, you should have the tools necessary to collect every egg in the game. <strong>You may need hints to collect some eggs, but this layer is otherwise solvable on your own</strong>. If you get stuck, visit the egg room near the center of the map and reference which shelves are still missing eggs. This will help you determine which eggs you specifically need to hunt down.<br></p><p>After collecting all 64 eggs, you’ll unlock an extra key item in the egg room. Take this item to a secret room in the “final” area in the game, and you’ll trigger a new final boss sequence that resembles how layer one ended. Congratulations! You finished the game again?</p><figure id="" data-id="244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-recommend-id="image://244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-recommend-id="image://244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <strong>Your reward for completing layer two</strong>: You’ll see the credits roll once more and achieve what one might generously call the “true ending” of the game. You’ll find yet another clock hidden in this new area as well, which will reward you with yet another figurine if you’re speedrunning. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="162102cbad84626517d75751e556d258" data-recommend-id="image://162102cbad84626517d75751e556d258" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The final area of Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The final area of Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="162102cbad84626517d75751e556d258" data-recommend-id="image://162102cbad84626517d75751e556d258" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The final area of Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After completing layer two, you’ll see that your save file now has a bunny icon with a number next to it. So, as you may guess from this hint, <strong>the objective of layer three is to find 16 bunnies hiding behind predominantly esoteric puzzles</strong>. Whereas layers one and two were exploration based, layer three will involve decoding ciphers (which typically involve using the Animal Flute) and looking carefully at background details  for clues. You’re bound to have noticed loads of these while playing earlier, but now’s the time to put on your detective hat.</p><p><strong>You <em>will </em>get stuck in layer three of Animal Well without outside help</strong>, for two distinct reasons<strong>. </strong>Firstly, the puzzles here are tricky enough that you’ll want to trade tips and tricks with others to find every hidden bunny. Secondly, one bunny specifically requires assembling a puzzle that consists of 50 distinct pieces, and you’ll only see <em>one</em> of them on your file. In other words, unless you have at least 49 friends playing this game alongside you, you’re going to need to look up solutions here.<br></p><p>Fortunately, if you’re determined to solve layer three all on your own, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can click here to use a tool that will help you solve this 50-person puzzle on your own</a></span>.<br></p><p>After collecting the 16 bunnies, a new puzzle will appear inside the house you found after completing layer one. By solving this, you’ll get a series of directions that you’ll need to follow by flying on the manticore in the ending area of layer two. This will take you to a secret island that houses a neat secret for your troubles. Congratulations! You very probably actually finished the game!<br></p><figure id="" data-id="34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-recommend-id="image://34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="767" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-recommend-id="image://34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="767" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Your reward for completing layer three</strong>: Unlike the first two layers, the credits won’t roll again. Instead, you’ll find a giant bunny that will swallow you, though fortunately you can escape through its rear end (I swear I’m not making this up). For reasons that only make sense within the lore of <em>Animal Well</em>, doing this will enable your protagonist to fly by pressing the jump button in midair.<br></p><p>A cool reward for sure, but it does lack a bit of punch considering you have no more game to explore.

Instead, <em>Animal Well</em>’s fourth layer consists of carrying out incredibly specific tasks across multiple playthroughs, that the game doesn’t necessarily hint at, to unlock a series of symbols (usually referred to as unicode or wingdings). These include tasks like speedrunning the game, letting a boss hit you several times on Groundhog Day, and circumventing the solution of a layer two puzzle.<br></p><p>By piecing these clues together, you can uncover another series of directions similar to the end of layer three, which unlocks yet another secret. To be clear, <strong>you don’t need to uncover all of these clues yourself</strong>. If you’re just interested in the reward, you can look up the answer online and follow the directions without any consequence. </p><figure id="" data-id="0eedb3e9bbed1f83e675f5d16ec6ecc2" data-recommend-id="image://0eedb3e9bbed1f83e675f5d16ec6ecc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="I have genuinely no idea, I'm just editing this article.

Given how meticulously the game has been unpacked, we’d most likely have clues pointing towards any deeper puzzles at this point.<br></p><p>That said, there <em>are </em>other oddities in the game that could point to deeper secrets. For example, there’s an infamous room with a fox and snails that houses an item called the “Cheater’s Ring.” Basso most likely included this room for…well, cheaters (layer three similarly featured “fake” bunnies in the game’s code to trick dataminers). However, when asked if there was a way to get this item legitimately, Basso responded “no comment.”<br></p><p>Additionally, there is the website <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com</a></span>, with which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1cybe5t/comment/l58awm7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1cybe5t/comment/l58awm7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shared Memory’s Dan Adelman appears to be involved</a></span>. As of writing, the website simply reads “no,” once again pointing to the existence of secrets the community hasn’t uncovered yet.<br></p><p>All that said, it seems like any lingering mysteries in <em>Animal Well </em>would consist of smaller easter eggs and not a wholesale “fifth layer.” However, <em>Animal Well </em>has surprised its community time and time again, so I wouldn’t write off any possibilities just yet.

<p>Just days after announcing a number of games during Summer Game Fest, British game developer Sumo Digital — the studio behind The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others — has announced that layoffs are coming to the company.  The studio is set to let go 15% of its workforce, or 160 people, across five different countries.</p>



<p>The news of the layoffs was first revealed by <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1800565013700280422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter</a>. It also comes just days after parent Sumo Group announced a number of new games from the company.</p>



<p>According to the company, the layoffs come due to “recent difficulties” that the studio has “not been immune” to. This has lead to a decision to reduce costs “in a number of ways”.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-dead-by-daylight-dev-makes-more-layoffs">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/">Dead by Daylight Dev Makes More Layoffs</a></h6>



<p>Shortly after the layoffs were revealed, Sumo Digital <a href="https://x.com/SumoDigitalLtd/status/1800566419735576756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released the following statement</a>:</p>



<p>“Over the last 21 years Sumo has grown from small beginnings into a family of studios across the UK and the world, which we’re incredibly proud of.</p>



<p>“While we have been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months, is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</p>



<p>“The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</p>



<p>“This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future.”</p>



<p>The latest set of layoffs now puts the total <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known amount to roughly 10,561</a> within the gaming industry. The number surpasses the 10,500 known layoffs from 2023 within the first six months of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-cover-athlete-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And it's out on August 16th.</h2></div><section><p>EA Sports has announced that San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey will grace the cover of Madden NFL 25, which has a release date set for August 16 on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p><p>As you can see in the images below, McCaffrey is featured on both the Standard and Deluxe Edition covers for Madden NFL 25. McCaffrey is the sixth running back to serve as the cover athlete, following <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25-anniversary-edition">Adrian Peterson</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25-anniversary-edition-past-gen">Barry Sanders</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-12">Peyton Hillis</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2003">Marshall Faulk</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2001">Eddie George</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Madden NFL 25 Cover Reveal</h3></div></output><p>"To be on the cover of Madden NFL is a career achievement and an honor I share with all of my teammates, coaches and 49er Faithful who have helped make it possible," McCaffrey commented. "I'm pumped to get back on the field this year to give Madden players more reasons to keep scoring touchdowns with me in Madden NFL 25."</p><p>McCaffrey is one of the most recognizable stars in the NFL and one of the best running backs in the league right now. Last season, McCaffrey not only led the league in rushing with 2,023 scrimmage yards, but had the most touches with a total of 339 and the most combined rushing and receiving touchdowns with 21 for the year. In addition, McCaffrey tied a league record of scoring a touchdown in 17 straight games.</p><p>Due to his performance last season, McCaffrey won Offensive Player of the Year and was a finalist for the NFL MVP. In previous years, EA Sports used the cover athlete to represent the new features or changes made to Madden's gameplay. Unfortunately, EA did not reveal the new features and how McCaffrey's inclusion ties into them. </p><p>This is the first proper reveal EA has done for Madden NFL 25 after reliable video game leaker and data miner Billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-connait-la-date-de-sortie-du-prochain-madden-nfl-25-50251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a report</a> about when this year's game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25s-release-date-leaked">would release</a>. The report also alleged several updated features to various game modes, including Career and Franchise.</p><p>Madden NFL 25 is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">now available for pre-order</a>. Those who buy the $100 Deluxe Edition get access to Madden NFL 25 three days early. Those planning to buy Madden NFL 25 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/college-football-25">College Football 25</a> this year could also buy the MVP Bundle, which retails for $150 and includes the Deluxe Editions for both games. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p>Video games should be upfront and honest with the player, but sometimes they have to mislead you a little bit. Case in point: according to a recent <a href="https://x.com/EbengerJohn/status/1799810812347117772" rel="nofollow ">social media post</a> from designer John Ebenger, if you tried to sprint in the Citadel in Mass Effect 1, you weren't actually moving any faster: the camera field of view (FOV) simply changed to give you a sense of speed rather than the real thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Ebenger served as a designer at BioWare on both Dragon Age and Mass Effect, and now currently works as a cinematic director at Firewalk Studios, which is working on the recently-revealed hero shooter Concord. Ebenger says Shepherd's turtle-like gait was due to technical limitations: the game simply couldn't stream in assets fast enough on the older consoles. Given how the original Mass Effect famously used elevators to hide its load times, this makes sense. The more you know.</p>

If Solas is successful, untold havoc will be wrought on the inhabitants of Thedas.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official 20 Minute Gameplay Reveal</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Teaming up with everyone's favorite dwarven archer, <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Varric_Tethras" rel="nofollow ">Varric</a>, lovable former Inquisition scout <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Lace_Harding" rel="nofollow ">Harding</a>, and Minrathous' resident mage-slash-detective, <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Neve_Gallus" rel="nofollow ">Neve Gallus</a>, Rook hacks-and-slashes his way through the various demons that have begun slipping through the Veil. At a glance, Veilguard's third-person combat looks smooth and satisfying, and gives players the choice to attack in real-time or pull up a combat wheel, pausing time while they decide which power they want to make use of. Players can choose to be a rogue, a mage, or a warrior, and each class has its own skill tree featuring useful perks and combat abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">After fighting off a Pride Demon, Rook and his fellow Veilguards get within sight of Solas, who's slightly distracted by the whole tearing-a-hole-in-reality thing. Varric decides now would be a great time for a chat, directing Rook, Harding, and Neve to hold off the demons while Varric pleads with Solas to rethink his methods. Unfortunately, his attempt at getting the elven god to see reason goes awry, and Solas zaps Varric's crossbow with a blast of magic, shattering it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317294"></a><figcaption>As with every Dragon Age game, The Veilguard forces players to make difficult decisions, though The Veilguard seems to give players some extra context.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Realizing things have gone sideways, Rook decides it's time for some hands-on diplomacy and opts to knock over one of several massive elven statues, hoping to create a domino effect that will interrupt the ritual. But first, he has a decision to make: Should he bring Harding with him, or Neve? An option wheel appears on-screen, and Rook decides to take Harding with him (earning some approval from her in the process) while Neve stays back to keep the demon attacks under control. Interestingly, the wheel provides some extra information about the choice, revealing that Neve is more likely to follow the player into serious danger.</p><p dir="ltr">With Harding's help, the statues are toppled, and Solas is nearly crushed by one of them. This seems to interrupt the ritual, but it's not clear if it's actually been stopped, as a massive tear in the Veil appears and two imposing, monstrous figures step through it. Even Solas looks a little concerned, but the trailer ends before more information about these creatures is divulged.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to release sometime this fall.

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We have finally seen a decent chunk of gameplay for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. Developer BioWare has published a full 20-minute video detailing some beautiful locations, an encounter with Solas, and the tragic loss of Bianca in what seems like a very early part of the game. </p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">The video shows the player character following Varric as they move through a city in turmoil. Their plan is to prevent Solas from tearing down the Veil and opening up a hole to the Fade. This would allow demons to pour into the world, though many of them are already present and attacking the party as they collect more characters moving through the city. It’s the heartbreaking encounter with Solas that’s so impactful here, though. Poor Bianca never saw it coming. </p>
 <h2 id="h-dragon-age-the-veilguard-s-gameplay-shows-off-varric-and-solas-explosive-encounter" data-injectable="false"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>‘s gameplay shows off Varric and Solas’ explosive encounter</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="false">Bianca is Varric’s beloved crossbow. Ever since his introduction in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, she’s been a staple weapon for him. Capable of shooting dozens of arrows at once, she could make short work of any enemies. Now, though, as we see in the video above, she’s been ripped apart by Solas in a fit of rage when the two friends shared a moment, and Varric pleased with him not to tear the Veil. </p>

<p data-characters="318" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Even though it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg03d8C5XkQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the very earliest showcases of Nvidia’s RTX lineup </a>of graphics cards <em>way</em> back in 2019, <em>Atomic Heart</em> hasn’t officially supported ray tracing proper. It’s been a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/atomic-heart-puts-its-ray-traced-beauty-on-full-display-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good looking game</a>, to be sure, but ray-traced it wasn’t. Unless you’ve got the latest update, that is.</p> <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Indeed, <em>Atomic Heart</em> has finally received a proper set of ray tracing graphic settings for players to peruse, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/atomic-heart-review-destructoid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost a year and a half after its initial release</a> on PC. The update – patch 1.14.4.0 – is fairly exciting in a few different ways, mind, as it comes with a surprisingly comprehensive array of accessibility features <em>and</em> a set of new Steam achievements for one of the game’s DLCs, but ray-traced graphics are definitely the belle of the bunch. Just note that they’re currently still in public beta, as it were.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mundfish</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-atomic-heart-s-ray-tracing-support-is-now-in-beta" data-injectable="false">Atomic Heart’s ray tracing support is now in beta</h2> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">Upon installing the 1.14.4.0 version of <em>Atomic Heart</em> on PC, you’ll be greeted with an all-new ‘Ray Tracing’ graphics setting in the menu. This beta version of the option allows you to set ray tracing to Performance, Quality, or Balance mode depending on your hardware and preference, which will elevate the game’s visual fidelity a few notches beyond its already impressive baseline.</p>
 <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">This, of course, comes with a hefty performance malus. Further, you’ll also need a DXR-enabled graphics card with <em>at least</em> 12 GB of VRAM for ray tracing to work properly in <em>Atomic Heart</em>. This is a tad funny in hindsight, of course, as even though <em>Atomic Heart</em> was initially demoed on the now-humble RTX 2000 series of Nvidia graphics cards, it’s clear that the game’s current ray-traced graphics are still going to push even the latest RT-ready GPUs to the max.</p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">If you’re uninterested in ray tracing for whatever reason, <em>Atomic Heart</em>‘s new suite of accessibility settings might prove more meaningful to you. The new update allows you to tweak all of the following settings however you wish:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"> <li>Quick-time event auto-completion</li> <li>Colorblind mode (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia)</li> <li>Special contrast mode</li> <li>Black and white mode</li> <li>Environmental object highlights</li> <li>Camera shake settings</li> <li>Puzzle auto-solving</li> <li>Auto-healing</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false">Not bad, right? Patch 1.14.4.0 is now available for all PC players of <em>Atomic Heart </em>on PC, so give it a whirl.</p>

        <p>Arriving on Netflix this November</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I've never played League Of Legends and I have no interest in doing so, but Arcane was superb. Set within the world of Riot's MOBA and starring several of its playable characters, Netflix's mini series was better animated and better written than any of its peers.
</p>
<p>A second season is on the way and due to arrive this November. Its teaser trailer also refers to it as "the final chapter".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Probably don't watch this if you didn't see the first season:
</p>

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Arcane season two teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEbfiLaOdJA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>That its the final season is good news, right? I loved the first season of Arcane, but good stories have endings. 
</p>
<p>I might need to go re-watch the first season between now and November, because I've forgotten a lot of the details since the first season launched in 2021. Even I can tell its picking up the major plot threads from the original's ending, with several recurring characters - which is why you shouldn't have watched the above trailer if you didn't see season one.
</p>
<p>Arcane is the work of French animation studio Fortiche, who aside from Arcane also worked on K/DA music videos and game trailers for Riot. Riot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-buy-big-part-of-arcane-animation-studio">bought a substantital stake in the company in 2022</a>, which suggests Arcane might not be their last League Of Legends-themed animation project. Or maybe next time it'll be a Valorant series, who knows.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Won’t Actually Take Up Over 300 GB of Storage Promises Activision]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-does-not-take-up-over-300-gb-storage/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-won%E2%80%99t-actually-take-up-over-300-gb-of-storage-promises-activision.898326/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-does-not-take-up-over-300-gb-storage/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Call of Duty franchise has become rather notorious in recent years for gobbling up unreasonable amounts of storage, which is particularly frustrating on current-gen consoles with limited SSD space. So yeah, most people were expecting <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> to be a big game, and yet, many were still shocked when the game’s pre-order pages indicated the game will require a <em>310 GB install</em>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops69.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Say whaaaat? Thankfully, the <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1720119892697821399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty X account</a> has since popped up to reassure players that the Black Ops 6 install won’t be <em>that</em> unreasonable. That 310 GB is for somebody who installs Call of Duty HQ, which is the launcher required for all recent CoD titles, along with CoD Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and all DLC for those games. While you can’t get away from installing Call of Duty HQ, obviously you don’t need to install Warzone or any of the other games to play Black Ops 6.</p>
<p><em>“Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</em></p>
<p><em>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone and all relevant content packs, including all localized languages combined which is not representative of a typical player install experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Players will be able to download Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at launch without downloading any other Call of Duty titles or all of the language packs . The actual estimation of the Black Ops 6 file size will be available closer to launch.”</em></p>
<p>As for how big Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will actually be, that remains to be seen, but Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and III “only” require about 150 GB apiece to play if you strip them right down and don’t install Warzone, DLC, other games, ect. Interestingly, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will also be utilizing cloud-based texture streaming, which means the game is always online, but perhaps that might also keep the game’s file size somewhat in check.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on PC (via Steam, Battle.net, and Microsoft Store), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on October 25. You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-omnimovement-campaign-zombies-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get more details on the game here</a>.</p>

So in the character creator, I like to call it ‘Last Time on <em>Dragon Age</em>,’ but you can go into your past adventures and it, actually through tarot cards, tells you what the context was and what decision you want to make.”</p><p>Busche explained the decision was made to not import save data this time around because “technology is so different and [BioWare] wanted it to be in the client.” That makes sense given <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>is 10 years old and was played on old hardware. I’d also be surprised if a lot of those decisions tracked by Keep will factor into <em>The Veilguard</em>. So maybe as novel as it was, it’s just simpler to give players a menu to pick the decisions that will play into things rather than importing <em>everything</em>.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall, and takes a notably more action-oriented approach with combat than the series has ever had.

According to creative director Bio Jade Adam Granger, there was a fine line between keeping "the original recipe" intact and tweaking other parts of the experience.</p>

<p>"We have things that are staying as-is, like the wall run, which is so iconic that we will try to match it as much as we can," Granger said in a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/5bpvgE64gxlTtkBULl98XT" rel="nofollow ">Ubisoft blog post</a>. "The dagger as well. There are core elements of the original recipe that we respect and sanctify: time powers, the tone of the game, and the gravity-defying gameplay. But we modernize stuff like the level design, for example, and really enhance the scale of the world."</p><p>Game director Michael McIntyre added that combat has also been reworked, but signature moves like the overhead vault strike and rolling attacks have been kept so that players still feel like an acrobatic hero.</p><p>Addressing the lengthy development cycle--the project was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-revealed-dur/1100-6482030/">first revealed during the 2020 Ubisoft Forward Showcase</a>--Granger explained that "the landscape of remakes has evolved a lot" in the years since Sands of Time was first announced and that the bar had been raised. Big changes to the characters, camera, and controls have been made, and Ubisoft Montreal had to build prototypes to fine-tune the gameplay further.</p><p>"It takes time and craftsmanship and people, which is why we have reinforcements from other studios to help us here," Granger said.</p><p>While the story will remain the same, McIntyre says players will get to experience more interactions between the Prince and companion, Princess Farah. "Probably the biggest development that we've done is to make Farah more present," McIntyre said. We're able to add more interactions between her and the Prince, so you can get more from their relationship. They will simply spend more time beside each other.</p><p>This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Prince of Persia franchise, and Ubisoft is celebrating with new content for two of its recent releases. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" data-ref-id="5000-590624">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has more DLC on the way and it will receive its first expansion, Mask of Darkness, in September. Currently in early access on PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" data-ref-id="5000-625410">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>'s first big update adds a new biome to explore, more weapons to master, and deadlier enemies to try them out on.</p>

        <p>Nearly 250 employees at risk</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sumo Group has announced it is seeking to cut costs with up to 15%, or nearly 250, of its employees at risk.</p>
<p>The firm says it hasn't been immune to the challenges facing the games industry and needs to reshape its organisation to 'navigate upcoming challenges'.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its work-for-hire and co-development services, and has built games for the likes of PlayStation, Microsoft and Sega. It also has an indie publishing team called Secret Mode. The firm has offices across Europe, India and Canada.</p>
<p>It was acquired by Tencent<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-high-court-approves-tencents-sumo-acquisition"> in a $1.27 million deal in January 2022.</a></p>
<p>The firm said in a statement: "Every day the incredibly talented people across Sumo studios are dedicated to creating great games and bringing ground-breaking experiences to players worldwide. That work and dedication over the past 21 years has helped to put Sumo on the map and build a family of studios that are second to none, and we are incredibly proud of what Sumo has become.</p>
<p>"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</p>
<p>"The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</p>
<p>"This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future."</p>
<p>Sumo Group has developed games including the BAFTA-winning Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Crackdown 3, and supported the development of games such as Team Sonic Racing, Forza Horizon and Hogwarts Legacy. It also develops its own internal projects, including Snake Pass and the upcoming Still Wakes The Deep.</p>

Our studio is best known for our roguelike deckbuilder </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In May 2023, we released another roguelike strategy game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062810/Inkbound/">Inkbound</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, into Steam’s Early Access program. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was recently released in 1.0, and we have been reflecting on our first experience with Early Access. This postmortem will outline what we think went right and wrong and will hopefully have some useful takeaways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After wrapping up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, its expansion pack, and various ports, we decided that we wanted to continue making roguelike strategy games but wanted to try to expand into online cooperative multiplayer. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> started as another card game, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but we felt we couldn’t make that work well in a cooperative environment after some early prototypes. The pacing was too slow. We pivoted to a hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay. In Inkbound, each player has an avatar they control with free movement in a 3D world, but in the strategic battles, the gameplay is turn-based. Players go on roguelike runs in a fantasy world where books create portals into their stories. During a run, players draft powerups to improve their “build” on a mission to defeat the enemy threat who is trying to unravel the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the game can be played solo, we also support 2 to 4-player cooperative multiplayer. Critically, to keep the pace up, in multiplayer, all players can take their actions simultaneously, including in combat. There is no defined turn order among players. It’s up to players to coordinate to use their abilities effectively. This combat system is one of our core twists and one of the reasons we wanted to use Early Access: to get additional feedback and iteration time on this new model before reaching 1.0.</span></p><p>Players battling a boss in multiplayer. Images via Shiny Shoe.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of feedback, listening to team and player feedback is a critical component of our development process and we have built a variety of systems to try to make gathering feedback as efficient as possible. Creating a culture of open feedback is a core studio goal. Prior to releasing in Early Access, we tested the game with a few hundred testers to try to both catch as many technical issues as possible, as well as improve balance and game feel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the stage set, let’s jump into the specifics of what went right and wrong in our Early Access program.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Went Right">What Went Right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text"><br>Listening and Pivoting</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After releasing in Early Access we received a significant amount of feedback from a variety of channels, some good, some bad, and some requesting major changes. Although it can be painful to listen to negative feedback at times, I believe it’s critical to push through and try to understand the feedback trends. It’s clear to me that some people are better at staying level-headed when reading negative feedback than others. I encourage you to identify those people on your team and have them help summarize the feedback in constructive ways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We felt we had a solid core game at our Early Access launch but some aspects of how the title was built were not received well by players in a way that blindsided us. More on this later. We absorbed that feedback and made some major pivots during Early Access in terms of game structure and business model. Some of the biggest feature additions included new character classes, new bosses, and a popular feature called “vestige sets” that give synergistic benefits to collecting different items during the course of a run.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Feedback Made Easy">Feedback Made Easy</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we’ve shipped all of our games with a feedback mechanism built straight into the game. It has gone so well that I encourage every developer to do this. On PC, we map a key to open an in-game feedback form, and in pre-release builds, put a message on the screen at all times encouraging players to push the button if they have something to say. We also ship this feature into production, though we turn off the always-on prompt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This system has proven immensely useful. If a player encounters a bug, they have an immediate way to send a report to the development team right when they are experiencing the issue and it is fresh in their mind. The same is true for balance feedback, quality of life concerns, and any frustration that they might be experiencing. When a player sends feedback, they get a free text entry to type in what is on their mind and under the hood, we capture a screenshot, their log file, their save game, and some other gameplay metadata. This additional data is incredibly useful for investigating bug reports and generally understanding the context of the feedback in cases where the written text may not be 100% clear.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to this in-game mechanism, we also encourage our engaged player community to connect with us on Discord and put in the effort to keep that well-moderated and a positive place to offer constructive feedback. Finally, we monitor a few other sources for feedback, like the Steam forums, our support e-mail, and social media. We want it to be easy to reach us.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Online Infrastructure">Online Infrastructure</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to encourage multiplayer. When playing the game online, players see each other in a central social hub between runs. There, they can optionally chat and party up before going on their next run. As a studio, this was our first big online game, and we decided to go with centralized hosting to ensure multiplayer would be as frictionless as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had the benefit of deciding to approach it this way from the outset, which enabled us to make technical decisions to support multiplayer and cloud server hosting along the way. We did a lot of research on engine architecture and server hosting deployment architecture, and we did as much simulated load testing as we could before the game came out to look for issues. Finally, before Early Access release, we ran a Steam Playtest, framing it as a “technical test” where players could try out the game and we could see how well our infrastructure was working.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were quite nervous about this aspect of the project going into Early Access launch day, but, in the end, it went fairly well. All the effort in research, development, and testing in this area resulted in a quite stable launch from a technology perspective.</span></p><p>Players hanging out in the Atheneum social hub. Images via Shiny Shoe.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Went Wrong">What Went Wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Business Model Misfire">Business Model Misfire</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched as a premium title with optional cosmetic-only in-game monetization. This is not common in the roguelike genre, but with our planned centralized online/cooperative experience, we wanted to try a business model that could support ongoing updates without having to charge for content in a way that segregates the community (like only certain players having access to an area). We tried to be as simple and generous as possible with the monetization design. There were plenty of cosmetics to earn for free, and the system was completely optional. Players could not buy power, and all gameplay was available without interacting with that system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to incorporate in-game monetization did not go over well with players. We were blindsided by the amount of negative feedback. The complaints were primarily centered around the sense that additional items being sold in an Early Access title is unacceptable. This wasn’t stated by players but I also theorize that between the time we started developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2021 to its Early Access release in 2023 that in-game monetization in premium games has soured industry-wide.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even though we did a lot of pre-release testing, I think we were blindsided because business model decisions are basically impossible to test pre-release on PC compared to elements like gameplay balance. Our pre-release community testing crew got the game and everything in it for free, so they did not have the same emotional response to these features as players who were not involved in the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, during our time in Early Access we fully removed in-game monetization. As expected, this was a popular decision, and I believe the right one for the project. We migrated the cosmetics that were previously available in the game into DLC “supporter packs” that can be optionally purchased on Steam. This is a model that is more widely accepted.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="English-only during Early Access">English-only during Early Access</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We made a strategic decision to launch in Early Access in English only to maximize our ability to iterate and release content updates without lengthy translation pipelines. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a lot of text and game mechanics, and the goal was to empower game designers to change it as rapidly as they saw fit, improving the game and reducing the time it took to release those changes to our players. In that regard, this decision was a success because it certainly simplified the release process and allowed us to patch gameplay rules and systems rapidly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s impossible to know for sure, but I believe that this was a mistake on the business side. Our top refund reason for the duration of Early Access was “no Chinese language support.” The Early Access release is one of your most important marketing beats, and only supporting English certainly reduced our reach during one of the times of maximum visibility. Eventually, we localized into a variety of languages at 1.0, which had been our plan all along, but I’ll always wonder how many players we failed to reach between Early Access that we were not able to reconnect with at 1.0.</span></p><p>At 1.0 we finally completed the Chinese localization. Images via Shiny Shoe.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Solo vs Co-op—it’s hard to serve both well">Solo vs Co-op—it’s hard to serve both well</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from the outset to support online co-op as one of its core unique features, but also committed to supporting solo play. We found that after launch, approximately 60% of runs were played solo, and 40% were co-op. We received feedback from engaged players in both camps, suggesting ways to improve either the solo or co-op experience.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these suggestions were sometimes at odds with each other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our design team found it challenging to support both playstyles optimally, and with the split between runs relatively even, there wasn’t an obvious side to fully commit to. It also caused some friction internally where some folks on the team were advocating for focusing on pushing multiplayer features while others didn’t want to do anything that would potentially cause a purely solo player to be unhappy. For example, adding objectives that require multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, we stuck to ensuring solo players could experience everything in the game, with multiplayer remaining a fun way to play but not pushed as far as it could have been if we had gone co-op only. In the end, we feel it did work out, but we also wonder if we should have gone solo-only or multiplayer-only.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was our first game to utilize Early Access, and we had some surprises that we did not anticipate. In the end, it was a valuable learning experience and I’m glad that we tried it. As we continue to support </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> post-launch we also have an eye to the future and are debating internally if and how we will use Early Access on future games. Regardless, we will definitely be applying the lessons learned on this project to our future games.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Blogger</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mark Cooke is the Lead Gameplay Programmer at Nihilistic, which he joined in August 2004 after interning at the company 3 years earlier.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40000<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="274" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Take it from someone who has played an assortment of wargames for nearly four decades: sometimes, a change is as good as a rest. If you have been pouring your heart and soul into <em>Warhammer 40K</em> for a while and just need something a bit different, there are options out there.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">While Games Workshop certainly has a lot going for it, such as rather nice sculpts, very good lore, and a degree of mindshare that makes getting games extremely easy, that’s no reason to ignore the rest of the offerings on the market from all manner of companies. Now, this list will concern itself with games that are set in science-fiction settings and are army-level. I’m assuming you want to play something like 40K here, not something dramatically different.</p>
 <h2 id="h-great-alternatives-to-warhammer-40k" data-injectable="false">Great alternatives to Warhammer 40K</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">Grimdark Future by OnePageRules</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via One Page Rules</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="941" data-injectable="true">OnePageRules is something of a cheat entry, as they have an alternative for almost everything, but this really is the very best thing to play if you are looking for something new to do with your <em>Warhammer 40K</em> army. A simple set of rules won’t take long to learn, and you’ll be able to use pretty much every model you already own because that is how the system was designed. Over the years, OPR products have slowly been turning into viable standalone products rather than just a “this is almost 40K, but free” alternative. This is great, as they are a talented team that deserves to grow beyond that initial concept. </p>
 <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">Have you always wanted to use a custom Space Skaven army to smash up some silly Chaos Space Marines? You can just use Mantic’s Veer-myn range of minis for a Ratmen Clans army while your CSM become Havoc Brothers. Fans of the magic of 3D printing can buy all sorts of files for the game’s many factions, and those same factions have been designed to cover just about every popular motif across the biggest games in the genre. They also have an extremely high-value Patreon, where you get oodles of free files each month.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">The best thing about <em>Grimdark Future</em> is that the rules really are fun. Army balance is pretty on point, and there is a certain reward for playing in a sandbox with less structure and lore around it, in that you can simply make it all up as you go. For an average game of 40-50 models made up of squads, vehicles, and characters, you are looking at about an hour and a half once you are familiar with the rules.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">BattleTech by Catalyst Game Labs</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Catalyst Labs</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><em>BattleTech’s Alpha Strike</em> made it onto my list of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-tabletop-miniature-skirmish-games-to-play-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best skirmish games to play</a>, but this time around, we are talking about the standard rules. Catalyst Game Labs have done a pretty good job of bringing this beast back to good condition in recent years, although folks outside of America should be warned that distribution can be a little spotty.</p>
 <p data-characters="529" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">The joy of <em>BattleTech</em> is in the details. While the model count might be low, with a classic match being two players and four mechs each, the deep and detailed ruleset means you are still looking at maybe two hours to wrap a game, and that is if you are quite familiar with it. Now, there are plenty of ways to make that shorter or longer, depending on your preference. I’ve seen people play games that took entire weekends to complete, with multiple players, multiple boards, and troop migration from one table to the next.</p>
 <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false">What seems to be the sticking point for many people is the models, which have quite dated designs and might not be your cup of tea. That just means you are wrong, but don’t worry about it too much. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Firefight by Mantic Games</h3> <figure data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mantic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">I’ve got a few reasons why Mantic is a better company than Games Workshop, and <em>Firefight </em>is one of them. Cheaper overall, better rules (sorry, 10th Edition 40K, you are just not for me), well supported, and similar enough to be inviting while different enough to be challenging. </p> <p data-characters="670" data-current-count="955" data-injectable="true">I feel like Mantic gets unfairly saddled with a “poor man’s GW” title, but <em>Kings of War</em> has been the best rank and flank game on the market for years, and <em>Firefight </em>is a fantastic game on its own merit. Starter sets cost about $140 with everything you need for two forces and all the rules to play. There are also two of them available, in case you don’t like one of the factions in one of the boxes. Most armies have a starter set for about $100, which would maybe get you two squads in other systems. You can even get the rules for free by signing up for their companion app, and those app-based rules get updated whenever new changes are made.</p>
 <h3 id="h-star-wars-legion-by-atomic-mass-games" data-injectable="false">Star Wars: Legion by Atomic Mass Games</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Atomic Mass Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Don’t tell anyone, but <em>Star Wars: Legion</em> is actually pretty ace. This is the game to go to if you want to play out some of the large battles that you saw on screen as a child in those space opera movies that nobody ever really saw. It has the advantage of getting to use designs that have stood the test of time and are as visually striking today as they were when first released. </p>
 <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">One of the reasons that I like <em>Legion</em> is that it scales pretty well. You can use smaller forces on a small table or bigger forces on a bigger table, and you won’t get some of the creaking that comes from under the hood of other rule sets. Games Workshop has a novel means of solving this lately with Combat Patrol in <em>40K</em> and Spearhead in <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, but <em>Star Wars: Legion’s</em> designers managed to crack this one pretty well without the need for an additional ruleset being attached.</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">The game features a neat activation system that replicates some of the randomness of war without leaving one player completely open to getting RNGd into oblivion, and the gameplay manages to walk a fine line between being both strategically and tactically rewarding. I always break it down like this. Strategy is how opposing armies interact, and tactics are how opposing troops interact. If you are missing one of those elements, you have a bad tabletop game.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Beyond the Gates of Antares by Warlord/Skytrex</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warlord Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true"><em>Beyond the Gates of Antares</em> is an interesting fish because it never really got the attention it deserved, and now it might be too late. <em>Gates</em> is all about human and non-human factions punching the hell out of each other to control the titular gates that allow access to all manner of hidden worlds and cosmic wonder.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Rick Priestly, probably still best known for his work laying the very foundations and building an awful lot of the walls of <em>Warhammer 40K</em> back in the day, is the man behind the rules. You’d be tempted to think he would have just rolled off and designed his next iteration of that ruleset under a different banner, but <em>Gates </em>is a pretty interesting game on its own merit.</p> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="937" data-injectable="true">The bad news on this one is that the game is currently in an odd place. It is no longer under the banner of former publisher Warlord Games and is instead with sister company Skytrex, which is selling the miniatures. This means it now sits in a strange place where you can get the game, and it is being supported as a passion project by Rick Priestly and former official head of the project Tim Bancroft. It is seeing an interesting surge in support on a community level, and it’s worth exploring if you don’t mind buying into older, at-risk systems.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Warmachine by Steamforged Games/Privateer Press</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="true">Folks were wondering where <em>Warmachine </em>was on my list of best skirmish games. Well, here you go. <em>Warmachine </em>is the game that could have, nay, should have, taken the crown from <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, at least as a competitive game. Then publisher Privateer Press somewhat fumbled the bag, sadly, and over the years, the game has faded away. The launch of MKIV didn’t do much to win me back with $200, 3D printed starter sets, and it seems like that is the case for others, too.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><em>Warmachine </em>and related IPs were recently sold to Steamforged Games. Now, Steamforged is certainly not above some criticism around certain areas, but I originally wrote this entry BEFORE this news was announced, and it was a few paragraphs of doom and gloom. I feel much better now, as Steamforged has said nothing will be changing except the stuff I think is bad, such as the lack of availability of the product, lack of a proper two-player starter set, and lack of plastic models in the new sculpts.</p>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">So, while I still feel a lot of trepidation about Warmachine in general, I do wonder if this might be it. The moment. The glorious ascent to levels of yesteryear? We can live in hope.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Quick Hits</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">Victory Decision: Future Combat by A.D. Publishing</h3> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">Flexibility is the name of the game for Victory Decision: Future Combat. This tome builds onto the Victory Condition system, adding specific rules for science fiction units. It covers quite a lot of variety and can work with anything from 6mm to 32mm models. It’s a fun system, but will definitely take some getting used to.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Dropzone Commander</h3> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Technically more <em>Epic </em>than <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, this 10mm scale city battles game by TT Combat is well worth a look. Miniature design in this game is just wonderful, with all factions being distinct and a lot of love going into each and every model. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Any old edition of Warhammer 40K</h3> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="false">If, like me, you are just not jiving with 10th Edition, then feel free to break out any old edition of the game. I still play 2nd Edition a lot and will play 5th Edition when people give my arm a little twist. Old rules are, thankfully, not dead rules, we can always crack open those old books and play again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/marvels-spider-man-2-gets-an-amazing-new-lineup-of-suits-including-the-latest-into-the-spider-verse-skin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=marvels-spider-man-2-gets-an-amazing-new-lineup-of-suits-including-the-latest-into-the-spider-verse-skin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="223" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Just when I think I’ve gotten my fill in the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spider-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Spider-Man</a> </em>universe, Insomniac Games swings me back in with new content. Another suit expansion is on the way, with an upcoming update set for June 18, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">The new update offers eight new suits to try on, and don’t worry; they are entirely free to use. The artist Colm Dillane, also known as KidSuper, designed several skins, blending together his classic artwork into <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a></em>. He also collaborated with other special guests for the project, including professional football player Vini Jr., motorsports driver Lando Norris, and singer/actress/model Rina Sawayama.</p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Vini Jr. and KidSuper have co-designed the vibrant Ginga Suit (left), depicting a sporty look for Vini Jr.’s successful athletic career. Lando Norris, on the other hand, has taken his racing career as the muse for the Fluro Suit (right), perfectly matching any motorsports driver’s gear through its helmet. </p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">As for Rina Sawayama and KidSuper’s collaboration, players can expect a “badass motorbike” look with the Motorchic Suit. Hit the streets of New York City covered in leather and take down those bad guys in style.</p> <figure data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Among the suits that Insomniac Games has customized, one that I’m particularly thrilled about is Into the Spider-Verse’s Peter B. Parker fit. This suit, with its unique design and nod to the beloved character, will be excellent for those movie scene recreation shots. Many players have already done this with other skins, specifically with the film-based suits from <em>Spider-Man</em> and <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false">Another personal favorite of mine, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spider-man-miles-morales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miles Morales</a>, will also be getting more suits, including the Animated Suit (left) and Uptown Pride Suit (right).</p> <figure data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">I have always loved the look of <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man’s </em>animated outfits, so it’s fantastic to see even more join the lineup. Insomniac Games also plans to implement more stability fixes with the update. It will address the issues with the parry and traversal swap from the Symbiote to Spider Arms.</p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">Both the stability fixes and the suits will arrive on June 18. Make sure to update <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> with the latest patch to get the new skins for free.</p>

<p data-characters="242" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em>, the free-to-play gacha game by Kuro Games, has only been available for the masses to play for under three weeks. However, since its release on May 17, 2024, the RPG has already hit a huge milestone — 30 million downloads.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">This number does include pre-registrations and doesn’t reflect the number of active players per day. However, it’s a commendable occasion for the studio either way you slice it. It’s no small feat, considering the issues faced by <em>Wuthering Waves</em> since it was released.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">There have been a string of issues plaguing the game, such as event schedule readjustments, translation errors, problems with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-echoes-guide/">Echo system</a>, and balancing issues when recycling certain Echoes. All of these issues have resulted in compensation rewards for all players, including huge amounts of Shell Credits and Astrite to make up for inconveniences faced.<br></p>

 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">Despite all of these issues, it’s clear that players are still coming back for more <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, with new players adding to the number of pre-registrations that existed prior to the release of the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">It’s easy to see why, with regular updates and hotfixes, plus a seemingly endless stream of events and the addictive nature of gacha gaming, <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is clearly hitting all the right notes with players, even if things haven’t gone entirely smoothly.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">With a new update arriving on June 28 (or June 27, depending on where you’re located), including two new Resonators and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-1-1-release-date-new-resonators-and-map-expansion/">host of other new features</a>, <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is likely to keep attracting players both new and returning.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-sails-far-from-the-series%E2%80%99-origins.898278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has released the first&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer, and we're a long way from the careful, considered CRPG approach of 2009's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p>
<p>Last week, BioWare revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard">had become&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em></a>, and that we'd get a first look at gameplay soon. That time has come, and first impressions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>are...certainly different.</p>
<p>The trailer opens with the player character, here named Rook, and series regular Varric Tethras looking for a mage detective (that's a detective who's a mage, not one who finds mages) named Neve Gallus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-hack-and-slash.jpg?itok=HQ1OCbZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-hack-and-slash.jpg?itok=WA2K4rUo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>isn't the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>you might remember.</figcaption></figure><p>Varric and Rook move through a city seemingly watched over by a giant Panopticon-style tower, and it isn't long before demons are running loose throughout the city, apparently summoned by Solas himself, the Dreadwolf of the game's previous title.</p>
<p>Soon, Rook, Varric, and companion Harding get into some combat, and we see that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is pretty much shrugging off the cloak of tactical RPG combat to fully embrace action.</p>
<p>The combat looks very hack-and-slash-inspired; the focus seems to be on stylish moves and cooldowns rather than strategy and planning, which means the trajectory of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Inquisition&nbsp;</em>is arguably at its apex here.</p>
<p><em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>also looks like it's putting quite a heavy emphasis on setpieces and "cool moments"; bringing down a statue and watching as demons rampage through the city streets spring to mind in this trailer.</p>

<p>Although the combat doesn't look much like old-school&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>, we do get to see our protagonist making some dialogue decisions on an&nbsp;<em>Inquisition</em>-style dialogue wheel that assigns responses to certain tones and moods.</p>
<p>We also get to see decisions being made that will apparently impact the plot and how characters feel about us; at one stage, Rook makes a decision of which one character approves and another disapproves.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this gameplay trailer represents the opening moments of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which means that it might be placing a heavier emphasis on setpieces than later sequences do in order to set the scene.</p>
<p>The trailer culminates in Varric confronting Solas about his deeds, upon which Solas shatters Varric's iconic crossbow Bianca and two powerful-looking demons appear to flank him.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see just how much of the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s DNA has actually made it into&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, but either way, the game is launching on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S this fall.

            <p><strong>UPDATE 5.45pm UK:</strong> Arcane may be ending with its second season, but Riot Games is planning more projects with the show's talented animation studio Fortiche, the developer has now said.
</p>
<p>"Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and our partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," co-creator Christian Linke said in a new <a href="https://x.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1800543519725297679">developer update video</a>. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with the second season. 
</p>
<p>"But Arcane is just the first of many stories we want to tell in Runeterra. We've been with Riot through Vi and Jinx's entire journey thus far, from becoming in-game champions to characters featured in different cinematics to main characters in a TV show. Their arcs have grown so far beyond our original dreams, and we want to give the same treatment to more champions. 
</p>
<p>"We're currently working on our next projects across television and film, and we're hopeful that we can share more before the end of the year. We're still in the early stages of that, and these things do take a lot of time, but we want to share updates with you whenever we can."</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 4.45pm UK:</strong> 
You wait years for a new season of your favourite show, and then find out it's ending. In what looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">classic Netflix fashion</a>, today's action-packed trailer for Arcane season two describes the show's long-awaited second run of episodes as "The Final Chapter". 
</p>
<p>
Which, for possibly the best video game adaptation of all time, and just an incredible TV show in general, is pretty bad news. 
</p>
<p>
Spoilers abound for the show's first season here, as the trailer appears to answer what happened next after the first season's explosive cliffhanger ending.

<p>
Some (but clearly not all) of the series' characters from season one are present, in this, our best look at Arcane season two yet. It looks great! But hell, to find out these episodes are likely the end of Arcane's story already is a massive shame. 
</p>
<p>
Arcane's first nine-episode season debuted on Netflix in 2021. It took six years to make, and was showered by praise from fans of its League of Legends source material and newcomers alike. It was also critically adored, and won that year's Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.
</p>
<p>
The show's upcoming second season has taken another three years to put together, and it was hoped its story would continue on further. There's still the possibility of another Arcane-style series set elsewhere within its universe, perhaps, but fans should now seemingly prepare themselves for the show's overall series finale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-two-teaser-reveals-a-big-new-character-and-sets-fan-tongues-wagging">when new episodes arrive this November</a>.

  <p id="I0DbbW">As if predestined by the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090250/bene-gesserit-sex-powers-frank-herbert-books-vs-movies">Bene Gesserit</a>, <a href="https://www.cmon.com/products/dune-war-for-arrakis/"><em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em></a> arrived at the perfect moment. This big-box strategy game emerged in the wake of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072878/dune-2-timothee-chalamet-paul-hero-denis-villeneuve-interview">Dennis Villeneuve</a>’s follow-up film that portrays the second half of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24075067/dune-star-wars-frank-herbert-george-lucas">Frank Herbert</a>’s seminal novel. Just like the motion picture, this <a href="https://www.polygon.com/board-games">board game</a> depicts the escalating desert war between the deposed House Atreides and usurping House Harkonnen. Both film and game share a second quality in common — they are spectacular pieces of media that could aptly be described as works of art.</p>

<p id="bIc12B">The duo responsible for <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em> are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22249192/tolkien-rpg-the-one-ring-second-edition-free-league-release-date-kickstarter">Marco Magi and Francesco Nepitello</a>. The bones of the game bear the shape of this team’s previous release, a board game titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Games-Multi-Colored-AGS-WOTR001-Players/dp/1903385113?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Games-Multi-Colored-AGS-WOTR001-Players/dp/1903385113?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23938020__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23938020__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>War of the Ring</em></a>, depicting the storied struggle at the heart of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It’s an epic experience that features clashing armies <em>and </em>the march to Mt. Doom <em>and</em> all of the most important characters in Tolkien’s novels. <em>War of the Ring</em>’s best aspect is the tactical dice system that controls the flow of play and composes the game loop. This is the main element carried ported over into <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em>.</p>
<p id="vUsPmS">Each turn both players roll a pool of dice. These custom six-siders have various action icons and the results determine what you will be able to do during the round. Play then consists of going back and forth from Atreides to Harkonnen, each player assigning a die and executing an action. </p>
<p id="e4YUu5">This is a simple system. You spend a die to recruit troops or move them. You can also play special cards from your hand to spring nasty surprises or launch massive attacks. The dice pool acts as a restriction, forcing players into tough spots where you can’t perfectly execute a plan. The tactical challenge is in how you utilize your options to warp the board to your will.</p>

<p id="acyUYN">Victory, likewise, is nuanced. The Atreides have the tougher assignment as they need to focus on a small assortment of goals dealt out from the Prescience deck each turn. These encourage various maneuvers built broadly on the novel’s narrative, such as Paul drinking the Water of Life or Atreides using their Fremen warriors to attack vulnerable harvesters. They focus play on momentary considerations, forcing adaptation and bending to the environment — two central themes running throughout Herbert’s novel. </p>
<p id="0ya1rT">There is also incentive to control the ecological stations scattered about the map. These form hotspots as the Harkonnen player will typically try to defend them. Finally, Atreides will edge closer to success by taking the Harkonnen strongholds, such as the North Pole and Arrakeen. These are always well defended and a significant challenge, but with tools such as the fierce sandworms and the elite Fedaykin troops, such an offensive is possible.</p>
<p id="ID6Isy">The Harkonnen player has it a bit easier. Instead of pursuing dynamic objectives that change each round, they simply need to destroy 10 points of Fremen bases. The value of each sietch is hidden, but this number can be scouted with ornithopters as well as some clever card play. This is the more blunt faction, relying on marshaling legions of troops to root out the indigenous Fremen and annihilate them. It highlights the alternative philosophies of each house and incorporates one of the novel’s many motifs.</p>

<p id="ffBFQL">Both combat and the incorporation of named leaders on the battlefield are reminiscent of <em>War of the Ring</em>. Violence is simple: Each unit adds a die that yields either a hit, shield, or special leader buffs. Shields cancel out hits with the remainder applied as casualties to the army. The special leader buffs are the most intriguing aspect. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23930166/lego-dune-set-buy-order">Baron Harkonnen</a>, for instance, will offer defense while The Beast Rabban supplies extra blows. The special troops — Fedaykin and Sardaukar — add further texture by soaking multiple hits and negating the opponent’s defense results. This, while simple and easy to internalize, proves a surprisingly strong offensive toolset that results in the potential for devastating results. Fights resolve quickly and logically, framing dramatic moments that punctuate play and support the larger narrative arc of the game.</p>
<p id="vb9M65">Besides conflict, the leaders are a significant aspect due to how they enhance player actions. Paul allows you to perform a special action that rallies multiple legions to him. Rabban can execute a potent double move which allows you to strike behind enemy lines and gain separation. Still other leaders influence card acquisition or deploy special units to the board. As the narrative evolves, new leaders come into play. The result is an unique story path each playthrough, with some sessions never even witnessing the Reverend Mother or the great Wild Maker.</p>

<p id="etH8DU">There is a lot of detail here. The asymmetry of the two forces is a large part of the appeal. The Atreides/Fremen forces can ride worms across the desert with impunity, while Harkonnen legions left in the open desert are worn down by storms each round. Collecting spice is integral to the Harkonnen keeping the rest of the empire content and maintaining their economic advantage. There is bluffing and secrecy through hidden units and vicious card play. Despite all of this detail and the large amount of content, the game wraps up in a surprising two hours. It’s shocking how this framework is exceedingly capable of furnishing a full story arc with depth and precision in the alloted time.</p>
<p id="1CrEm0">Many of its accomplishments are a result of the design team iterating on <em>War of the Ring</em>, now in its second edition. Tweaks to leaders represent a significant improvement over that game, as they are now decoupled from the bonus dice they grant in Middle-earth. Here on Arrakis, the action system is more satisfying, as Atreides possess less dice but are able to perform the clever wormsign action on their turn — effectively manipulating the environment — instead of simply passing and waiting for their opponent to spend their extra dice. The time commitment is much shorter, as <em>War of the Ring</em> requires a huge chunk of the day to setup and play. There are other small improvements found in battle, the card system, and general game flow. The outcome is an experience that sits at this splendid intersection of grand strategy wargame with a more personal and intimate composition.</p>
<p id="BhDQfB">Despite these plaudits, it’s important to understand this is primarily a two-player game. It can function as a four-player endeavor with each faction split in half between a pair of players, but this is far less satisfying in practice and undercuts some of the design’s strengths. If a group of four players is in search of something to play, they would be much better off looking elsewhere.</p>

<p id="nYh1Xf">Of more significance is an issue of faction balance. Michele Garbuggio, a developer that worked in support of the design team on this game, has <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3304026/article/44306943#44306943">stated</a> that “by precise design intent, [<em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em>] is not balanced on a 50/50 win ratio…it’s more like a 60/40…in favor of the Harkonnen.” The intentionality behind this reflects the power disparity between the forces and the miraculous rise of the Kwisatz Haderach to lead the scattered Fremen. This does not detract from the overall power of the design. The vast majority of participants will engage this game casually and not in a tournament format, and in this more relaxed environment it’s of little consequence.</p>
<p id="Tzrjtg">Regardless of these minor concerns, <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em> has burst from the sand with ferocity. This game offers an epic experience flush with drama and moments of grandeur. It successfully condenses and refines many of the concepts of its designer’s previous work, and it produces a special game that stands with its own identity. 2024 is only halfway complete, but it may have already received its best title. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-receive-8-new-suits/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Insomniac has just unveiled a brand new free content update for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 that brings new suits into the pictures. 8 new suits will be introduced, some of them are based on new designs whereas others are returning favourites from the previous instalments of the franchise. The update will be released on June 18, 2024, and with the suits, we can also expect the developers to add some stability improvements to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four new suits have arrived through a collaboration with American artist and fashion designer, Colm Dillane or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kidsuper/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KidSuper</a>. The first one is from the designer himself called the Metro Suit, which has a puffer design inspired by his collection along with an exclusive and original colourway. Now Spidey can be dripped out while saving the civilians of New York.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The second suit has been co-designed by Brazilian Footballer, Vini Jr. His suit is called the Ginga Suit and it showcases the footballer’s love for his country. The suit features the colours and accents from the Brazilian flag along with a sportier look for Miles Morales. With the Ginga Suit Spider-Man looks ready to win another Champions League trophy.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The third suit has been co-designed by British-Belgium motorsport racer, Lando Norris and his design is called the Fluro suit. The main inspiration behind his design “is the feeling of speed” and he also wished to give a touch of racing to the suit, which is why the mask looks like a helmet. All that remains is an F1 car to rule the streets of Manhattan&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The fourth suit has been co-designed by Japanese singer, actress and model Rina Sawayama. The Motorchic Suit adds a leather jacket and trousers to Spider-Man, with metal detailing. It brings out the inner motorbike rider in Spidey.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In terms of the returning favourites, the one that fans won’t miss is Peter Parker’s Spider-Man suit from Into the Spider-Verse movie. Next up we have Peter Parker’s Last Stand suit. In third, we receive a slightly animated version of the Miles Morales suit. Last but not least is The Uptown Pride suit from Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new suits will arrive with updated version 1.003.000 along with some stability fixes. Additionally, the developers have addressed some player feedback too and will now introduce the “ability to swap out your parry and traversal abilities from the Symbiote to Spider Arms, and vice versa”.&nbsp;Additionally, you can check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-great-web-trailer-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-the-great-web-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second</a> trailers for the cancelled multiplayer Spider-Man game, Spider-Man: The Great Web. </p>

<p>Summer Game Fest, E3, or whatever we’re calling it now, is finally over. Xbox had arguably one of the best showcases in the past decade, whereas Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest main show fell short of some of the more significant announcements we would have expected from such a show. The Ubisoft Forward showcase also felt underwhelming, especially considering the slate of games we know that Ubisoft has in development and is set to release in the next couple of years. So, what was up with that disappointing Ubisoft Forward showcase?</p>



<p>Two of Ubisoft’s biggest games to release later this year, Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, took up over half of the one-hour show, and apart from the two surprise announcements of Anno 117 and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 date for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, there wasn’t that much else to brag about. </p>



<p>The most notable misses of games that have already been announced were the Splinter Cell Remake, Project U, Beyond Good and Evil 2, the 20th-anniversary edition of the original, and even a showing of the Assassin’s Creed Infinity Hub, which is set to launch alongside Shadows. Division 3 has also been officially announced but will not enter production until later this year after appointed management is free after the release of Outlaws.</p>



<p>Other games expected to be released in the next two to three years include Assassin’s Creed Invictus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Hexe</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7</a>, a Far Cry extraction shooter, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-recon-project-over-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Ghost Recon game</a>, several new free-to-play games, and a new WW2 extraction shooter under the codename Crest that has an ambitious 10-year live service plan that will follow the events of World War 2. </p>



<p>If everything comes to fruition, it’s easy to see that Ubisoft does have a great pipeline of games in the works, but the reality of game development is incredibly complex. Speaking with several Ubisoft employees, the feeling is that Ubisoft executives no longer wants to commit to release dates or games publically until they are confident of their releases. Perhaps because of mishaps like Skull &amp; Bones, which saw over half a dozen public delays, or the more recent example with Star Wars Outlaws, which has seen a reduction in its scope to release on time. </p>



<p>Why these things continue to happen at Ubisoft is a bigger story for a later date (but I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest reading this article on low morale at the company</a>). Issues internally are not changing, but at least in the eyes of Ubisoft, a little more public caution over its games and release dates can go a long way. A trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2 has been ready for over a year, but without any confidence in a release date; do they want to see another game with more constant public delays? Probably not. At least, we should hear more about the Beyond Good and Evil 20th-anniversary game soon, but where and when is anyone’s guess.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview.898260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is off to an interesting start, to say the least. Coming off the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">somewhat controversial decision to change the name</a>, BioWare re-introduced the series to fans with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">two-minute trailer that drew unfavorable comparisons to Fortnite and Marvel</a>. BioWare quickly followed with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases-first-ever-gameplay-footage-ahead-of-tuesdays-reveal">twenty-second tease</a> that was met much more positively – yet another jolting turn in what has been a rollercoaster decade for the franchise since Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p><p>Over the weekend, I watched as BioWare finally took the wraps off Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the course of an hour-long presentation in which they showed off the character creator, a broad swath of the gameplay, and the battle system. Director Corinne Busche also took the time to answer some of my biggest questions around The Veilguard’s romantic options and exploration.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>First, the graphics. Running on the latest iteration of the Frostbite Engine, at least one source told me that The Veilguard targets 60fps. In a subsequent conversation, though, an EA representative said, “Dragon Age: The Veilguard will feature performance and quality modes on consoles to ensure players can choose the visual fidelity they prefer. We’ll have more to share on exact performance as we finish development in the coming months.”</p><p>Whatever the fidelity, it’s evident that The Veilguard is heavily stylized, and whether that look lands is mostly a matter of taste. It’s worth pointing out that Dragon Age has always been a riot of art styles and I’m not so sure that the series needs to return to the blood-spattered style of the original. What matters to me is polish and a cohesive sense of identity, and in that sense The Veilguard seems like a logical evolution of Inquisition, which itself was quite stylized. </p><p>Also, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguards-character-creator">The Veilguard actually has good hair this time around</a>, which, <em>finally</em>.</p><h2>In the shadow of Mass Effect 2</h2><p>For what it’s worth, there’s plenty of nods to longtime fans, including the return of Varric, who Busche calls the franchise’s “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” along with some “killer cameos.” It’s Varric who narrates the story’s opening section, recapping the events of previous games and explaining the motivations of Solas, aka the Dread Wolf. While The Veilguard is once again a standalone story, with Rook joining The Warden, Hawke, and the Inquisition in the ranks of Dragon Age protagonists, it starts in a breathless state of in media res as a group of heroes try to stop Solas before he tears apart the barrier between Thedas and the spirit world.</p><p>“We want to get you right in,” Busche explains. “Especially with an RPG where they can be quite lore-heavy, a lot of exposition at the front and remembering proper nouns, it can be very overwhelming.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>What follows is basically one long action setpiece as the main characters sprint through Minrathous, a city under attack by demons (this is another big moment for fans, who have been waiting for ages to see the capital of the Tevinter Imperium). While it’s unwise to draw too many conclusions from such a brief section of the game, it’s easy to wonder just how linear The Veilguard will end up being.</p><p>“Yeah, so it is a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated,” Busche says, echoing a talking point that comes up repeatedly throughout the presentation. “We believe that's how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience. However, along the way, these levels that we go to do open up, some of them have more exploration than others. Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game.”</p><p>Pressed for more details on sidequests and optional content, Busche says, “Some of them are [highly curated],  especially when it involves the motivations and the experiences of the companions. You're really along on this journey with them. Others, you're investigating a missing family… and the entirety of this bog is open up to you. You're searching for clues, finding a way to solve their disappearance. So really it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. But I do want to emphasize that hand-crafted and curated is our approach.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game</p></div><p>It reminds me nothing so much as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a>, with The Lighthouse – The Veilguard’s equivalent of Skyhold – standing in for the Normandy. I suppose it only makes sense in light of Dragon Age’s unique relationship with Mass Effect 2. Fans will recall that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">original Dragon Age: Origins</a> was basically a AAA CRPG – a continuation of BioWare’s isometric RPG legacy on PC. Mass Effect 2 followed just a couple months later, garnering praise among mainstream critics for its transition to full third-person shooter. Ever since, BioWare has prioritized action over gritty RPG mechanics, and the latest Dragon Age is no different.</p><p>But The Veilguard’s connection to Mass Effect 2 perhaps runs even deeper than that. Mass Effect 2’s story centered around Shepard recruiting companions from around the galaxy, Dirty Dozen-style, before ultimately embarking on a Suicide Mission where every character is at risk of dying – one of the most famous quests in gaming history.</p><p>Busche hints that something similar might be in The Veilguard. Asked whether The Veilguard will feature permadeath, she teases, “I don't want to get into spoilers but you just might [lose some characters]. Now in what we saw there, obviously no one died. In a situation like that they can get injured, they can influence how they think about you. If they're ready to hit the field with you, it does get more dangerous. We might lose some people along the way.”</p><h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of an action game than ever</h2><p>So with that in mind, let’s talk a bit about Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s battle system, which reduces the party size from four to three and in so doing becomes more action forward than ever. It features what Busche calls “sophisticated animation canceling and branching,” with the design centered around dodging, countering, and using risk-reward charge attacks designed to break enemy armor layers. Much of its strategy lives in its ability wheel, which stops the action either by tapping or holding the shoulder button and allows you to issue orders as you see fit. In particular, companions can be kitted out as support units and healers, which Busche cites as a big player request after Inquisition.</p><p>“The combat system is an interesting challenge going into the fourth iteration of this game because as you know, every Dragon Age has reinvented combat to some degree,” Busche explains. “Of course, pause and play strategy is always the backbone of it. But what that means is that, in addition to fans of all three prior games and welcoming in an entirely new generation of fans, we've got a pretty diverse player base to accommodate to.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p>While she offers comparatively few specifics, Busche hints at some of the deeper strategy behind the battle system. Weaknesses and resistances will apparently play a major role in the combat, with abilities being designed to exploit them accordingly. One character might be able to plant a weakening debuff on an enemy, and another enemy might be able to detonate them. Likewise, the bonds that Rook forges with companions like Neve, a detective, and Harding, who returns from Inquisition as a full partner, determine how party members grow and what abilities become available. Those bonds are in turn determined by the choices you make using BioWare’s famous dialogue wheel, which returns for The Veilguard.</p><p>I was heartened to see some of this depth make its way into the battle system, which has a fluidity to it thatl Dragon Age: Inquisition lacked. It further includes individual specializations for each class, including Duelist, Saboteur, and Veil Jumper for Rogue, as well as an overarching backstory based on the faction you choose. Players used to choosing a backstory and having it be totally irrelevant to the story will be happy to know that it impacts the dialogue more this time.</p><p>After all it’s the characters who will determine the success of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Larian ironically stole some of BioWare’s thunder with Baldur’s Gate 3, but this is still the studio that gave us Leliana, Liara, and Varric among many others, and it practically invented the RPG romance as we know it today. It’s been less than a week since the first official trailer and <a href="https://x.com/FidzyO/status/1799943346175263057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lucanis fanart is already manifesting on social media</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I've been a fan of all three for different reasons. But Origins is when I fell in love with the franchise</p></div><p>“Each of the companions that you journey with has really complex backstories, problems of their own, deep motivations. And these play out through some really well fleshed-out character arcs; missions that are unique to them, but ultimately tie into the larger story,” Busche says. “And along the way we'll make consequential decisions for each of them, sometimes affecting who they are, sometimes heart-wrenching – I've cried more than once – and sometimes pretty joyous.” </p><p>Many years ago, I stood in a room with Mike Laidlaw as he talked about the tremendous amount of work that David Gaider, Ben Gelinas, and other writers put into building Dragon Age’s world (Gaider, it should be mentioned, is very active on X/Twitter and is <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1799965308213743818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>definitely paying attention to The Veilguard</u></a>). That effort has earned the series an enduring fanbase despite being on hiatus for more than a decade. Busche, a self-described RPG fan who says she loved Baldur’s Gate 3, counts herself among them.</p><p>“I've been a fan of all three for different reasons. But Origins is when I fell in love with the franchise,” she says.</p><p>When The Veilguard arrives later this fall (it doesn’t yet have a firm release date), it will be more than a big moment for BioWare – it will be a huge moment for the fans. The Dragon Age fans I know, many of them women, are palpably excited to have this franchise back in their lives after waiting for so long. It’s too early to say whether or not Dragon Age: The Veilguard will live up to their expectations. All I know is that it’s good to finally be back in Thedas after all these years.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

Here's how.</h2></div><section><p>Yes, you <em>will</em> be able to carry over your decisions from previous Dragon Age games into The Veilguard — it'll just work a little differently this time.</p><p>In an interview with IGN, Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director Corinne Busche says the ability to import your choices is "fully integrated into the character creator this time around." What's more, Busche confirmed that you'll be able to customize your Inquisitor if you want to remake your protagonist from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>.</p><p>"What's not lost on us is that it's been 10 years since existing players have played. They might not remember [what they did in previous games]," Busche explains. "They might need that refresher and we don't want new players to feel like they're missing out on those decisions. So in the character creator, I like to call it<em> last time on Dragon Age</em>, but you can go into your past adventures and it, actually through tarot cards, tells you what the context was and what decision you want to make."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/dragonage-veilguard-4-blogroll-1718059907587.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Corrine Busch reveals how world state imports will work in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. </figcaption></figure></output><p>When pressed further about if all the previous characters would be woven into The Veilguard, like Hawke, Busch says, "I won't say everybody, but yes, some of them."</p><p>What it sounds like is that BioWare may be abandoning <a href="https://dragonagekeep.com/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Age Keep</a>, which would allow you to export your world state from previous Dragon Age games into Inquisition through your save files. When asked if The Veilguard would read saves from <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age Origins</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/08/dragon-age-ii-review">Dragon Age II</a>, or Dragon Age: Inquisition, Busche confirmed that it wouldn't. </p><p>"The technology is so different and we wanted it to be in the client," she says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"What's not lost on us is that it's been 10 years since existing players have played.</p></div><p>Indeed, Busche also confirms that The Veilguard players won't have to link to their accounts for this option, as you'll be able to play the game fully offline. And, yes, it's a single-player game and has no microtransactions.</p><p>It's only the latest in a trove of information we've gotten about Dragon Age: The Veilguard lately, in addition to its extended gameplay showcase today. BioWare recently showed off the seven companions <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">in its Xbox Showcase trailer</a>, and before that, it officially announced that it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">changing its name from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Previously, BioWare general manager <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">Gary McKay told IGN in an interview</a> that Dragon Age: The Veilguard will allow you to "romance the companions you want," sparking speculation that the fourth game in the series would be making a change to the way romances were handled in previous entries. </p><p>Now, in a new interview with The Veilguard game director Corinne Busche, we've confirmed that yes, you <em>will</em> be able to romance any companion you want, regardless of your character's gender or race. It's a bit of a surprise for fans, considering that in previous Dragon Age games (excluding Dragon Age II), the romanceable characters had different sexual orientations. Some were pansexual, sure, but others were heterosexual, others were only attracted to the same sex, and some could only be romanced if you were a certain race (Dragon Age: Inquisition's Solas, for example, could only be romanced by female elves).</p><p>But Busche pushes back on the idea that The Veilguard's companions are "playersexual," a term used to describe games where NPCs are specifically only attracted to the player character. She says she's seen playersexual "done in a number of games," and "it can be really off-putting where these characters are adapting to who you, the player, are."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"It's not until the later parts of the game where you really commit to romance and it gets pretty spicy.</p></div><p>Rather, Busche insists that they're all specifically pansexual, and that might come through in what you learn about their backstories.</p><p>"Their past experiences or partners, they'll reference them and indeed who they'll become romantic with," Busche tells IGN. "For instance, we saw Harding. I might be playing a straight male character flirting with her, but I choose not to pursue a romance. She might get together with Taash. So my perception, my identity has no bearing on their identities and that comes through really strongly."</p><p>When asked if that means it won't take long for romance to become an option in The Veilguard, Busche confirms that you'll be able to start flirting with everyone pretty early, as you recruit all seven companions throughout the first act. But, she clarifies, "it's not until the later parts of the game where you really commit to romance and it gets pretty spicy."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/11/harding-1718064550125.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Lace Harding, who appeared in Dragon Age: Inquisition, will be one of the romanceable companions in The Veilguard. </figcaption></figure></output><h2>Speaking of spicy...</h2><p>Of course, Dragon Age: The Veilguard <em>is</em> a BioWare game, and games from the studio — specifically those in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series — are known to have some fairly explicit sex scenes. Busche confirms that The Veilguard will be no different, particularly towards the end of the game: "Of course, we are an M-rated game," she says. "We do have nudity."</p><p>There's also some obvious parallels to be made between The Veilguard and last year's critical darling Baldur's Gate 3. The latter became known not only for its deep romances (like The Veilguard, Baldur's Gate 3 player characters can romance any companion regardless of gender or race), but also for its sex scenes, including one involving a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-lets-you-have-sex-with-a-druid-in-bear-form">Wild-Shaping Druid that went pretty viral</a>. </p><p>Busche isn't afraid to admit that she has played Baldur's Gate 3, and loved it, as she's an "an RPG fan through and through": "The more character-driven party-based RPGs with deep emotional connection, the better."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive.</p></div><p>"What I love about the two games is I think they live side by side in a really interesting way," she continues. "They're very different games, but those emotional connections and how the narratives hook you, I think there's space for both."</p><p>Specifically in regards to the sex scenes and how The Veilguard will handle theirs differently, Busche says some of Baldur's Gate 3's scenes were "shocking and comical in some ways, and I would say I loved that." </p><p>"Our companions, we want them to be relatable and fully realized. So they can get spicy, but in a way that I think people will actually relate to," she says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Basically:<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-lets-you-have-sex-with-a-druid-in-bear-form"> no bear sex</a>. Busche goes on to say that how sexually explicit the scenes are, too, will vary between characters. </p><p>"Some of them are more spicy than others," she reveals. "Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive, and some of them are more... we have a gentleman necromancer, for instance, that is more intimate and sensual."</p><p>Our interview with Busche comes as BioWare continues to roll out information about the highly anticipated Dragon Age sequel, with a cinematic trailer having <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">dropped at the Xbox Showcase</a> over the weekend. Dragon Age: The Veilguard will debut sometime this fall. </p><p>For more, check out our breakdown on how romance in <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/polygons-pixels-and-polyamory-oh-my-the-40-year-evolution-of-video-game-romances">video games has evolved over the past 40 years.</a> </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

Only the citizens or weaponry on the first liberated planet is likely to be saved, the Major Order reads. Both planets are currently held by the Automatons, Helldivers 2's terrifying robot enemy faction.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: Helldivers, a difficult decision lies ahead. Will you save the trapped survivors on Vernen Wells or the raw ingredients for the MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines on Marfark? <a href="https://t.co/U6wiK48YH2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U6wiK48YH2</a></p>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1800533719985311947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It’s a cool development from developer Arrowhead, whose Game Master Joel pulls the strings of Helldivers 2’s meta narrative from the shadows. And while this is all just a bit of fun, already the community is stressing over what to do.</p><p>“We can create more kids, we need the mines now,” reads a post from one player. “We're never getting those mines….” said another. Some are even suggesting Arrowhead is hiding some secret reward behind saving the children, although that doesn’t sound like a very Super Earth thing to do.</p><p>Given how hardcore Helldivers 2 players have struggled to shepherd the wider player base in a single direction for previous Major Orders, there’s a risk here that neither planet is liberated, which would be awful for everyone. Perhaps there’s time for both to be saved. It will be interesting to see which way the galactic wind blows on this one.</p><p>This Major Order comes ahead of this week’s new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-reveals-jungle-themed-premium-warbond-viper-commandos-heres-what-to-expect">jungle-themed premium warbond</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-next-big-patch-makes-over-100-changes-and-fixes-including-some-that-should-significantly-improve-the-game">hotly anticipated game-changing patch</a>, which makes over 100 fixes and improvements to Helldivers 2. Both should hit on Thursday, June 31.</p><p>This week is a big one for Helldivers 2 and Arrowhead, which recently revealed it was in the process of setting the studio up so it could “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, new CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and now current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>A Sony IP on a Nintendo device shows increasing platform holder efforts to reach new audiences</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The unveiling of Lego Horizon Adventures was not a surprise. As is often the case around major debuts, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-rumoured-lego-horizon-game-reportedly-coming-day-one-to-pc-ps5">hints and details had leaked out</a> in the days before.</p>
<p>What was surprising, however, was that not only is the game coming to PlayStation 5 and PC (as expected), but it is also coming to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Let's take a moment to process that: a PlayStation-owned IP on a Nintendo platform.</p>
<p>As far as I can Google, such a thing has not occurred in decades – not since, as <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> head Christopher Dring reminded me, Wipeout 64. Yes, Sony's MLB The Show is also available for Switch as well as Xbox, but that's a licensed title rather than a property PlayStation owns.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures may not have been the biggest blockbuster with which to open Summer Game Fest, but it's perhaps the most symbolic reveal we've seen throughout this year's array of showcases: seeing PlayStation IP coming to a Nintendo console is almost akin to Mario and Sonic appearing in the same game, both of which the '90s child in me sees as a sign of peace between the major players in the console war of that era.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there was a lot of discussion around Microsoft going multiplatform, with simple <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-reportedly-bringing-indiana-jones-and-starfield-to-ps5-and-switch">rumours that Starfield and Indiana Jones were coming to PS5</a> escalating into full-blown conspiracies that Xbox was going to stop making consoles (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-bringing-four-games-to-other-consoles#:~:text=Microsoft%20is%20still%20working%20on%20hardware%20for%20the%20future%2C%20saying%20the%20focus%20for%20the%20next%20generation%20is%20%22delivering%20the%20largest%20technical%20leap%20you%20will%20ever%20have%20seen%20in%20a%20hardware%20generation.%22">it isn't</a>).</p>
<p>It transpired that Microsoft was bringing just <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-bringing-four-games-to-other-consoles">four games to other consoles</a>, and they <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-announces-slate-of-four-titles-launching-on-non-xbox-systems">weren't exactly flagship titles</a>. Starfield and Indiana Jones are still bound for Xbox and PC only as far as we're aware (for now?), while some of the firm's upcoming titles, like the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-new-gears-of-war-and-doom-headline-xbox-showcase-2024">newly-announced Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, will also come to PS5. In fact, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/06/xbox-you-are-going-to-see-more-of-our-games-on-more-platforms">Pure Xbox</a> reports that, during an on-stage interview at IGN Live on Sunday, Microsoft gaming CEO Phil Spencer said: "You are going to see more of our games on more platforms."</p>
<p>The point is, as we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/does-it-make-sense-for-xbox-to-bring-its-games-to-playstation-microcast">discussed</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/will-xbox-publishing-on-rival-consoles-spark-a-revolution-opinion">at</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/multiplatform-microsoft-and-a-very-different-future-for-consoles-this-week-in-business">length</a> earlier this year, there are a myriad reasons why it makes sense for Microsoft to release select titles on other platforms: the need to reach more players, the limits of its own install base, growing its brand to grow its ecosystem. Much the same applies to PlayStation.</p>

<p>Sony has already <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/12-live-service-games-usd300m-pc-sales-aggressive-mobile-strategy-playstation-lays-out-its-plans">openly discussed</a> its plans to grow both its audience and its revenue with a string of PC ports for its blockbuster hits – including both Horizon titles – as well as upcoming but as-yet-unannounced mobile titles. After a few years of ports, PC is working out nicely for PlayStation with president and COO Hiroki Totoki telling investors earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-seeking-growth-by-bringing-more-first-party-games-to-other-platforms">Sony will be doubling down on this strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing your previously-exclusive titles to other platforms has many benefits: it reaches new audiences, raises awareness of your brands, gains you insight into what does and doesn't work with those communities.</p>
<p>Even for a market leader like Sony, growth is limited on their own platform. PS5 may be the most profitable PlayStation to date, but its sales have been tracking behind the PS4 – and a PC port reaches those who might be interested but lack the required hardware.</p>
<p>So, with Sony already reaching PC and mobile, targeting Nintendo with Lego Horizon Adventures makes perfect sense once the initial shock has worn off.</p>
<p>For starters, the Switch represents a sizeable audience at over 140 million units sold – more than 20 million more than the PlayStation 4, which still represents <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-5-now-represents-50-of-sonys-active-console-base">50% of Sony's active audience</a>, and more than double the PS5's current sales.</p>
<p>For another thing, it's a <em>different </em>audience (and arguably more so than PC). Nintendo has historically always attracted a family audience including a lot of younger players, often more successfully than Sony has. This likely explains why the debut of a PlayStation IP on Switch is a Lego spin-off, as opposed to a mainline entry. It's also more feasible to create something new that looks in keeping with other Switch titles than trying to port a PS5 powerhouse to Nintendo's more limited device.</p>
<p>And using Nintendo platforms to bring your IP to a broader, more family-focused audience isn't even a new thing. Microsoft expressly said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-hopes-ds-helps-viva-pi-ata-reach-broader-audience">this was the reason it was bringing Viva Pinata to DS</a> way back in 2008.</p>
<p>It's also fascinating that PlayStation has opted to take a new Nintendo-like direction with one of its mature franchises. While Horizon isn't as violent as, say, The Last of Us, it is heavy with its brooding protagonist and story of environmental apocalypse; this makes it an interesting choice given the more obvious fit for a Nintendo audience would be the likes of Astro Bot (which happens to have a new game out this September), Sackboy, Tearaway or perhaps Ratchet &amp; Clank.</p>
<p>PlayStation's targeting of Nintendo's audience speaks to a trend we've seen growing in recent years: all three platform holders are increasingly trying to reach different demographics by looking beyond their own ecosystems.</p>
<p>Xbox, which has always brought its games to PC, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-mobile-store-to-launch-this-summer">will reach mobile this summer</a> in addition to targeting PlayStation gamers (a similar audience to Xbox) with select titles. Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-mobile-strategy-is-about-reaching-new-audiences">still dabbles in mobile</a> to reach more casual players; for example, a recent Super Mario Run event was used to promote Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. And now, in addition to PC, PlayStation is prioritising the growth opportunities available via the Switch over its historic rivalry with Nintendo (granted, Nintendo removed itself from direct competition with other consoles with the Wii in 2006).</p>
<p>And it's not just about bringing games to other consoles. As former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden told us <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/where-will-you-be-playing-games-in-the-future-ign-live-2024">during our IGN Live panel</a> on Sunday, the total console userbase has been hovering around the 200 million to 250 million mark for multiple generations now, only briefly exceeding this during the Wii's heyday.</p>
<p>This means to grow your brand, to grow your audience, you need to look beyond not just your own consoles and those of your rivals, but into other forms of entertainment. Xbox has the Halo TV series, while its subsidiary Bethesda had a smash hit this year with the Fallout show on Amazon Prime. Nintendo has the biggest animated movie of the year in 2023 with Mario's cinematic outing. These grow brands and attract new audiences in ways no amount of video game spin-offs could manage.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lego Horizon Adventures on Switch demonstrates how the landscape has changed; there are now gates between the walled gardens</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Sony has been trying to broaden Horizon's reach for years. The Call of the Mountain spin-off was the headline launch title for PlayStation VR 2 last year, and there are already a range of transmedia products and merchandise available – from the Titan-published comics series and the special edition Lego sets (showing a pre-established relationship between Lego and Aloy) to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-tv-series-called-horizon-2074">animated Netflix series that's in the works</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the real of video games, it's unclear how much of a precedent this particular title will set. Lego Horizon Adventures coming to Switch doesn't necessarily mean the first two Horizon games are coming to Xbox – putting a family-friendly spin-off on a console with over 100 million players, many of whom have flocked to Lego games, makes more sense than porting Aloy's blockbuster adventures to a device with less than half the audience (and an audience that is likely less family-orientated). It's worth highlighting that even this Lego spin-off isn't coming to Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p>Nor does all this mean that Nintendo will follow suit by putting Mario spin-offs on PlayStation or Xbox. The 150 million or so players these two ecosystems represents holds less growth potential than making movies and mobile games that appeal to a far larger audience.</p>
<p>PlayStation and particularly Nintendo will continue to protect and prioritise their own platforms – after all, these are their primary sources of revenue. But Lego Horizon Adventures on Switch does at least demonstrate how the landscape has changed; there are now gates between the walled gardens.</p>
<p>It's also premature to declare the death of the exclusives. There is room for both multiformat games and console exclusives, and PlayStation's current strategy still centres around 'killer apps' to draw people to its ecosystem. But while its flagship games remain the biggest attractor to PlayStation – case in point: Astro Bot, a game that fully demonstrates the technical wizardry of the DualSense controllers – the brand extensions, like a Lego spin-off, can serve to introduce the IP to new audiences that companies would otherwise be incapable of reaching.</p>
<p>Will Lego Horizon Adventures drive Switch owners to buy a PS5 or a beefy PC, and pick up Aloy's full-scale adventures? Time will tell. But you can bet Sony will be watching the performance of this title closely. When we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jim-ryan-i-would-love-a-world-where-hundreds-of-millions-will-enjoy-our-games">spoke to former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in 2021</a>, he talked about how Sony was interested in finding ways to reach hundreds of millions of players with its games. Taking its brands beyond PlayStation consoles is essential to accomplishing this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/06/11/arcane-season-2-which-will-be-the-final-chapter-gets-a-new-teaser-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of <em>Arcane</em>, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEbfiLaOdJA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will be concluding, Christian Link stated during a LoL dev update released earlier today that it won't be the last animated story set in the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<em>Arcane</em> is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of <em>Arcane</em> wraps up with this second season. But <em>Arcane</em> is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”</p>

<p>You can watch the first teaser for <em>Arcane</em> Season 2 <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/01/05/arcane-season-2-gets-first-teaser-trailer">here</a>.

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">True to its promise from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-promises-massive-improvements-2024-key-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early this year</a>, <em>Forza Motorsport</em> developer Turn 10 has been hard at work improving the game with each subsequent update, delivering <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsports-car-progression-rework-is-now-out-and-its-a-huge-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some much-needed wins</a> in this respect. The new Update 9 continues this trend with endurance events, but with a huge asterisk in tow.</p> <p data-characters="642" data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true">As I myself have bemoaned time and again here at Destructoid, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-two-types-of-fomo-present-in-forza-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza</em> developers are huge fans of transient, temporary content</a>. The introduction of proper, full-blooded endurance races that take a fair bit of time to wrap up and force the player to consider their tire compound, fuel economy, and other such items has got to be a permanent addition though, right? Well, no, because <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-is-insistent-on-not-adding-permanent-new-career-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza Motorsport</em> absolutely insists that all of its post-launch content has <em>got</em> to be time-limited</a>. That’s right: endurance racing is just a timed event in <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, and it will be available for the duration of Update 9, from June 12 until July 24.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Endurance Month Trailer | Forza Motorsport" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TnrMF3CKNcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-enjoy-endurance-racing-in-forza-motorsport-s-update-9-for-about-a-month" data-injectable="false">Enjoy endurance racing in Forza Motorsport’s Update 9, for about a month</h2> <p data-characters="645" data-current-count="945" data-injectable="true">Endurance racing is not everyone’s cup of tea, that much should be a given, but the fact that these events are being relegated to a mere footnote on one of the pages of <em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s post-launch support is disappointing indeed. Had <em>Forza Motorsport</em> simply kept around even just one half of its monthly events instead of permanently removing them from the game with each new update, it would by now have one of the biggest, most varied career modes of all modern simcade racing titles. But, here we are, with Update 9’s admittedly impressive roster of endurance races coming out with a <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunsetting timer attached by default</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">The fact that endurance events are being done dirty in such a manner, then, does put a hefty dampener on Update 9’s flagship feature: the Sebring International Raceway track. This comes after Update 8 did not have a new race track attached to it, making the release of a legendary new raceway that much more important for the game’s long-term health and variety.</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Update 9 also introduces some minor tweaks to the Laguna Seca and Nürburgring Nordschleife tracks, improving their real-world accuracy, as well as the option to disable temporal anti-aliasing on PC. The VRAM use estimator, too, has been updated to be useful, as Turn 10 is actively looking into the shift timing problem that has persisted up until now on PC.</p>
 <p data-characters="604" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">There is one last thing that could either prove to be a big nothingburger or yet another point of contention for the community: <em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s Update 9 is the first piece of post-launch content to come with a purchasable DLC attached to it. Notably, the game’s Car Pass DLC is now done and dusted, but Turn 10 seemingly aims to continue releasing bonus vehicles as the game goes on. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2921330/Forza_Motorsport_Porsche_963_Combo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The new Porsche 963 Combo DLC</a>, for example, includes the titular racing car and a Porsche racing suit for the low, low price of $4,99. Granted, you <em>can</em> claim this DLC at absolutely no charge until June 19.</p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">Note that <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> has already nurtured a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-horizon-5-turns-into-forza-motorsport-new-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">steady cadence</a> of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-horizon-5s-retrowave-season-brings-us-minecraft-cosmetics-a-new-radio-station-and-hyundai-n-vision-74/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC-locked cars</a> on top of its timed content structure, which can get expensive if you’re out to collect all or most of them. Whereas <em>Horizon</em> usually nets you at least a handful of cars for $4,99, though, <em>Motorsport</em>‘s first outing of this type is far, far weaker in comparison. Interesting times ahead, for sure.</p>
