            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/07/hands-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds-now-were-racing-with-portals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There was a time where many would have pointed to Sonic being the best kart racer around. With a pair of games in the early 2010s, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/04/02/weview-sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed/">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a> had great circuits, a fun and eye-catching vehicle transformation system, and a huge roster drawn from more than just the Sonic universe. Those vehicle transformations are making a comeback in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and it’s easy to argue that Sonic’s erstwhile rival Mario actually cribbed from his homework, with Mario Kart now also having transforming vehicles and a quirkier line up of characters.</p>
<p>But where Mario’s just gone open world, Sonic’s now going inter-dimensional, or maybe intergalactic?</p>
<p><iframe title="Hands on Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds –&nbsp;Now we're racing with portals!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tILNuCTkEKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the big hook for CrossWorlds. The karting will feel pretty immediately familiar, slotting right into the genre staple elements and tropes, while the tracks will bounce back and forth between driving on roads, powering across water, and flying through the air, but everything changes after the first lap. At that point, the race leader is able to choose between two portals, deciding which CrossWorlds stage you’ll be teleported to for the second of the three laps. Through a four race championship, the final round will be one lap each of the first three race tracks, teleporting you between them instantly.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting idea, and the CrossWorlds are a potential wildcard that the leader can use to play to their own strengths, though when there’s 24 tracks and 15 CrossWorlds stages, they could quickly become the part of the game you know best, especially if players online start to gravitate towards a particular one or two.</p>


<p>This also puts another bit of pressure on for the light collectathon angle. Each track has got five red stars to collect, in amongst the long strings of rings, of course. It’s a bit like collecting letters or other pickups in a platformer, except that you’re also trying to win the race, and you really only have the first and third laps in order to grab them.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of other intriguing twists to the kart racing formula from Team Sonic. It starts at, well, at the start of the race, where the way you get a boost is much more like a sim racing game’s need to get the revs just right. That kind of approach can also be seen when drifting, where a drift bar fills up repeatedly to very clearly demonstrate how much of a boost you’ll get when you come out of it.</p>
<p>If those a shade of more realistic racers, then the air tricking is right out of the arcade extreme sports playbook. As you’re going through the air on a big jump, you can flick and flip your car around pulling over-the-top tricks to build up a boost… but make sure not to hit the ground again while tricking or all that effort will go to waste. This combined with the handling in general, not to mention that clear blue sky Sega aesthetic, really does make Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds feel like a classic arcade racer.</p>

<p>But you wouldn’t get something like the Gadget Plate at the arcades. You simply wouldn’t have time to make use of this degree of customisation before you run out of coins to feed the machine!</p>
<p>Dished out by the mustachio’d cat in a hover car, Dondon Pa, Gadget Plates let you equip a whole bunch of car-modifying Gadgets. A plate has got two rows of three slots which you can fill up how you see fit, with gadgets taking up a number of slots and then modifying everything from the vehicle speed and acceleration, to letting you carry three items, doubling boost, increasing the chances of particular item types, and making certain items more powerful.</p>
<p>If you expect to win on skill and speed, the vehicle mods would be the order of the day with a bump to defensive item odds, but someone that likes to race in the thick of it would get much more out of boosting attack item chances, a giant rocket punch mode, and a quicker recovery. You can set up multiple gadget loadouts and switch out the plates between races as well, which will let you switch up some of how you race.</p>

<p>There’s some neat ideas in Sonic Racing CrossWorlds that bring a real arcade feel to the genre in a way that maybe only Sonic could.</p>

                <p>Following the spectacular Death Star Sabotage season finale event, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is offline for maintenance ahead of the launch of Chapter 6 Season 3. The Emperor has been defeated, the Empire has been run off the Fortnite island yet again, and after five short weeks of Star Wars mayhem, it's time for Fortnite to move on to its summer season, which has only just slightly been officially revealed--more on that in a moment.</p><p>Star Wars season was an unorthodox one for Epic Games, which had never dropped a season quite like this one before--past mini seasons were throwbacks, rather than full-throated collaboration events, though last year's Remix season blurred that line. But now that it's over, Fortnite is going back to a more standard season for the summer. And we won't have long to wait for it to get started.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start time</h2><p>Every previous time that a Fortnite season ended with a live event on a Saturday, the game went offline until at least Sunday morning. But this time, it seems as though Season 3 will instead be launching <em>tonight</em>.</p><p>Players who completed the Death Star Sabotage event were greeted with a timer counting down to the start of the new season--but it said it would start in less than six hours. The timer is counting down to 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET on Saturday evening. That doesn't necessarily guarantee that it actually will be back online then, since maintenance downtime length can be unpredictable, but clearly that is what Epic Games is aiming for.</p><p>Given that, you can expect Fortnite to be back online <strong>sometime during the evening after 5 PM PT on Saturday.</strong></p><p>The timer screen also <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931415424442236993" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Superman will be headlining the new season, the first official confirmation of a recent leak. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">Read more about the new season right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-a-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025.1211277/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At SGF this year, TechRaptor got a chance to check out the upcoming SGF demo for <em>Frosthaven</em>, a digital adaptation of 2022's hit strategy game. This faithful recreation of the board game presents a 'no mess' version of an incredible (and difficult) board game with deep legacy mechanics as you not only explore the world and develop your characters, but build up the settlement of <em>Frosthaven </em>to offer more gameplay opportunities and build up defences.</p>

<p>Before getting my hands on the game, I was lucky enough to not only speak with Hristo Petkov, the game director for <em>Frosthaven</em>, as well as Isaac Childres, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f351387-1805-4afa-833a-e32039d2d562" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frosthaven-review" rel="nofollow">designer behind the <em>Frosthaven </em>board game</a>.</p>

<h2>Adapting <em>Frosthaven </em>From The Board To The Screen</h2>

<p>Knowing that <em>Gloomhaven</em>, the previous game in the 'Haven' series, had already been adapted into a Video Game, I asked what it was like adding on additional elements to suit <em>Frosthaven</em>.</p>

<p>In praise of Childres and the new mechanics that were created, he said, "Each character has a very individual playstyle and mechanics, so we needed to actually change quite a lot from Gloomhaven."</p>

<p>The largest addition that had to be created was the Outpost phase. This is the part of the game in between the combat missions where you can "create buildings, craft potions, and so on. You also need to defend it from attackers that approach the city."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-exploration.jpg?itok=DSb1iGft 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-exploration.jpg?itok=niup-9WX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a legacy game, <em>Frosthaven </em>iterates from session to session as you and your friends develop their characters and build out the town. I was excited to hear that even if you're playing a game with friends, if one friend isn't able to make it, the game adapts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Let's say you have a four-person party and one of the guys cannot come today. You can still play with or without their character for a couple of missions, and he can come back after. It's not a problem, just like the board gam,e it's very adaptable in terms of the number of players."</p>

<p>It was highlighted that even in a scenario where one player ends up at a lower level than the rest of the players, then the game will adjust to the average level of the party.</p>

<p>I turned to Childres to ask if he'd considered a digital edition of <em>Frosthaven </em>while developing it, and he commented that he had only been focusing on making the board game. "Once it was made Twin Sales, who was the original publisher, approached us and asked, 'Do you want to do this one digital too?' and I said, 'Sure, why not?'"</p>

<p>Talking about the collaboration, I wanted to get a better idea of what it looked like as development continued and how it made sure to stay true to Childres' vision. Childres explained, "we have monthly meetings where they show me all the new assets and I'm like 'Oh, it looks awesome!'" while knowing he was easy to be pleased Childres also expressed appreciation that he gets to be so involved in the process.</p>

<p>Petkov also echo'd that sentiment "the approval process is very good, there are some things that we need to change, obviously, but generally speaking most things are approved first time."</p>

<h2>From Imagination To Screen</h2>

<p>Petkov did let me in on the idea that "the most challenging things, and the things that we had the most to talk about were things that didn't exist."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-environments.jpg?itok=X7a6hnxM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-environments.jpg?itok=gdE4Nlia 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's easy to say or read that something is burning, but bringing it to life is something totally different.</figcaption></figure><p>He began to list off a variety of aspects of the game where there's a written description, but nothing visual. A Metallic Ruin to explore, a zombie blacksmith boss that just used a guard token, or a moving elevator that is represented on your dining room table.</p>

<p>In Board Games it's easy to substitute miniatures or describe an environment in text, but adapting that to a video game means you need to create assets for it all. Luckily for all of these places where there wasn't art the artists at Snapshot Games were excited to create these unique elements.</p>

<h2><em>Frosthaven </em>Steam Next Fest Demo</h2>

<p>From there I sat down with the Steam Next Fest Demo of the game, ready to get into the tutorial mission and explore <em>Frosthaven</em>.</p>

<p>Starting the game I was brought to a party creation screen, selecting Bonechiller and Drifter, I could quickly review cards and abilities and purchase starting equipment. Asking how players had reacted to the Closed Beta that was held earlier it was the look of Bonechiller and Drifter that had actually received quite a bit of feedback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-characters.jpg?itok=Xd9-c7td 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-characters.jpg?itok=QhmACOBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updated feedback to these characters makes them more terrifying (and less ewok-y)</figcaption></figure><p>For Bonechiller, players though she should have more/deeper scars to reflect her tortured gameplay style, taking damage to summon creatures to fight for her. On the other hand, the Drifter was thought to have a face "too much like an Ewok".</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Early Access Stats</strong><br>
When <em>Frosthaven </em>releases in Early Access there will be Six playable characters for you to play as and unlock. There will be 30 Scenarios from the Board Game made available, that means of the total 136 Scenarios approximately 22% of the game will be available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entering the first cutscene it was explained that the games events are fully voiced, this audio comes from the <em>Official Frosthaven Companion App</em>. By working together they were able to avoid reinventing the wheel and create a premium experience.</p>

<p>Loading into the first scenario Bonechiller and Drifter were placed on the board. Where the Board Game uses different dual sided hex tiles the world of <em>Frosthaven </em>has been more built out. In the snowy forest where I faced a group of Algox raiders the edges of the playable space were built up with rocks and foliage before drifting off into a haze. It didn't feel like the landscape stopped, but that it just wasn't in focus, leading to a better sense of immersion in the world.</p>

<h2>UI And Player Tooltips</h2>

<p>Speaking of the Beta feedback UI/UX was one that Petkov highlighted to me. "That's why we're doing the demo, that's why we are doing Early Access. It's so important because this game is really hard to do when it comes to UI. You want to shortcut things, then some people get mad because they want the agency, right?"</p>

<p>Character portraits appeared to the left, a list of combat participants to the top of the screen, and a list of selectable cards flew out in front of me. Each card I hovered over presented all of the information required in a quick and easy to digest format.</p>



<p>Petkov also showed me with a single key additional tool tips could be expended out related to just about anything your cursor is hovering over. If you want to know what the symbols are on a card, what any character has in their inventory, or even more information about an enemy fighter you can quickly gather it.</p>

<p>This is the kind of efficiency that I can imagine getting a lot of use out of at the start of the game, that would make me far more glad in the late game when I don't need any of that information and want less text and windows to progress.</p>

<p>That being said, while playing I did notice that there were a lot of 'confirmation' steps, that took place. You'd select two cards and then confirm, select where you want a character to move and have to confirm, pick the only enemy next to your character and have to confirm the attack.</p>

<p>At any point where it looked like my clicks weren't working around the screen my eyes began to learn to dart to the bottom of the screen to see if a red "Confirm" box had appeared.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-settlement-builder.jpg?itok=IvrGOpej 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-settlement-builder.jpg?itok=4z35xhhK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While I won't give the full play by play my Drifter and Bonechiller were able to swiftly dispatch the Algox in the first room and approach a door made of Ivy to open up the second room. Before reaching the (currently burning) gates of <em>Frosthaven </em>you could see a hint of it in the fog surrounding the map. A neat tease for something big you're about to open up a door into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Differences In Difficulty and Enemy AI</strong><br>
Alongside the standard <em>Frosthaven </em>gameplay, there is also a Story mode as well as a mode with increased difficulty. Based on feedback from the Open Beta they have made it that the enemy AI tends to move in a way that's better for the player, as that's how a lot of people play at home</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skipping through the rest of the battle I was introduced to the settlement building phase. Here there were a wide variety of options presented to me. Build and upgrade buildings, purchase new equipment or try to upgrade it with resources, and even potion creation where trial and error can lead to the discovery of new recipes.</p>

<p>This isometric view of <em>Frosthaven</em>, with plenty of empty plots of land, showed off just how far you'll be able to go when you get your hands on the game.</p>



<p><em>Frosthaven</em>, the board game, is an epic experience. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0f8e2e88-4e90-4808-88d3-e7f73952c19d" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/frosthaven-unboxing-is-lengthy-and-almost-perfect" rel="nofollow">A heavy box filled with all manner of characters, cards, boards, maps, and booklets</a>. If you're able to get the box, a consistent group of friends, and the time to play it's well worth the experience. It's also understandable that for many getting the stars to align in such a way can just be impossible.</p>

<p>With the <em>Frosthaven </em>video game a lot of the stress of time and setup is washed away, with voice acting and beautiful (and scary) environments this is already shaping up to be an incredible way to experience <em>Frosthaven </em>without a number of the barriers to entry.</p>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-970687"></span></p><p>“We’re incredibly proud to partner with <a title="Companies > Panpipe Studio" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/panpipe-studio">Panpipe Studio</a> to bring <em>Colorbound</em> to life,” said Whitethorn Games CEO Dr. Matthew White in a press release. “This game is a beautiful celebration of heritage, family, and approachable game design—exactly the kind of heartfelt, inclusive, and accessible games we’re passionate about supporting. We can’t wait for players to experience Anku’s journey.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Whitethorn Games:</p><blockquote><p>A heartfelt, colorful puzzle platformer, the game draws inspiration from the rich culture of the indigenous Aymara people of the Andes. <em>Colorbound</em> immerses players in a warm, minimalistic setting as they guide a young boy on his journey to reunite his beloved late grandfather’s band for one final concert.</p><p>In <em>Colorbound</em>, the power of color is the key to opening up the path forward. Young Anku’s grandfather was a beloved musician whose band brought immense joy to their people. After his passing, Anku sets off on a journey to seek out the scattered musicians, help them to find their neglected instruments, and reunite them for a final tribute performance in memory of a great man. Equipped with the ability to harness the power of color to shape the environment around him, Anku must collect and add colors to his palette and use them to change the way he interacts with the world, and find ways to open up new paths. Combining light platforming with environmental and logic puzzles, players will lead him through each setting—from dusty deserts to cities in ruin to flourishing forests—and help him reach his goal.</p><p>Winner of the Latin American Game Showcase Game Jam 2025, and created under the theme “What the Eyes Don’t See, the Heart Doesn’t Feel,” <em>Colorbound</em> was not only a favorite of the Game Jam attendees, but of the jury selection as well. Drawing upon Panpipe’s Chilean traditions and heritage, <em>Colorbound</em> blends traditional music and art in a celebration of the rich culture of Latin America.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Yet in the months that follow, Anna is haunted by visions of violence and death, compelling her to create disturbing drawings that rapidly manifest into horrifying reality.</p><p>Desperate to free her of this affliction, Caroline travels to the remote town of Villa Hess and a mysterious clinic nestled deep within the mountains of southern Chile. But behind the warm smiles of the facility’s serene staff lies a sickening truth, and the sisters soon find themselves at the center of an entirely new nightmare…</p><p><strong>So What’s Included in the Demo?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This first playable demo features roughly 60 minutes of gameplay, beginning with the sisters’ long journey to Villa Hess and their arrival at the convent-turned-clinic as recommended by Caroline’s long-standing friend and psychiatrist, Isabella. Greeted by the cheerful Sister Angelica, a member of the convent’s secretive sisterhood, the pair seem initially at ease. But during the night Caroline wakes to find Anna missing and following the sounds of her screaming, rushes headfirst into the horrifying scene of her sister’s abduction. Trapped in a stranglehold, Caroline begins to lose consciousness as the sisterhood’s matriarch, Mother Lucia reveals her plan to capture the Wildberger twins and continue the unthinkable work of their grandfather, Noah… </p><p>Coming around in the convent’s infirmary, Caroline must now navigate the claustrophobic passageways of the convent in search of her missing sister. But as she ventures deeper into the shadowy facility, she soon discovers that she is not alone and that an ancient evil calls from below…  </p><p><strong>An Insight Into Caroline’s New Look</strong></p><p>As many of our fans will know, <em><a title="Games > Tormented Souls [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tormented-souls">Tormented Souls</a></em> was initially conceived as a love letter to the iconic third-person survival horror titles of the 90s and early 00s. These games shared some fairly outlandish plots as well as memorable protagonists whose designs effortlessly combined B-movie horror aesthetics with the eye-catching fashion trends of the time. Looking back on Claire Redfield’s Queen-quoting biker jackets in <em><a title="Games > Resident Evil 2 (2019) [55 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/resident-evil-2-2019">Resident Evil 2</a></em> and <em>Code Veronica</em>, and Aya Brea’s none-more-nineties denim in <em>Parasite Eve II</em> got us thinking about our design for Caroline Walker in <em>Tormented Souls II</em>. Had we moved too far away from our influences? Would Caroline’s silhouette still be recognizable? What would Caroline think about her militaristic, combat-ready new look?</p><p>These questions led us to revisit her design once more, going over and picking out all the key details of her outfit from the original game, and seeking to “evolve” her look for the sequel. The most important point was that following the events of the first game, Caroline has grown up. She’s very much in BIG SISTER mode now, and so needs to look suitably mature. This is reflected in her color palette, with the blood red of her dress contrasting dramatically with the scuffed leather of her jacket, which conveniently helps to pick her out of the multitude of dark environments that she’ll be exploring throughout the game.</p><p>We also wanted to retain elements of her design so as to keep her silhouette relatively consistent between games. This meant bringing back the dress and jacket combo, as well as Caroline’s taste for floral patterns, bows, and leather. Some of you might remember the evolution of The Prince’s design from <em><a title="Games > Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2026) [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-2026">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a></em> to <em>Warrior Within</em>. Across games, he retained his flowing sash, chunky arm bracers, and loose-fitting trousers, but undeniably looks more bad-ass in the sequel.

            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a>? That was a bloody lovely game. I'm always partial to a game where photography is the core mechanic, there's such a specific joy in navigating a space attempting to capture a fracture of its essence. Photo modes just aren't the same, I want someone to textually give me a camera and send me on my way. A sequel was announced last year, quite simply called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem-2">Toem 2</a>, and during yesterday's Day of the Devs, some gameplay was shown off for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Essentially, it looks like more of the same (which I want to quickly make clear is a wonderful thing), albeit clearly with a few more years of artistic experience under the developers' belts. Environments are fully 3D now, rather than what (I'm guessing) were all 2D textures mapped onto 3D objects. You're still out on an adventure, taking pictures along the way to uncover a phenomenon that is being kept hush, hush for the time being.

<p>
The sequel will feature special NPCs called Friends (aww), all of which have their own unique questline. Once you've wrapped up a quest, they'll give you a camera tool like, uh, scissors! Which cut things! As scissors are want to do. Or you'll get a hammer, no prize for guessing what that does. None of these things sound particularly camera related, but they look like fun ways to interact with the world. You can jump around and climb things now too, lots of ways to have some fun outside of taking a picture of a cheeky gnome.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date for Toem 2 just yet, but it is slated for release sometime in 2026. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/">here</a>!

<hr>
<p>Despite how monumentally groundbreaking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> was on the Switch (and the Wii U, for that matter), there’s no denying that the game struggled ever-so-slightly under the weight of its ambitions. A quick trip into Korok Forest confirms as much, with the frame rate plummeting at frequent intervals.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was never enough to ruin what was one of the greatest games of all time. But in the lead up to the Switch 2’s announcement, there was definitely a part of me that wondered just what BOTW <em>could</em> be like on beefier hardware.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156628/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I need not fantasise anymore, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is here, and it's absolutely <em>glorious</em>. Offered up via either a paid upgrade or as part of a Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, this update boasts enhanced resolution of up to 4K (1080p in handheld), rock-solid 60fps frame rate throughout, faster load times, an extra save file, and... the rather terrible Zelda Notes mobile app.</p>
<p>Okay, let's start with the positives, of which there are many. Thanks to the boost in resolution and frame rate, the Switch 2 version of BOTW <em>is</em> the best way to play a modern classic. There's no going back, folks, this is it.</p>
<p>From the moment you exit the Shrine of Resurrection and gaze across the horizon, the improvements are immediately apparent. Mountains and trees in the distance are now significantly clearer with gorgeous detail, and swinging the camera around reveals just how unfathomably smooth the performance is.</p>
<p>I'm not kidding, there wasn't a moment for me when the frame rate faltered. Whether I lobbed a bomb into a Bokoblin camp littered with exploding barrels, pranced around Korok Forest, parried an attack from a Guardian, or whatever else the game could chuck at me, it all ran flawlessly. Nintendo did the best with the hardware it had back in 2017, but the Switch 2 Edition represents BOTW at its absolute finest.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156625/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, with the enhancements and the natural passage of time, some textures are starting to look a little long in the tooth - rocks big and small, mainly, but since the world is absolutely littered with the things, you'll notice it quite a bit. It's a minor quibble, of course, and the game largely still looks incredible thanks to the absurd scale and beautiful art design.</p>
<p>With such robust performance enhancements, you'd think load times might take a bit of a hit, but it's actually quite the opposite. Thanks to the Switch 2's extra power, loading screens are now much zippier than ever before. Granted, you're still looking at around five or six seconds when teleporting or entering a shrine, so it's hardly instantaneous, but it's a <em>lot</em> quicker.</p>
<p>So, from a technical standpoint, BOTW is much improved. This is the same game you know and love, but now better-looking and smoother than you ever thought possible. If you want to experience the enhancements from the start of the game without getting rid of your original progress, you can – the Switch 2 Edition introduces a second save file, which might sound somewhat inconsequential on paper, but it's a lifesaver for those who want a fresh start but are hesitant to overwrite their save.</p>

<p>Nintendo didn't stop there, though. Oh no. You've also got a bunch of extra content, too! The catch, however, is that it's not in the game itself, but rather via the Zelda Notes hub stored within the Nintendo Switch mobile app. And, to put it bluntly, it's naff.</p>
<p>To give credit where it's due, the ability to sync up your gameplay almost perfectly to the app is actually quite impressive. It knows exactly where you are in the environment, and this in turn allows you to use a couple of interesting features.</p>
<p>The first of these — and perhaps the most significant — is 'Voice Memories', which features voice work from Patricia Summerset as Princess Zelda to provide bits of history and anecdotes on a whole bunch of landmarks littered throughout Hyrule. Discovering these hinges on a beeping sound via the app that indicates how close you are to a Voice Memory, kind of like how the Sheikah Sensor works for Shrines. You can turn this off if it gets annoying (which it <em>does</em> – very quickly), but then you have to keep glancing at your phone to monitor a little yellow flashing symbol.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156631/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, the Voice Memories themselves, while perfectly harmless, aren't interesting or vital enough to warrant having to put up with the incessant beeping or looking at your phone all the time. I play games to switch off from the outside world, so having a constant reminder that my phone is there is borderline infuriating. Either put this stuff in the game itself, or don't bother.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Navigation feature lets you locate specific characters or structures in the world, like Koroks and Shrines. Chances are that if you've been playing BOTW since 2017 you've probably already found everything worth searching for. For everyone else, this is basically a way to achieve 100% completion. Like the Voice Memories, you can activate a voiceover to point you in the right direction, but having a repetitive voice that sounds like a sat nav in a traditional fantasy setting is horrendously jarring.</p>
<p>You've also got a Daily Bonus feature, acting as a roulette wheel to grant you various perks, like weapon repairs and meals. I've got nothing against this, as it's essentially like activating an amiibo without actually having to grab an amiibo. You can also view play data, tinker around with in-game photos, and even exchange items with other players.</p>

<p>If you find yourself using and enjoying Zelda Notes, then that's wonderful – more power to you. But I just couldn't get on with it at all. The very notion of using a smartphone to access bonus features completely yanked me out of what is otherwise an all-encompassing experience. Voice Memories, Navigation, and even the Daily Bonus features could have all been implemented in the game itself, and honestly, Zelda Notes' only saving grace is that it's not enabled automatically. Just leave it be.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is undoubtedly the best way to play one of the greatest games of all time. The visual and performance enhancements remove any issues that you may have had to endure with the original game. It's practically flawless from that perspective.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Zelda Notes app really brings the whole thing down. Useful features that should have been implemented in-game have been relegated to your smartphone, and using it completely breaks immersion in this incredible world. I'm only thankful that it's not even remotely mandatory. Leave Zelda Notes to one side, and you've got the definitive presentation of a modern classic.</p></section>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1626350/Pekoe/">Pekoe</a> developer Kitten Cup Studio and publisher Big Blue Sky Games debuted a new trailer for Kitten Cup Studio's upcoming cozy narrative-driven puzzle game, Capy Castaway, during today's Women-Led Games 2025 Summer Showcase event as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The story follows Capy, a capybara that gets separated from their parents after a flood rushes through the zoo where they live. When Capy comes to, a small crow, Corvi, finds them, and the two vow to help each other in their search for home.</p>
<p>"<em>Capy Castaway is inspired by our hometown of Toronto and the true story of Bonnie and Clyde - the runaway capybaras from Toronto's High Park Zoo in 2016,</em>" said chief executive officer and creative director at Kitten Cup Studio, Saffron Bolduc-Chong in a press release.</p>
<p>Not only is Capy Castaway set in Toronto, it also features some Toronto talent not already in the Kitten Cup Studio development team, with an original soundtrack composed by Toronto's Mark Sparling, who previously composed the music for 2019's beloved indie game, A Short Hike.</p>
<p>"<em>The game is heavily inspired by familiar places and things that bring us joy, and we wanted to capture a sort of intuitive playfulness. When we're playing through the game and think, 'Hey, wouldn't it be fun if we could just wear this yuzu on our heads?' and then we try it out. Suddenly, you have a mechanic where you can stack 10 yuzus on your head, and I love it. We can't wait for players to experience the heartfelt story of Capy Castaway, but also to enjoy the wonder and charm of being a silly little guy."</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Capy Castaway Character Trailer | Wholesome Direct 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dv1mi6TON0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Big Blue Sky Games president Tony Roma added "<em>We're thrilled to help bring Kitten Cup Studio's vision to life; Capy Castaway is a thoughtful, imaginative and full of heart - exactly the kind of experience we want to champion. The game's story of unlikely connection unfolds in a vibrant wold filled with peaceful gameplay, calming music and charmingly funny dialogue - one that players won't want to leave</em>."</p>

But it’s also a great place to find things to play now — and that’s especially true this year. The 2025 edition of the livestream showcase included a number of games that released during the show itself.</p><p>So if you like what you see, there’s no wait at all.</p><p>Finally, a game that combines designing your own house with going on a road trip. <em>Camper Van: Make it Home</em> is exactly what it sounds like. On the design side, you’re able to customize a tiny home camper and make it appropriately cozy, but the developers say it will also take you on “a journey of self-discovery.”</p><div><p id="fireside-feelings"><h2><em>Fireside Feelings</em></h2></p></div><p>This game seems designed entirely around comfort. You play as a cute little animal and spend your time curled up around a fire, chatting with friends, and guiding the conversation as you get pulled into a bigger story.</p><p>Puzzle game meets scrapbooking. Here the goal is to organize a huge cache of family photos, and as you do, discover their history and story. “Inspired by the way elders pass down family history using pictures to support their storytelling,” the developers explain, “this game blends narrative, puzzle, and creativity.”</p><p>This game is almost worth checking out for the pun title alone. In it, you create all kinds of weird omelets on a conveyor belt to deliver to students with seemingly very weird taste buds. Also, the principal is a rooster.</p><p>From the same team behind the similarly gothic <em>A Mortician’s Tale</em>, this game has players exploring a chill cemetery that changes based on the time of day and season. It even has sound effects recorded from an IRL cemetery. And not only is out today, it’s a completely free download.</p><p>For those who wish Picross also had lots of adorable little mice. In addition to all of the number-based puzzle solving, <em>Squeakross</em> also has some collecting elements, where you can gather decorations and stickers to up the cozy factor.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Inlusio Interactive</cite></p></div><p>This hand-drawn adventure game looks absolutely stunning, like an animated movie come to life, and it stars a little guy who can change shape to explore the natural world in various contexts. While the whole experience isn’t available yet, you can play the game’s first episode now.</p><p>This game may give you a craving for Boss Coffee, but it also looks pretty laid-back. It’s described as a “charming idle simulation game,” and the goal is to build an empire of vending machines, where you’ll have to manage staff and handle decorations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Back in March, ustwo games announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/monument-valley-3-is-coming-to-pc-and-consoles-this-summer/">Monument Valley 3 would be coming to PC and consoles this summer</a>. Now, the studio has confirmed the exact release date for Monument Valley’s release on PC, Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series XS is July 22nd. This follows the first two Monument Valley games releasing on the same consoles back on April 15th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monument Valley 3 | Launch Trailer |" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0BGVxbWmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/31/ustwo-games-confirms-monument-valley-3-is-now-in-development/">Monument Valley 3 was first announced</a>&nbsp;way back in 2019, so it did take five years to get to release. In this third game, players are Noor. Noor is on a mission to find a light source to push back the darkness that is enclosing her world. Like the previous games, players will have to manipulate the environment to find the solutions to the puzzles with each chapter adding a new spin to things. In a first for the series, Monument Valley 3 lets you set sail in open areas to further explore the world. Post launch, ustwo games has confirmed there will be new puzzles and chapters added to the game.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchases Monument Valley 3 will also be donating to charity, as ustwo games has stated the 3% of profits to support flood relief efforts. Before you buy, you will be able to play a demo on PC via Steam Next Fest, which takes place June 9th-16th. Further, a digital and vinyl release of Monument Valley 3’s soundtrack will be coming this summer.</p>

If we're being honest with ourselves, the original PSP was a sort of Proto-Switch too, no? As in it was home to a lot of odd, smaller-scope games that not many other platforms might have featured outside of Nintendo's earlier handhelds. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/patapon">Patapon</a> was one such tiny oddity, one of the most charming games on the platform, if not to ever outright exist. It did go on to get a couple of sequels, but the series (outside of an upcoming remaster of the first two) is sort of dead. Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratatan">Ratatan</a>, a spiritual successor from Patapon's creator is here to satisfy your tiny-guy-chanting-to-music needs with a newly revealed release date!
</p>

<p>
Featured during yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation, it was revealed that the rhythm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> action game (take a shot for every genre it mixes) will be coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/">Steam in early access</a> next month on July 25th. I'm quite excited by this one personally, those little chants in the original Patapon are burnt into my ear canals, I'm looking forward to getting something fresh in there that I can also repeat to myself ad infinitum. Yes that sounds like someone's personal hell, I just love a good chant.

Luckily, none of us actually have to wait to check it out either. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">demo</a> you can give a punt right now, something I'll be trying to fit in amongst the 1000 showcases taking place this week. The one thing I'm uncertain of is the roguelike element - outside of that it just looks like an incredibly lush and colourful, modern take on an old classic. Whether that roguelike quality will rob itself of tightly designed levels is something I'll have to find out for myself.
</p>
<p>
Ratatan also differs slightly in that you can freely move the little guys around, adding an extra tactical layer to it all. I will cry if even one of the Ratatans die, so, I'll be working hard to make the right choices.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-%E2%80%93-the-first-preview.1211199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of Dying Light is informed by the series’ melee-first design. Its impact can be seen in the damage system that causes its grotesque zombies to fall apart with every slash of your blade, as well as the weapon crafting, which turns household tools into hilariously impractical killing machines. And, of course, it influences the parkour movement, which allows you to keep well away from chewing teeth and clawing hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what happens when you add guns to this close-quarters formula? And I don’t mean one or two rusty pistols, but a whole armoury stocked with shotguns, assault rifles, and plentiful ammo. That’s a question the next game in the series, Dying Light: The Beast, poses. The answer is not the obvious one. Far from transforming into a regular first-person shooter, guns have turned Techland’s latest into something that feels closer to Crysis or even (if you squint a bit) Dishonored. They’re another layer of an increasingly varied toolset that ensures every encounter is a sandbox solved by your own rules.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For this month’s IGN First, I was able to play an hour-long mission from an early section of Dying Light: The Beast. This meant stepping into the combat boots of Kyle Crane, the returning protagonist of the original Dying Light. Held hostage and experimented on for 13 years by a shadowy figure known only as The Baron, I join Kyle a few hours into his quest for revenge. Deep within the new, much more rural zone of Castor Woods, I infiltrate one of The Baron’s factories. And, standing on the facility’s roof, I realise my options are more varied than the last time I played Dying Light. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dying Light: The Beast - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Using Kyle’s heightened “survivor” senses (a benefit of all those experiments he endured), I’m able to highlight the patrolling members of The Baron’s militia. Some are marked in orange, while others are red; an indication of who is armed with melee weapons or guns, respectively. It’s a colour-coded threat level that helps me set up a plan of action. Yes, it’s all very Batman: Arkham.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I start right in front of me with a blissfully unaware bowman. Approaching silently, I perform a melee takedown using a shiv I’ve crafted – much faster than choking him out – and then swipe the bow from his corpse. Bows were, of course, in Dying Light 2, but kept out of reach until the back half of the game. Their earlier introduction in The Beast promises a greater level of engagement options across the campaign, especially considering their ranged stealth potential. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notching an arrow, I headshot the bowman’s buddies, including a rifle-wielding sniper on the opposite roof. No one hears him slump to the floor, so I’m free to parkour across and add his gun to my collection. Once again, my engagement opportunities expand: no longer limited to firing single arrows and enduring long draw speeds, I can take out groups of charging melee enemies before they make it into striking range… although everyone around me will know exactly what’s going on. Might as well make a spectacle of it, then. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I dive down to the roof below, where a further two riflemen, a squad of brawlers, and – delightfully – a pile of explosive gas canisters await. The dive triggers a slow-motion effect. It’s hardly the slick bullet time of Max Payne and the old FEAR games, feeling more as if you’re suddenly travelling through sticky air rather than becoming John Wick, but it nonetheless successfully emphasises Kyle’s military background. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Taking more than a few pages from The Walking Dead’s book, you can now smear yourself in undead guts in order to mask your human scent.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With this expanded toolkit, Dying Light’s encounters have graduated into a space similar to Crysis and Far Cry’s sandboxes. Using Kyle’s survivor sense allows you to methodically remove enemies with guns from the playing field before going toe-to-toe with less dangerous foes. Flowing fluidly from stealth takedowns to silent headshots to shell-sputtering shoot-outs allowed me greater control over the space than I’ve come to expect from the typically messy melees of Dying Light 2. Combined with the parkour, which makes a respectable stand-in for teleportation, there’s even a little of Dishonored’s strategy to be found here, too – albeit less elegant in execution. My hope is that, beyond the boundaries of this demo, there are encounters that encourage a strong variety of approaches. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve reason to be hopeful. As I explore Castor Woods, I encounter a zombie wearing a battery pack that detonates on contact, sending arcing forks of electricity through the horde. Another wears an explosive canister on its back – just one good shot will turn him and his buddies into barbeque. Talking of seared flesh, I later acquire a flamethrower. It’s clear that there are plenty of toys to experiment with, and I hope that Techland is playful enough to use these elements to coax players into cleverly absurd solutions for clearing out the undead and deadly alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Techland has upped its game when it comes to stealth, too. The bow, shivs, and tools like throwing knives are naturally all very good at silently dispatching human opponents, but there’s now a method for quietly avoiding zombies, too. Taking more than a few pages from The Walking Dead’s book, you can now smear yourself in undead guts in order to mask your human scent, and then casually walk through the horde. It’s a simple stealth tool, but one that’s incredibly evocative of the fiction Dying Light revels in.     </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/06/dltb-02-1749214336850.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But Kyle isn’t special because he can use a gun or take a bath in a zombie’s insides. Those aforementioned experiments have turned him into the titular Beast. It’s a similar backstory to that of Aiden Caldwell, the protagonist of Dying Light 2, but where Aiden’s infection gave him some zombie-like superhuman abilities, Kyle has become something much closer to a leaping wrecking ball. Triggered at will after taking and dealing enough damage to fill a meter, Beast Mode allows you to tear regular enemies apart with gory animations akin to Doom’s Glory Kills. A thunderous ground pound violently throws foes to the seven winds – using it indoors is effectively a screen wipe attack, sending zombies splattering into the walls and ceiling. All this came in handy against the demo’s final boss, a towering “Chimera” zombie known as a Behemoth, which is capable of hurling engine blocks and concrete boulders across the arena. The Behemoth has a number of easily recognised attack patterns, but the challenge is in its resilience, as well as the number of minions that shamble after you. With Beast Mode engaged, I was able to easily clear those mobs and inflict big damage spikes against the boss. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as much as going toe-to-toe with another beast is good fun, I’m actually more interested in the utility aspects of Kyle’s mutations. Techland tells me that playtesters have used the Beast mode’s extended leap ability to bypass entire parkour challenges. And so it’s the unconventional uses of these abilities that promise to join the likes of guns and camouflaging yourself with guts in ensuring that The Beast feels like a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The scope of this demo was pretty limited – in fact, it was largely a playable version of the hands-off presentation I saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dying-light-the-beast-reveal-trailer-gamescom-2024">at gamescom last year</a>, and so there is almost certainly more to see in time. But being able to wander about this small slice of the world on my own time allowed me to enjoy some of the smaller details. The world feels like a substantial upgrade over Dying Light 2, not so much in level design (although much of what I liked about the old town section of Villedor returns) but in atmosphere. The new weather effects system is exceptional, with storms drenching the landscape with heavy rain and winds whipping trees, bushes, and long grass into a frenzy. And when the sun sets, the light really does die. It’s nearly impossible to see during the witching hour, forcing you to sparingly use your flashlight to navigate between the patrol paths of the much more difficult nighttime terrors. Long-time fans who pine for the scarier nights of the first game should hopefully be well catered for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I left <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-literally-brings-out-the-big-guns-for-a-shooting-heavy-spin-off-gamescom-2024">my appointment with Techland at gamescom last year</a>, I was somewhat skeptical as to how guns would affect the core ideas Dying Light is built on. Naturally, the studio wanted to show off its new toys, and that hands-off demo was played largely as a shooter. But having had the opportunity to play myself, in which I had the agency to choose when and where guns were deployed, I quickly learned that firearms are just one component of Dying Light: The Beast, not the main attraction. Their addition, alongside what feels like a strengthened inclusion of the bow and the series’ many trademark DIY melee solutions, made the demo’s encounters feel richer and more textured. Each combat scenario felt like a problem with a dozen solutions, rather than the melee mosh pits that I typically found myself in while playing Dying Light 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is how all this evolves over the wider game. There are several tools and weapons that I didn’t get extensive or any time at all with, such as the aforementioned flamethrower and oddities like a throwable shock knife, and so my hope is that The Beast constantly adds weapons with unique utilities to the toolkit. And then, of course, there’s your mutations; each Chimera you kill allows you to inject more freaky DNA into your veins and unlock a skill tree of powers. I can only hope that the further down those branches you go, the more wild your ability set becomes. And provided the campaign continues to offer up interesting challenges that encourage the use of both abilities and tools, then I think The Beast could be a much more interesting sequel than it initially appears to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s greatest strengths is its scalability. You can run it on the highest of high-end PCs or a years-old phone, and it's going to be playable either way. Players across all platforms can join parties and play battle royale, Creative, Fortnite Festival, or almost anything else the game has to offer--sans Saves The World mode--and each player will get a performance and visual experience tailored to their platform. Among many other reasons it's found such lasting success, this is key. You're not locked out based on where you're playing.</p><p dir="ltr">For my tastes, I still want that high-end experience, so I play Fortnite on my PC or my Xbox Series X most of the time. Switch 2 players have now joined the fray as the latest platform to host Epic's everything-game, and though it's a downgrade for those like me, for Switch 2 players, it's a sizable step forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Fortnite on Switch 2 was nearly my first time playing anything on Nintendo's new hybrid console--save for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/">Madden 26 a few days ago</a>. Like that experience, I found Fortnite can't keep up with Xbox Series X|S or PS5. Textures are noticeably fuzzier; the pop-in of far-away objects, like trees as you glide down to the island, is quite common; and character models lack the same fidelity of the other major consoles. At first, this irritated me. A new console should move the needle, I felt. Why have I been frantically chasing down a Switch 2 for sale if it can't even offer me an experience the likes of which I've been playing for half a decade elsewhere?</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo, of course, is the reason. The Switch 2, like the original Switch, isn't trying to achieve performance parity with those other consoles. The Switch's debut was essentially Nintendo making it clearer than ever that it wasn't interested in the graphical arms race with Sony and Microsoft, and I can't really blame it given the success of its machine. The Switch 2 definitely moves the needle closer to those consoles, but certainly falls short.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508461" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508461"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 doesn't put Fortnite on par with other consoles, but neither does it have to.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, two things began to change my mind as I played more Fortnite on Switch 2. For one, handheld mode hides some of those aforementioned blemishes. Texture fidelity is hardly noticeable when I'm playing the game in my hands. The same goes for the character models. My assortment of skins--so many I hope I'm never able to calculate the true cost--look totally acceptable in Switch 2's handheld mode. And whether I was playing on a monitor or in my hands, the game offers a smooth 60fps frame rate.</p><p dir="ltr">I've often felt like I can't easily tell the difference between 4K and 1080p. If I intently look for it, I'll spot it, but in typical play sessions, it's the 60 frames I really demand because that's what I notice effortlessly. This is where Fortnite on Switch 2 really succeeds. The game looked terrible on Switch, to be blunt about it. That's no longer the case. On Switch 2, the frame rate boost carries it a long way forward, and eventually helped me forgive some of its other shortcomings compared to my preferred platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">I said there were two things that changed my mind about Switch 2's Fortnite. The other is Lego Odyssey. The survival-crafting game that debuted in Fortnite's massive 2023 update looks awesome on the Switch 2, and it occurred to me how important that will be on the kid-friendliest console out there. Once I played Lego Odyssey on Switch 2, I felt my frustration evaporating quickly. I pictured my kids playing this mode next to me on the couch while I joined them on my Xbox, and I'm sure that use case will be a popular one for families that game together.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite has been reinventing itself for years now. With experiences like Unreal Editor for Fortnite overhauling Creative mode, music integration in the form of Fortnite Festival and a new mode that lets players have a dance party with Sabrina Carpenter, and the abundance of Fall Guys and Lego games to play, Fortnite hasn't truly been a battle royale game in a long time. That remains its most-popular mode today, but the sum total of the game's other virtually limitless games to play make up a great deal of what younger players are playing when they boot up the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Switch 2 isn't going to be where I play Fortnite battle royale, but it will surely become the go-to platform for my kids when they want to play Lego games, music games, or anything Creative has to offer. And in any case, it's going to look much nicer than the potato version that ran on the original Switch. I expect players who are siloed in Nintendo's ecosystem will be very impressed with Fortnite on Switch 2, even as I and others recognize it's still a technical half-step toward levels of detail we've been enjoying since 2020.</p>

            <p>Summer Game Fest's 2025 showcase is over for another year. Packed end-to-end with a whole slew of announcements and teasers, it even included a shadow-dropped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> DLC, Overture.</p>
<p>If you missed part of it, all of it, or simply don't want to scrub through 120 minutes to see if the announcement you were hoping for popped up, here's every single thing announced at Summer Game Fest 2025 in the order they were revealed. Pray for my tendonitis. Enjoy!</p>
<h3> Mortal Shell 2</h3>
<p>The show kicked off by noting how many of Steam's biggest sellers this year have been from indie developers, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-shell-2-revealed-at-summer-game-fest-coming-to-ps5-xbox-and-steam-in-2026">threw us into the evening's first announcement: Mortal Shell 2</a>. The dark fantasy action game, developed by Cold Symmetry, is coming to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.</p>

<h3>Death Stranding 2</h3>
<p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Death Stranding 2 was getting its own premiere</a> separate from the main Summer Game Fest stage - that's coming tomorrow, 8th June - but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> accompanied Geoff on stage anyways, treating us to a "special exclusive clip for SGF", which you can check out below. The teaser lets us spend a little time with Neil and Lucy, after which Kojima reminded us that the sequel is set to release later this month on 24th June, 2025.</p>

<h3>Chronicles: Medieval</h3>
<p>"Thou shalt not kill, so the priests tell us, so the lord commands," says some gruff, disembodied voice as we zoom in on a blacksmith blacksmithing. Apparently, ambitious men do not listen, though, which is why Chronicles: Medieval invites you to forge your destiny in a host of epic historical battles when it drops in early access in 2026.</p>

<h3>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds x Minecraft World</h3>
<p>After introducing us to the latest Sonic racing game, Sonic creator officer, Takashi Iizuka took us into a CrossWorld promotion with Minecraft, where familiar Minecraft folk zoom around the place in little rectangular carts. It's quite the spectacle. There's no release date yet, just the promise that it'll be "drifting across dimensions soon".</p>

<h3>Mouse P.I. for Hire</h3>
<p>Join private investigator Jack Pepper on a guns blazing, jazz-fueled adventure in Mouse: P.I. For Hire. The inaugral title from Fumi Games, Mouse P.I. stars Troy Baker and combines "the charm of hand-drawn rubber hose animation inspired by the classic cartoons of the 1930s with the adrenaline and action of an explosive first person shooter". It's out later this year on PC via Steam, Switch, and current- and last-gen consoles.</p>

Set in the Atomic universe, a giant, levitating Cube with rotating rows and edges appears one day, and hidden within is an unknown equation capable of altering the laws of reality.

<h3>Wu-Tang Rise of the Receiver</h3>
<p>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver is a co-op action RPG with anime-style fighting where players will face increasingly challenging battle Chambers to "the tune of reimagined Wu-Tang Clan tracks while decking out their own custom fighters". Say it with me - there's no firm release date - but it looks to be coming to PC via Steam and EGS.

<h3>Into the Unwell</h3>
<p>Dive into The Unwell as one of "several flawed and heavily medicated misfits in this delightfully despondent third-person roguelite game" that also homages 30s-style cartoons. We didn't get much more than that other than the you can play alone or with up to two friends, and a closed beta is coming to Steam soon, so sign up now if you're keen.

<h3>Splitgate 2</h3>
<p>Splitgate 2 - often referred to as "halo with portals" - is in the pink in the sequel, showing that even with a light, bright pastel palette, you can still get your arse kicked. It released at the end of May, so this is just a reminder that the follow-up free-to-play shooter is finally here.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aether-iron-sets-up-beautiful-world-for-gritty-noir-story<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine a 1930s New York where technology had been created to float parts of the city into the sky, flying cars were common, and everyone spoke with enough pulp to put Humphrey Bogart to shame. This is the world of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, a new detective game, by Seismic Squirrel.</p>

<p>At SGF we had a chance to sit down with Tyler Whitney, Narrative Lead, and Joshua Enz, Producer, to talk about what inspired the game, what experience players can look forward to, and even got some time hands on to explore a picturesque bar in the clouds, take on a mysterious man in car on car combat, and explore our home base.</p>

<h2>What A World To Live In</h2>

<p>In <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, players take on the role of Gia, a down-on-her-luck detective who has had one too many jobs go sideways. Returning to her employer, Mr Black, she's handed the job of escorting Nellie to the Lowers.</p>

<p>This job quickly escalates as both Gia and Nellie are thrown into danger and important and mysterious documents that Nellie was holding close are stolen.</p>



<p>The game is broken up into two gameplay styles, the first is exploration. As Gia you'll be able to interact with scenes and locations, having conversations with those you come across, or perhaps find an item or two to pick up for use later.</p>

<p>My first experience of exploration was in a bar with a glass floor, the view extending down to nothing but clouds below, the interior decked out as you'd expect a speakeasy of the time, but with a 'Neo-Decopunk' aesthetic.</p>

<p>When asked about what led to the idea of merging the past, of 1930s New York with a futuristic concept like that of Aether, the simple response from Whitney was that "we know that we want to have something beautiful, but was different." Whitney also offered up his love of movies like 2004's Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow, though he jokingly accepted that he might be in the minority for that.</p>

<p>Seeing the gleaming skyline of the city it reminded me of the Metropolis of Superman's Silver Age. Beautiful skyscrapers that tell you that this is a safe and glorious place to live, that's ignoring the other locations in this game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-iron-interior.jpg?itok=DHq_o0fO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-iron-interior.jpg?itok=iPyhMbLv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After picking up a bottle of booze and prodding the passed-out drunk, I approached the bar to open dialogue with the barkeep, a fellow employee of Mr Black.</p>

<h2>Explore And Interact With The World of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em></h2>

<p>Dialogue in<em> Aether &amp; Iron</em> is fully voiced, letting you really get sucked into the noir dialogue filled with flowery phrasing and an internal monologue that exposits without feeling like it's spoonfeeding information to the player.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additional Voice &amp; Text Options On The Way<br>
It was explained to me that after <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> launches at the end of the year they will be adding Spanish and Chinese text localization, as well as working to add Spanish and Japanese Voices</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whitney attributed the passion for this genre with characters like Phillip Marlowe. He spoke about how he was given reign to write and that he then made it "flowery as hell." He wanted to write in a way that would make you feel, he laughed referencing the line "walking a knifed edge with bare feet" and how even now the thought of that made his toes curl in response.</p>

<p>At various points in conversation you'll be prompted with choices, these might be of no consequence merely moving the conversation forward, could only be possible if you have a certain item, or could be settled with a speech check.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-iron-taxi-rank.jpg?itok=-OlNwGYd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-iron-taxi-rank.jpg?itok=7agGhhh2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An element of the speech checks that I loved were the inclusion of dice rolls. Each would prompt you to roll two dice, add your relevant stats, and any companion bonuses to try to meet the difficulty level of the check. You might be trying to fool someone, get some additional information out of them, or press your luck with an intimidating statement.</p>

<h2>The Choices… And Consequences Of Dialogue</h2>

<p>While I cleared most of the speech checks during my time playing, earning additional experience and earning additional money for Gia, there was one extremely difficult check that I failed. This didn't lead to any immediate negative repercussions but instead a funny moment where Nellie made fun of Gia and her very obvious attempt at lying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It might not have earned me experience as a character, but as a player, it showed a side to this new character I hadn't seen yet and endeared me further to her.</p>

<p>I asked about what kinds of negative repercussions there could be, and if you failed enough, if there were "fail states" where you'd have to revert to a save. The answer I got was quite surprising as there could definitely be scenarios where you keep talking back and end up getting shot because of it.</p>

<p>Each of these fail states are presented with the idea of a retro newspaper spinning up towards the screen. When one happens it's something monumental enough that it would make the front page, Whitney explained that internally they "view them as hidden collectibles."</p>

<p>The choices that you make during the story of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> each have varying weights and some can even lead to exclusive branched narrative paths.</p>

<p><em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> is expected to take about 20 hours for an initial playthrough, and Whitney mused that if you knew exactly what you were doing it would take about three playthroughs to see everything, but I'm guessing if you're going in blind it might take a lot longer.</p>

<p>Due to the way you not only interact with the world, but also pick up and develop relationships with different characters and factions of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> there are currently ~16 different endings. These aren't all wholly unique but much like a game like Fallout has endings for individual character stories, faction plots, and the overall game each of the permutations can lend to one another.</p>

<p>Outside of exploration and interrogation when making your way across the city there are events that can prompt such as road combat.</p>

<p>Here the combat is turnbased, functioning on a grid where every turn you have a certain number of actions you can perform. You can ram your car or unleash a shotgun blast, or simply shift from lane to lane.</p>

<p>A neat element of movement is that while shifting lanes left and right you'll use up a point of stamina, but going up and down (accelerating and decelerating) you have complete freedom.</p>

<p>Other dynamic elements of this combat were other drivers on the road, that you could use to get inbetween yourself and whoever you're facing, and also lanes that appear and disappear during combat. Just like real life you may be asked to merge or shift lane so as to stay on the road, be sure to pay attention!</p>

<h2>Rooted In History</h2>

<p>An interesting aspect of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> for history buffs is that there are certain characters and elements that are rooted in the real life history of New York. An example given was that of the White Wings, the group of uniformed cleaners for New York established in 1895 by Colonel George E. Waring Jr.</p>

<p>Each of the segments of New York that have taken to the skies in <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> function like company towns, with an organization at the head, and one of these factions is a militaristic group of cleaners.</p>

<p>It's by creating the world first, and then creating a story that inhabits it that the team hopes to create "a world that others feel so immersed in that when they walk away they continue to play in their heads."</p>

We wanted to create something different, a space where players can exhale. A space that values listening, empathizing, and slow, intentional conversations. With <em>Fireside Feelings</em>, we hope to inspire joy, catharsis, and connection through something as simple—and human—as sharing words beneath the stars.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via The CoLab:</p><blockquote><p>Following a philosophy that “we all need a good talk under the stars,” <em>Fireside Feelings</em> sees players sharing heartfelt and empathetic thoughts about diverse—and sometimes challenging—topics.</p><p>Players choose and customize their avatar from one of six different animals, including a besuited bear, a barista bee and a skater fox. Once selected, players begin their journey across meditative locales, including a beach, woodland and a record store.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>There they’ll meet Spark, a sentient campfire guiding them through a series of questions inspiring thoughtful and empathetic answers under the stars. Sat on the other side of the fire is a second animal, sharing another player’s previous answers to the same questions and forming a contemplative, yet asymmetrical, conversation on the chosen topic.</p><p>To provide a highly robust level of player safety, <em>Fireside Feelings</em> anonymizes answers and the player’s in-game character name. Responses given by the other player across the campfire are not live, but chosen from a moderated database of conversations.</p><p>Furthermore, sensitive topics that might be discussed and might be triggering for players—including violence, self-harm, mental illness and more—can be avoided by removing them from the discussion at the start of the game or via the main menu.</p><p>Team Empreintes and The CoLab have worked with Safe In Our World, the games industry’s mental health charity, to integrate a link to the Safe In Our World website from within the experience, where players can access resources and support.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Fireside Feelings Launch Trailer - Wholesome Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y3j3JRzardU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
