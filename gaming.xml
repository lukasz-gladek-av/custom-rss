                <p>Since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, many Nintendo fans have wondered when the first Nintendo Direct of the post-launch era would drop. Nintendo has decided not to monkey around for too long on the subject, as it has announced the next Direct will be this week--and it will be focused on Donkey Kong’s upcoming adventure Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>The Donkey Kong Bananza Direct will air Wednesday, June 18 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET on the official Nintendo YouTube and Twitch channels. It will feature "roughly 15 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game," according to the official announcement on the Nintendo Today app.</p>

		<p>Triumph and Paradox have revealed the next DLC for Age of Wonders 4. The fourth instalment in Expansion Pass 2, Archon Prophecy expansion is set to launch on 12th August for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Archon Prophecy Expansion Release Date Announcement | Age of Wonders 4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtIcPa9D_8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Archon Prophecy will add a new culture, the Architects, allowing players to construct huge magical monuments within cities. There’s also new Forms, a new narrative path to follow, two new story realms, and more.</p>
<p>The Archon Prophecy expansion will arrive alongside a free update, dubbed the Griffon Update. This will have new features that include the Extra Faction data, the new Form trait Flaws, and&nbsp;Hero Class Updates.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown of Archon Prophecy from Triumph:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>New Culture: </b>Build your empire with the help of the <b><i>Architects</i></b> – construct vast, magical <b><i>monuments</i></b> within your cities and dedicate them to the affinity of your choice to empower your economy and unlock powerful bonuses. Shape your domain and carve your ideology into the world.</li>
<li><b>Two New Forms</b>:<span>&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><b>Elysian<i> </i></b>– ascended, heavenly beings that bring a touch of the divine to your realm.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Ancient </b>– withered and bent beings from the depths of history – and other, more sinister places.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Narrative Content: </b>Forge your destiny with <b><i>Prophecy Traits </i></b>— new society traits that help you shape your empire. Early in your journey a vision will appear, challenging you to define your ruler’s purpose and ambitions. How you interpret it is up to you, but fulfilling the Prophecy will unlock powerful rewards.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Two New Story Realms: <span>&nbsp;</span></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Rings of Emnora</b> – Enter the hidden realm of Emnora, stronghold of the Archons, in a search for aid in the eternal war against Urrath.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Cliffs of Sordünn</b> – Land on the Coast of Sordünn and explore an ancient land that fell into the endless horrors of the Umbral Abyss. Reclaim the realm from Urrath’s clutches and fulfill a Prophecy that will shape the war between light and darkness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Four New Tomes:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Tome of Virtue</b>: Empower your armies with unwavering righteousness and bolster their fighting strength until the bitter end.</li>
<li><b>Tome of Prophecies</b>: Weave fate into every moment with prophetic spells and omens that shape the battlefield.</li>
<li><b>Tome of the Revenant</b>: Channel the power of the dead, and take vengeance against the living.</li>
<li><b>Tome of the Archon</b>: Summon celestial allies and ascend your units to the ranks of Archons.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Hero Class: </b>Answer the call of the divine with the power of the <b><i>Battlesaint</i></b>. Whether guiding the faithful as a sacred support unit or standing firm as a martyr-like tank, the Battlesaint turns virtue into strength and sacrifice into victory.</li>
<li><b>And</b> <b>So Much More</b>, including seven new wildlife units roaming the wilds, two new mounts, five new music tracks from composer Michiel van den Bos, several map updates, new interface skin and many other smaller things!</li>
</ul>
<p>Age of Wonders 4 came out in May 2023 and, while we unfortunately weren’t able to review the game at that time, it had a broadly positive reception. It saw the series return to the fantasy setting of the earlier games, after the sci-fi divergence of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/05/age-of-wonders-planetfall-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Age of Wonders: Planetfall</a>, and brought some fun new ways to mix and match your wildly customisable empires and races.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/exoborne-is-a-tactical-open-world-extraction-shooter-in-development-at-sharkmob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exoborne</a> has been one of those battle royales with a unique traversal hook that I’ve been curious about but never had the chance to go hands-on with until Summer Game Fest 2025’s Play Days. The concept of fighting off not just other players but the weather seemed like a concept that would keep fights feeling dynamic between sessions.</p>
<p>Sharkmob and Level Infinite let us jump into a quick three-player match after a brief bit of onboarding and watching a mission cutscene from one of their key NPC handlers. After that, we were permitted to look at and pick just one of the three Exo-rig’s they wanted to show off. My two teammates went with the more nimble Viper while I opted for the heavier Kodiak. Despite all of my ziplining around and attacking from above, I didn’t get to try out most of his kit and instead just stuck with sniping and machine-gunning as they were more than effective against the majority of AI grunts we encountered (there were other players in our match, but we extracted once we bumped into them without much of a drawn out firefight).</p>
<p>Exoborne's gunplay is fairly standard stuff, with various weapons having enough impact to feel like you're not just shooting Nerf pellets at the enemy troops while not having enough recoil to knock you out of your Exo-rig. With Exoborne being focused on being a faster-paced run-and-gun format, leaning into an arcade-style for gunplay lends itself to a more enjoyable experience over some of the more hardcore extraction shooters</p>
<p>In speaking with one of the developers from Sharkmob before my interview with Martin Holberg (co-founder at the studio and a narrative director on the game), it’s clear that they’ve done a large overhaul to the mechanics and progression for Exoborne throughout the various beta tests, from retaining your Exo-rig on death to supporting separate progression tracks to each rig. Extraction shooters are becoming a busier and busier market to compete with and it looks like Sharkmob is taking the closed beta feedback to heart in order to hit the ground running when Exoborne launches later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne - Gameplay Walkthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tqnPjrA29k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>For gamers that might be seeing Exoborne for the first time, can you give us a quick rundown on what this project is?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Exoborne is a tactical extraction shooter. You play as an Exowarrior in the United States that's being torn apart by these apocalyptic forces of nature, and that happens as you play the game.</p>
<p>During a session, you scavenge and fight to stay alive. It's an extraction shooter. You fight your way in, you try to achieve an objective, you fight your way out, and hopefully, you survive long enough to extract yourself and get out of the session. You can prolong that experience by doing certain activities in the session.</p>
<p>There is something called a rebirth trace timer that keeps track of you as you move around. Eventually, that timer is going to identify you on the map for all other players to see. That's your hint that you should have gotten out already, because now you're kind of marked. You can extend that timer so it takes longer before you get marked on the map,</p>
<p><strong>How does extraction work in your game?</strong></p>
<p>The only way to get out is through the extraction ships. There are a number of extraction points on the map, and not all of them are active at any given time. The weather can affect which ones are active, and there's also a random dynamic to it. The first thing you really want to do when you drop in is kind of look at which of these zones are active for extraction, and then you plan your activity.</p>
<p><strong>Ok. It's probably one dropship per extraction point, so if a player team goes there and they extract, there won't be another ship called in right away, right?</strong></p>
<p>No, you're calling in one ship at a time and then there's a cooldown on that extraction point. If you're another team, you would have to wait a while to call in the next one. But you could also kill the ones trying to extract and take their extraction, or you could just go up, shake their hand, and all of you can get on board. But that rarely happens.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an emote system in there for that sort of thing?</strong></p>
<p>We're actually looking at that now. I know it's on the design team's table. I haven't gotten the latest update on that, so I'm going to leave that as a maybe.</p>
<p><strong>In the PR materials for Exoborne, we saw highway signs for Albany. Does this mean that the game will be set in the northeastern reaches of the US?</strong></p>
<p>The game takes place in a fictional place that we call Colton County. It's a place we made up just because we wanted to be able to create our own sandbox to play in, right? And we always imagined Colton County located somewhere in the southeastern USA. We're still keeping it a bit vague, but it's not an accurate portrayal of any specific location. But yeah, there are traffic signs to real locations.</p>
<p><strong>We got to see three of the different Exorigs that players will have access to. Roughly how many are you planning to have at launch for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>At launch, there will be the three rigs you saw today, plus one we use for tutorial and onboarding. It's a much simpler thing. We just use it to teach you the basic power. The three you saw here are the three we're shipping with.</p>
<p><strong>And what sort of upgrades will players get as they dedicate time to each of the rigs?</strong></p>
<p>Each of these has some bespoke modules that are unique to each model. Then there are a number of shared modules that you can apply to every one of them. It can be different stuff, like, it can affect your movement speed, it can affect your grappling hook's speed. It can be lightning resistance or fire resistance, that type of stuff. You try to configure your exorig to fit your optimal playstyle or&nbsp;preference in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Are they more like static modifications, or will there be some that add in new abilities or change how an ability works?</strong></p>
<p>We have both direct abilities and stats that change based on the mods. You can call in an air strike, you can cloak, you can put down a cloak field, you can put down a minefield. There's a bunch of offensive capabilities and also some defensive capabilities. The other ones are more along what I mentioned previously, affecting your run speed or like grappler, cooldowns, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>What's the length of the grapple, roughly?</strong></p>
<p>That's a very good design question. I'm going to have to get back to you with an answer on that because I don't know it. It's also quite different depending on how you modify it, but we can get you an exact answer if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>I was experimenting right around the 15 to 20 m range when I got it to be really reliable.</strong></p>
<p>I would say it's around 20 m, but I can't give you an exact number.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Exoborne-1-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>How many different weapon types are available in Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>I will have to count them in my head because I don't know the exact number. We have sniper rifles,&nbsp;shotguns, assault rifles, submachine guns, pistols, light machine guns. I'm sure I forgot one or two, so I would say 6 or 7 different types, and then many variants of those. None of them is limited to a specific rig.</p>
<p><strong>How large are each of the maps?</strong></p>
<p>Maynard is the biggest one. I'm struggling to remember exactly the size of it, but Maynard is quite big. It's a very big open. You can use cars to drive across it. The other one, the mid-size one we call Agnesville, and that's an urban area, so it is smaller in terms of the size, but it has way more vertical space because you've got more rooftops, you've got indoors. It plays very differently.</p>
<p>The smaller one is essentially quite a large sinkhole that's about 1 kilometer big, and it's like a big hole where you need to go down and do certain things, so it's a very intense area.</p>
<p><strong>When you're moving into a much denser area, like you mentioned,&nbsp;that limits a lot of the mobility options there.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. The Exorigs are made for traversal. That's one of the key components. That works absolutely best when you're outside, when you can either move freely on the wind, grappling up on cliffs or on buildings. When you go inside, it becomes more of a traditional tactical shooter because now you're locked in a hallway or locked into a room. That changes pacing, the tactics you apply, and to a certain degree, it also changes what you can use your Exorig for. But we still have some fairly large indoors as well where you can use some of these things to your advantage, like grappling hooks to get up on catwalks.</p>
<p><strong>Are any of these levels modular, where you might see them play out a little bit differently, or is every map bespoke?</strong></p>
<p>The layout is the same, it's static, but the weather patterns are always different, so that's dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any building destruction in Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We have destructible objects. The buildings themselves are not destructible, but many of the props and objects out in the world are. For example, fences and low walls and stuff like that can be either crushed if you run too fast with your Exorig. You can drive through them with cars, or you can shoot them or blow them up.</p>
<p><strong>We saw tornadoes. We did see firenados and others. Can players throw like a Molotov or an incendiary grenade and turn a tornado into a firenado?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You can either use a Molotov to do that, or you can shoot an exploding barrel and cause a fire and the tornado becomes a firenado. You can do similar things with toxic substances. If you shoot a container with gas in it, then it carries the gas with it.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to have a weather forecast? It wouldn't have to be exact, just to get a rough idea of the conditions before starting a map.</strong></p>
<p>We've thought a lot about that. I know design has been struggling a bit with that. We want you to be able to have some degree of anticipation so you can load your equipment, because otherwise it doesn't really make sense, right? You want to prepare for a certain set of conditions. At the same time, we do want it to change on the map.&nbsp;I'm just going to have to say we're going to get back to you on that with more details.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't your first multiplayer title, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-qa-devs-talk-early-access-feedback-and-partnering-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt</a> being the previous one from Sharkmob. What sort of lessons did you learn about what players enjoy most about a multiplayer game?</strong></p>
<p>Many of the seniors at our studio had worked together before on other multiplayer games. Just like you said, Bloodhunt is the first one that Sharkmob did, but we have some experience prior to that as well. A lot of the learnings we took from Bloodhunt were related to how to operate and how to run a live game. Bloodhunt was free to play. It's very different. We are now making a premium game, so there are certain factors that are quite different, but there were a lot of good lessons in Blood hunt on everything from the vertical movement. It might have been a bit too hardcore in Bloodhunt, where it was quite easy to get away from a fight by jumping down a house or breaking a line of sight, meaning that you would often lose your prey and you wouldn't get to finish the fight.</p>
<p>In Exoborne, we've spaced out the verticality a bit more, so it's harder to quickly break those lines of sight. You're going to have to commit to the fight more than you did in that game. Besides gameplay stuff like that, there's also learnings around cheating, how to plan live content, and at the same time provide updates and bug fixes, and all of that stuff. It's way more complicated than you'd think initially to be able to both proactively produce content and, at the same time, maintain what's running live right in front of you. So a lot of good lessons on the simple practical stuff of running a game like that.</p>
<p><strong>What anti-cheat solution are you using?</strong></p>
<p>We've got to get back to you on that one. The only thing I can say is that we've invested a lot of thought and time into it, but we're also quite wary about releasing too many details about it for the obvious reasons of maybe not wanting to spill the beans on it.</p>
<p><strong>Is PC the only platform or just the primary platform for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>It's more like the first platform for us. We will do PC and console, but we will do PC first and then consoles will follow.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Exoborne-2-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Battle Pass?</strong></p>
<p>There will be a Battle Pass, we can say that. The game is full of cosmetics, vanity, and customizing your character. Not just how it plays, but also how it looks is very important to us. That's another one of those things we kind of fell in love with Bloodhunt, where we had a lot of customization options. You will definitely be able to have a lot of diversity in how you set up a character.</p>
<p><strong>One thing that's unique about Exoborne is that, rather than picking upper and bottom layers, you're picking the entire outfit. Will players be able to have different colors for a given outfit?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think we have different colors on the outfits. We have different variants of the same. We have different uniform patterns, for example. It's the same basic uniform, but with different patterns. On the Exorigs, we have more color options.</p>
<p>Because you have the vanity on your outfit, which is like your clothing, and then you have your Exorig where you have another set of vanity on top of that, like the skin for the actual Exorig and you have Helmets, you have facewear, and then your facial customization.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to acquire the outfits in the game itself? Can they find a rare loot that might have an outfit?</strong></p>
<p>I am pretty sure we have a reward system that rewards vanity.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. Is there any sort of mastery system that incentivizes players to pick up one specific Exorig and specialize with it?</strong></p>
<p>There's a progression system tied to the Exorig, so it's going to take time to max it out. Ideally, I think you would probably want to be able to use all of them because there's a synergy between them, and you play in a team. So, if the entire team goes in with the same Exorig, that might not be optimal. Depending on who you play with, you might want to swap it out.</p>
<p><strong>Going into the mission, we saw a loadout or gear score. What risks are there for players if they die in the world? What will they lose?</strong></p>
<p>When you die, you lose everything except your Exorig, so you lose your guns and all. Well, you don't lose the vanity either, so the Exorig and the vanity are safe. You lose your weapon, you lose your mods, you lose your inventory, you lose your armor. That's what you lose when you die.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any insurance system at play here where players might insure their primary weapons, so if they die and lose everything, they might be able to retain them?</strong></p>
<p>We're running a lot of tests and each of these tests have generated feedback that we have taken and addressed in the game. For example, we did a progression overhaul, an inventory overhaul, we did a significant UX pass. The handler character that you probably saw when you played is Styx, who holds together much of the missions and we're constantly looking for that feedback.</p>
<p>When it comes to the insurance thing, it's one of those things where I'm saying currently we don't have it. If we think we need, it we might add it, but right now, it's not in the game. It's one of those things where some players love it, some players hate it because they want every match to be incredibly high stakes. But sometimes it helps draw in players that might be a little risk-averse to go out there with those higher ranked weapons rather than just keeping them in your stash for another day.</p>
<p>That is the big challenge, right? If you have a very powerful weapon, the risk is that you're too afraid to use it. I definitely get that desire, but there might be other ways to handle that and make sure you still feel like you can use your toy and not be afraid to lose it.</p>
<p><strong>How will players be able to communicate in the world of Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We have the ping system. We also have VoIP for both team and proximity chat, so you can communicate with other teams if you want to when you're close to each other. Those are the main ways of doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to link multiple squads together if they want to ally towards the end of the match?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there is no system that allows that to happen mechanically, but there's nothing that stops you from doing it on a gentleman's agreement.</p>
<p><strong>When will players be able to get their hands on Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We recently had that public test. We are preparing to do more tests, and a date will be released in the&nbsp;not-so-distant future, but we're not releasing that date yet.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on collaborating with other brands or other games to create new content or cosmetics for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>I think we're always open to collaborations, and you can obviously do them in many different ways, right? We have a world that is very close to our own, so there are some brands that fit perfectly as a part of the universe, and those brand collaborations are very easy if they show up. Then there are collaborations which might be a bit more on the edge of, does that fit in our world? Then we'd have to take that discussion, but typically even in that case, you could have a temporary event where you do that kind of stuff. We're always hoping for collaborations. It's always fun.</p>
<p><strong>Exoborne is so much about the gunplay, but would you consider having melee weapons in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Each of the Exorigs today has a melee move, which you can use for different things. Personally, I mostly use it against NPCs. I'm not sure I would dare to go and try to get a player doing that as long as they have a gun, but I would absolutely say that I would not completely rule out melee weapons as a thing that could be added in the future. It's how we work: we watch how people play and what they enjoy to do, and then we try to create more of that content, but there will definitely be no melee weapons at launch. It's one attack per unit and that's it.</p>
<p><strong>Any other closing remarks you'd like to leave with our readers, Martin?</strong></p>
<p>Like I said, we already made major improvements to this game based on feedback from people like your readers. I would be very happy to keep seeing their feedback and just to have them comment on stuff, participate in our play tests, and let us know what works and what doesn't work. Often, what can be really helpful is why they think it doesn't work. It's one thing to say, oh, that thing is shit, but please elaborate and explain why you think it's shit or why you think it's awesome because that really helps us when we read the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-scheduled-for-this-week.1219368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be airing a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>-themed Direct presentation later this week, so we'll finally get to learn more about the iconic ape's upcoming platformer.</p>

<p>As revealed on the Nintendo Today news app, the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct airs on June 18th (that's this Wednesday at time of writing). It'll last around 15 minutes and will (quite obviously) focus entirely on&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, so put your&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>hopes away.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">back in April</a> as part of the Nintendo Switch 2's big reveal,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will serve as DK's first 3D platformer in 26 years. Naturally, I'm not counting the newer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country&nbsp;</em>games; their models might be 3D, but they're 2D platformers at heart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=FoXmj90V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=Rpz_cQ8B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Direct airs in two days, DK. I'd go find something else to do in the meantime.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will see you playing as the titular ape as he attempts to recover priceless golden banana-shaped jewels from the nefarious VoidCo, for if Donkey Kong is involved, then it must be the rescue of bananas that motivates him.</p>

<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a 3D platformer with all the good stuff you've come to expect from the genre: collectibles, bad guys to fight, and, of course, plenty of chasms to jump across.</p>

<p>The game will also feature destructible environments, with initial trailers showing off the ability to smash up elements of the stage to get underground or to collect more stuff. That's the kind of thing the original Switch probably wouldn't have been able to handle.</p>

<p>You can remind yourself of how fun&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>looks (very, in case you need a refresher) by checking out the debut trailer from back in April below.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct presentation airs on June 18th at 9am Eastern (that's 6am Pacific). The game itself launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming.1219347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The summer is a great period for games, but also kinda weird when you think about it: it’s a few weeks where we’re all more excited about watching trailers for games, rather than playing them. It’s all for a good reason, of course – the multiple big presentations, once the framework that held up E3, showcase the most exciting new games in development and often reveal new projects for the very first time. They’re our first taste of what we’ll be playing tomorrow and beyond, and so naturally they garner a huge amount of interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To see what’s really caught players’ attention, we’ve combed through every video posted to IGN over the last couple of weeks and picked out the 10 most-viewed trailers from the Summer of Gaming. There are some clear standouts, clocking up millions of views, as well as a mix of highly-anticipated returns and brand new surprises. You can see the biggest and best trailers below. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Resident Evil Requiem</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 2.1 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil 9</a> was the big hit of Summer of Gaming 2025. Resi fans have been waiting a long time for this one, with Requiem’s predecessor – Resident Evil Village – having been released back in 2021. And with Ethan Winters’ story now over, the perspective is switching to a new character. This first trailer provides a solid introduction to FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, and we couldn’t be more excited because it appears she’ll be heading to a bombed-out Raccoon City. While much of the trailer is set in Ashcroft’s office, the final segment goes hard on the dark and gnarly survival horror tone established in Resident Evil 7 – making it clear that developer Capcom is looking to scare us all silly. We can’t wait.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Invincible VS</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 2.1 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Video’s animated version of Robert Kirkman’s Invincible comics has proven exceptionally popular, so naturally an Invincible video game has captured the imagination of many gamers this week. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a> is a 3v3 tag fighting game that really does seem to capture the bone-crunching, bloody violence of the TV show – more than clear during the shot where Invincible causes Bulletproof’s head to detonate. While the promise of a city-destroying Invincible vs Omni-Man showdown is enough to sell us on the idea, seeing other characters turn up for the tag-style matches – including Atom Eve and Rex Plode – really has us eager to learn more.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.5 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">People may grumble about Game of Thrones’ final season to this day, but that doesn’t mean the fantasy series has lost any popularity. That’s proven by the massive number of views on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/game-of-thrones-war-for-westeros">War for Westeros</a> trailer, which acts as something of a “what if?” scenario. The cinematic trailer sees Jon Snow face off against the Night King in a one-on-one duel, a thrilling event that never happened in the HBO show. As the fight continues, we see other exciting but similarly non-canon moments play out, such as Daenerys and Drogon being shot out of the sky by a huge ballista, and Jaime Lannister fighting in what appears to be a four-way battle between his army, Stark bannermen, the Unsullied, and the White Walkers (the first hint of this being a real-time strategy rather than an action game). The big surprise, though, is seeing Jon killed and turned into a wight. As many in the trailer’s comments have said, this is the big finale season 8 could have been. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. ILL</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.3 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil understandably got the most love of any horror reveal this year, but we’re delighted to see the grotesque gameplay trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ill">ILL </a>also struck a chord. This terrifying, rusty-looking survival horror is full of some of the freakiest enemies we’ve seen recently, including multi-limbed monstrosities, bobble-headed babies, and zombies with a desperate need to see a dentist. All of them can be torn apart thanks to an "advanced dismemberment system". Despite all that grossness, ILL knows how to crack a good joke: over in the equally engaging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ill-official-trailer-summer-game-fest-2025">SGF trailer</a>, the whole sequence ends with a zombie toddler being kicked in the face and punted into a pile of barrels. A little dark humour to brighten up your Summer of Gaming, there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.2 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG experts Owlcat Games is back with a new project, set in the world of The Expanse. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">Osiris Reborn</a> is very different from Owlcat’s previous projects – where the studio usually develops isometric RPGs that take inspiration from both games like the original Baldur’s Gate and tabletop adventures, this new Expanse game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-from-the-developer-of-warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-looks-a-lot-like-a-new-mass-effect-and-yes-there-is-romance">looks a lot like a modern-day Mass Effect</a>. And considering how long it’s been since we had a good Mass Effect, it’s no wonder the internet has gone wild for this lengthy trailer, which combines exciting cinematics involving flying grenades and face crystals with a healthy gameplay montage demonstrating some good cover-shooting mechanics. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. 007 First Light</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 835,000</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive’s Bond game was announced years ago, but we finally got to see it in action as part of PlayStation’s State of Play stream. The coolest thing about this trailer is how it treats <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">First Light</a> as if it were a brand new 007 film, introducing us to the new cast playing the likes of M, Q, and – of course – James Bond. Our super spy hero is much younger and greener than we’re used to, but it’s clear that IOI knows everything that’s required for a hit Bond mission. There’s exotic locations, expensive watches, a vintage Aston Martin, and more high-stakes action than the entire Hitman trilogy combined. It seems like IOI really does have a license to thrill.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 822,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">New hardware is always going to draw significant interest, and so it's no surprise to see a handheld Xbox among the most-watched trailers. Of course, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/rog-xbox-ally">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> isn’t <em>quite </em>a true handheld Xbox – this portable PC is developed by Asus rather than Microsoft itself, and is an extension of its existing line of ROG Ally devices. However, it’s still the next step in Microsoft’s “This is an Xbox” project, which aims to allow you to play Xbox games anywhere from your console to your computer, TV, phone, and (presumably, one day) your fridge. And a powerful handheld PC that can directly interface with Xbox Game Pass and the Xbox cloud services is certainly nothing to be sniffed at. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Atomic Heart 2</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 796,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first trailers for the original Atomic Heart were big hits with the IGN audience, but a sequel was never a sure thing – reception of the first game was mixed, and it wasn’t quite the BioShock spiritual successor that the trailers suggested. Nevertheless, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomic-heart-2">Atomic Heart 2</a> seems to be doing it all over again. This time around things look significantly more expansive; there’s space stations, wall-running, hang-gliding, mechs, and more vehicles, plus what looks like a much more active world with a larger array of characters. It’s all rendered in Atomic Heart’s signature, retro-futuristic Sovietpunk art style, which really is unlike anything else out there. Well, apart from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-cube">The Cube</a>, a multiplayer game set in the Atomic Heart universe that was also announced at Summer Game Fest this year.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 720,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’d think that the only kart racing game anyone would care about in June 2025 would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>, but the latest trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> has truly popped off. That may be down to Sonic going through what is undoubtedly his most significant popularity spike in many years (no doubt thanks to the movies), but it also helps that this new trailer shows off some exciting guest additions to the character roster: Hatsune Miku, Like a Dragon's Ichiban Kasuga, Persona 5's Joker, and Minecraft's Steve. There’s even Minecraft-themed courses, which hints to even larger ambitions when it comes to cross-dimensional races. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Chronicles: Medieval</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 708,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s very little gameplay in the trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chronicles-medieval">Chronicles: Medieval</a>, but those brief few seconds reveal that we’ll be leading an entire army from horseback. That promises an epic scale, perhaps one similar to that explored by the Mount &amp; Blade series. The CGI cinematic proceeding that glimpse of gameplay showcases the life experiences of a medieval warrior, from simple village life, to forging weapons, to bracing against cavalry charges. If Chronicles: Medieval can capture all that, then all the excitement around this trailer will be well-rewarded. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honourable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a few other trailers that demand honourable mentions. Naturally, much-demanded sequels and remakes always do well in trailer showcases, and so it hasn’t been surprising to see both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-official-gameplay-trailer-state-of-play-2025">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/high-on-life-2-official-announcement-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">High on Life 2</a> clock up over half a million views each. It’s been far too long since we had a new MGS game, and while Delta isn’t a brand new entry, it is at least a shiny remake of arguably the best game in Kojima’s back catalogue. High on Life, meanwhile, was a breakout hit for Squanch Games back in 2022, and clearly people are excited about wielding even weirder weapons with faces in a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel has also had its fair share of success, but it wasn't ambitious PlayStation 4v4 tag team game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> that drew in the crowds. Instead it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/marvels-deadpool-vr-official-reveal-trailer-summer-game-fest-2025">Deadpool VR</a> and its kinetic, violent action. It really seems like an authentic Deadpool experience, from hacking a guy's head off with a katana and then bowling it at another enemy, to forcing someone’s face into a propeller. And because it’s VR, you know this is all player-controlled stuff rather than canned animations. We can’t wait to see the horrible possibilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But returning favourites are perhaps not as exciting as the truly new, and joining MGS, High on Life 2, and Deadpool in the “over half-a-million club” is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/clockwork-revolution-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Clockwork Revolution</a>. The former is a new RPG from former CD Projekt Red developers, and looks a little like a new take on The Witcher's recipe with bloodthirsty vampires. The latter, meanwhile, is from the RPG longbeards at InXile, and the five-minute-plus trailer dives deep into its steampunk world, roleplaying mechanics, and time-travel systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN is, of course, not the only place people go to for trailers on the internet. We’ve also taken a look at the official YouTube channels for PlayStation and Xbox, and you’ll see similar stats there. 007 First Light was the big winner at PlayStation, with almost three million views, closely followed by Resident Evil Requiem. ILL and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-release-date-trailer-japanese-audio-state-of-play-2025">Silent Hill f</a> also pulled in over a million views each, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/gears-of-war-reloaded-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> – which marks the series’ arrival on a Sony console for the very first time – saw in excess of half a million views. As for Xbox, the brand new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld PC was the leader with over a million views, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/persona-4-revival-official-reveal-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Persona 4 Revival</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/super-meat-boy-3d-official-reveal-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/beast-of-reincarnation-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Beast of Reincarnation</a> all clocked up hundreds of thousands of views.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what was your personal favourite trailer of the event?

<p>This year's event, dubbed <strong>BitSummit the 13th: Summer of Yokai</strong>, will take place at the the Miyako Messe in Kyoto City from <strong>Friday, 19th July to Sunday, 21st July</strong>. Tickets are on sale now for Japanese attendees via the <a href="https://t.pia.jp/en/pia/event/event.do?eventCd=2511585">Ticket Pia website</a>, while international attendees can use a dedicated <a href="https://ticket.pia.jp/piasp/inbound/bitsummit25eng.jsp">English-language page</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has stressed that it will not be showcasing any first-party games at the event, which is completely understandable given the nature of BitSummit. It's also confirmed that the Nintendo booth will be accessible via a lottery system, with the reservation page available at a later date.</p>
<p>Other confirmed publishers attending the event include PlayStation, PocketPair, Lost in Cult, Inti Creates, Spike Chunsoft, Devolver Digital, and more.</p>
<p>Nintendo will no doubt be seeking every available opportunity to advertise the Switch 2 now that it's out in the wild. Having launched earlier this month, it's gone on to become the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">fastest-selling console of all time in Japan</a>, and the fastest-selling Nintendo platform in both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-wont-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-won%E2%80%99t-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty.1219299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-wont-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The revival of Onimusha, CAPCOM's action series that hasn't seen a new entry in nearly twenty years, certainly surprised fans. During the latest Summer Game Fest 2025, where Onimusha: Way of the Sword was shown to the press (<a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-hands-off-sgf-2025-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ourselves included</a>), Italian website Multiplayer had the chance to speak to the developers and learn more details about the upcoming game, such as its linear level design.</p>
<p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will generally be structured around a series of sequential missions. There will be a series of levels and, as shown in the presentation, those individual levels will feature a relatively linear path with some secondary areas: once you reach the final boss, you defeat it and move on to the next mission. However, the content shown in the presentation was only representative of a small fraction of what is found in the Kiyomizu-dera level. Although the essence is linear, there is a lot of hidden content in each level.</em></p>
<p>One thing is for sure: CAPCOM did not choose to bring back the franchise as a reaction to games like Dark Souls. In fact, they said that the goal is not at all to create a particularly challenging game.</p>
<p><em>I can say without a doubt that we did not decide to bring Onimusha back to life because of the recent trend of particularly difficult video games. On the contrary, we want to ensure that as wide an audience as possible can immediately get into the game and enjoy it. The goal is not to create a difficult experience: we want to offer the right sense of satisfaction to both hardcore gamers and those who approach it from other perspectives, for example, to enjoy the story and setting.</em></p>
<p>It seems like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will focus more on the narrative than ever before, as the developers recognized it is a major way to open up the game to a broader audience.</p>
<p>So far, we only have a generic 2026 release window. However, with the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-playable-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be playable at Gamescom 2025, a launch in the first half of next year is not to be ruled out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-sales-apparently-topped-a-million-in-just-three-days.1219296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-sales-1m-three-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC sales of the hack-and-slash actioner&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>apparently reached a major milestone within just three days of the game's release, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per Korean news platform <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ruliweb</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC version, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>, racked up a million sales for itself on PC alone within the first three days of its release on the platform.</p>

<p>According to Ruliweb, that brings the game's total sales up to over three million around the world. That's on both PlayStation 5 and PC, of course, and it also includes both digital and physical shipments. Still, that's not a bad figure at all, and it means&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has picked up an extra two million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-sales-report-boss.jpg?itok=uA66X8Or 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-sales-report-boss.jpg?itok=0eCGlPQk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC port has done solid numbers, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, it's an action game developed by&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>studio Shift Up. Released last year, the game revolves around Eve, who must rid Earth of a hostile force known as the Naytiba.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including the addition of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">crossover with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">Nier: Automata</a>&nbsp;</em>(one of the game's biggest inspirations), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">lots of new outfits</a> for several of the game's characters as well.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the game did so well that Shift Up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus" rel="nofollow">gifted all of its employees PS5 Pro consoles</a> as a Christmas bonus last year, and since&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>boasts PS5 Pro improvements (along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">several other games</a>), I'm sure that came as a welcome surprise.</p>




<p>As for what's next for Shift Up, a <i>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</i>sequel has been confirmed to be in the works, although we don't know when it's due yet. Additionally, the studio is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-new-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">new next-gen action-RPG</a>&nbsp;with an urban sci-fi theme.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our very own Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>

<p>In offering a world in which "every tile is simulated", Away Team is both daring comparisons with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a> and building on the volatile foundations of Oxygen Not Included, which Nate (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oxygen-not-included-review">called</a> "a machine for procedurally generating engineering problems, and due to the huge number of physical properties interacting in the simulation, they will never be the same twice".</p>
<p>In Away Team, you are a solitary Oxygen Not Included colonist, aka Duplicant, who has mistakenly pushed a big red button and rocketed off to a strange new world. Equipped with a vacuum gun, you must explore the depths and craft your own abode from all the materials you find. You will need food and oxygen. Also, a working understanding of conductivity. And a very careful aim.</p>
<p>This is a realm in which every piece of matter is subject to the laws of thermodynamics. Liquids flow and evaporate. Fires spread, given access to flammable materials. I don't remember things being so... temperamental in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> away missions, but I would have happily watched a million episodes of a show in which Captain Picard spends 29 minutes gingerly carving out acid vats, then says "oh shit" just before the credits roll.</p>
<p>Away Team has yet no release date, but it does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168390/Away_Team/">a Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down," Charles Tremblay, CD Projekt's VP of technology said when asked why the tech demo was on PS5. "But then we had so many problems in the past that we tried to see, ok, this time around we really want to be [doing] more console-first development, right? We worked with Unreal, with our partner, and then we saw the challenge. To realise the ambition, to make what we want at 60 fps on PS5 would be, you know, there would be work."</p>
<p>So, the studio's made The Witcher 4's console performance a big focus - something that's not surprising given <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s launch issues generally proved much more dire on those platforms than on PC. That's not to say we were spared totally, I remember some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-review">pretty wacky glitches</a> from the start of my first playthrough, but nothing so game-breaking it made me consider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-removed-cyberpunk-2077-from-the-playstation-store">trying to get a refund</a>.</p>
<p>However, don't fret, CD Projekt still plan on letting you take full advantage of the bells and whistles the best PCs can pull off, even if it sounds like they're currently figuring out exactly what that'll entail.</p>
<p>"It's easier to scale up than down, because we know that both Lumen (UE5's global illumination and reflections system) and all those technologies are providing us pretty consistent representation across the scale up, we know that once we set up certain foundations both visually and technically, there's room to scale up," CD Projekt VP and global art director Jakub Knapik said in a bit of the chat about the game's graphical potential beyond what the PS5 can handle.</p>
<p>He added that CD Projekt aim to "expand all the raytracing features forwards" on PC, and in general ensure that people who spend the big bucks on their desktops are appropriately rewarded with the likes of uber-swankily rendered huts and suitably stunning vistas.</p>
<p>"In the past, something that's [been] super important for the group is that if people pay good money for the hardware, we want them to have what the game can provide for that [top hardware], not like a simplified experience," Tremblay added, "So this is something we'll definitely explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As a kid, when you come across an ancient, tattered map in the attic, what’s the first thing you do? If you answered ‘Go to sea, wreck yourself and then wash up on a desert island on the back of a giant turtle’, then we have a winner!</p>
<p><iframe title="Survival Kids - Official Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhT0Rv8pFOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the very simple backstory holding down Survival Kids, a co-op survival game from Konami that’s received a surprise revival on Switch 2. The original was a Game Boy Color game of the same name, which was just rereleased on Nintendo Classics last month, and continued in the noughties by the Lost in Blue trilogy on Nintendo DS.</p>


<p>Survival Kids is a colourful romp across a series of fantastical and magical islands. Either solo or with up to 3 friends, you set about crafting and cooking your way to freedom. Or, at the very least clumsily crashing your boat into every possible island on the way home.</p>
<p>Despite the name, this is more Messing About on an Islands Kids than it is about actual survival. You are functionally immortal, you will never die of starvation and there’s none of the usual inventory or time management that comes with the survival genre. This is very much a survival-lite game, making this a decent co-op option for those new to gaming. It’s also entirely playable solo, but as in real life, it’s quicker to chop a tree down when four people are wildly swinging axes at it.</p>

<p>Near the start of each level you will find a Harmony Stone — the McGuffin that both acts as portable camp as you work your way to higher ground, and drives the limited plot forward. This is a relic from a bygone era; despite each island being a deserted one, it was once home to an ancient race with an impressive command of technology.</p>

<p>Once you set up camp, you begin your hunt for either the elevator to the next strata of the island, or the boat that will get you off the island and onto the next one. The elevator is, naturally, broken so you need to find the missing parts to repair it.</p>
<p>The rub is that as you traverse a given island, you will quickly find your way frequently blocked by gaping chasms or unclimbable walls. Since you are resourceful youngsters, and carry around a pickaxe and an axe, you can fashion functional bridges and climbing nets out of the stuff lying around the island.</p>
<p>The genius here is that since you have to manually carry everything — your pockets are full of pickaxe, remember? — and you can’t do complex tasks like climbing while your hands are full, each island is extremely navigable. That’s not to say they are linear — exploration is rewarded and you frequently have to think outside the box, throwing vines and the like into crafting boxes from across a gap, in order to create the bridge you need to cross. You’ll even come across glyphs that unlock extra outfits and Treasure Stones that increase your island’s star rating.</p>
<p>Escaping the island all hinges on solving the area’s puzzles, which invariably involves building bridges, crafting tools and eating food to get the stamina to rip stuff out of the ground.</p>
<p>These puzzles are usually pretty simple —&nbsp;chop down a tree and add wood to the blue box with the floating recipe above it — but get slightly more complicated as the game progresses. Mostly, they get more frustrating when you come across the ‘ancient’ gun turrets that shoot you into the water, making you lose the thing you’re carrying.</p>

<p>New tools are added along the way in the form of blueprints; find those and drag them back to base to discover the recipe for your tool. Collect the bits you need and you suddenly have a new glider to help traverse the peaks, or a fishing rod that will carry parts up cliffs.</p>
<p>Once you’ve repaired enough elevators and are high enough up the island, you’ll find your ship, minus a few key parts. So now, instead of looking for elevator parts, it’s the same thing but looking for rudders, sails and so on. Find the bits, repair the ship and bring the Harmony Stone aboard.</p>
<p>Island-specific recipes aside, this core gameplay loop doesn’t really change: fix the elevator, pick up your camp and up you go. It’s possibly a little simplistic for some, but ideal for playing with your partner or kids who don’t usually have a controller glued to their hands.</p>
<p>Ultimately, your mission is to get the Harmony Stone off of each island and take it back to an arcane lighthouse that staves off the storm surrounding the archipelago, permitting your eventual escape. If you complete the level fast enough, you’ll be awarded up to three stars, adding to those from looting all three Treasure Stones per island. Get enough stars and you can unlock the final island.</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>It's a feature</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="rumble turned off message switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3877cedaa3806/rumble-turned-off-message-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It seems some eager players have been a little mystified as to the reasons behind a message that's been popping up on their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> screens during play as of late.</p>
<p>Yep, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lai1kb/rumble_turning_itself_off/">over on Reddit</a> (thanks <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/49752-switch-2-will-automatically-turn-off-rumble-after-prolonged-use">GoNintendo</a>) a handful of gamers have been rocking up to report that an alert related to the console's HD Rumble has been popping onto their lovely big LCD screens, as you can see in the post below this very paragraph. Of course, with it being a new console, folk have quickly become concerned that there's something up with their Joy-Con and/or Pro 2 Controllers.</p>

<p>Fear not, however, if you happen to see this very same message, which is something that could definitely happen (although this particular writer, through a whole bunch of reviews on the system thus far, has yet to see it), so stay frosty!</p>
<p>As it turns out, amongst the many new bells and whistles the Switch 2 brings with it, its snazzy new HD Rumble 2 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-differences-how-do-the-new-controllers-compare">the reason your Joy-Con and Pro 2 Controller feel so great this time around</a> — has the ability to shut itself off should it overheat or become a burden on other functions, such as battery, we are guessing. Indeed, browsing through the comments from the same post, we've got gamers chiming in on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> both triggering this same function.</p>
<p>Could it become annoying, though? Or can we switch it off more to the point? (No, no we can't as there's no option in settings.)</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a huge amount of rhyme as to how and when the issue presents itself at the moment, but with the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 the rumble <em>can</em> become very intensive for entire scenes, and it appears as though a sustained rumble, for around a minute, is what's causing the issue. Perhaps the best bet, certainly with regards to CD Projekt Red's game, is to turn the rumble down in-game.</p>
<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/switch-2-joy-con-hd-rumble-wont-be-as-loud-as-it-was-on-switch">already discussed the decreased the volume of rumble</a> on Switch 2, so it's obviously an aspect of the machine they've been spending a lot of time refining and keeping an eye on. We've reached out to Nintendo asking about the exact conditions and reasons for this warning to pop up - we'll keep you posted with any updates.</p>
<p><em>Have you had the HD Rumble message pop up on your Switch 2 during game yet? Let us know!</em></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has sold more than one million copies on PC within three days of its arrival to the platform, <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821">according to Ruliweb</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> would also pass the three million sales milestone across all platforms following its PC release. As of writing, the game reached a peak concurrent player count on Steam of 192,078, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">a substantial increase over the weekend from its initial peak of just under 100,000 in its first day</a>.</p>
<p>This performance marks an all-time record for South Korean single players games, a style of game that ShiftUp has been championing since releasing Stellar Blade in April of last year.</p>

<p>According to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238">Daniel Ahmad at Niko Partners</a>, a majority of these PC sales stem from China, a playerbase who'd benefit from a PC-only Chinese dub and appropriate regional pricing. This market has proven an exceptionally eager one, both with Stellar Blade and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">Black Myth Wukong's own record breaking Steam release last year</a>.</p>
<p>This stunning PC release comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony execs spoke about bringing its games to different platforms in an annual fireside chat</a>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president Hideaki Nishino and Studio Business Group head Hermen Hulst when asked about how to "protect the value" of the PlayStation console noted that Sony's consoles would remain "the best place to play and publish", but that "the team is always looking for "new and innovative ways to broaden [its] reach".</p>
<p>ShiftUp announced back in May in an investor presentation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">a sequel to Stellar Blade was being developed</a>. The only tidbit of information aside from the confirmation present there was that the game was scheduled to be released before 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
