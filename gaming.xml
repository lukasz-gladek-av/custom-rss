			<p>The level of competition in the personal audio space is flabbergasting. While the biggest companies – Sony, Bose, et al – manage to stay at the top of the pack, the middle ground and the budget brands continue to rise ever closer to them, as technology improves and components become cheaper and more readily available. Amongst those building a head of steam, Edifier have become one of the most reliable names in audio, and with the snappily-named ES850NB, they’ve taken another step closer to those at the top of the category.</p>
<p><iframe title="ES850NB Active Noise Canceling #Headphones. ???? #edifier" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0KJ-obYho8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ES850NB – seriously, can’t we have sensible names in the headphone space? – is an over-ear, wireless headset that brings a suite of desirable features to bear, starting with Hi-Res audio certification, active noise cancellation, and a mammoth 92-hour battery life (53hrs with ANC). That’s good enough to see you all around the world, and thankfully, the audio is good enough to take you all the way there too.</p>


<p>In the box you’re getting the ES850NB itself, a very nice hard case with the Edifier logo proudly emblazoned on the front, and a USB-A to USB-C charging cable. The ES850NB fold down, which Sony and Bose seem to have forgotten about in recent years, and there’s a surety to popping them in the case and putting them in your bag knowing they’re perfectly protected. Thanks to that fold, the case isn’t going to take up all the room in your bag, either.</p>
<p>The headphones themselves come in black, brown, ivory and pink colourways, with our review unit appearing in the understated black. The sleek lines of the headband culminate in the rounded oblongs of each earpiece, connected via a single curved arm. There’s a debt here to the visual design of the Bowers and Wilkin Px8, but the ES850NB come away with enough visual identity of their own to stand apart.</p>


<p>Some of that comes down to the leather-like texture that covers the earpieces, lending the ES850NB a premium look beyond its mid-range price. It creates an interesting juxtaposition with the clean, smooth lines of the headband, and the understated Edifier logos help to make this a pair of headphones that retain a sense of class.</p>
<p>There are physical controls here, which are definitely preferable to some of the touch controls we often see at this price point. There’s a volume rocker, with a central raised point that provides a third button, and these provide every control you could want, whether power, call handling, volume, or music controls.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s a separate button for Bluetooth, which also controls mode switching for ANC, and changing between music and the low latency gaming mode. Unfortunately, you can’t combine the gaming mode with the LDAC codec, forcing a reset of the headset every time you switch, but if you’re serious about competitive mobile gaming, this is an excellent choice. That’s all quite a lot to remember, but the physical recognition of the buttons certainly helps to give you some surety when making changes, as does the voice assistant. Alternatively, you can switch between modes in the Edifier ConneX phone app.</p>
<p>At 265g, the ES850NB are a smidgen heavier than Sony’s XM6 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra, but not enough to notice a difference in your hand or on your head. Soft leatherette covers both the memory foam of the earpads and the underside of the headband, making this an exceedingly comfortable headset that you can wear all day long.</p>

<p>There was a point where I wondered if the ES850NB sounded as good as my Sony XM5s. They don’t, but the fact that Edifier have made something that sounds good enough that I had to check, speaks volumes. There’s a pleasingly wide soundstage, especially wide for a closed-back pair of headphones, and when combined with Hi-Res music, the ES850NBs sound very good indeed.</p>
<p>I have a fairly horrible taste in music, and the Edifier ES850NB delivered all the loud, grinding Metalcore of Bad Omens and Starset with bags of energy. There’s plenty of bass here, but it’s not overwhelming, and with a Hi-Res source like Apple Music, you can pick out details in tracks you’ve listened to hundreds of times, and still find new elements that you’ve never heard before.</p>
<p>When you combine any input with the ANC – rated for -45db – the ES850NB do a great job of cutting out external noises and background sounds, and they provide a natural-feeling fit without any undue pressure. The ambient sound setting is less natural than the best headsets out there, sounding slightly muddied and subdued, but I did like the hold-to-chat function which allowed you to activate the ambient sound setting by holding the right earpiece.</p>

<p>You can dial in a moderate amount of difference via the customisable EQ in the app, and there’s a limited number of pre-made EQ settings as well, but this is currently where the ES850NB are at their weakest. There simply isn’t the level of control or ability to make incremental changes to the audio settings that you’ll find elsewhere. In the end, I opted for the Bass Boost EQ setting, and there was still plenty of top-end detail with this setup, but if you’re the kind of person who wants to dial in a very specific sound, Edifier have some work to do.</p>
<p>There’s the added oddity that the phone app won’t update your headset’s firmware. Instead, you have to use the Edifier Tempohub on your PC or Mac, which is an unnecessary extra layer of faff, and might even lock some owners out of updating their headphones. When everyone else’s phone app can perform that function, I don’t really understand why Edifier’s doesn’t.</p>
<p>At £149.99, the ES850NB are pretty much the epitome of the mid-range. As another option in this price range, the Skull Candy Crusher ANC offer some serious bass, but they lack the refinement of the ES850NB. If you’re lucky enough to catch them in a sale though, you might want to hold out for Sony’s older XM4’s, which remain one of the best pairs of headphones ever made. They also support that all-important LDAC codec.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/supergiant-games" rel="nofollow">Supergiant Games</a>, the developers for hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/transistor-review-kill-robots-talking-sword" rel="nofollow">Transistor</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/supergiant-games/reviews" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>, never cease to amaze me. Somehow, each game they make is better than the last. So with their latest title<em>&nbsp;Hades 2,&nbsp;</em>I have to wonder how anything could top this. Yes, it's that good. With how incredible&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is, can you&nbsp;<em>imagine</em>&nbsp;what they've got cooking in the future?</p>

<p>But let's focus on the present for now.&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a Game of the Year contender, the same as its predecessor. This <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/roguelite/games" rel="nofollow">roguelite</a> -- filled with mechanical depth and wonderful, complex characters -- continues to give more and more, even after dozens of runs across many hours of gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-hecate.jpg?itok=opPfS3jt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-hecate.jpg?itok=pFLd10Cn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hecate isn't the only one with a grudge.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Hades</em>&nbsp;is Back and Better than Ever</h2>

<p><em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;expands upon what was already a meaty game in&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>. Hailed as one of the greatest in its genre,&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;provided a great deal of content as player character Zagreus fought through an Underworld directly based on Greek myth.</p>

<p>With this title stars Zagreus' sister, Melinoe, who was born after the events of the original and, due to the scheming of the Titan of Time Chronos, she was whisked away from her family at a very young age. Melinoe, along with the titaness Hecate, trained for many years in the ways of witchcraft and combat in order to take down Chronos and save both the Underworld and the other gods of Olympus.</p>

<p>Any good run in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;begins with some prep work, and that's what Hecate's base of operations is for. It's a beautiful, witchy hub where Melinoe can, among other things, conduct incantations at the cauldron to unlock new mechanics. Incantations require materials, which are acquired during your runs, so despite&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s inevitability of failure during a run, you're still making progress towards your end goal.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-incantations.jpg?itok=txCFQvlV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-incantations.jpg?itok=rw41BZmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The iconic witch's cauldron, a very useful tool.</figcaption></figure><p>Because upgrades are introduced at a natural and steady pace, I was never overwhelmed by the breadth of mechanics. There is a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;going on in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, you see, but somehow, Supergiant Games manages to make it less intimidating than it sounds.</p>

<p>You can unlock new weapons, open up new pathways, and add helpful shrines to enhance your run. Conduct the&nbsp;Propensity Toward Gold incantation to allow urns with extra gold to appear, or activate&nbsp;Faith of Familiar Spirits to acquire animal companions.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, incantations are more nuanced than many roguelites' approach to metaprogression. This makes&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>vastly more interesting in terms of gameplay, meaning that every time you unlock the ability to do a new incantation, it's actually quite exciting.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-boon-of-poseidon_0.jpg?itok=0FJcaWym 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-boon-of-poseidon_0.jpg?itok=dGtKzHpm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thank you, Uncle Poseidon.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Gifts of the Gods</h2>

<p>Beyond that, of course, is your standard run through the Underworld in your quest to defeat Chronos. This formula remains true to the original&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;in that you'll fight across a number of zones with hand-crafted rooms arranged in random order. You acquire upgrades and items after completing combat encounters in each room, creating a simple combat loop.</p>

<p>Boons will be the main source of your power here -- these are gifts from the gods that alter your abilities during a run. Like incantations, boons have more nuance to them than your typical roguelite upgrade. You might get stat increases like increased damage or power, but more often than not, boons alter the way your abilities behave.</p>

<p>For every boon you're given three choices, but there are something like two dozen boons for each god, so the possibilities with your builds feel limitless. As an example of what we're working with,&nbsp;I'd get pretty excited every time I saw a boon of Hephaestus waiting for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haphaestus-hades-2.jpg?itok=gWzIJj53 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haphaestus-hades-2.jpg?itok=T8swHtLb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Side note, I love his design.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The God of the Forge would, appropriately, buff your attacks to have blast-like effects, much like a hammer striking hot metal fresh from the forge. These blast effects deal a great amount of damage and refresh after a cooldown. Hephaestus' boons often inflict a debuff called "Glow" on enemies, which allows foes to take an increased percentage of damage.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll likely find your favorite gods and pick which boons work best for you. Personally, I'm still experimenting with possibilities even after 30 hours of playtime, and I definitely haven't seen everything boons have to offer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=64Aizidb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=_1TzNJOY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They look intimidating, but they're no match for Melinoe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Melinoe the Witch</h2>

<p>Where Zagreus felt like more of a brawler in&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, Melinoe is more like a spellcaster. She is a witch, after all, so it only makes sense for her to utilize more spells and ranged-based attacks. Thus, more of her toolkit favors ranged combat, though you're still given a number of close-ranged weapons to choose from.</p>

<p>Though the melee weapons felt way more underpowered compared to the ranged weapons in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. Why get up close and risk getting hit by an enemy when you can attack just as effectively at range? So yes, I vastly preferred keeping foes at bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of weapon variety,&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is similar to its predecessor. You're given a handful of weapons -- called Nocturnal Arms -- to choose from, which will serve as the basis for your kit. From there, these enhance your attacks, dash-strikes, and specials.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-skull.jpg?itok=XGQsqAGB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-skull.jpg?itok=CByzXfuG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using the skull on our skeletal punching bag, Schelemeus.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I preferred the Argent Skull, which is an ammo-based projectile that has a potent, long-range attack that catered to my preferred playstyle. You're given four skulls, and after shooting them, Melinoe must recover them in order to shoot again.</p>

<p>It sounds like a bit of an unconventional way to play, but I like that. Melinoe special dashes forward and grabs those skulls, so the Argent Skull has a great deal of mobility to add onto it. Grab Hephaestus' boons to alter its attacks and specials, and you're going to melt bosses!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-weapons.jpg?itok=sj-QFFFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-weapons.jpg?itok=din5BxJL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Weapons even have variants, so there is so much to unlock and use!</figcaption></figure><p>There's also the cast ability, which you're given regardless of what weapon you choose. This creates a circle on the ground that slows down enemies and can be a very beneficial tool when overwhelmed. Add on a damaging boon, and it serves as a great way to tack on debuffs and damage foes.</p>

<p>Once more adding some complexity and depth to&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s mechanics are Arcana cards, which are permanent unlocks that serve as ways to improve survivability, increase the potency of abilities, and much more. Keepsakes, gifts from gods and other characters, also aid you in&nbsp;this one, as they did in<em>&nbsp;</em>the original. By now, you can probably see what I mean when I say there's a lot going on in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2.&nbsp;</em></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mt.-olympus-hades-2.jpg?itok=IPQ6kARS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mt.-olympus-hades-2.jpg?itok=JHIXZtvn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So this is where the gods live, eh?</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking the Fight to Mt. Olympus</h2>

<p>Truth be told, there's much more to&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>than just traversing through the Underworld.&nbsp;Eventually, Melinoe gains the ability to fight on the surface in an attempt to rescue Mount Olympus from a siege. Here we have even&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>variety&nbsp;in gameplay as it introduces new level layouts, an entirely different&nbsp;set of enemies, bosses, and characters to meet as well.</p>

<p>This is where I realized that&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is more special than I initially thought. The surface is where Supergiant Games' strengths are truly leveraged. Gameplay is, as usual, wonderful, but where they truly excel is with art and sound direction, and strong character writing.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is gorgeous, and the zones are so varied. In the Underworld, Chronos' version of Tartarus has this opulent, clockwork aesthetic. Go to the surface, and you'll eventually reach the snow-capped cliffs of Mt. Olympus, which are magical in their own right, despite their beauty being marred by Chronos' attacking army.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prometheus-hades-2.jpg?itok=TyYDL7jH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prometheus-hades-2.jpg?itok=qixaONM7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Holy moly what a cool lookin' dude.</figcaption></figure><h2>All Things Greek Myth</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, this title brings its characters to life with some of the best character design in the business, as well as strong voice performances by its wonderful cast,&nbsp;including everyone's favorite Ben Starr as Prometheus.</p>

<p>I do want to make a point with Prometheus for a second. If you're familiar with his myth, he was essentially damned to a hellish eternity of being chained to a mountaintop while an eagle devours his innards. I didn't realize it at first, but Prometheus has a bandage around his belly along with a giant scar. As a boss, he has an eagle companion as a weapon and also uses fire (the fire makes sense, as he was the one who gave fire to humanity).</p>

<p>This is just one example of strong visual design conveying a lot about a character, but you'll see this in just about every encounter. You don't really need to know much, if anything, about Greek mythology to enjoy the writing&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;offers, though. It's well-written enough that you can intuit a character's backstory based on what they say.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scylla-and-the-sirens-hades-2.jpg?itok=VzPx4JZ2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scylla-and-the-sirens-hades-2.jpg?itok=JqC64Crq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This one is for Odysseus!</figcaption></figure><p>It was a particular joy to see characters featured from&nbsp;<em>The Odyssey,&nbsp;</em>my favorite tale from Greek myth. There's the cunning and wily Odysseus, who now acts as a tactician for Hecate. We fight Scylla, a sea monster that had a run-in with Odysseus in the past, as well as the cyclops Polyphemus, who still hasn't forgotten how Odysseus outwitted him that one time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This really scratches the surface when it comes to writing, but I'm continually amazed by how much dialogue is offered in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. There are dozens upon dozens of lines for each character, reacting to different things like how your run went, what items you have on, and the like. It's marvelous work.</p>

<p>Really, writing is very strong up until the end. I expected more of an emotional response, but I wasn't fully satisfied with how things ended. This, I realize, is a common complaint among the fandom, but there's a lot of truth to it. I won't divulge details, but I expected something more, I don't know,<em>&nbsp;</em>compelling or thought-provoking, given how strong the rest of the narrative was.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fields-hades-2.jpg?itok=z6jPCCpR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fields-hades-2.jpg?itok=1R7-zTCE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Where to go from here?</figcaption></figure><h2>Hades 2 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I know it's in a roguelites nature to be repetitive, but one additional issue I had with&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;was its boss battles. I felt the same way I did in the original, but they're just so repetitive to a point that I don't look forward to fighting them anymore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in order to roll credits, you're tasked with getting to the end of both the Underworld and the surface quite a few times, so you'll be repeating this cycle a lot. There's no simple solution to fixing this. It's a quirk from roguelites I don't really prefer, so I'd lose excitement when I knew a boss was in the next room.</p>

<p>Despite this,&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is by far the most compelling roguelite ever made. Possibly even the best, and I'm not being hyperbolic. Seriously, it's no wonder other developers try to emulate the formula, only to create something less than the inspiration. Well, with a second stab at&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, Supergiant Games one-ups itself with an even better version of the game that shook up the genre.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shovel Knight&nbsp;</em>developer Yacht Club Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, its upcoming retro-style top-down action-adventure game, has been delayed indefinitely.</p>

<p>Announcing the delay in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Yacht Club says that despite "working tirelessly day and night to finish"&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">intended October 31st release date</a>, the development team is "just not quite there yet".</p>

<p>According to the studio, the delay in question won't be "major"; it'll simply be an opportunity to "apply some final polish and balancing" to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is ready for primetime when it releases. However, no new release date was revealed, so we don't know when the game will actually be arriving.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mina-the-hollower-delayed-gameplay.jpg?itok=Wm58zpnJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mina-the-hollower-delayed-gameplay.jpg?itok=ucqr7VGp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>isn't going to launch in time for Halloween, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club says it doesn't want to announce a new release date until&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>has been submitted for approval across all of the platforms on which it's intended to appear, beseeching fans to "hang tight as we reach the finish line".</p>

<p>As for what's actually being done during the final hours of development, Yacht Club says the team is currently working on issues like finalizing design and art, game balance, and implementing localization, as well as "eating cheese". Well, that's a noble reason for a delay in my books.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is, it's the next title developed by&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight&nbsp;</em>outfit Yacht Club Games, which has also branched out into publishing with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yacht-club-games-announce-8-bit-platformer-cyber-shadow" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Cyber Shadow</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game revolves around the titular Mina, who must traverse Tenebrous Isle in order to rescue it from a curse. It utilizes deliberately retro-style graphics, just like&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight</em>, but this time, the vibe is much more&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>than&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>.</p>




<p>We don't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it's set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875580/Mina_the_Hollower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Mina-the-Hollower-2887867.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Mina-the-Hollower-2887790.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.

            <p>I was rubbing along pretty well in House Of Necrosis before I hurled a vial of unidentified black serum at a squashy purple Devourer. I was hoping the serum would be some kind of poison - I mean, come on, an unidentified black serum? You wouldn't pour that on your chips. It turned out to be an XP potion, which transformed the Devourer into a Foul Devourer - still squashy, still purple, but with much sturdier defence.</p>
<p>I managed to recover some of the accidentally donated XP by lobbing a cheeky hex, but not enough to boost the stopping power of my homely pawnshop knife and pistol. So down I went in a pool of that special red serum the billionaires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/13/rich-men-longevity-history">like to drink</a> when they're feeling mortal.</p><!--more-->
<p>Imagine if this had happened while you were playing the original Resident Evil on PS1. Imagine hurling a bottle of unspecified weirdness into the blindspot immediately after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ntFBVXqPg">the Hunter's first appearance</a>, and hearing a cheery level-up chime. You'd have ripped the power cable out of the wall. You'd have sworn to track down Shinji Mikami and make him eat his own socks. Unless, that is, you'd already played a few Mystery Dungeon games, which do this kind of nonsense all the time.</p>

<p>I described House Of Necrosis as "OG Resident Evil but turn-based" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-battlefield-6-fends-off-an-onslaught-of-cool-indie-rpgs-strategy-games-horror-games-and-piss-simulators">the latest Mawmouth</a>, which isn't inaccurate but (as reader SeekerX pointed out) omits plenty. This neato <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is a tribute to both Capcom and Spike Chunsoft. It sees you exploring a zombie mansion made up of grid-based floor layouts full of randomly distributed enemies, treasures and traps. You've got to find the next floor while sprucing your stats and gathering items. </p><p>It's a game of pleasurable/maddening occult surprises. For example, I was spared death at the claws of an AOE-slopping boss monster by a teleport trap, which whisked me off to a room stocked with green herbs. Thankfully, these do exactly what you're expecting. For people who can't get enough of that old-timey survival horror, there's also a hub environment with proper tank controls.</p>
<p>House Of Necrosis is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005870/House_of_Necrosis/">out now on Steam</a>, still has a demo at the time of writing, and seems jolly, going by the early user reviews. I did enjoy my brief time with the Foul Devourer, though I feel like the game's devout 32-bit murkiness may wear out its welcome, next to the crisper anime stylings of regular Mystery Dungeon. Shame it doesn't appear to be Steam Deck Verified - this feels like it would make a fine portable play. You can also find developer Warkus on <a href="https://warrrkus.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> - they're certainly fond of fifth generation consoles.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-the-iphone-17-amazon-is-offloading-the-new-pixel-10-for-2x-cheaper-this-prime-day-2000632506</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-the-iphone%E2%80%AF17-amazon-is-offloading-the-new-pixel%E2%80%AF10-for-2x-cheaper-this-prime-day.1318492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The new Google Pixel 10 just landed, and if you’ve been eyeing a phone that can keep up with your daily chaos while delivering pro-level photos without the pro-level hassle, this deal is hard to ignore. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/">just dropped the price of the 128GB model to $649 for Prime members, down from $799</a>. That’s a rare discount on a flagship device that literally came out weeks ago and is already going toe-to-toe with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Pixel 10 is Different</h2>
<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Actua display is a major strength</strong>: With a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, you actually get to see what’s on your display when you’re outdoors under direct sunlight, no longer squinting or covering the phone with your hand to view a text message. The display is covered by Corning’s scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the phone boasts an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>The camera system is where Google shows off: That improved triple rear camera array now boasts a 5x telephoto lens, driving its Super Res Zoom to a whopping 20x, so you can snap clear, sharp shots of your child’s soccer goal from across the sideline, for example, or of that street musician across the courtyard without your picture ending up a grainy mess. Night Sight, meanwhile, still wows by delivering clean, clear images even when lighting is awful, say, indoors at a poorly lit restaurant or after a sunset walk. A new feature called <em>Camera Coach</em> also provides real-time advice to assist with nailing your composition and exposures so it’s not a guessing game of being on manual mode nor pure auto mode.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life sits at 24-plus hours</strong> on a single charge with fast-charging support, so you’re not tethered to an outlet by mid-afternoon. This is an unlocked Android phone, giving you full freedom to switch carriers whenever you want and choose your own data plan. It works seamlessly with Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and other major carriers, so you’re not locked into one ecosystem or stuck with a device that only plays nice with a single network.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini AI integration is where the Pixel 10 moves ahead of the pack</strong>. Instead of having to type out every question or task, you’re free to speak naturally via Gemini Live. Point your camera at something interesting, like an unknown plant on a hike or a sea creature at the aquarium, and Gemini will identify it and give you context. You’re also free to chat with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, compose an email, schedule your day, or have things done across multiple apps without having to manually switch between each one. It’s an assistant kind of feature that is useful as opposed to gimmicky.</p>
<p>This obsidian version of the 128GB model is just offered at this market for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and as new as the Pixel 10 is, a discount like this is rare. Make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-is-offloading-the-delta-2-amazon-lists-the-1800w-power-station-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000632497</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-is-offloading-the-delta%E2%80%AF2-amazon-lists-the-1800w-power-station-at-its-lowest-price-ever.1318486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages don’t send you a warning text before they strike and the last thing you want is to be scrambling in the dark wondering how long your fridge will stay cold or how you’ll charge your phone. That’s exactly why portable power stations have become essential backup gear for people who want peace of mind during emergencies, camping trips or off-grid adventures.</p>
<p>EcoFlow initially kicked off Prime Day with their Delta 2 priced at $449 for this 1800W portable power station, but then Jackery dropped their 1500W model to $349. EcoFlow responded by matching that price, even though their unit delivers more power. Right now, exclusively for Prime members during Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">you can grab this EcoFlow Delta 2 beast for $349, down from its original $699 price tag</a>. This<strong> marks an all-time low for an 1800W portable power station</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lightning-Charge That Outpaces Other Brands</h2>
<p>The <strong>1800W continuous output</strong> is where things get really practical: This power station is capable of powering your fridge, microwave, coffee maker, portable air conditioner, power tools and just about any household appliance you’d want to run during an outage. With <strong>15 varying outlets built across the unit</strong>, you don’t have to worry about running multiple devices simultaneously by playing musical chairs with your electronics. There are six AC outlets for standard plugs, two 100W USB-C for laptops and tablets to be quickly charged, several USB-A for phones and smaller devices and DC outlets for your 12V devices.</p>



<p>The <strong>capacity sits at 1024Wh thanks to a LiFePO4 battery</strong>&nbsp;which is chemistry shorthand for lithium iron phosphate. This battery type is tougher and safer than standard lithium-ion batteries you find in cheaper units. More importantly, it <strong>can handle over 3000 charge cycles</strong> before capacity starts dropping, which translates to roughly six times longer lifespan than older battery technology. You could charge and drain this thing once per week for over 50 years before hitting that 3000-cycle mark.</p>
<p>The game-changer here is the charging speed: The Delta 2 goes <strong>from</strong> <strong>completely dead to 80% charged in just 50 minutes</strong> using a standard wall outlet, and hits 100% in 80 minutes. That’s seven times faster than most portable power stations on the market. This rapid charging capability means you can quickly juice up before heading out on a weekend camping trip or get your backup power ready in a hurry when storm warnings hit your area.</p>



<p>What sweetens the pot even more is expandable capacity: The base unit offers 1kWh of storage, but additional battery packs can be added to triple it to 3kWh. The modular configuration means you start small but expand your system as needed, ideal for serious RV owners or individuals outfitting off-grid systems. The ability to charge by solar adds even more independence. The Delta 2 takes a whopping 500W of solar panel (sold separately) input so it stays topped off during longer camping forays or serve as a truly renewable backup at home.</p>
<p>For $349, you’re getting a high-end 1800W portable power unit for less money than many companies are asking for their mid-range 1000W models. Make sure you don’t miss that Prime Day deal.</p>

<p>Better late than never</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>More than five years after its initial console release, the retro FPS title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ion_fury">Ion Fury</a> is finally getting its DLC expansion later this month.</p>
<p>Titled <strong>Ion Fury: Aftershock</strong>, the expansion was originally launched in October 2023 for PC, so it's been pretty much two whole years of waiting for console owners to receive the same treatment. Heck, a full sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phantom_fury">Phantom Fury</a>, has even launched in the interim.</p>

<p>Better late than never though, right? Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Uncharted Territories, Higher Stakes:</strong> Ignite the Fury with a gripping new campaign. Traverse 15 freshly-designed levels teeming with lurking adversaries.<br>
<strong><br>
Fresh Faces of Evil:</strong> Heskel’s been busy. Meet his new lineup of augmented monstrosities itching for a fight.<br>
<strong><br>
Packing More Heat:</strong> Enhance your firepower with new weapons and tools.<br>
<strong><br>
Push Your Limits:</strong> Challenge your skills with the grueling new Angel of Death difficulty level.<br>
<strong><br>
Ride On:</strong> Find out what a rotorcycle is and engage in white-knuckle vehicular combat.<br>
<strong><br>
Old, Yet New:</strong> Immerse yourself in Arrange mode for a fresh new take on all 28 levels from the original 2019 campaign, featuring new areas, new enemy encounters, and more.<br>
<strong><br>
Packed With Content:</strong> Engage in a total of 43 additional levels of sheer mayhem. See Ion Fury through a whole new lens.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Our review for Ion Fury back in 2020 described it as the "time-travelling love letter from the past you’ve been waiting for", praising its challenging combat and intricately designed levels, but noting that the boss battles were uninspired, ultimately awarding it a score of 7/10.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-15m-players</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-to-play-skate-reboot-racks-up-15m-players-in-under-a-month.1318453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that its&nbsp;free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot has hit a major player count milestone less than a month after launching across PC and consoles in Early Access.</p>

<p><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-early-access-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">back in mid-September</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1975229570807890000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a> by the game's development team, it's managed to attract 15 million players since that time. That figure naturally includes all of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is available, but EA doesn't say which of those is most popular, sadly.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that, as with any "player number"-style announcements, this isn't a sales figure; since&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is free at the point of entry, players can just jump in for ten minutes, decide they've had enough, and check out, and EA would still presumably count those players as part of the 15 million figure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-reboot-15m-players-diving.jpg?itok=d_TpdO-F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-reboot-15m-players-diving.jpg?itok=PuL1YWWX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>appears to be pretty popular, if its player count is anything to go by.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it is fair to say that&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>appears to be scratching an itch that hasn't been scratched for a long time. At time of writing, the game has around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3354750/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">23,000 active players</a> on Steam, with a 24-hour high of about 57,000. Clearly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">the fact you can't play</a>&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>offline isn't turning people off.</p>

<p>As EA points out in the aforementioned social media post,&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is about to embark on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-season-1-new-stuff" rel="nofollow">first post-launch season</a>, which will introduce new seasonal events and challenges to the game, as well as a raft of new cosmetics to unlock.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, it's the latest game in EA's&nbsp;skateboarding series of the same name. Unlike its predecessors, the latest&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>isn't a boxed premium product; it's a free-to-play experience with all of the usual trappings, so you can expect battle passes, cosmetic unlocks, and microtransactions galore.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in EA-related news, it was recently revealed that the veteran publisher is being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">purchased by a consortium of different firms</a>, among them the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund and a company owned by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/skate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and if you want to know what we thought of it, you can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skate-is-return-to-form-but-will-audience-be-there-to-support-it" rel="nofollow">preview right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-brings-new-story-and-more-next-month.1318450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed the Valley of Memory update for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, and it's bringing a ton of new story and gameplay stuff next month.</p>

<p>The update, which will be arriving across all platforms on November 18th, was revealed during a livestream in which Ubisoft delved deep into what we can expect from it. You can expect a brand new region to explore, new side quests and contracts, and lots more.</p>

<p>Valley of Memory will take place just before the main game's finale, and it revolves around Basim learning that his father may still be alive in the valley of AlUla, upon which he sets out to discover whether there's any truth to that rumor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-swinging.jpg?itok=v3OLauJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-swinging.jpg?itok=AjzIo3mA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>'s free Valley of Memory update should give you plenty of reason to revisit it next month.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you can expect a brand new series of main missions in Valley of Memory, as well as new assassination targets to take down. Ubisoft is also promising parkour challenges that will reward you with music sheets, allowing Basim to play the songs he's discovered on the oud.</p>

<p>Rather excitingly, the studio is also teasing "a unique twist on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s classic black box missions" in Valley of Memory. Given that&nbsp;<em>Mirage&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-reveals-return-to-roots-trailer-featuring-gameplay-developer" rel="nofollow">originally touted</a> as a return to old-school&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>, that's particularly tantalizing for me.</p>

<p>Valley of Memory will also bring a number of enhancements to the base game, including new parkour moves, replayable missions, and new skill and tool customization options, among other things.</p>

<p>While Ubisoft hasn't publicly confirmed this, it's very likely that Valley of Memory is the DLC that was first mooted back in January, when it was also suggested that the Saudi PIF (which is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">one of the firms</a> chipping in to buy EA) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">would fund the update</a>.</p>




<p>In any case, the Valley of Memory update for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>will launch on November 18th for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, and you can play the game on all of those platforms right now as well. Be sure to give our Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back" rel="nofollow">review a read</a> if you want to remind yourself what he thought of the game!</p>

              <p>When you’re upgrading your storage, you also need to take care of speed and reliability. You don’t just want to add more space; you want something that doesn’t slow you down even when dealing with heavier files. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">The Samsung 990 Evo Pro SSD does a great job at that, and the 1TB model can be yours for less this Prime Day.</a></p>
<p>We’ve often seen it go for $70 – a $35 discount – but, right now, it’s dropped even further to just $60 on Amazon, marking a steep 43% off. This is one of the best prices we’ve ever seen on this drive, and it’s available for both Prime and non-Prime members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Capacity, Exceptional Speeds</h2>
<p>The 1TB capacity is more than enough to store all your essentials and then some. Think a ton of high-resolution photos, all your favorite videos, a bunch of movies, and even a few TV series to watch on the go when you don’t have a stable internet connection. There’s also a 2TB and 4TB version of this drive available, but we think the 1TB capacity should be enough for most work professionals and creatives out there.</p>
<p>Speed-wise, you’re looking at up to 7,250 MB/s read and 6,300 MB/s write speeds – ideal for large files and heavier apps. You can expect instant boot times and ultra-fast transfers that keep you productive without any slowdowns. Even the basic day-to-day tasks get a significant boost!</p>



<p>The SSD supports PCIe Gen 4×4, with forward compatibility for Gen 5×2, so it’s going to support all your future upgrades just as well. Magician Software keeps everything optimized and up-to-date, plus you will enjoy features like drive health monitoring and extra encryption in one place. And even with all this, you really don’t have to worry about overheating and battery life. There’s an efficiency-boosting nickel-coated controller that ensures it uses less power while still delivering excellent performance under pressure.</p>
<p>Installation is pretty straightforward. Just pop it into any compatible M.2 2280 slot, and you’re good to go. All in all, this is an efficient upgrade that gets you both solid storage and exceptional speeds.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/"> This Prime Day makes it possible to grab it for just $60, down from $105. For more capacity, you can consider getting the 2TB or the 4TB version.</a> Just note that the discount is only around for a short time, so it’s better to hurry.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-curvx-with-22000-pa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-2000632479</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-curvx-with-22-000%E2%80%AFpa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock.1318438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums promise to handle your cleaning chores automatically but most fall short in frustrating ways. They get stuck on furniture, miss obvious dirt patches, tangle on cables or require constant babysitting that defeats their entire purpose. The <strong>Roborock Qrevo CurvX</strong> sits comfortably in our top three favorite robot vacuums because it actually delivers on the promise of true hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, the standard $1,499 price tag is steep but this is one of the rare models that really replaces you rather than just assisting. It cleans to perfection, navigates your home intelligently and handles the messiest scenarios without complaint or intervention. Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/">Prime members on Amazon can grab it for $899, down from that $1,499 list price</a>. This <strong>40 percent discount</strong> represents an all-time low and makes premium robotic cleaning accessible at a price point where the investment actually makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Qrevo CurvX Addresses Day-to-Day Cleaning Needs</h2>
<p>The <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction is among the strongest available in a robot vacuum</strong>, and it directly equates to cleaning performance you can see. Pet hair and debris trapped deep down in carpet fibers are cleaned thoroughly instead of being surface-swept. Areas of floor and grout lines where dirt tends to build up aren’t glossed over.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dual Anti-Tangle system</strong> of Roborock eliminates one of the leading failure modes of robot vacuums. Pet fur and human hair as long as 40 centimeters are dealt with by the system not wrapping around the brush roller and forming a knotted mess, which causes a halt to the vacuum mid-cycle. It is a huge issue if your family members are long-haired or if your pets shed, as other robot vacuums must be continually manually corrected by cutting hair off of the brush by hand.</p>



<p>Coming in at a mere 7.98 centimeters / 3.14 inches in height, <strong>the Qrevo CurvX is also the thinnest Roborock model yet</strong>. Its ultra-low profile gives it a way to slide under couches, beds, and cupboards where dust bunnies are a fact of life and regular vacuums are unable to reach.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift Chassis represents genuine innovation in robot vacuum design. Roborock pioneered this technology as the first manufacturer to mass-produce a robot vacuum with a liftable chassis system featuring three-wheel control, launching in Q3 2024. The<strong> chassis can lift up to 4 centimeters to clear high thresholds between rooms</strong> or it can adjust individual sections independently to navigate around furniture legs and uneven surfaces.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle detection employs structured light sensors and an RGB camera for <strong>detecting and evading 108 types of objects</strong>. It can work during bright sunlight and complete darkness, its sensors navigating it to safely navigate around objects such as shoes, cords, pet toys, etc., without your pre-cleaning your floors.</p>
<p>The <strong>mopping function uses 80°C warm water to clean its own mop pads</strong> and looses grease and embedded dirt deposited by cold water. It keeps your mop clean and actually cleans your floors rather than spreading dirty water. The Thermo+, <strong>Multifunction Dock 3.0 does it all for zero cost</strong>, automatically: cleaning your mop with warm water, drying off at 113°F to prevent mildew, emptying your dustbin, refilling your water tank, and even cleaning itself with warm water.</p>
<p>At $899 for Prime members, the Qrevo CurvX really provides professional-grade auto cleaning. It’s definitely one of our favorite ones.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here it is, folks. Prime Big Deals Day is upon us finally. October 7 and October 8, you can save big across almost every product category on Amazon. The giant online retailer has sales on PC gaming parts, Bluetooth speakers, and even cameras. The DJI Osmo Action 4 has three different bundles which are each seeing sales. Right now, you can save as much as 23%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Let’s break down each bundle. The essential combo is the most barebones of the three. It includes the Osmo action 4 camera alongside a horizontal-vertical protective frame, a locking screw, lens hood, battery, quick release adapter mount, anti-slip pad, and a USB-C cable for charging and data transfer. This essential combo is usually $289, but has come down to $219 for the sale.</p>

<p>Next we have the standard combo. This includes everything you get with the essential set plus an adhesive curved base mount to pair with the quick release adapter mount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">This set was $299, but has dropped to just $229.</a></p>
<p>Lastly, the adventure combo features all of that and you also get two more batteries so you always have a charged spare at the ready, a multi-functional battery case, a 1.5-meter extension rod or selfie stick as they are colloquially known, and a extra quick-release adapter mount except this one is mini. Normally priced at $399, the adventure combo is now down to just $327.</p>



<h2>Why DJI?</h2>
<p>GoPro is no longer the only name in the action camera business.&nbsp;The DJI Osmo Action 4 produces premium image quality with low-light clarity thanks to the 1/1.3-inch sensor. Capture every detail from dawn to dusk in stunning 4K resolution at 120 frames per second. The high framerate means you can render slow-motion shots without losing detail.</p>
<p>The ultrawide FOV keeps every bit of action in view whether you’re rushing down the side of a mountain on a snowboard or riding waved on water skis. The DJI Osmo Action 4 employs three different stabilization modes to ensure steady footage across rugged terrains of all kind. HorzionSteady is a DJI feature which keeps the horizon of your shots flat and level at all times.</p>
<p>The frame that comes with each of the bundles has a magnetic quick-release. The camera can be shot either in portrait or landscape so you can swap easily on the fly between the two while shooting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">If you’re looking for a big opportunity to save of some cool gadget to take on your next trip, consider saving yourself up to $72 on the DJI Osmo 4 action camera.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-is-quietly-offloading-its-mini-4k-drones-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-price-on-amazon-2000632469</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-is-quietly-offloading-its-mini-4k-drones-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-price-on-amazon.1318429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Getting into aerial photography used to mean dealing with FAA registration paperwork, fees and regulatory headaches. DJI changed that equation with the Mini series, and the Mini 4K sits right at 249 grams, j<strong>ust under the 250-gram threshold that triggers FAA registration requirements</strong> for recreational use in the United States. This weight advantage has made it one of DJI’s best-selling drones, and gives casual users the freedom to fly without bureaucratic barriers.</p>
<p>Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/">can snag this drone for an unprecedented $239, down from its usual $299 price</a>. This is<strong> an all-time low for a drone that shoots genuine 4K Ultra HD video</strong> with professional stabilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Results in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD camera captures video at 3840 x 2160 resolution</strong> which means you’re getting four times the detail of standard 1080p footage. This resolution matters when you want to crop or zoom into your footage during editing without losing quality, or when you’re capturing landscapes where fine details like distant mountains or intricate coastlines make the shot. The camera performs across different lighting conditions and handles everything from <strong>golden hour sunrises to moody sunset scenes</strong> and even challenging night environments.</p>
<p>What differentiates the Mini 4K from cheaper drones is its <strong>mechanical 3-axis gimbal stabilization</strong>. While electronic image stabilization on a lot of budget-priced drones crops into the scene and still shows jitter, a mechanical gimbal truly compensates for motion by physically balancing it on three axes: tilt, roll, and pan. That guarantees your video stays smooth even when your drone encounters a puff of wind or a sharp directional change.</p>



<p>Flight performance is formidable with<strong> Level 5 wind resistance, i.e., wind speeds of up to 38 kilometers per hour</strong> (around 24 miles per hour). Brushless motors provide the horsepower needed for stable flight at these speeds, and they are also more efficient and longer-lasting than the brushed motors found in toy-grade quadcopters. The same motors enable the Mini 4K to <strong>lift off at altitudes of up to 4,000 meters (around 13,100 feet)</strong> which opens mountain and high-altitude shooting potentia.</p>
<p><strong>10-kilometer video transmission distance</strong> gives you tremendous mobility to roam about and position shots. For all intents and purposes, you rarely take advantage of this limit due to line-of-sight limitations and battery life yet having that longer distance as a minimum guarantee ensures your operator gets a rock-solid connection with no dropouts or pixelation even if flying a few kilometers off.</p>



<p>Battery life provides <strong>31 minutes of best-in-class flight time</strong> per single supplied battery, although real-world flying with camera recording usually enabled normally produces about 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Safety features make Mini 4K accessible to total newcomers. <strong>GPS Return to Home returns the drone to its starting point if it runs low on battery</strong>, loses signal, or if you initiate a return yourself. One-tap takeoff/landing eliminates stress of manual throttle management during most critical flight stages.</p>
<p>Coming in at $239 for Prime members during Prime Day, the DJI Mini 4K offers true 4K quality, mechanical stabilization and intelligent modes at a price low enough to make aerial creativity accessible. It slashes its drone to an all-time-low during this Prime Big Deal Days sale, and it’s a great way to start your journey into aerial photography.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It feels like absolutely ages ago that I first reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst">The Touryst</a> on Switch, and returning to it so far down the line, and on the Switch 2 no less, I've been excited to see just how it's held up in the six years since I last took a vacation. Seriously, though.</p>
<p>I was bowled over back in the day, giving Shin'en's adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/touryst">a whopping great 9/10</a>. I loved its voxel graphics and oh-so-lovely controls, its clever puzzles and breezy, beautiful vibes. It's all about the tiny details in this one and, in much the same way as the remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a> — also 2019 — the devs (as usual with Shin'en) have got another real looker out of Nintendo's console, with each of the islands you visit presented as gorgeous bespoke miniatures of the likes of Ibiza, with its beach parties, or an idyllic Greek island replete with rooftops to clamber across. Half the fun here really is in just gawping at everything.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:94016 @ 1759842540 -->
<p>There's barely any story to speak of, which perhaps is the game's one drawback (although I'm all for the "let's get down to business" approach sometimes). Each island contains a secret TOWA tower you'll need to uncover and unlock, before heading inside to complete a conundrum or two and obtain a magic core. Collect all cores and deliver them to win the day. As you go, you're entertained by minigames and silly side missions. The Touryst delivers all the good things, without laborious cutscenes or unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>All of this is presented not just in a wonderfully stylish way but in an eminently playable one, too. Your tourist avatar is a capable fellow, despite appearances, with a steady stream of new moves to unlock from the hub island's surf shop. He feels perfect to control as he wobbles carefully and/or speed boosts around locations, and each of the dinky dungeons is so painstakingly crafted that you can't help but be drawn in. Yes, I'm enjoying it all over again.</p>
<p>For this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">Deluxe</a> Switch 2 update, you get an excellent new island to mess on (no spoilers from moi), so more side missions and a whole new tower to explore. It also can't be underestimated how much nicer it looks and plays. No jaggy edges, pristine performance and resolution, and they've added ambient occlusion, improved rain effects, global illumination, and all that fancy stuff. More exciting, though, is the new Fast Zero arcade machine in the game's arcade (a little tribute to Shin'en's excellent anti-grav racers), which you're gonna love.</p>
<p>So, The Touryst: Deluxe gives us Shin'en's excellent 2019 adventure, plus a new island, fun new minigames and missions, and a new arcade game that may well be worth the price of entry alone. With snazzy Switch 2 graphical effects and super smooth performance, it's perfect if you've yet to play it. And with a reduced price point for seasoned travellers — returning players are presented with a 75% discount on the eShop — this is a return trip that's very hard to knock.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-touryst-deluxe]]></content:encoded>

            <p>****, we didn't mean for that to happen. This has been the response from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> developers Activision to folks spotting that you couldn't type the name of fellow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> into the chat of the game's beta without it being censored. Yep, you could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders">reportedly</a> get away with Arc or Raiders, but stick the two together, and it was off to the starred-out naughty corner.</p>
<p>Naturally, folks wondered why this was a thing, especially since you could chat about more obvious Black Ops 7 competitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> to your heart's content without facing any star-based repercussions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/activision-angles-for-the-most-petty-corporation-prize-by-censoring-the-name-arc-raiders-in-black-ops-7s-lobbies/">Penguin Choir Gamer</a>, a text filter error was to blame according to Activision. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/">Insider Gaming</a> report having been offered more specifics regarding the nature of the error, with Activision saying it was down the word 'Arc' being listed as an alternative for a naughty word, and pairing it with 'Raiders' caused the moderation system to flag up an inappropriate phrase.</p>
<p>It seems strange that if 'Arc' was the root of the issue, you'd only be pinged upon adding the seemingly innocuous 'Raiders', but hey, text filters can be weird sometimes. A quick stealth patch has since been issued and it's now possible to type out Arc Raiders' name. It's also worth noting that the EA had to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">resolve a similar Arc Raiders name censorship issue with their app earlier this year</a>, so it very much looks like this is just a standard text moderation quirk.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>At least Arc Raiders devs Embark Studios have been able to have a bit of fun with the free publicity they've gotten out of the misbehaving filters.</p>
<p>Even if this had been down to shooter publishers cheekily blocking out competitors' names from their games' chats, that'd probably rank relatively low on the outrage scale for me. An inconvenience perhaps if you're talking to mates and comparing two shooters while playing, but there's plenty of third-party chatting software that'd seem a more practical forum for such discussions anyway. Or maybe I just need to get better so I can comfortably type out 'I see your point esteemed colleague, but I feel the recoil of [insert game]'s guns is exactly three per cent more satisfying' in between headshots.</p><p>You could also discuss the ups and downs of ***** *** *, *********** *, and *** ******* in the RPS comments section instead. The former's beta has just been extended to run until October 9th, if you weren't already aware.</p>

This has made Haunted Chocolatier highly anticipated, although little information about the game has been shared, beyond making it clear that it's a game where you move to a new town and take over a chocolate shop.

featuring music from the game, but no additional gameplay. The trailer briefly shows a snowy mountain, with a bakery and other buildings, including your chocolate shop. From the chocolate shop, the player jumps into a portal, which takes them to a combat dungeon, which shows more in-depth combat mechanics. That portal is also where you gather chocolate ingredients, which can be used back at the chocolate shop to make products to sell in the store.</p><p dir="ltr">Shop customization is shown after that, with shelves for products and decorations. This is also where the Haunted part of the name comes in, with a bunch of ghosts running the chocolate store for you. The final section of the trailer shows a quick handful of interactions with different NPCs living in the town, with gift giving as well, likely containing a relationship system similar to Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_platforms">Haunted Chocolatier platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Currently, Haunted Chocolatier has only been announced for PC, but ConcernedApe mentioned in the game's <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/faq/" rel="nofollow ">FAQ </a>that he intends to bring it to other major platforms. Stardew Valley was initially only available on PC, but was later ported to nearly every modern platform, including all consoles and mobile.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Story__Setting__and_Characters">Haunted Chocolatier Story, Setting, and Characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580854" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580854"></a><figcaption>In Haunted Chocolatier has you leave the big city to run a chocolate shop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg"></figure><p>As part of ConcernedApe wanting to take his time making Haunted Chocolatier, he has kept many of the details about what exactly Haunted Chocolatier is close to his chest. That said, the basic premise has been revealed--you'll take on the role of running a chocolate shop with some spooky help.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few named characters shown in the announcement trailer, like Burk the blacksmith and a woman named Maddie. The name of the town hasn't been revealed, nor has the reason for your character taking over the chocolate factory, but a brief conversation about the big city in the trailer suggests at least a similar character background to the farmer in Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Gameplay">Haunted Chocolatier Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580856" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580856"></a><figcaption>Making chocolate will be one of the primary focuses of Haunted Chocolatier.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg"></figure><p>As the name suggests, the main gameplay loop will revolve around gathering ingredients, making chocolate, and selling chocolate. In the <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2021/10/08/hello-world/" rel="nofollow ">announcement blog</a>, this was the only gameplay mechanic highlighted, although it was implied to share gameplay elements with Stardew Valley, like having a cast of NPCs to befriend and possibly romance. While details are still fairly light, ConcernedApe has provided some details regarding combat and chocolate making.</p><p dir="ltr">Two additional blog posts provide more details on the gameplay. First is a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/05/10/intuitive-chocolate-making/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> about "Intuitive" chocolate making, where ConcernedApe vaguely describes that the chocolate making gameplay loop will have multiple ways to progress and make chocolate, some more systems based and others based on "intuitive" chocolate making. The second <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2021/10/30/combat-shields-stuns-my-approach/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> is focused on combat, specifically highlighting a shield system that allows you to stun enemies, rewarding a defensive play-style and showing that the Haunted Chocolatier combat system will have more depth than Stardew Valley's.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Development_News">Haunted Chocolatier Development News</h2><p dir="ltr">It has been about four years since the original announcement of Haunted Chocolatier, and aside from a couple of blog posts talking about specific aspects of the game, ConcernedApe has not commented on how the game is progressing in specific detail. The most recent <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/09/02/on-the-recent-stardew-valley-1-7-update-announcement/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> on the Haunted Chocolatier website from September 2, 2025, mentions that while a Stardew Valley 1.7 update is in the works, ConcernedApe himself is focused on Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog states that Haunted Chocolatier will release eventually, and that it could even release before Stardew Valley 1.7, but that nothing is set in stone. ConcernedApe did reiterate multiple times that he is working on Haunted Chocolatier entirely solo, and that there is no release window being targeted just yet.</p>

                <p>Battlefield veteran David Goldfarb's studio, The Outsiders, is closing down, but Goldfarb and the team are "not giving up."</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1975200395128610955" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Goldfarb said The Outsider is shutting up shop as part of wider cuts at studio owner Funcom. The Outsiders, which was founded in 2015, had a close call at closing up shop when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darkborn-the-monster-game-from-battlefield-and-pay/1100-6476722/" data-ref-id="1100-6476722">the studio's other game, Darkborn, was canceled in 2020</a>, Goldfarb said. After that game didn't make it, Funcom took a majority ownership of The Outsiders. The studio then released the rhythm-action game Metal: Hellsinger in 2022.</p><p>"It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen," Goldfarb said.</p><p>Goldfarb said The Outsiders had plans to make something "even better" in the future, but "things don't always go the way you hope."</p><p>That being said, Goldfarb said, "We are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting."</p><p>The Outsiders had around 60 employees at the Stockholm office, <a href="https://www.funcom.com/funcom-stockholm/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Funcom.</a> The company recently announced that this year's Dune: Awakening was its biggest release in the company's 32-year history, but despite that, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the publisher slashed a number of jobs.</a></p><p>Goldfarb is known for his work on the Battlefield franchise from when he worked at DICE. He left in 2012 to join Overkill Software as the game director for the beloved Payday 2 before leaving to establish The Outsiders in 2015.</p>

			<p>In addition to the 23 versatile Jobs available for every unit, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles features 12 unique characters, each with a powerful, exclusive Job Command. Here is our tier list for these special units, highlighting which characters are essential to create a party that can deal with all sorts of enemies.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note: This Job Tier list is based on Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty, with rankings determined by each unit’s utility at the time of joining and in the endgame, growth potential, and skill set synergy with Jobs other than their unique main Job. The ranking is largely applicable to other difficulty settings and Classic Mode. Screenshots were captured from the 1.0 Steam release.</strong></em></p>

<h3 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cidolfus Orlandeau is the best character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cidolfus Orlandeau</strong> - The Sword Saint has always been considered as the best character in the game since the original, and this holds in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles as well, despite some damage nerfs. His starting weapon, the Knight Sword Excalibur, and his Swordplay Job giving him access to Physical Attack-based ranged AOE, ranged equipment breaking, and self-healing, make him an absolute powerhouse that lets him solo entire maps and break the game's difficulty <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Ramza Beoulve</strong> - The main protagonist of Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not as broken as Orlandeau, but is still an extremely capable character thanks to the his unique Mettle command that gives him access to some powerful support abilities like Tailwind, Steel, and Shout, which increases his Bravery, Physical Attack, Magic Attack, and Speed. His Squire Job, which becomes Gallant Knight in Chapter 4, also provides him with some great equipment options, and the great PA and MA growth make him a highly versatile, customizable character who can deal with any foe in the game. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 1)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Agrias Oaks joins early in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, and remains a great character until the end of the game</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Agrias Oaks</strong> - The Holy Knight protector of Princess Ovelia is the first powerhouse to join Ramza in his quest, and she stays very useful until the end of the game thanks to her versatility. Her Holy Sword Job Command gives her access to useful Physical Attack-based AOE attacks that can also cause status ailments, while her relatively high Magical Attack can be taken advantage of to give her better support capabilities with the White Magic Job Command. Her lower Physical Attack, however, requires some investment to bring it closer to Orlandeau's or Ramza's. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 2)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Beowulf Cadmus </strong>- The Templar is among the most divisive special characters in the game, but his utility far outweighs his shortcomings. Although his starting Bravery is low and his Physical Attack is not great, the Spellblade Job Command gives him access to status ailment-inducing skills that require no charge time, outclassing the Mystic Job significantly and giving him the potential to take down enemies with a single hit via the Break skill. By increasing his Magic Attack, the Spellblade abilities also gain increased hit chance, making Beowulf even more useful in a variety of situations.   <em>(</em><em>Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>)</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Reis Dular </strong>- While her special Job, Dragonkin, provides situational yet solid utility with ranged attack and support most of the time, her HP, Physical Attack, and Magic Attack growth, and her high starting Bravery and Faith stats make for a versatile character that can make every generic Job shine, regardless of whether PA or MA oriented.                                                                                                                                                       <em></em><em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>. Her human form is unlocked after completing a sidequest available after winning the battle in Zeltennia)</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Meliadoul Tingel</strong> - The Divine Knight is a solid Physical Attack-oriented character who can break enemy equipment from range with her Unyielding Blade abilities. Although her usability has been improved in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles over the original by making these abilities deal damage against monsters, Meliadoul is the last special character to join Ramza, and with her limited versatility, she requires more investment than the best characters in the game to shine. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though his damage output falls off in the late game, Mustadio Bunanza remains a great utility character throughout Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rapha Galthena</strong> - The Skyseer comes with one of the most unique Job Commands in the game, Sky Mantra, which gives her access to powerful elemental spells that do not require MP, scale with Magic Attack, and ignore her Faith, which can deal very high damage multiple times. Unfortunately, these spells randomly hit their AOE, making them unreliable, even with the increased hit chance at the center tile of the AOE improvement. Still, her high Magic Attack growth and her high starting Faith make her an excellent mage with some time investment. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mustadio Bunanza</strong> - The Machinist is the first special character to join Ramza, and his utility stays high for the entirety of the game, thanks to his weapon of choice, Guns, and the Aimed Shot Job Command that can Disable and Immobilize enemies, and turn undead to stone. While his damage heavily falls off later on, requiring the rare elemental guns to keep up with the output of other characters, his utility does not, making him a solid choice for some battles where preventing enemies from acting is more important than dealing damage. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 2)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><span><strong>Byblos</strong>&nbsp;- The unique demon character who joins Ramza out of nowhere after clearing the game's optional endgame dungeon, Midlight's Deep, is a strong monster character with excellent</span> stats and versatile skills that make it useful in various<span> situations.</span> However, being unable to change its equipment and its Job, and its late joining when the game is essentially over impacts its utility considerably, as its only real use is in random battles and the game's final gauntlet of battles. <em>(Recruited after completing Midlight's Deep in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-c-tier">C Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cloud Strife requires a lot of investment to be a good character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Strife </strong>- The stranded Final Fantasy VII protagonist has his Limit Break attacks as his Soldier Job Command, but even starting with the Materia Blade required to use them, the enhanced Materia Blade+ obtainable with the Treasure Hunter ability at the highest point of the Mount Bervenia map, and the reduced charge time are not enough to make him as strong as other special characters in the game. Still, he can hold his own with some skills, like the Time Mage's Swiftness to speed up his abilities' charge time, but as he joins quite late, the time investment will not be worth it for most players. <em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available after winning the battle in Zeltennia in Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Construct 8</strong> - The Steel Giant is a real powerhouse under the right conditions. Its high Physical Attack makes its skillset extremely powerful, and its immunity to status ailments is a welcome bonus. However, his inability to enter water severely limits his mobility on most maps, and being unable to change gear or Job severely hinders its versatility, making it an extremely situational character. <em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-d-tier">D Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Encumbered by how the mechanics powering his Nether Mantra skills, Marach Galthena is the worst special character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marach Galthena</strong> - On paper, the Netherseer has the potential of being as powerful as his sister Rapha, but in reality, he leaves a lot to be desired. His Nether Mantra skills, which work like Rapha's Sky Mantra, are more effective the lower his Faith his, but this makes it impossible to build him as an effective mage. Marach's base Job does not have great HP and Physical Attack,  so he needs a complete Job change into a Physical Attack-based class to be somewhat useful and take limited advantage of his Nether Mantra unique Job Command. This time investment for a character that essentially ends up being little more than a generic unit makes Marach the worst special character in the game. (<em>Recruited in Chapter 4</em>)</li>

            <p>
The factional asymmetry of Mars Tactics ain’t about Fish Himbos vs The Telepathic Hairdryer Folk of the Highlands. It gives you the bracingly topical choice of suits vs revolutionaries. In the blue corner, you’ve got the iron fist of Capital, who begin each campaign in a position of supremacy, but are beholden to the fatter cats on Earth for supplies. And in the red corner, you’ve got Labo(u)r, who kick off with little more than their chains, but are able to manufacture their own gear due to being honest working folk, and have higher morale due to being a bunch of zealous bolshies. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can tailor their differences further by means of governmental policies. Introducing Universal Basic Income, for instance, means you can deploy robot workers without riling up your fleshy dogsbodies quite as much. Fully automated luxury communism for all! Except you, Kevin - I'm sending you off on a doomed mission to reclaim that rocketpad from the fuzz. You can also found a police state, set up labour camps, and embrace neoliberalism, if you're feeling especially dystopic. More pragmatic research projects include fermentation: if ideology alone won’t carry the day, perhaps some liquid courage will do the job.

Between Capital and Labor sprawl the deserts of Mars: curiously cuboid, usefully deformable, and rich in building components. To claim the wargod’s favourite planet, you’ll need both a shrewd understanding of cover and a head for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>. You need to capture and defend resource hubs, build railways, and get hold of some jets for troop movement and airstrikes. You need sturdy offworld trade connections. You might want to hire a few mercenaries.
</p><p>
The battles are turn-based, and waged by squads of upgradeable, customisable troopers. They look a lot like XCOM, perhaps with a splash of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a>. You can suppress foes both to sabotage their aim and steal initiative from them. You can also gouge out trenches with explosives, call in artillery strikes from neighbouring regions, and toss unprimed grenades or spare magazines of ammo between friendlies. Foes can be captured, then interrogated for intel, then held for ransom. As for the guns, there’s a phat grid editor that includes a choice of scopes, stocks, calibers, and receivers.
</p>
<p>
It all seems very appealing, though I’m basing that assessment on trailers and snatches of press release – please qualify my enthusiasm appropriately. I am crossing my fingers for 1) a demo, and 2) a Total Recall-inspired endgame involving underground terraformers. Please, though, no boggle-eyed Arnie death scenes. The developers are Takibi Games, and the publishers are Hooded Horse, who have a good nose for this kind of thing. It’s out in early access in May 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week is Prime Big Deals Day. Despite the name, it’s actually two days. On both October 7 and October 8, you can save huge swaths of cash on a bunch of cool tech or home goods, and that included PC gaming accessories. If you’ve been on the hunt for a new gaming monitor, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">now might be the time to pull the Hall Effect trigger you have mapped to “Add to Cart.” Samsung’s curved Odyssey G5 gaming monitor has dropped in price by $100.</a> The 27-inch model is down from $300 to $200, while the 32-inch has gone from $330 to $230.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Go Curved?</h2>
<p>The way we perceive the world around us is not on a flat plain. Heck, we even describe it as the world around us, not in front of us. So when we simulate worlds through the games we play, why not aim for a more immersive experience? Monitors like this are awesome to play pretty much anything on but where they really shine is anything that’s first-person. When I initially got my curved monitor, first thing I played was the updated version of <em>Portal </em>with RTX and oh boy was that thing a beaut.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor comes in either a moderate 27-inch or large 32-inch screen, each with a curvature of 1000R to help fill your peripheral vision with the visuals from your game. Enjoy a better-than-HD resolution of 1440p which packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of 1080p HD displays. HDR10 allows for vibrant colors with deep blacks and luminous whites, portray a wide depth of color and brightness.</p>



<p>The screen has a refresh rate of 165Hz to help maintain smooth gameplay with fast frame rates and the 1ms response time will keep your character feeling snappy. Seriously. I’d been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> through Game Pass and my Xbox on a TV from 2017 then switched over recently to my PC and a similarly-specced monitor and wow what a difference. Input lag I had thought was just normally going completely away. I felt like I was cheating. It was just like that episode of <em>Samurai Jack</em> when Jack is training with the rocks strapped to his wrists and ankles. You know the one I’m talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">Elevate your game and save yourself a solid $100 during Amazon’s Prim Big Deals Day with this Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor,</a> currently going for an even $100 off during the sales event.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger already has plenty of content to sink your teeth into, but Bandai Namco isn’t holding back, and plenty more is on the cards to be added in upcoming DLC.</p>



<p>While it will take a while to gather all the Digimon in the game, particularly given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-digimon-story-time-stranger-digi-eggs-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digi-Eggs are required for some</a>, the list of Digimon will get even longer with upcoming content drops, which will also extend the main story of the game with new episodes.</p>



<p>If you’re mulling over which DLC to purchase, or want to know what’s included in the Season Pass, we’ve got all the important details.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-upcoming-digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-amp-release-windows">All Upcoming Digimon Story: Time Stranger DLC &amp; Release Windows</h2>



<figure><figcaption>DLC goodies. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Three Episode Packs are confirmed to be coming to Digimon Story: Time Stranger as DLC and in the season pass, though an exact release date has not been set.</strong></p>



<p>Available in the Season Pass, Episode Packs 1-3 will all be released in the next calendar year, with Bandai Namco confirming the content will drop before September 30, 2026.</p>



<p>At this stage, though, it’s unclear when exactly each Episode Pack will drop, and whether the DLC cycle will be extended beyond an additional year. </p>



<p>The table below lists all upcoming DLC, which we’ll update to include release dates as they are confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Several pieces of DLC are already available for Digimon Story: Time Stranger, many of which are included in the Ultimate Edition and Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>While the Episode Packs bring additional Digimon and new content, the other DLC currently available in the game are mostly just cosmetic options. However, there are some that provide in-game boosts with additional items and currency, acting as a head-start pack.</p>



<p>The table below shows all currently available DLC, the edition of the game it’s included in, and whether it’s available to purchase separately.</p>
