		<p>Wargaming’s new multiplayer mech game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a> is heading into Steam Early Access on 2nd April.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters - Early Access Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year</a>, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games with World of Tanks, World of Warships and more. This free-to-play mech hero shooter blends together battle royale and extraction shooter ideas, and Wargaming are hoping that early access will help them to quickly refine that blend, with the expectation that they will quickly get to a full release after gathering community feedback. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/steel-hunters-open-beta-brings-stompy-off-on-steam/">This will build on what they learnt from closed beta</a> periods held over the last few months.</p>
<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>
<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>

<p>Catch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/">our preview from December here</a>, or just jump into the game when it launches in April… or both!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/two-point-museum-two-point-at-its-best/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Two Point Museum</h5><p><span>4 March, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Two Point Studios</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/">sandbox games</a> that allowed you to manage large areas or populations. Whether it was Theme Hospital or SimCity 2000, a lot of time was spent playing those games. As someone who loves going to museums, big or small, I knew immediately that I had to play this game, and I'm so glad I did. Truly, you can't go wrong with any of the Two Point games, but Two Point Museum excels in areas that other sandbox titles do not. Between their first game and this new title, they have learned what makes a perfectly challenging, comedic, and relaxing experience all in one.</p>
<p>It's always a little bit daunting jumping into a new sandbox game, regardless of whether you've played the previous iterations in the franchise. There's a lot of information to take on board, as well as trying to remember all the different controls and mechanics that you will need to manage throughout. However, compared to previous Two Point games, Two Point Museum definitely feels the most user-friendly, and I didn't find it nearly as anxiety-inducing to actually get stuck in and start playing. The tutorials were thorough and helped explain every mechanic you'd need to manage, with the campaign taking you through everything you needed to know at a reasonable pace without things getting too chaotic from the outset.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_9e6cbc42294ab41d4ebd29f89ec8796220f92293.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While other sandbox games have tutorials and help you work around the basics, the campaign is a thorough tutorial experience that is relatively stress-free. It helps you learn the controls and basics of the game but also provides information on some of the metrics you'll need to keep an eye on. Compared to Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus, this new game feels incredibly accessible to those who are new to the sandbox or simulation genre and helps ease the player in gently rather than being plunged into the deep end. On top of that, even when you get into the deep end of the game, at no point did I feel like I was drowning or wouldn't be able to get myself out of trouble. Compared to games like Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster, which can be devastatingly punishing, Two Point holds your hand just enough to ensure you don't sink completely under.</p>
<p>I initially started my Two Point Museum experience on PC but found that I also enjoyed playing it on the Steam Deck after initially being daunted by the idea of using a controller for this style of game. However, the controller inputs are smoother and feel easier to work with compared to a mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>After playing Two Point Hospital, I didn't know how it would be possible to make the franchise even better. Still, Two Point Museum takes my love for museums and doubles it by adding the ability to create an aquarium with funky-looking fish and go on expeditions. To obtain artifacts, you have to send your Experts on expeditions, where they may get injured along the way. It makes every discovery exciting, as you never know whether you'll get a duplicate or something completely new from the map. However, duplicates don't go to waste, as you can deconstruct them to learn more about the exhibit, making it higher quality and adding perks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_18e9d7278ffdea6575ef296b3eb1e2ee0eed3b28.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, like any Two Point game, you have funny announcements over the intercom, which also helps to bring your attention to when the chopper returns to the helipad. It also notifies you of things that may slip past your attention, such as exhibits needing to be restored or staff members wanting a raise. From seeing Tails and Sonic walking around your museum as staff members to the dry humor that comes through over the intercom, it's a perfectly packaged game. It's incredibly well-polished, and much love and passion went into making this experience.</p>
<p>The expeditions system is a lot of fun to try and complete, especially when it comes to needing certain perks to ensure that you can even go on the expedition. It starts off relatively safe, with minimal risk, but ramps up soon enough, and you have to really put thought into who you want to send out. If they get injured, there is a very high risk that they will ask for a significant raise, or they will just up and leave. This can be a little bit stressful, especially since at this point, the Expert will be decently leveled up. Luckily, it feels that although it can have consequences, they are fixable consequences, and it doesn't feel like a damning punishment if you make a mistake.</p>
<p>The only issue I had with Two Point Museum was the explanation given for placing staff-only doors and other types of doors on partition walls. Partition walls are in the build section and are small ropes or glass half walls to keep members of the public out of areas. It's explained that you can put a door on these for whatever function you need it for. However, the doors aren't actually compatible with the partition walls, and the game actually means that you need to use the Museum Wall to add doors.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_fc3903f36c1c6cc278db1222a6a9f337edcb3ccc.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I loved the colors and styling of Two Point Museum, as it had a degree of vibrancy that the previous games didn't quite have. While the museums are tones of brown and beige, adding in pops of color through info boards and decorations helps to make the museum shine.</p>
<p>Although I now have multiple museums on the go, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer, and I can't wait to see what other weird and wacky exhibits I unearth on my expeditions.</p>
<p>I have yet to play Two Point Museum's sandbox mode, but considering how user-friendly the rest of the game has been, I expect that, if the campaign is any indication, it will be a good experience with building difficulty.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with Two Point Museum has been a dream. It is exactly everything I wanted from a brand-new Two Point game. I can't wait to see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what comes next</a> for this game and the franchise in general.</p>

						<section>
				<p>I loved every moment of this game, and didn't have a single issue throughout. There were no frame issues, the game was incredibly accessible and easy to dive into, and didn't have that overwhelming factor that a lot of new sandbox games do. It brings in moments of comedy to break up tense moments, and the campaign helps ease you in to the mechanics little by little.</p>

							<h6>Pros</h6>

With several <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successors in the works from former staff, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-lawsuit-woes-continue-as-fired-devs-double-down-on-claims-of-fraud-at-studio-zaum">controversy regarding the exits of key team members</a> behind the beloved RPG, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">an in-development expansion cancelled</a>, you might have been wondering what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zaum">Studio ZA/UM</a> will do next. Well, that answer is here. In a recent presentation held for the press, ZA/UM revealed a first look at their next game. It's called C4 and it's about espionage.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The presentation was led by Jim Ashilevi, the lead voice over director on Disco Elysium, and Siim "Kosmos" Sinamäe, a producer and writer for the RPG, who are both serving as writers on this new game. Right off the bat, Sinamäe made one thing quite clear: "This is not Disco Elysium 2, this is C4." The writer went on to explain that ZA/UM has "spent the last three years developing this brand new, gripping, completely original world, exploring a theme that each and every member of the ZA/UM collective is inherently obsessed with: espionage."
</p>
<figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
While the presentation didn't offer a look at anything in-game, a short teaser trailer for C4 was shown which mostly consisted of a woman with a London accent talking in a very Disco Elysium-y kind of way, set to some very cool looking art. Story details were pretty slim too, but Ashilevi did explain that "C4 is all about spy games, allegiances, and betrayals. It is not 007, with his hero complex, the Bond girls, the gadgets. It is more like Slow Horses, doing the work you love even if it does not get you any fame or parades. No heroes, only the stench of failure." Failing forward will also apparently be a big part of what sets the game apart, with Ashilevi saying the team is making "failure a joy in itself".
</p>
<p>
This presentation is just part one of two, as ZA/UM is also apparently making an appearance at GDC later this month, where it will presumably talk more about the game.
</p>
<p>
C4 is obviously the first project following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-developer-alleges-creative-leads-were-fired-on-false-premises">the departure</a> of Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere and artist Aleksander Rostov in 2021. What followed has been a series of messy legal battles, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGIGA8taN-M&amp;ab_channel=PeopleMakeGames">documentary</a> that alleged toxicity from Kurvitz and more, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">different</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">games</a> claiming to be spiritual successors. I'm looking forward to finding out if the OG ZA/UM can cut through all of that noise.

            <p>Longdue, a new studio formed by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> staff, has revealed a teaser trailer for its new project and announced the inclusion of key Disco Elysium alumni.</p>
<p>The new "psychogeographic RPG", called Hopetown, will launch a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/longduegames/hopetown">Kickstarter campaign</a> on 17th March where more details will be revealed.</p>
<p>Until then, below is the first teaser trailer, which includes character artwork and an intriguing voiceover hinting at the psychological consequences of the story.</p>
<figure>
<p>

<p>Lenval Brown, who voiced the narrator in Disco Elysium, will return for Hopetown and voice a key character.</p>
<p>"It feels good to be back - to step into something new," said Brown. "There's nothing like bringing a world to life, shaping a story that's been waiting to be spoken into existence."</p>
<p>What's more, Martin Luiga - founding member of the ZA/UM Cultural Association who was involved in writing Disco Elysium - has also joined the team at Longdue.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to share my experiences with Longdue to help them craft the narrative and systems for Hopetown, playing to the strengths that the narrative RPG genre has achieved thus far and attempting to innovate upon them to tell a rich story based in equal parts on what has been, what is and what could be," said Luiga. "I am confident that the team can deliver a worthy addition to the canon of Western RPGs. I call upon the fans of the RPG and adventure genre to back the Hopetown Kickstarter to help us make the game."</p>
<p>Longdue's staff also includes Piotr Sobolewski from the Disco Elysium team, though as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/535127/disco-elysium-successor-looks-just-like-disco-elysium">Polygon</a> reported earlier this month his ties to the game are loose - in the game's credits Sobolewski is listed as providing "additional development" from outsourcing studio The Knights of Unity.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Brown and Luiga therefore strengthens the ties with ZA/UM's project. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">first announced back in October</a> last year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-plans-to-redefine-psychological-rpg-genre">further details on its mechanics</a> provided back in January this year.</p>
<p>However, it coexists with multiple other projects from former Disco Elysium staff, with each announcement seemingly not-so-coincidentally arriving at the same time (notably, the games were first revealed on the fifth anniversary of Disco Elysium).</p>
<p>ZA/UM, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studios-new-rpg-c4-is-a-mix-of-espionage-thriller-and-psychedelic-sci-fi">original Disco Elysium studio, has today announced its next game</a>, called C4, which blends dice-rolling gameplay with psychedelic sci-fi and espionage thriller elements. However, many original members of staff who worked on Disco Elysium have since left the studio.</p>
<p>Then there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">new UK-based studio Dark Math Games</a> creating XXX Nightshift, formed of a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium", which was announced in October.</p>
<p>Shortly after that announcement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">Summer Eternal revealed itself as a new studio from Argo Tuulik</a>, who co-created Disco Elysium's worldbuilding.</p>
<p>Disco Elysium writer and designer Robert Kurvitz has also established a new studio called Red Info with artist Aleksander Rostov.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/messy-drama-behind-disco-elysiums-multiple-spiritual-successors-detailed-in-new-report">report in November detailed the messy drama behind the multiple Disco Elysium spiritual successors</a> in development - it followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">multiple lawsuits that are now said to be resolved</a>.</p>
<p>In the wake of this drama, though, multiple studios are now creating new projects vying to be the foremost successor to Disco Elysium - an isometric political RPG that was lauded on its release in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> developer ZA/UM - or at least what remains of it after a fractious few years of mudslinging, firings, and lawsuits - has announced its next game: a dice-rolling blend of psychedelic sci-fi and espionage thriller it's calling C4.
</p>
<p>
C4 casts players as an operant serving a questionable global power who finds themselves "locked in a vicious, clandestine struggle for the truth and influence". It's a quest for secrets, set in a world of shadowy characters and concealed conflicts, that's said to offer a blend of player introspection, deep character-driven dialogue, and dice-based high-stakes encounters.
</p>
<p>
"Yet it is the mind that takes centre stage in C4," ZA/UM explains. "More vulnerable and somehow more powerful than the physical world, it can be erased, changed, reordered, and of course significantly altered through regular use of psychoactive substances. Players must steel themselves with whatever comfort they can to survive the violent canvas of the real."
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>C4 teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
In a brief conversation with press ahead of C4's official unveiling, ZA/UM writer Siim "Kosmos" Sianamäe shed some light on the philosophy driving C4's development. "We want to build on what we've done before," he explained, "but not simply by repeating it or rehashing it. This is not Disco Elysium 2, this is C4. We've spent the last three years developing this brand-new, gripping, completely original work exploring the theme that each and every member of the ZA/UM collective is inherently obsessed with: espionage."
</p>
<p>
Fellow C4 writer Jim Ashilevi added, "[This] is a game all about spy stuff - spy games, allegiances, betrayals - [but it] is not 007, with his hero complex, the Bond girls, gadgets. It's more like Slow Horses: doing the work you love even if it does not get you any fame or praise. No heroes, only the stench of failure."
</p>
<p>
And failure appears to be a theme central to C4. "What differentiates us from other RPGs out there," Ashilevi continued, "is failing forward. Instead of failure being something that makes the player trigger a reload, start save scumming, we make failure a joy in itself, validating the player choice where other games may deny it. This is something very unique to our games, and we all know nobody fails more often than spies."
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/C4_5.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/C4_4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
</figure>
</figure>
<p>
As to how all this will play out in more specific terms, that remains to be seen. For now, ZA/UM seems content to speak in more thematic terms, with C4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8">striking announcement trailer</a> being accompanied by Sianamäe's tease that "betrayal is only possible in the presence of love".
</p>
<p>
What the studio is willing to share, though, is a whole heap of influences it's drawing upon for its latest project, ranging from the spy fiction of John le Carré to the "weird" science fiction of Ursula K. Le Guin, Phillip K. Dick, and Stanisław Lem. Even Park Chan-wook and French TV drama Le Bureau get a mention, with Ashilevi noting the latter "really [captures] how normal civilians get entrapped or seduced into intelligence work, and how keeping secrets compounds for those members of humanity who do it professionally."
</p>
<p>
At the moment, there's no hint of a release date - or even target platforms - for C4, but ZA/UM says it'll be sharing more details during next week's Game Developer Conference.

<p>
C4 is the first game to emerge from ZA/UM since 2019's widely acclaimed Disco Elysium, and follows years of convoluted legal drama among executives and former members of the creative team. With at least some of that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">now said to be resolved</a>, and with different members of the original Disco Elysium team now scattered across the globe, multiple new projects have been announced by Disco Elysium alumni since October.
</p>
<p>
Over in the UK, there's Dark Math Games and Longdue - two studios comprised of former ZA/UM developers that both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors last year. Longdue is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">working on a "psychogeographic RPG" it's now unveiled as Hopetown</a>, while Dark Math is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">developing a detective RPG called XXX Nightshift</a>. Additionally, former Disco Elysium writer Argo Tuulik <em>also</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">announced his new Summer Eternal studio</a> in October, confirming it too is working on an RPG. And if you thought that was confusing, last year's barrage of announcements was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/messy-drama-behind-disco-elysiums-multiple-spiritual-successors-detailed-in-new-report">accompanied by yet more messy drama</a>.
</p>
<p>
And that's without factoring in what Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - who were both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">fired from ZA/UM in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct</a> - will do next. The pair have set up their own studio, Red Info, and were previously said to be making a game with backing from NetEase.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-set-to-be-revealed-in-new-silent-hill-transmission-this-week.1130952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-transmission-announced-silent-hill-f<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase for this week, and it sounds like the show will focus pretty much exclusively on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/1899218771375481118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami reveals that the stream will air on March 13th at 3pm Pacific, which is around 6pm Eastern and about 10pm GMT. It's going to be a fairly late one if you're in the UK or Europe.</p>

<p>According to the post, the stream will "uncover&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>", so presumably, we'll get a full reveal for the game. I'm not sure you should hold your breath for a release date, but at the very least we should get a full story reveal and perhaps some gameplay as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-reveal-next-week-flower-girl.jpg?itok=otsaKKu5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-reveal-next-week-flower-girl.jpg?itok=4fw1eN9z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was first revealed back in late 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was revealed via a rather effectively creepy teaser trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">back in 2022</a>, but we don't know too much about the game outside of that initial reveal.</p>

<p>The trailer featured some pretty creepy imagery, including a Japanese-style doll and a girl covered in some kind of strange floral growth, but it's not clear yet how those things will fit into&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>'s story.</p>

<p>In the interim, however, Konami didn't forget about&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was released late last year, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">over two million copies</a> at last count. It seems the game performed well enough to prompt Konami to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">work with Bloober on another game</a> based on one of the publisher's IPs, too.</p>

<p>You can rewatch the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>teaser trailer (or perhaps even watch it for the first time, if you missed it back in 2022) right here.</p>

            <p>
The passage of time is unfortunately an unstoppable thing, and I seem to have blinked and five years have passed since the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. In the intervening period, a sort-of-sequel was released simply titled Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 - now just called Call of Duty: Warzone, too - and the single, bountiful map players War upon has changed several times over. Yesterday on March 10th, the day Warzone officially released back in 2020, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/activision">Activision</a> shared a teaser trailer confirming that the game's original map Verdansk will be making a comeback.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The trailer, which you can check out below, is set to Nat King Cole's classic Unforgettable, all while different characters in a range of military gear lovingly look at dirt, embrace shot-up walls, and cry over the return of Verdansk.

<p>
To be honest, it feels like a bit of a tone deaf trailer given the general state of the world, but I suppose Call of Duty has never been known for treating these kinds of things sensitively. 
</p>
<p>
It was thought that season 3 of Warzone and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> would be arriving later this month on March 20th, but last week the official Call of Duty X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641">confirmed that it will instead be coming April 3rd</a>. That's when you'll be able to jump back into Verdansk, too.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is obviously following in Fortnite's footsteps here, given that Epic's more popular battle royale did the exact same thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-og-is-here-bringing-back-planes-hamster-balls-tilted-towers-and-more-over-the-next-four-weeks">back in 2023</a> by bringing back a whole bunch of features from the earliest iteration of the game, including its original map. Fortnite found a lot of success with that move, something I'm sure Activision will hope repeats with the return of Verdansk to Warzone.

That was easy, eh? The whole campaign is split into two parts, each taking 12 to 15 hours to tackle. But again, that’s just the story! It’s just the opening flourish of the game! There’s still a whole expansive world to explore, monsters to hunt, crafting and upgrades to explore, side quests and challenges to tackle, and of course, the ever-present grind the series is known for.</p><p>Then, of course, there are achievements to consider.

<p>If you’re looking for your next fix of horror and hilarity, REPO might be what you need. The valuable-extraction title blends comedy and claustrophobic scares, and tackling it with more players is necessary if you want to sleep better.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lethal-company-coming-fortnite-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company</a> came along in late 2023 to stun the indie gaming community. It racked up a peak of nearly 250,000 players on Steam, and it still attracts thousands of players each month. Imitators have come and gone, trying to replicate its meteoric success, but REPO might be the one to crack the case.</p>



<p>It’s also an online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> where you need to “Locate valuable, fully physics-based objects and handle them with care,” according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and if you have a lot of friends, you might be pleased at how many people can join up and play REPO at any one time.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-repo-in-online-co-op">How Many People Can Play REPO in Online Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My face when the McDonald’s milkshake machine works. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Up to 6 players can team up and play REPO together in a party.</strong></p>



<p>This gives REPO a slight edge over Lethal Company’s four-player squads. It also means even more chaos and calamity can ensue. </p>



<p>One of the biggest differences about REPO is keeping the cargo safe. Dropping the valuables or bringing any harm to them will decrease their value. This reduces your earnings, and disappoints your creator greatly.</p>



<p>Given that you need to use voice chat to communicate with your allies and negotiate obstacles, enemies, and other ungodly hazards, having more teammates could go either way for your survival chances!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-repo-solo">Can You Play REPO Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play REPO solo, but if you’re not privy to the game’s contents, you’ll understand why that’s a bad idea.</strong></p>



<p>Teamwork is <em>key </em>in REPO. Again, the more players with you, the faster you’ll find loot, and the more decoys and human shields you have to take the brunt of enemy attacks—grim, but true. Solo survival in REPO is extremely difficult, and even the game’s official description suggests you should: “<strong>Use teamwork to make sure that the precious cargo will safely reach its destination</strong>.”</p>



<p>REPO may get tweaked to be more accommodating to solo players as time goes on. Conversely, REPO may get options to broaden the player pool for each lobby. We’ll update this guide if developer semiwork makes such changes.</p>



<hr>



<p>Indie horror games are a popular genre on Steam. REPO is a breakout hit already in 2025, so let us know if you get the chance to play it and what you think.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the first 3D entry in the series and is considered, still to this day, as one of the best entries in the series. As such, there's high demand for a modern remake of the game, but Nintendo seems more focused on working on new entries in the series rather than remaking older 3D games that would require way more work than the remasters released so far. Still, the remake released on Nintendo 3DS is a solid upgrade to the game, so it is definitely a game that's worth playing to experience a slightly modernized take on the classic N64 game.</p>

That’s part of the reason why every show from <em>The Sopranos </em>and <em>Lost </em>(in the PS2 era) to<em> M*A*S*H </em>(way back on the Atari 2600) have been turned into (mostly pretty lousy) video games. (Of course, it also helps that studios want to milk successful IPs for all they’re worth). <em>The Last of Us </em>is that rare example of a property that is finding great success in both forms: the original games are widely beloved and have millions of fans around the world, and the HBO series is only pulling even more people into the fold. Given the success of the video game adaptation of <em>The Last Of Us </em>(and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-trailer-dina-ellie-dance-1851768672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-trailer-dina-ellie-dance-1851768672">the impending arrival of its second season</a></span>)<em>, </em>we decided to flip the script and take a deeper look at the TV shows we wish we could play as video games. </p></div><div><p>Over the last 14 years, whenever we hear that an AI chatbot influenced a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child to commit suicide</a></span>, or a reality TV star becomes President of the United States, or a global pandemic breaks out, at some point many of us think, <em>“</em>Man, this feels like a <em>Black Mirror</em> episode.” The dystopian anthology series has complicated the human experience by placing people in deadly moral quandaries with a level of creativity that would be a thrill to explore further in a video game. There have been episodes in which people are dog-like robotic killers (“Metalhead”), a museum of unethical technological experiments like a brain implant allowing a doctor to feel his patient’s pain is explored (“Black Museum), and the British Prime Minister is blackmailed into having sex with a pig on national television (“The National Anthem”). They’ve also already ventured into the dark world of video games in an episode in which two friends fall in love in a <em>Mortal Kombat</em>-esque VR game (“Striking Vipers”) and one in which a guy tests an augmented reality game implanted in his head where he experiences his worst nightmares (“Playtest”).</p><p>This show would make an excellent video game in which a character is banished to a purgatorial void for some moral infraction, and they can only escape by going through a series of mirrors that are portals into wild scenarios that test their willingness to live. </p></div><div><p>Espionage has been the basis of some of the greatest video game franchises ever, like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em>, and <em>Watch Dogs</em>. The cutscene dialogue is usually rich with dramatic doublespeak and societal commentary that excites the inner conspiracy theorist in us. Few shows over the last 25 years have all that and the benefit of two dynamic leads, but <em>The Americans </em>does. The show is centered around two Russian spies posing as a suburban American family in the early 1980s, leaking intel back to their motherland. They and their network of spies have to intercept valuable assets in broad daylight through choreographed distractions, infiltrate a U.S. military project to steal defense communication codes, and bug the FBI office by placing a listening device in a mail robot. </p><p>Even when the series ended, there were  nuances of the show that fans wanted to delve back into, which a video game could help with. Since the show is more about stealth than murder (though there’s a fair amount of that too), it could be a great two-player game in which you and a partner extract intel to send back to Mother Russia, but it presents you both with different paths you must choose from that could ultimately lead you two to hate each other. The world will never get enough of spy games.</p></div><div><p>If guns, drugs, and the occasional wrestler-turned-gangster are what you are into, <em>Snowfall </em>is your show. The final piece of art the late John Singleton gave us is a gripping drama about a young man named Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) who starts selling drugs to get him and his mother out of the ‘hood. That is, until it turns into an empire and he becomes a power addict who destroys everything he loves. Watching Franklin devolve into a prisoner of his power by killing one of his best friends to prevent a gang war and then killing the father of the love of his life to prevent being arrested is truly heartbreaking. There’s also enough drive-by shootings, cocaine smuggling, and sex to make this a great <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>-style<em>&nbsp;</em>video game in which you can either play as Franklin or one of the numerous members of his empire to see where this gangster life will lead you.</p></div><div><p>The show that took <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682">Sterling K. Brown’s badass levels</a></span> up to 100 has scenes  that I wanted to leap into my TV screen to participate in. Certain members of the U.S. government and private sector build a city inside of a Colorado mountain to escape an extinction-level event they knew was coming. The first season’s penultimate episode is already being hailed as the best TV episode of 2025 so far and contains a tense scene in which the President of the United States needs armed guards to make it out of the White House after he told America that the world is ending, and the government knew about it. In a video game, you could play as Secret Service agent Xavier Collins (Brown) and be tasked with getting the president through a mob of angry government officials without him being shot or assaulted.  Ratcheting up the stakes further, you also have to make sure you don’t lose the “nuclear football,” the briefcase device that allows the president to launch nuclear attacks. That’s just one of the exhilarating and video-game-ready scenarios from a show that has  survivors being killed by mercenaries, the sky itself getting hacked to flash messages, and some of the most emotional scriptwriting of any show this year.</p></div><div><p>Yes, we’re getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-gameplay-showcase-survival-mmo-1851630351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-gameplay-showcase-survival-mmo-1851630351"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a></span> game later this year, but that game won’t be focused on the strongest group of people in the <em>Dune </em>universe: The Bene Gesserit<em>. </em>The sensational HBO series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-finale-recap-desmond-hart-valya-harkonnen-1851727517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-finale-recap-desmond-hart-valya-harkonnen-1851727517"><em>Dune: Prophecy</em></a></span><em> </em>is mostly told from the perspective of this ancient sisterhood that acts as confidants and advisors to royal families while surreptitiously influencing powerful people in a way that keeps their secretive group close to power. We’ve seen them tap their fingers and peer into someone’s soul to see if they’re lying and use a powerful voice technique that can make almost anyone who hears it do what they say. The only person proven capable of withstanding the Voice is a man who was swallowed by a sandworm, operated on by thinking machines, and had devices implanted in his eyeballs that allow him to infect people with an airborne virus that burns them alive. </p><p>This would be the perfect basis for a game in which you choose your member of the Bene Gesserit, each with their unique skillset, and have to make nuanced interpersonal decisions with the intent of finding the messiah. Imagine using your voice to make the prince of the Atreides family marry the princess of the Harkonnen family simply because of their family names, and seeing it result in one of them killing the other because you didn’t spend enough time with them to know that their families have had a secret war going on for generations. This game would be like <em>The Sims </em>in space but with a lot more murder.</p></div><div><p>It’s a bit baffling that Amazon’s violent spin on superheroes isn’t on its third PlayStation game by now. <em>The Boys</em> is a fever dream of a series in which a ragtag anti-superhero militia known as the Boys works to stop the reign of the superhero consortium The Seven. The central appeal of the show is that, even while it’s focused on genetically modified super freaks who can do things no ordinary human being can do, it’s also grounded in human imperfections like jealousy, carnal temptations, and greed. It doesn’t let that humanity get in the way of over-the-top action, though. We’ve seen a protestor get his head lasered off, a man’s body ripped apart by a miniature person who crawled inside of him and then expanded, and a superhero orgy too graphic to even try to describe. With superhero video games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>popping up every two seconds and making a gazillion dollars, there’s no reason a similar type of game can’t be made within <em>The Boys</em> universe.</p></div><div><p>This should’ve happened a long time ago. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span> was one of the best TV shows of 2024 and a true testament to the wealth of possibilities contained within the <em>Batman</em> universe. Set after the events of Matt Reeves’ <em>The Batman</em> film, <em>The Penguin</em> focuses on how people like “Oz” Cobb (Colin Farrell) and Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti) try to fill the power gap in Gotham’s underworld left by the death of Carmine Falcone. The show’s titular character is the main star of the action, and we get to see how he’s as strategic as he is ruthless, willing to kill his closest partner so his enemies can’t exploit his love as a weakness. Thus far, whenever video games have let us travel through the seedy underbelly of Gotham it’s been as the Caped Crusader dishing out bone-breaking justice, but it would be just as fun to do so as the nefarious Penguin, trying to take out the crime families standing in his way as he’s determined to be somebody in this world. </p></div><div><p>When I realized the first season of <em>Creature Commandos </em>was done after only seven episodes that were under 30 minutes each, I was legitimately upset. You don’t want to leave a world in which a black ops team composed of non-human inmates from Belle Reve Penitentiary is assembled in an attempt to protect Princess Ilana Rostovic (Maria Bakalova), the rightful heir to the throne of Pokolistan. This ragtag team of misfits includes a radioactive walking skeleton, an undead Bride of Frankenstein, and a Nazi-hating killer robot, and that’s just the start. They’ve torn someone’s head off by punching through their headrest, had their limbs magically turned into balloon animals mid-fight, and had a rabid weasel tear through someone’s flesh. How could we not have fun running through the world with these agents of mayhem in a video game, violently ending more lives than we save?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We never thought it would return. But get ready, because Verdansk is coming to Warzone 2. Long-time fans are worried it won’t feature Superstore or other famous POIs, so we’re here today to answer any questions regarding its hotspots.</p>



<p>Call of Duty Warzone 2 is the successor to Warzone Caldera. It’s kept the CoD battle royale boat afloat for a couple of years now, but it’s taken some damage in recent times. Some have even labeled it as a sinking ship. Warzone’s lessening impact is getting so concerning that a potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone 3 is in danger</a>, as is the potential future of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-warzone-being-shut-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone shutting down</a> altogether.</p>



<p>Warzone was once arguably the battle royale powerhouse of the world. It needs a serious injection of players to kickstart the excitement again, and a fully-loaded Verdansk armed with classic POIs could be what it needs.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-verdansk-poi-in-warzone-2">Every Confirmed Verdansk POI in Warzone 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It stores goods and campers. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warzone 2’s Verdansk map will feature most POIs from the original including Atlas Superstore, Storage Town, Prison, and many more.</strong></p>



<p>We learned a little while back we’re getting “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pretty Much the OG March 2020 Version</a>” of Verdansk. I couldn’t imagine Activision dropping a version of Verdansk no one wants, or even Verdansk ’84. So, get ready for what appears to be the complete, classic Verdansk experience.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/WZStatsGG/status/1895902878293692854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, here’s every POI leaked so far, with more presumably to come:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlas Superstore</li>



<li>Block 17</li>



<li>Block 23</li>



<li>Boneyard</li>



<li>Coast</li>



<li>Gora Bridge</li>



<li>Gora Tunnel</li>



<li>Gora Village</li>



<li>Grazna Bridge</li>



<li>Great Bridge</li>



<li>Jarvdinsk Spomenik</li>



<li>Karst Bridge</li>



<li>Krovnik Farmland</li>



<li>Lozoff Pass</li>



<li>Novi Grazna Hills</li>



<li>Prison</li>



<li>Storage Town</li>



<li>Styor Memorial</li>



<li>Zhokov Boneyard</li>
</ul>



<p>Some notable favorites are missing for the time being. Dam is absent, as is Airport and many others, but Verdansk is gigantic, so this is likely an incomplete inventory. We expect more details to leak ahead of its much-hyped return to Call of Duty and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-verdansk-returning-to-warzone">When is Verdansk Returning to Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty courtesy of Warzone 2 Season 3 on April 3.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-officially-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk is returning to Call of Duty Warzone next month</a>. The official Call of Duty X account had a message for everyone on March 10: “As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories. Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories 🪂

Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 💥 </span></p></article></div>



<p>Whatever your thoughts on Verdansk or how it will be received, this is no doubt a special time for CoD Warzone users. Expect a huge influx of players looking to lap up the initial nostalgia.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone player count</a> drops off as the days and weeks pass.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege X’s changes to UI, map reworks, and new skins have appeared online due to a new leak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-leak-first-look-seasons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, new details about Rainbow Six Seige X have leaked ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase planned for March 13</a>. The leaks arrived from the Rainbow Six Leaks Discord server, giving players an idea of how the upcoming game could look. Moreover, these leaked images appear to be from an early game build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding UI, Siege X has added a new label for ‘Operation Prep Phase’ at the right-hand corner of the screen. Players will also find additions of a ‘battle pass progression tracker’ and a ‘challenge system’. Players should know that all these elements are subject to change with the game’s final build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following leaked image for Siege X provides players with a look at the type of skins we might see. The skin showcased is Valkyrie’s Paragon Elite skin, which also has a matching Black Eye camera skin. Lastly, Chalet and Border Maps appear revamped, and the leaked images show enhancements towards the lighting in these environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that none of the information revealed through the leaks has been confirmed officially by Ubisoft and is subject to change with the final game build. Players will receive more concrete information during the dedicated Siege X showcase on March 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Siege X might feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-will-feature-a-6v6-mode-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 6v6 mode</a>. Also, Rainbow Six Siege remains <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-rainbow-six-siege-top-esports-game-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a top esports title</a> after being in the market for a decade.

Playdead, the developer behind indie darlings <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and Inside, has responded amidst an increasingly ugly spat between the company's co-founders.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a rift between Playdead's Dino Patti and Arnt Jensen are nothing new, and first circulated around the time Patti left Playdead following the launch of Inside in 2016. 
</p>
<p>
This month, however, the friction between the two men has become public - following a claim by Patti that he was the subject of "bullying", and that Jensen had "repeatedly" sent legal threats to him since his departure from the company. 
</p>
<p>
The latest of these legal claims, Patti says, involves a now-deleted LinkedIn post in which he discussed Limbo's development and shared a photo of an "unauthorised" photo taken by Jensen. Patti says he has now been asked to cough up the equivalent of £56k in compensation.
</p>
<p>
In response to Patti's claim being made public, Playdead has issued a statement confirming it has "submitted demands" based on a claim of "infringement and unauthorised use of Playdead's trademarks and copyrighted works in a commercial and marketing context" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">Game Developer</a>).
</p>
<p>
"We have found it necessary to take this action to protect our trademarks and copyrights," the company said, "which are essential to Playdead's business and reputation".
</p>
<p>
In a legal document shared by Patti, Playdead wrote that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game".
</p>
<p>
Sharing the document online, Patti said he was a "significant part of building Playdead from the ground up" and that without him, "Playdead wouldn't have existed". 
</p>
<p>
"Arnt, please stop the bullying," Patti concluded. "I will not stop being who I am. I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." 
</p>
<p>
Playdead is currently working on its third game, which it began teasing in 2017. In 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-announces-publishing-deal-with-control-inside-and-the-last-guardian-devs">Epic Games confirmed it would handle publishing duties on the game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Patti launched Somerville, his first game at new studio Jumpship, in 2022. An adventure platform game with physics-based puzzles, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/somerville-review-a-tasteful-apocalypse-with-a-little-light-puzzling">received decent reviews, amidst comparisons to Playdead's work</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-ai-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony is working on AI-powered versions of PlayStation characters that can respond to voice input from the player during gameplay, a new leaked video revealed.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> by an anonymous tipster before it got taken down on YouTube, shows an AI-powered version of the Horizon series protagonist Aloy that can respond to queries using synthesized voice and facial movements both in a demo setting and during Horizon Forbidden West gameplay, as highlighted by SIE director of software engineering Sharwin Raghoebardajal who demonstrated the technology in the removed video. The technology, powered by OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations, is augmented by Sony's internal Emotional Voice Synthesis system and by Mockingbird technology that handles audio-to-face animation.</p>
<p>While this AI-powered version of Aloy was developed to show the technology internally, there's a very good chance that we will eventually see it implemented even on consoles, as parts of the technology can run directly on PlayStation 5 with little overhead. This glimpse of what the technology is capable of achieving doesn't exactly provide hints at how it could be implemented to enhance gaming experiences, but there's little doubt that it will impact future games considerably, considering the direction the industry is taking and how the PlayStation 6, in particular, is said will go <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">all-out on AI.</a></p>
<p>Sony isn't the only major console manufacturer investing heavily in AI. Last week, Microsoft unveiled its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muse AI model</a> capable of generating gameplay. This&nbsp;should help developers, especially in the early stages of development, although the contrary is more likely, given the current state of the industry.</p>

It’s positively massive, and you cannot man the entire vessel solo: even as the coolest yakuza in Hawaii you require a crew. In <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, your ship crew is split into two groups: Cannon Squad and Boarding Squad.</p><p>Your Cannon Squad is relatively self-explanatory. It’s the crew working the various cannons and weapons on your ship. However, the Boarding Squad is where running a pirate crew becomes slightly more complex. You see, it’s not a single squad: you have four. Each Boarding Squad consists of four members and a Squad Leader. As a Squad Leader, the assigned crew member has access to a unique ability that enhances their skills and, occasionally, yours.</p><h2 id="h2568524"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Boarding Squad Leader Traits in Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-recommend-id="image://0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-recommend-id="image://0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a touch of strategy to the over-the-top beat ‘em up <em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, especially regarding your pirate crew. When assigning Squad Leaders to your Boarding Squad, picking wisely from the roster means the difference between overtaking the competition and succumbing to Davy Jones’ Locker.</p><h3 id="h2568525"><a id=""></a><strong>Nishida: Indomitable Will Bonded</strong></h3><p>You’ll meet Nishida on Nele Island relatively early in the campaign, where he’s actively searching for Majima. Well, he finds the man. As it turns out, Nishida is one of the best healers in the game, thanks to his ability, Indomitable Will. It’s a Squad Leader trait that boosts healing, plus includes Shock Resistance. You’ll deal with Shock frequently during combat, making Nishida a staple for any pirate crew!</p><h3 id="h2568526"><a id=""></a><strong>Misaki: Succession of Will Bonded</strong></h3><p>Misaki, the daughter of Namioka, will join your pirate crew deeper into the game and, as expected, provides a nice buff to your Boarding Squad when assigned as a Squad Leader. Her ability, Succession of Will, boosts Attack Damage and increases the charge rate of the Voltage Gauge, which allows your support units to utilize powerful abilities mid-combat.</p><h3 id="h2568527"><a id=""></a><strong>Masaru Fujita: Marine Cuisine Bonded</strong></h3><p>The first crewmember you’ll recruit in <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, Masaru Fujita, is another of the most powerful to assign to your Boarding Squad. His ability, Marine Cuisine, boosts attack power for everyone in his squad and increases Poison Resistance. Now, you won’t deal with Poison frequently, but when you do, it’s a painful, annoying experience that will make you beg for higher resistance!</p><h3 id="h2568528"><a id=""></a><strong>Jason Rich: Hunter’s Knowledge Bonded</strong></h3><p>As one of the first crewmates you’ll unlock, alongside Masaru Fujita, Jason Rich also offers one of the strongest Squad Leader Traits in the game. As you level Jason and his abilities become more powerful, you’ll note that his Squad Leader Trait, Hunter’s Knowledge, is genuinely one of the best in the game. It provides a significant buff to attack and defense, while also boosting firearms resistance to the entire squad.</p><hr><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is easily one of the wildest experiences on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025 so far, so long as you don’t mind the lengthy story and side content!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
