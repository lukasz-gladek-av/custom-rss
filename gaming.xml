            <guid>1374172</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="140" data-end="945">Laptops often get more praise than they deserve. While they’re convenient for mobility, nothing quite compares to a well-designed desk setup with large monitors, a responsive mechanical keyboard, and the comfort of a dedicated workspace. Such an environment not only boosts productivity but also creates a place you’ll genuinely enjoy returning to whenever it’s time to focus. One of the best ways to power a setup like this is with the Apple Mac Mini. Despite being a desktop machine, it’s still compact enough to take with you when needed. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">Even better, the 2024 version of Apple’s compact desktop is currently discounted by 17% on Amazon, dropping the price from $599 to $499.</a> If you’ve been considering an upgrade, this is an ideal moment to treat yourself while saving a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="947" data-end="1618">The discounted model is the 2024 Apple Mac Mini equipped with Apple’s M4 chip, which features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The device is sold in 256 GB and 512 GB variants, although the higher-capacity version is currently selling for over $700. Alongside that storage, the system includes 16 GB of RAM. The M4 processor is the star of the show here, giving this compact desktop a tremendous performance boost. Apple claims it can operate up to 13 times faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac Mini. That makes the machine suitable for everyday productivity as well as demanding creative tasks like photo or video editing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1620" data-end="2060">In terms of connectivity, the 2024 Mac Mini packs a generous selection of ports and wireless options. You’ll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-C ports, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for fast and stable wireless connections. Apple may have phased out the headphone jack on the iPhone years ago, but it remains present on the Mac Mini, giving you the convenience of wired audio whenever you want it.</p>
<p data-start="2062" data-end="2748">The desktop comes loaded with macOS 15.1 Sequoia, which continues Apple’s emphasis on privacy and security. It includes an upgraded Secure Enclave to help safeguard your personal data and system integrity. MacOS supports a wide variety of software, from productivity essentials to creative tools. You can use the full Microsoft 365 suite, Adobe Creative Cloud applications, Zoom, and thousands of other programs. In fact, the App Store offers more than 15,000 apps, many of which are optimized specifically for the M4 chip.</p>


<h2>Better With Apple Accessories</h2>
<p data-start="2750" data-end="3035">To enhance your experience even further, you can pair the Mac Mini with other Apple accessories. It works seamlessly with the Apple Studio Display and integrates perfectly with peripherals like the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, offering a smooth and cohesive setup across your devices.</p>
<p data-start="3037" data-end="3278"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">For a short time, Amazon is selling the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip for $499, an even $100 reduction from its standard price.</a> AppleCare+ isn’t included, but you can add three years of coverage for a combined total of $588—that’s at a $120 discount.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-arena-reloaded/</link>
            <guid>1374169</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate developer 1047 Games has announced that Splitgate 2 will be relaunching later this month under the new name SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded. The latest trailer shows that the game isn’t just relaunching with a new name, though, and that 1047 Games has been hard at work listening to community feedback and improving the game in as many areas as possible.</p>



<p>As said in the game’s latest YouTube trailer (see below), the game has seen a significant graphic overhaul, a pullback on the game’s heroes and abilities, and a rebuild of the game from the ground up, taking the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2 and removing what didn’t work.</p>

</p></figure>



<div><p>In addition to those changes, SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded now also has player stats, leaderboards, a career system, and a new competitive experience.</p><p>SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded, Josh Watson, also revealed that the game will launch with five new maps, four new weapons, new modes, and more, with “A lot more to share in the coming weeks”.</p></div>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-s-redemption-arc">Splitgate’s Redemption Arc?</h2>



<p>After a horrible launch earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splitgate 2 was taken offline back to BETA</a> after the game failed to make a good impression on players and see significant player retention. Splitgate 2’s failed launch was hindered by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-apologizes-for-sgf-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial comments</a> from 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx at Summer Games Fest and since then, the game struggled to find any kind of interest from the wider community.</p>



<p>Now, though, 1047 Games seems like it’s started a redemption arc by listening to the community and seemingly keeping Proulx away from the game’s marketing. The YouTube community on the trailer seem to suggest that players are once again interested, which would be a huge turnaround for the developers if they can pull it off.</p>



<p>The game is set to launch as a free-to-play title on December 17th on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC, with the latest game trailer </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cast-outs-reveal-trailer-drops-features-developers-from-closed-sony-london-studio-team/</link>
            <guid>1374166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony’s London Studio is back with fewer staff members and has been rebranded as Twisted Works. The team has revealed Cast Outs, which bears a striking resemblance to London Studio’s canceled game it was working on.</p>



<p>Last May, the unfortunate news broke that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-london-studio-has-closed-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s London Studio closed after 20 years</a>. The team primarily focused on games designed around gadgets, such as the EyeToy and PlayStation VR. But Twisted Works is comprised of several London Studio members, and they are working on Cast Outs.</p>







<h2 id="h-london-studio-developers-return-to-finish-what-they-started">London Studio Developers Return To Finish What They Started</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Back, sort of. Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the wake of London Studio’s 2024 closure, everyone learned of a canceled PS5 game the developer was working on.</p>







<p>An online co-op game, Cast Outs uses fantasy elements in its London setting. You’ll need to embrace the fantastical arts, such as magic and spells. Here’s how Twisted Works described the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Cast Outs&nbsp;brings you the pure spectacle of magic where spellcasting hits with the physical impact of a brawler and the immediate kick of a&nbsp;shooter. Dive into the ultimate magical urban battleground where you and your friends can truly cooperate, regardless of skill level. It’s the perfect balance of quick-fix fun and high-octane action, built to be played together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Much of the footage and elements sound like the studio’s original canceled project. Development must be moving along well, as the studio is already talking about a beta: “We are entering production soon and plan to release an early access beta in early 2027.”</p>



<p>You can see the reveal trailer for yourself.</p>

              <p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-wins-the-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-enters-exclusive-deal-talks/"><em>TheWrap</em></a>, Netflix is now entering exclusive talks to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, having outbid other competitors for the&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>-owning megacorp. If the deal goes through, rumored to be at $30 a share, it would mean the streaming giant would own everything from HBO to DC comics, including all your favorite Lego and <em>Batman</em> games.</p> <p>Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav has been making it clear he wants to sell the company for a good while now, but holding out for a big exit. In October this year he <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">turned down a bid from Paramount</a> said to be at $20 a share, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach"><em>Bloomberg</em> claiming</a> the CEO was holding out for 50 percent higher. That valuation seemed crazy, and it was assumed that Paramount came in much lower to test the waters, with the expectation of either a $25 per share bid to follow, or more hostile takeover moves. However, instead, it seems Netflix has swooped in with that $30 offer thus won the war.</p>

 <h2>What are the implications of this deal?</h2> <p>If the deal goes through, this would mean streaming giant Netflix would own one of its big rivals, HBO Max, and presumably look to merge the two services. It would also own Warner’s entire movie business including New Line Cinema, all of DC Entertainement, the Discovery network of channels, and multiple networks like CNN, TBS, TNT and the Cartoon Network. And, of course, Warner Bros. Games.</p>

 <p>In a normal universe, this would be the sort of deal that would be tangled in monopolistic concerns for years to come, as people questioned the unparalleled power this could offer Netflix over multiple industries. However, given other recent mergers that have taken place after, um, payments made to the Trump orbit, what might happen is anyone’s guess. However, earlier talk last month of the potential deal between Netflix and Warner <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-warner-bros-bid-antitrust-concerns-darrell-issa-letter/">resulted in antitrust concerns being raised</a>, and certainly there will be a lot of fight from those concerned how the deal could affect Hollywood.</p>

 <p>Yet, at the same time, Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance and Disney was allowed to buy Fox, so Netflix has plenty of precedent to argue from. As it happens, it could be Paramount that objects the loudest to the Netflix deal, given how it and so many others had assumed it would get Warner eventually, and the company is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/paramount-questions-warner-bros-discovery-sale-process-letter.html">already questioning the “fairness and adequacy”</a> of the process. A Warner attorney wrote, “It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder.”</p>

 <h2>A messy breakup for gaming?</h2> <p>The Netflix deal also makes another aspect of Warner Bros. Discovery more interesting. <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">Zaslav had appeared determined to break up the company</a> such that its linear cable channel businesses would be separated from the rest, and then that loss-making sector take all the company’s debt with it. Because that’s legal I guess. However, while Paramount likely wouldn’t want to end up owning a bunch of profitless cable channels, for Netflix the vast number of new shows to stream could be a real boon. Not only would it have everything on HBO Max, but also be able to strip-mine the remaining cable channels for extra content.</p>

 <p>At the same time, the deal could be very concerning for games players, given <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">Netflix’s very clear backward step from anything other than mobile gaming</a>. Its owning the studios that develop the <em>Arkham</em> and&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games could mean bad times for console players if the pattern continues.</p> <p>There’s obviously a lot of fighting to come, and presumably some hefty legal challenges from those who feel dropped at the altar, let alone the antitrust maneuvers. But given [broad sweeping gesture], it won’t be in the least bit surprising to see it happening sooner rather than later.</p>

Additionally, in this case, there have also been a number of inaccuracies shared over the radio's usage, with some reports incorrectly stating that it includes otherwise exclusive music, or that the bike's main Sol Valley area is silent otherwise. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's true that the Sol Valley's etheral, ambient music is relatively sparse — the desert-like area is meant to be a wasteland, after all, and a notably different environment from the game's main areas that Samus once again explores on foot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some fans have suggested that it would have been nice to have the option of turning on the in-game radio without buying a $29.99 toy, which — while a familiar argument for Nintendo games with amiibo-exclusive features — seems fair enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Couldn't they have given us that jukebox mode in the first place instead of having us buy an accessory to unluck said jukebox mode?" wrote Nintendo fan knightedwolf851 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualnintendo/comments/1pdpg1j/it_seems_you_will_be_able_to_put_music_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>.

"It is a cosmetic that doesn't impact the game.

            <p>Banjo-Kazooie is now playable on PlayStation - at least, a fan-made version created in Dreams - and it's even caught the eye of Rare.</p>
<p>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania has been created by William Butkevicius, and is just a single level made in homage to the N64 platformer. Butkevicius, incidentally, is a level designer at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> developer Moon Studios, who created this project in their spare time.</p>
<p>Butkevicius described it as a "labour of love", but doesn't have plans to add to it. "I'd like to move away from big Dreams projects now, so unless I get the opportunity to work on an official Banjo-Threeie (which I would be thrilled to), this is it for now," Butkevicius wrote on social media. Rare, are you listening?</p>

<p>Well actually, it is. The studio shared Butkevicius' post, stating: "Put our fanciest hat on just so we could tip it to this. Incredible work!"</p>
<p>Gregg Mayles, Banjo-Kazooie's director (who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-director-officially-leaves-rare-following-everwild-cancellation">recently left Rare</a>), also <a href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1996694869297795109?s=20">shared the post</a> calling it "splendid", while <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1996298038286111087?s=20">composer Grant Kirkhope</a> shared it with the googly eyes emoji.</p>

<p>Butkevicius' video shows the iconic bear and bird exploring an island level reminiscent of Treasure Trove Cove - it even has that terrifying shark. There are musical notes and jiggies (30!) to collect, platforming challenges and puzzles, and new characters to meet.</p><p>Perhaps most notable are the new transformations, including a rock golem and a skeletal fish. It took Butkevicius around 14 months and over 800 hours of work to create, adding: "A lot of the concepts were born out of issues I had with the original game, like 'the transformations don't feel fun enough to use', or 'going to the hut to transform is tedious' and then tons of iteration to find good solutions!"</p>
<p>There's some great jaunty music too from composer Duckenomics and brass ensemble The Game Brass, while PieceofCraft assisted with sculpting, animation, and logic.</p>
<p>The original Banjo-Kazooie was released for the N64 27 years ago and the last new release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</a> in 2008 for Xbox 360. It's clear the original game has left a lasting impression, but could we see a new game in the series in future?</p>
<p>It seems unlikely, considering Mayles' recent departure from Rare. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-sequel-chances-better-than-zero-but-not-much-says-composer-grant-kirkhope">Kirkhope also told Eurogamer there's "better than zero but not much" of a chance</a> the bird and bear will return.</p>
<p>The project is also a reminder that Media Molecule's Dreams is still up and running. A report last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dreams-pc-playstation-5-ports-reportedly-canned">claimed PC and PS5 versions of the game were in development</a>, but were later canned.</p>

            <p>The next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> patch will finally remove all glamour restrictions, even though Yoshi-P isn't really a fan of it.</p>
<p>Glamouring essentially allows players to combine the visuals of their favourite armour with the stats of something better - transmog, basically. However, players can only glamour within the Job they're playing as, so your White Mage can wear any other White Mage outfit but can't dress as a Dragoon.</p>
<p>That's all set to change in Patch 7.4, out later this month, which is great news for fashion fans - the real endgame of Final Fantasy 14. However, it seems director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has agreed to the change reluctantly.</p>

<p>The decision not to allow this type of glamour until now wasn't due to technicalities, but Yoshida's personal taste.</p>
<p>"I felt more strongly than anyone else that we had to cherish the Final Fantasy worldview," Yoshida told <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59484">Famitsu</a> (translation via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/ff14s-yoshi-p-reveals-why-hes-finally-lifting-glamour-restrictions-hes-got-his-own-preferences-but-its-no-longer-the-time-to-force-them-on-players/">PC Gamer</a>). "I felt that the way Final Fantasy should be is for Dragoons to be able to equip their character in that style, and to be able to hold their spear and strike the 'Kain pose' [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-iv">Final Fantasy 4</a>'s iconic Dragoon]. It's the job's identity, so to speak. The core of that feeling hasn't changed much even now."</p><p>However, he noted there are "very few games that have the same limitations as Final Fantasy 14 in terms of enjoying fashion", although he added if he were in charge of a free-to-play game he'd naturally want players to buy items without restrictions.</p>
<p>Yoshida has been playing games from other companies and now understands, in this modern era, what players want may differ to his own preference. For instance, he plays as a Black Mage and wouldn't want his character to wear other armour.</p>
<p>"These are my own roleplaying rules, so I have decided them arbitrarily," he said. "I reconsidered and decided that it would be pointless to impede the roleplaying of people who say, 'My character is the coolest and cutest in the world. I want to dress up even more,' by [forcing them to follow] my own rules.</p>
<p>"I'm fine with being particular about my own preferences, and I'm sure there are many others who feel the same way, but that doesn't mean that the system should restrict the motivation of people who are particular about dressing up."</p><p>Another reason for the change is to combat the use of mods. Yoshida has been adamant about not allowing mod-use in Final Fantasy 14, which reached a peak earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-most-controversial-third-party-plugin-used-for-in-game-stalking-has-been-shut-down">a controversial third-party plugin used for in-game stalking was shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Some players used mods to alter their character's appearance - most notably the Mare Synchronos mod, whose creators were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/legal-inquiry-shuts-down-one-of-final-fantasy-14s-most-popular-mods-adding-yet-another-blurry-line-in-the-sand-from-square-enix/">sent a cease and desist earlier this year</a>. Now the game itself has been altered to appease players.</p>
<p>What's more, the change is an offer of goodwill to players. When, anecdotally, the MMORPG has seen a reduction in player count since the release of the less well-received expansion Dawntrail, this change to glamouring will likely be a popular change - and give an extra incentive to explore everything in the game in the search for the right outfit.</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/patch_7_4/">Patch 7.4, Into The Mist</a>, will be released on 16th December, extending the story and bringing various other additions as expected with each patch. Next year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> will host multiple Fan Fest events as it prepares to launch the next expansion, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-us-fan-fest-event-square-enix-accessibility-disabled-players">disabled fans in the US fear their accessibility needs won't be met</a>.</p>

            <p>It looks as though Epic is getting over its aversion to showing male nipples in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion around Fortnite's lack of nipples on its shirtless characters famously began after a Travis Scott concert was held in-game, with the <a href="https://x.com/Fresh/status/1252792137143312384">topless singer sporting some very smooth pecs</a>.</p>
<p>However, you may recall last month, a then-leak revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-homer-simpson-going-to-be-the-first-character-skin-to-get-his-nipples-out-in-fortnite">Homer Simpson would be getting his own nipples out in Epic's shooter</a>, thanks to a skin of the yellow patriarch in his underwear. In Homer's case, his nipples were just two black dots on his chest.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But now it seems Homer was in fact a vessel for change. As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-really-does-seem-to-have-changed-its-nipple-policy-and-now-its-not-just-homer-simpsons-chest-thats-in-the-game">IGN</a>, a new battle pass skin for Carter Wu shows a shirtless Fortnite model complete with actual nipples. Unlike Homer's cartoonish pec specs, though, these nipples are actually (for Fortnite) quite anatomically accurate, with detailed areola.</p>
<p>You can check out how Carter Wu's Fortnite nipples look in the reddit embed below.</p>
<p>So, has Homer Simpson started a new wave of nipples in Fortnite? What a triumph to add to his ever growing list of achievements (I mean, this man has gone to space, become a professional boxer and stopped nuclear meltdowns).</p>

</span></p><p>As for Fortnite more generally, it recently made headlines after players discovered what they believed to be AI-generated images within the game. In a Reddit post entitled "Say 'No' to AI slop, a billion-dollar company should have no problem supporting real artists for real art", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-are-saying-no-to-ai-slop-after-spotting-what-they-believe-are-ai-generated-images-in-game">Fortnite players shared their thoughts on a number of alleged AI-generated images</a>, including in-game posters and sprays.</p>

<p>"AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas"</p>

<figure data-uuid="95589e4db57d8"><a title="Sega Will &quot;Carefully Assess Appropriate Use Cases&quot; When It Comes To AI 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95589e4db57d8/sega-will-carefully-assess-appropriate-use-cases-when-it-comes-to-ai-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/IDWPublishing">Sega / IDW</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>While rivals such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/ea-is-diving-headfirst-into-generative-ai-with-new-partnership">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ubisoft-is-all-in-on-generative-ai-says-its-as-big-a-leap-in-tech-as-the-shift-to-3d">Ubisoft</a> have jumped into the world of Generative AI development with both feet, not every company in the games industry is willing to throw caution to the wind.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A session following its recent Q2 financial results, Sega‘s top brass addressed the use of AI when it comes to making games (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-says-it-will-use-ai-in-game-development-but-only-in-appropriate-use-cases/">VGC</a>) and how it will help tackle the increasing costs of development.</p>
<p>Sega's response was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development, we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI. However, as AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas such as character creation, we will proceed by carefully assess appropriate use cases, such as streamlining development processes."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while Sega certainly isn't against turning to AI to streamline production, it doesn't look like it will be embracing it with quite the same vigour as other companies.</p>
<p>While Generative AI models are powerful tools, they are often trained on the work of artists, musicians, filmmakers<span>, and animators without permission or remuneration. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">Many models have been found to produce</a></span> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">copyright-infringing results with minimal effort.</a></p>
<p>Nintendo has previously stated that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">doesn't currently intend</a> to use Generative AI in its own games, citing "issues with intellectual property rights" as one of the main reasons for avoiding it.</p>

			<p>Will Rockstar's GTA 6 be released before The Elder Scrolls VI? That's the question posed to Bethesda Creative Director Todd Howard <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRzIJQ-CGtt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Power Unlimited</a> on a red carpet for the presentation of the second season of Amazon's Fallout TV series, which airs on Prime Video starting on December 17.</p>



<p>Howard suggested GTA 6 would indeed launch before his studio's next big project. He then went on to profess his great respect and admiration for Rockstar's work.</p>



<p><em><strong>What game do you think releases sooner? Is it GTA 6, is it The Elder Scrolls VI, or is it Fallout 5?</strong></em></p>



<p><em>I got my fingers crossed for GTA 6. </em></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think it will really come next year?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>I do. They are doing an incredible job. I know the folks at Rockstar and I think they are some of the absolute best at bringing a virtual world to life. It's a world that feels like it would go on even if you weren't there.</em></p>



<p>It's high praise from Howard, but then again, gamers who have experience with both franchises are aware of some similarities. While The Elder Scrolls is, of course, a roleplaying game and Grand Theft Auto is not, both try to achieve world simulations that are among the best in the industry.</p>



<p>Regarding the release window prediction, it isn't too much of a shock. Fallout 5 was never a realistic chance, as it remains in pre-production while Bethesda focuses on finishing The Elder Scrolls VI. Plus, it's not even been a whole month since Todd Howard himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that TES VI is 'still a long way off'.</p>



<p>Granted, on that occasion, he also teased that he'd love to make it 'just appear' when it's ready, but the chances that he'll be able to do that before November 19, 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new GTA VI release date</a>, are slim to none. There are still some people who believe Rockstar may delay the next Grand Theft Auto yet another time, but it's unlikely. They've never delayed a game three times in their entire history so far.</p>



<p>As for The Elder Scrolls VI, the track record of Bethesda Game Studios tells us that it took them nearly four years between The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and then another four years between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4 (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its Anniversary Edition to celebrate the 10th anniversary). Sure, Fallout 76 (just <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated</a> with the largest map expansion to date and The Ghoul character from the TV show) launched only three years later, but that was essentially Fallout 4 modded to support multiplayer and set in Appalachia. </p>



<p>Starfield took five years to make, but it happened during COVID and it was also the first sci-fi game made by the developer, not to mention their first new IP in 25 years. They had to create the whole space travel and combat systems. It stands to reason that TES VI will require four years, thus putting its target window to around late 2027. On the other hand, GTA 6 will most likely be released in November 2026, and even if it slips a bit, it wouldn't be delayed beyond the end of Take-Two's fiscal quarter (March 31).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone, raise your glass and let’s make a toast to The FINALS, as it’s quite literally introduced a weapon skin that makes toast as you’re playing a match.</p>



<p>Just when you think you’ve seen every kind of wacky cosmetic in a live-service shooter, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-current-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The FINALS</a> comes along and boots all expectations out of the window and into the kitchen—next to your toaster. If the thrill of killing and scoring points doesn’t satiate your appetite, then a new toast-making skin might.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-finals-players-are-toast-thanks-to-new-skin">The FINALS Players Are Toast, Thanks To New Skin</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A real breadwinner. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve fallen out of love with the P90 or need a new exercise to use it, Embark might interest you with the new Toast &amp; Roast Skin.</p>



<p>When you want to reload, simply insert bread. Hilariously, the longer you fire the gun and the more you burn through your ammo clip, the more the bread will cook—Ergo, the more it will toast.</p>







<p>Should you suddenly be overcome by full, unadulterated, and unfilmed bullet-spewing menace, barreling through a full clip will completely incinerate your toast: Taking it from a well-toasted snack to a charred mess.</p>



<p>It’s a genius skin, and fits in with the arcadey and kooky nature of The FINALS.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It would look out of place in Call of Duty or Battlefield, that’s for sure. Is it your new favorite skin in The FINALS? If you still play The FINALS, what keeps drawing you in compared to all the other new shooters released in 2025?</p>

<p>Is that a psychic crystal embedded in your forehead, or are you just happy to see me?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7c30e4405c23d"><a title="samus Aran Varia Suit Chogokin" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c30e4405c23d/samus-aran-varia-suit-chogokin.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Spirits</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally in the wild (still feels weird to be able to type that) and given that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">another excellent entry</a> in this phenomenal series, you may well be feeling like now's the time for some fancy Metroid merch.</p>
<p>Well, say no more because (and thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/12/03/samus-aran-finally-gets-the-chogokin-toy-she-deserves-next-year/">Forbes</a> for the heads-up) Bandai Spirits has announced a very appealing diecast 'Samus Aran in Varia Suit' model that's got us morphing in and out of ball mode furiously over here. Whatever that means.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, it is very nice. We agree. Standing at 21cm, there's a whole lot of lovely diecast metal here, and with lights accentuating all of the most important and iconic elements, such as Samus' great big cannon (so batteries required). We've also got lots of nice moveable joints, so you can recreate all your most frequent in-game poses (for this writer that's just Samus' death pose).</p>


<p>We've been over <a href="https://tamashiiweb.com/item/15649/?wovn=en">on the official website</a>, and the price is set at 30,800 yen (that's around £148 or $198) and you can also pre-order on the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_A3AA2">official Nintendo site</a>. However! Fly in the ointment klaxon. The pre-orders, which went live yesterday AM, are Japan-only for now. Although we can't see it being very long before you're able to get yourself one imported from either the main Bandai Spirits website or another vendor.</p>
<p>The expected release date for the model is May 2026. Ooooft. It would have looked so good on top of the Christmas tree, too. Maybe next year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cejrwhgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nintendo finally looks set to acknowledge a certain secret character's presence in Donkey Kong: Bananza, fans are taking the moment as further evidence of upcoming, unannounced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As everyone who has completed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong: Bananza</a> will know, the game's final boss is King K. Rool (and if you haven't played the game yet, you should, it's great). While he's hinted at numerous times during the game, King K. Rool's reveal is kept as a late surprise — and Nintendo has hidden the crowned reptile from all of its marketing around the game. That is, until now. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dataminers who have peered into the files of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-today">Nintendo Today</a> smartphone app have spotted that Rool will finally be acknowledged on December 15, when the scaled royal figure is set to star in the software's daily intro animation (as recorded and already visible via the Mario Wiki). And now, fans are putting Rool's reveal together with a certain other event happening in the very near future, along with some previous hints, to suggest we'll be seeing much more of the character very shortly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because, of course, next week is The Game Awards on December 11, and Nintendo has used the show to reveal some more minor announcements in the past — though, it has to be said, not for the past few years. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/108339-amiibo-king-k-rool-super-smash-bros-1200x675-1764928588998.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">King K. Rool.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's an expectation that Nintendo does have DLC for Mario Kart World waiting in the wings, as that game's credits mysteriously include the voice actors for both King K. Rool and Void Kong, Bananza's main villain. Neither character can be found in the game at present, something that's led fans to believe the pair are arriving as part of the racer's first wave of post-launch characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wrapping up 2025 with a DLC drop for Switch 2's launch title that celebrates this year's second-biggest Nintendo release just makes sense, and may help shift a few more Switch 2 consoles ahead of the holidays (not that Nintendo really needs the help).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will King K.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst the veritable sea of announcements (<a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samson</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hello-sunshine-preview-you-the-desert-and-your-giant-robot-best-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intriguing-sci-fi-first-person-bullet-hell-game-luna-abyss-gets-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna Abyss</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-shown-in-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of War IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/survival-pirate-adventure-game-crosswind-gets-rebranded-to-windrose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crosswind/Windrose</a>, to name a few) from the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase, SOL Shogunate certainly stood out among the most impressive.</p>



<p>Small independent developer Chaos Manufacturing reimagines the sci-fi genre in samurai fashion. In this 'space opera action RPG', a powerful shogunate rules a colonized solar system. However, it's about to be challenged by protagonist Yuzuki, the broken heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. With no choice left but to become an outlaw ronin, Yuzuki seeks to carve a bloody path of vengeance with a traditional ronin arsenal reforged for the battlefields of the future. As the game unfolds, new abilities and skill combinations are unlocked, enabling evolving tactics against increasingly challenging foes.</p>



<p>Yuzuki will explore the so-called Lunar Glass cities of SOL Shogunate, where artificial gravity and simulated night-time provide an Earth-like experience for the Moon's inhabitants, who also enjoy infrastructural wonders such as space elevators and high-speed rails. But beneath the bright skylines and opulent districts of the wealthy lie sprawling industrial zones where workers toil unseen to sustain the shogunate's pervasive influence.</p>



<p>According to the people behind SOL Shogunate, each metropolis on the Moon draws inspiration from a different era of Japanese history. To navigate these vertical districts, players must use gravity-assist gear. They will also uncover hidden layers within each biome and discover clues that unlock the mysteries of the game's backstory.</p>



<p>The developers at Chaos Manufacturing have designed combat to be all about precision, timing, and adaptability. Yuzuki is meant to feel like the ultimate space samurai, albeit genetically modified for the future of combat. Players will get to choose between various weapon types and can channel different types of energy into attacks to expose weaknesses, stagger foes, and create new tactical opportunities. As Yuzuki's abilities grow and her enhancements, like bio-ceramic skin and enhanced vision, evolve, new techniques shift how battles flow and how players overcome increasingly dangerous enemies.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The pinnacle of combat encounters are, of course, the boss fights. The studio promises dynamic, cinematic, multi-phase boss encounters that challenge players to identify and exploit weaknesses. Meanwhile, the music changes as battles intensify, featuring dynamic tracks hand-crafted for the game by talented recording artists, including Japanese rock band AliA.</p>



<p>SOL Shogunate is still in early development, but we already know the game will be released on PC and consoles. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> also lists the surprisingly low system requirements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Price, Explained—How Much Does It Cost On PlayStation 5?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-price/</link>
            <guid>1374076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re wondering whether a year-old Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 still has a high price, you might be in for some turbulence. This guide has details on the game’s full price and the different editions you can pick up.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5</a> isn’t a free in-flight meal, far from it. Originally an Xbox and PC title, MSFS 2024 arrives on PS5 with all the updates and content additions that have landed over the last 12-plus months. But don’t think Xbox Game Studios and Microsoft will go easy on you, PlayStation owners.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-cost">How Much Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Standard Edition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 has a fairly routine $69.99 or £69.99 price.</strong></p>



<p>No discount, no price reduction, it’s a full-priced port on PlayStation. It is a premium property with a ton of content, though, so it’s worth the price of admission. When you also consider that this is the first entry in the series’ 40-year history to arrive on PlayStation, it’s quite a significant milestone.</p>



<p>Many will see $69.99 as a fair deal. This is only for the Standard Edition, so is the damage much worse for more expensive packages?</p>







<h2 id="h-all-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-editions-amp-prices">All Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<p><strong>There are four Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 editions for PS5: Standard, Deluxe, Premium Deluxe, and Aviator.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of each edition and what it costs. Warning: The later editions get sky-high with their pricing.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">MSFS 2024 Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th><th data-align="center">Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £69.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-70 Aircraft<br>-150 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £99.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-80 Aircraft<br>-155 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Premium Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £129.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-95 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aviator Edition</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 or £199.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-125 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s up to you if you can justify as much as $200 for the PS5 launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. What do you think of its pricing? Should it be more reasonable? Is $200 too much for simply adding more vehicles and airports?

<p>A new Monster Hunter Showcase is scheduled for December 8, 2025, featuring the title update 4 for MH Wilds and the latest information on MH Stories 3. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-still-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top launches of 2025</a>, but some PC performance issues and content complaints have brought criticism from the community. The developers already confirmed they are working on those issues and have now announced a new showcase that will provide players with details on another free content update for Monster Hunter Wilds and the latest information on their upcoming title, MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-monster-hunter-showcase-on-december-8-2025">How to Watch Monster Hunter Showcase on December 8, 2025?</h2>



<p>Announced through the Monster Hunter <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1996867143057445119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Monster Hunter Showcase will begin on Monday, December 8, 2025, at 2:00 PM PST. Interested readers can tune in to the live stream on the official <a href="https://t.co/WbntyFTmOM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/KNEebgyzzy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> accounts. The developers have also explicitly stated that “For Monster Hunter Wilds, the event will focus solely on Free Title Update 4.” For Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, we might get to see new story details or maybe a gameplay deep dive. Players will have to wait to know for sure. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is set to arrive in March 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. The title is the latest instalment of the RPG series set in Monster Hunter World. Players get to become a rider who can raise and bond with their favourite monsters while exploring a brand new story that involves two countries on a path of destruction and a set of twin Rathalos, a species that was thought to be extinct. Pre-orders for the game went live in October.  </p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> has an official release date of February 11, 2026, executive director and game producer Goichi "Suda51" Suda has revealed. Priced at $50, it'll land early next year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 port also being considered.</p><p>Suda added that the release date could be delayed by up to two weeks if the master copy of the game is rejected up to three times, which would result in Romeo Is A Dead Man launching around the same time as "that title with a big nine" on its box art. Suda is likely referring to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-preorder-guide-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-pc/1100-6535813/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which launches on February 27 next year.

As for the proposed Switch 2 port, Suda51 said this could happen after the game's launch.</p><p>"We've got to make sure it works on PC and the other platforms that have already been decided on," Suda said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grasshopper-wants-to-bring-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-switch-2-but-needs-to-make-sure-the-engine-will-play-nicely-with-it-first/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "And since we're using Unreal Engine 5 for Romeo is a Dead Man, we need to make sure that we can find a way that the engine is going to play nicely with Switch 2, using stuff like Nanite and Lumen and other things--some of them are new to us, some of them them might have issues with Switch 2, with porting and stuff."</p><p>Billed as a third-person adventure, Romeo is a Dead Man puts players in the boots of FBI Space-Time special agent Romeo Stargazer as he hunts down fugitives across the multiverse and searches for his lost girlfriend, Juliet.</p><p>The game's current release date puts it in the middle of a very busy February, as it launches a day before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-kiwami-1-2-0-directors-cut-preorder-guide/1100-6534988/">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> and other highlights that month include Tales of Berseria Remastered, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-fixes-the-originals-painful-slog/1100-6536315/">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-2026-game-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6534725/">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and No Sleep for Kaname Date on PS5.</p>

            <p>If you're a fan of gruff blokes punching goons and putting the pedal to the metal in muscle cars, Samson looks like it'll be up your alley.

<p>Set in a fictional industrial metropolis called Tyndalston, which its leather-jacketed protagonist dubs the "asshole of the world", Samson is about a dude in debt. Each day, this dude wakes up with a daily quota to meet in terms of paying back what he owes to some bad people, a problem that grows worse by the hour unless he takes action.</p>
<p>That action is punching goons in the face or slapping them with improvised weapons as part of Mad Max-ish brawls in alleyways and mini-marts or getting behind the wheel of your all-black muscle car and using it to either race people, ram them off the road, or some combination of both. Police chases will kick off if your punching and driving gets a bit too rowdy, giving you a chance to unleash those skills on some boys in blue.</p><p>As you go, you'll work your way through the different factions of Tyndalston's districts, spending action points to choose which missions you dedicate Samson's limited time to. There's a tale about unearthing the dude's past in the city and saving his family to offer extra motivation to get out there and wreak havoc.</p>
<p>As much as playing a game about having constant money worries might hit a bit too close to home given what the real world's like for the non-rich at the moment, I'm keen to see if Liquid Swords have nailed the satisfying violent rollercoaster ride a game like this usually needs to shine. It looks more along the lines of Mad Max's desert marauding transplanted into an urban spawl than Just Cause's more exotic pinging around a map and blowing shit up, and I'm certainly partial to the former. Here's hoping the gritty city doesn't struggle to seem a bit dull compared to the backdrops Sundberg and co worked with at Avalanche Studios.</p>
<p>Samson's set to release in early 2026 and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/</link>
            <guid>1374046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Liquid Swords, a Swedish developer founded in 2020 by ex Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg, has unveiled their debut game, Samson: A Tyndalston Story, during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase.</p>



<p>About a year ago, the studio had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> the photorealistic visuals of its Unreal Engine 5 open world game. Now, we have received a lot more details. According to the developer, it's going to be a gritty, brutal story.</p>



<p>The protagonist, Samson McCray, is forced to return to the unforgiving streets of the titular city of Tyndalston. He owes some very, very dangerous people a lot of money, and to make sure he returns to pay his debt, these criminals are threatening Samson's sister.</p>



<p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story is based on the simple, yet brutal truth that time is against the protagonist. With every passing day, the debt owed grows with interest. Each job picked by the main character uses up a limited supply of Action Points, and every decision affects how the city treats him, with no do-overs possible. Samson must keep moving forward because standing still makes everything worse.</p>



<p>While one of the features listed is indeed 'open world districts', this is not the type of near-endless open world game where you can stop to explore every nook and cranny without any repercussions. It's a focused story, likely not even too long given that the recommended price is $24.99. Over the course of the narrative, players will learn what broke Samson's family and what it takes to fix it before time runs out.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, Liquid Swords has prepared several systems that will cause Tyndalston to react to what Samson is doing. The police, for example, will push back if the protagonist sows too much chaos on the streets. Moreover, faces, factions, and streets shift in response to Samson's actions.</p>



<p>As you can see in the trailer, fights look very grounded. On-foot combat appears to be focused on brawling, with Samson using momentum, terrain, and improvised tools to take them down. But there's also car combat, with high-speed chases easily turning into collisions, traps, and close-quarters destruction.</p>



<p>The developers also confirmed that Samson: A Tyndalston Story includes a skill tree with over 25 upgrades to shape the main character into the type of fighter preferred by the player.</p>



<p>The game will launch on PC (no other platforms have been confirmed at this time) via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/samson-ab5af7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. It shouldn't be far off, either, with Liquid Swords promising an early 2026 release. </p>



<p>The Epic Games Store already lists the minimum and recommended requirements, although they are oddly missing the CPU:</p>

<p>It’s finally time for PS5 owners to book their ticket to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The title has so far been kept from the blue brand’s main console, but now MSFS 2024 has a PlayStation 5 release date, along with complete start times.</p>



<p>A one-way ticket to the sky beckons for PS5 players. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> took off just over one year ago, and boarded with plenty of Xbox and PC passengers on board. The flight-sim title is the latest in the franchise, and it’s going to be another instance of ‘Xbox Game Studios’ being bizarrely plastered all over a PS5 game.</p>



<p>Here are the official Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 release details for PS5.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches worldwide for PlayStation 5 owners on December 8.</strong></p>







<p>It’s nearly a year to the day since MSFS 2024 debuted on Xbox and PC: November 19, 2024, to be exact. But now it’s time for MSFS to add its name alongside Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War: Reloaded, and the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved as Xbox hits to make the jump to the blue side of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-playstation-5-have-early-access">Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 On PlayStation 5 Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>The PS5 release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 comes with early access for those who pre-order the Deluxe, Aviator Edition, or Premium Editions.</strong></p>



<p>Consider this the gaming equivalent of securing priority boarding on a flight. Early access is out—meaning you don’t need to wait until December 8—and there are more details below on dates and times.</p>

            <p>A sudden update for Armored Core 6 on Steam has spurred hopes among fans of the third-person mecha action game that something big is coming to The Game Awards next week.</p>
<p>The update, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1888160/history/">which can be seen on the game's SteamDB page</a>, shows a change to the application <em>has</em> happened. However, we can't see what has changed. It could be absolutely nothing, <em>or</em> it could be preparation for something substantial… In this murky realm of possibility, a flicker of hope has been lit.</p>
<p>"Babe wake up. Armored Core got another SteamDB update 1 week before the Game Awards," <a href="https://x.com/Etheox/status/1996259179225620778">posts user Etheox on X</a>. It is worth noting of course that Armored Core 6 has received several Steam page updates over this year and no DLC announcements.</p>

<p>The game, while successful, has been left largely alone since its release in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-has-had-its-best-weapons-nerfed">It received an impactful nerf to some of its most powerful weapons</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-now-has-1v1-and-3v3-ranked-online-matchmaking">ranked matchmaking support for both 1v1 and 3v3</a>. Aside from that, it's been left well enough alone, which is a shame! More Armored Core would be a wonderful thing.</p><p>It is worth noting that previous Armored Core games have recieved DLC packs in the past. Take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/armored-core-5">Armored Core 5</a>, which was updated with the Modeler's Pack. This brought a vast number of new AC parts and weapons to the game. While big narrative updates aren't the norm with the series, FromSoftware has proven keen to create such content for its games in recent years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-difficulty-harder-than-main-game-the-forsaken-hollows">Take Elden Ring: Nightreign's recent Forsaken Hollows DLC</a>, an injection of difficult content adding life to the multiplayer spinoff.
</p>
<p>Armored Core 6 was an outstanding game from FromSoftware. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">In Eurogamer's review</a>, Caelyn Ellis wrote: "FromSoftware delivers a superlative action game that builds on its Soulslike pedigree while staying lean and laser-focused."</p>
