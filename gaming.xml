              <p>You want to buy something in a video game. Maybe it’s a battle pass. <a href="https://twitter.com/Wensoing/status/1965755228424425619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Maybe it’s a Sonic skin</a>. Maybe it’s the current <em>Halo</em> Master Chief skin. That one costs 1,500 V-Bucks, but V-Bucks only come in packs of 400 or 1,000. You now have 300 leftover V-Bucks and Epic Games has your extra money. It’s scammy and it sucks. Thankfully, it’s also going away.</p> <p>“Starting October 14, we’re adding an Exact Amount&nbsp;offer to the <em>Fortnite</em> V-Bucks purchasing page that lets you ‘top up’ your V-Bucks balance to the exact amount needed for the item you’re trying to buy,” the company announced on Thursday. “Let’s say you want an item that costs 500 V-Bucks but you only have 400 V-Bucks in your account. You’ll be able to buy just the 100 V-Bucks needed.”</p> <p>The improved payment option is coming to <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> as well, and will be available across Xbox, Switch, PC, mobile, and…not PlayStation 4 and PS5? “We will work to make this available everywhere,” the blog post reads. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Forcing players to buy extra currency by mismatching it with microtransaction prices is a tale as old as digital downloads on console. Platforms like Xbox were once infamous for making players buy games with points instead of real currency, a practice <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/article/2013-08-26-xbox-live-updated-to-real-people-money.html">that didn’t end until 2013</a>. It was such a big deal when it changed that Microsoft made the announcement at that year’s E3.</p> <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s “top-up” option comes a couple of years after Epic reached <a href="https://kotaku.com/fornite-refund-check-file-claim-ftc-settlement-deadline-1851717873">a $245 million settlement</a> with the FTC over “dark patterns” that tricked players into unwanted purchases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was 13, my dad let me drive his car for the first time. It wasn’t on city streets – just in a big, empty parking lot – but I will never forget that’s the day I learned that a car creeps forward even when the driver’s not pressing the gas. Sure, I was only going a few miles an hour, but as a terrified, inexperienced driver, my heart was pounding and I felt totally out of control. I hit the brakes like a kick drum, starting, stopping, starting, and stopping, until I finally got a handle on the machine. It was a steep learning curve; before then, the closest experiences I had to real-life driving were go karts and Mario Kart, and I naively thought my hundreds of laps of motion control steering on Coconut Mall would give me some idea of what to expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strangely, I thought about this memory a lot just a few days ago during my first hands-on demo with Kirby Air Riders. There are certainly a number of similarities: your character moves forward automatically without pressing any buttons, I was going completely off the rails and heavily relying on the brakes until I got the hang of things, and – most notably – my Mario Kart skills didn’t transfer whatsoever. But surprisingly, it was my Smash Bros. muscles that I found flexing instead, with Air Riders feeling like a strange pseudo-sequel to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in the same way that Donkey Kong Bananza gave the Super Mario Odyssey treatment to another franchise. Let me explain.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Masahiro Sakurai Gameography</h3><p>Here's every game that Smash Bros. creator and YouTuber Masahiro Sakurai has directed or designed in his 30-plus year career.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Mario Kart World and Kirby Air Riders were formally revealed for Switch 2 back in April, lots of us have wondered the same thing: “Why is Nintendo releasing two kart racers in the same year?” It’s a fair question, one that even Air Riders director – and the creator of Kirby himself – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakurai-says-kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-in-extremely-smash-bros-style-direct"><u>Masahiro Sakurai posed in his presentation last month</u></a>, joking that it “basically is like Mario Kart,” and one that he even brought up when Nintendo asked him to make Air Riders years ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, it’s an obvious comparison. Mario Kart World and Kirby Air Riders both feature a large roster of characters racing through colorful courses on various karts/machines, as they weaponize a wide lineup of power-ups to try to take first place. It’s easy to see why onlookers (and even Sakurai himself) would question the choice to place both of these games in Switch 2’s first six months on the market. But once I got Air Riders in my hands, I realized that Mario Kart World and Air Riders really don’t play like each other at all, even in their respective racing modes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got to try out the same pair of race courses as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview"><u>our previewer Leanne Butkovic</u></a> did late last month, first speeding through the starter track, Floria Fields, before taking on the more intense Waveflow Waters. I was immediately struck by how <em>fast </em>Air Riders is compared to the GameCube original, where the racing always felt a bit sluggish. It echoes the jump from Smash 64 to Smash Melee: Melee is faster, more competitive, and stacks a ton of new mechanics on top of the original, just as Air Riders does when compared to Air Ride. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difference is that Melee came out two years after the first one, and Air Riders is arriving more than two <em>decades</em> after its original, and it’s honestly really cool to see Sakurai pick up right where he left off, creating an iterative sequel that builds upon and fixes issues of what came before as if no time has passed at all. When Air Riders was first teased, I didn’t know what to expect from a legacy Sakurai sequel as he returned to a series from so long ago, and the answer being that it’s basically a GameCube game, but better, is a pretty cool direction to take. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kirby Air Riders echoes the jump from Smash 64 to Smash Melee.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Air Riders felt like a roller coaster ride at first, as I swung around tight turns and glided through exciting setpieces like a stretch of road with rumbling waterfalls on either side of it. The strategy for these races is nothing like Mario Kart World, where it’s all about knowing your route on the track, crossing your fingers for the right item at the right time, and executing shortcuts when you get the power-up you’re looking for. Air Riders is more about attacking and reacting to your opponents – Nintendo even opened its behind-closed-doors presentation to the media by calling it a “Vehicle Action Game” rather than a kart racer. To play Air Riders successfully, I needed to focus on combat and my opponent’s positioning while racing around the course, both by attacking enemies to charge up my devastating special and following the leader’s exact path to take advantage of the new Star Slide ability that increases your speed when you collect the trail of stars machines leave behind. Once I wrapped my head around these core mechanics, I started to understand that from a gameplay perspective, Mario Kart World isn’t the immediate comparison point for Kirby Air Riders: it’s Sakurai’s other darling, Super Smash Bros.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby Air Riders: Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Smash is technically classified as a fighting game, but it has really carved out its own niche with its focus on advanced platforming and knocking opponents out of the arena rather than depleting a health bar, and the same concept can be applied to Kirby Air Riders. Both Smash and Air Riders exist on the outskirts of their traditional genres, resulting in games that can be intimidating at first glance due to how they defy expectations, but ones that provide shocking mechanical depth to those who heavily invest in their systems. As I said, I was incredibly overwhelmed during my first Air Riders play session, but determined to understand its intricacies, I returned to the demo three additional times during PAX West, gradually getting better and more confident each time. I was reminded of the first time I played an eight-player match of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. It was overstimulating, chaotic, and hard to follow, and I thought there was no way it was a mode I’d ever get attached to. But Sakurai games have a way of drawing you in, and it wasn’t long before eight-player matches became a staple on game nights with friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could see the same thing happening with Air Riders’ City Trial mode, which I’ve now had the chance to play eight times. This returning fan-favorite from the GameCube original drops you into an open city alongside up to 15 other players, giving you five minutes to find a better machine to ride and upgrade, with stats and powerups that spawn throughout the map. At the end of five minutes, you compete in one of a lineup of competitions with the machine you developed which range from seeing who can glide the furthest to the straight-up speed test of a drag race.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Air Riders presents itself as a cute, simple racer, but in reality, it’s a complex action game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Sakurai warning against it in his presentation, I spent my first few City Trial runs gobbling up every power-up I could find, and it resulted in a machine that was way too fast for the minigames that followed. I was completely off the rails, and I initially felt punished for being too greedy during the exploration segment of City Trial. But for subsequent runs, I started being more selective about which power-ups I grabbed and which I left behind, trying to make a machine well-suited for any of the possible minigames that could show up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai’s fingerprints are truly all over Air Riders. From the slick menu and UI design – which is traditionally designed by his wife, Michiko Sakurai – to the dramatic, slow-motion, red and black finish zoom that punctuates destroying an opponent’s machine just like the final knockout in a match of Ultimate. Even the main menu’s basic black title set on a white background is the same style as Ultimate, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaba/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air Riders’ Japanese website</a> could easily be confused with Sakurai’s other series at a quick glance, complete with character renders and alternate costume designs that scream Smash Bros. Each character’s unique special move instantly reminded me of a Final Smash, and the sheer level of polish and attention to detail across every facet of my demo was unmistakably Sakurai.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/airriders-1757609508456.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Rider page on Air Riders' Japanese website is very Smash Bros.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m so interested to see how the public perceives Air Riders when it comes out in a couple of months. It’s more nuanced than it appears, and for that reason, I don’t think Air Riders demos very well to people playing it for the first time. I spent about two hours watching various groups demo it at PAX West, and the vibe of players felt very familiar to my very first hands-on session: overstimulated, overwhelmed, and generally confused. Air Riders presents itself as a cute, simple, approachable racer that only uses the control stick and a couple of buttons, but in reality, it’s a deep, complex action game that demands your full attention. That tough, contradictory first impression, combined with the surface-level comparisons to Mario Kart, and Air Riders’ hefty $70 price tag, makes me worried that people won’t give it the time of day when it launches in November. I hope not, because after meeting Air Riders on its own terms and working across several demo sessions to understand it, I walked away very excited for a fascinating sequel from one of my favorite creators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

One conspicuous absentee here is PlayStation — and while Epic does not state why Sony's consoles will not initially support the feature, it has said it's working to make the offer available "everywhere".</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/fortnite-exact-amount-purchasing-offer-1757607311797.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite's Exact Amount purchase screen. Image credit: Epic Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An example image of how it will work, above, as published today on Fortnite's website, shows a player with 600 V-Bucks being offered the ability to buy the remaining 400 V-Bucks required to purchase a 1,000 V-Bucks item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where previously the player would have had to buy a whole other 1,000 V-Bucks pack (and be left with an unused 600 V-Bucks balance after their purchase), the Exact Amount method offers a way to only pay for the V-Bucks that are required.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there are still advantages to buying V-Bucks in bulk, and the conversion rate offered for the 400 V-Buck top-up looks to be a straight 100 V-Buck to $1 price. That compares to buying a 1,000 V-Buck pack for $9, or spending even more on larger V-Buck packs and getting even more V-Bucks included.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games hasn't said why it is adding this feature now, or why it is launching the offer in general. But it's certainly an interesting step for Fortnite and the publisher's other titles to take — and one that others around the industry will likely be watching. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the advantage to developers of making players pay for more currency than they might need is that players then end up spending more. After that, players are also left with a remaining balance, that they may then decide to put towards something else — and so the cycle continues. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> boss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-bundle-containing-fortnite-skin-is-an-ebay-investment-randy-pitchford-suggests-even-though-account-trading-risks-a-ban">Randy Pitchford suggested</a> that the game's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-it-actually-worth-preordering-borderlands-4-or-should-you-wait">pre-order bundle</a>, which contains a free Fortnite skin, could become a worthwhile investment for players.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival - Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Barker is also involved in the project, as Saber says that he was consulted on the story written for the game. "We're trying to portray all the gore and horror that is present in the films, violence, sexuality, everything," associate game director Aleksandra Pelivanović <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-game-is-as-nsfw-as-its-creators-original-vision/1100-6534252/">explained to GameSpot recently</a>. "It was really important for us to catch every key element of the franchise and put it in the game in the right context. And when we sent Clive the final draft for the storyline, he was like, 'Yes, that's Hellraiser!'"</p><p>According to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, an M rating is usually reserved for games that feature "realistic depictions of violence, blood and gore, sexual content," as well as the "frequent use" of profane and vulgar language. In terms of pure gore, the recent Mortal Kombat games have received this rating, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RyFMmcrRkc8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mortal Kombat 1 pushed the envelope for digital violence</a> with several stomach-churning fatalities.</p><p>The fighting game featured characters being brutally dismembered in a variety of ways that were rendered in vivid detail, so you can only imagine just how far Saber can go--along with the erotic themes present in the Hellraiser material--before it risks earning an Adults-Only rating.</p><p>Following a series of cryptic teasers, Hellraiser: Revival was officially revealed in July and it'll launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Pinhead actor Doug Bradley will reprise his iconic role and provide the voice of the Cenobite--though sadly, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNq0n22JySe" rel="nofollow ">not in a scouse accent</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> launched last week and immediately saw its highest engagement on PC via Steam. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyl32gelvc2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana's US Player Engagement Tracker</a>, over 7% of active Steam users played Silksong on launch day, ranking it as the third-most-played game overall, just behind Helldivers II and Counter-Strike 2. It should be noted that it was on Steam that the original Hollow Knight gained its loyal following.</p><p>"It was anticipated that Hollow Knight: Silksong would have the highest initial appeal with the core enthusiast audience, particularly on PC. So far, that seems to have been the case," Circana's Mat Piscatella added. "On console, being on Game Pass certainly appears to have helped boost launch-day engagement on Xbox."</p><p>Looking at the stats for Xbox, Silksong managed to secure over 2% engagement, placing it at 12th overall. Now, this metric reflects active players, not total downloads or interest--so plenty may have grabbed it for later. PlayStation, on the other hand, saw under 1% engagement, coming in at a distant 55th place, but it was not available via any services like it was on Xbox. Without access to Nintendo platform data--which Circana's tracker currently doesn't cover--it's hard to gauge what could be the actual biggest player base in the future, especially since the original Hollow Knight had a huge Switch following as well.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has only been out for a week, but the buzz was so strong around the sudden launch that several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">indie studios pushed back their own release dates</a> to avoid being swallowed in Hornet's shadow. It's rare for a non-AAA game to shift the calendar for others, but that's the kind of cultural weight Silksong carries in the indie space.</p><p>While the data is just a snapshot of opening-day engagement, the full weekly rankings are set to be released on Monday. Then we'll get a clearer picture of just how far Silksong's reach is--but if this early data is any indication, it's off to a very strong, PC-first start.</p>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows' latest title update, numbered <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv">update 1.1.1</a>, has officially gone live today, with Ubisoft adding a slew of changes ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-plus-dlc-claws-of-awaji-release-date/">Claws of Awaji</a> expansion's launch on September 16, a new story quest for players to delve into, and new Ezio Auditore da Firenze-themed cosmetics for players to acquire through a new Animus HUB project.</p>



<p>The new quest being added sees you follow Junjiro in his quest to learn more about the Bo staff and find a legendary Bo master. You get your own Bo staff at the end of the quest, while this quest is free for all players, that wasn't always the case, as Ubisoft reveals it was initially designed as part of the Claws of Awaji expansion. Somewhere along the way, though, Ubisoft decided it shouldn't lock the weapon behind the Claws of Awaji paywall, or as Ubisoft puts it in its blog post "<em>we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone.</em>" While update 1.1.1 is live now, this quest and the Bo staff will arrive alongside the expansion on September 16.</p>



<p>What is live today is a level cap increase, improved scouts, new upgrades for your hideout, enhanced gear quality, the ability to advance the time of day, a slew of bug fixes, and a new Animus HUB project called Project Sanctuary, which grants players the Ezio-themed cosmetics for you and your cat.</p>

<p>When the Claws of Awaji expansion arrives, it'll add a new island region to explore, a new faction to face, the aforementioned Bo staff, new gear, abilities, and of course, a new storyline to follow and uncover. This expansion is the final step in Ubisoft's previously revealed summer roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows. </p>



<p>Once it's out, we should start to hear what Ubisoft has planned next for the game soon, since, at least for the foreseeable future, Ubisoft will continue to support what has been one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">best-selling games</a> of the year so far across the industry and not just for Ubisoft. </p>

                <p>Flash games were everywhere in the late '90s and early 2000s, as they were an easy way to play games on the internet, no downloads required. Unfortunately, many of these games are now lost due to Flash having been discontinued in 2020, but others were lost even before then as they were harder to preserve. One such game was actually from the fictional musical group Gorillaz called Kong Studios, and in a bit of a surprise move, the game has been brought back to life.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Kong Studios arrived on the internet in 1998, and was the fictitious recording studio that Gorillaz made their albums in. You could wander round the studio, listen to some music, and discover hidden secrets, but the game was shut down in 2008. Except now it's back!</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdeoTsDrj9Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BdeoTsDrj9Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The news was shared on the official Gorillaz YouTube channel, and if you head to the <a href="https://kongstudios.gorillaz.com/" rel="nofollow ">site</a> you can play a game inspired by the music video for Clint Eastwood where you have to fend off, well, gorillas in a first-person-shooter-style perspective as you make your way to Kong Studios.</p><p dir="ltr">If that's not your jam, you can just skip it and head to Kong Studios itself, which has had a bit of a revamp with some new graphics and art. An <a href="https://gorillaz.com/Kongstudiosfaqs/" rel="nofollow ">FAQ page</a> explains that this version of Kong Studios is "the home of Gorillaz and a gamified fan experience where you can explore the rooms and spaces of 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel. It’s also a place to go to find out everything you want to know about Gorillaz, first." That last line certainly implies news about future projects will be revealed on the site before anywhere else.</p><p dir="ltr">Gorillaz fans also might want to juke out the jukebox in Kong Studios, as it features a teaser for a new song called The Happy Dictator. Or you can just listen to Feel Good Inc. for presumably the 1000th time.</p><p dir="ltr">Gorillaz, while made up of fictional members, is the project of Blur frontman Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The group's next album is scheduled to release in 2026.</p>

<figure><a title="Ragebound" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5d135f14b942b/ragebound.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Dotemu and The Game Kitchen have released a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, adding in a whole bunch of new features, fixes, and improvements.</p>
<p>Perhaps most crucially, however, is the addition of a new performance mode targeting 60fps, but there's a catch... As detailed in <a href="https://x.com/Dotemu/status/1966139635454849150">Dotemu's announcement post</a>, the game will default at 30fps on the Switch, while it's recommended that only those on the Switch 2 activate the 60fps option.</p>
<p>There's also a really cool CRT filter available for those who really want to relive the good ol' days. Both this and the frame rate option is available by navigating to 'Options' and 'Video' via the menu.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067poyhkx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the Hard Mode being unlocked by finishing the game for the first time, you may unlock it earlier by winning the duel against Ryu on level 1-1. If you want to leap right away to Hard Mode, you will first have to prove yourself worthy of the challenge!</p>

<li>Added support for DirectInput controllers.</li>
<li>If Kumori were to perform a roll attack whilst wearing the Black Spider Uniform, the default skin would be displayed during the animation.</li>
<li>Removed invisible ceiling on level S-6 on Hard Mode, near the end of the tree section.</li>

<li>On level 5-1 you could lose control of Kenji or Kumori when starting Rhyvahsi’s fight.</li>
<li>On level 5-1, a long wait time was present after defeating Rhyvashi.</li>
<li>Kenji could climb over a wall and skip part of the level, causing camera issues on level 3-5 on Hard Mode.</li>

<li>On level 3-2 on Hard Mode, a Hanging Demon enemy could end up frozen and unable to attack.</li>
<li>Level 4-4 boss shockwave projectiles could appear in the air rather than on a surface.</li>
<li>Striking Level 4-4 boss in the back with a Hypercharge attack pushed it to the other edge, making it behave incorrectly.</li>
<li>During the elevator section on level 4-4, drone enemies could attack Kenji while being outside the camera.</li>
<li>Bio Blocker's enemy projectile hitbox remained active after being killed.</li>
<li>On level 3-2, during the Eels boss fight, the camera could be unlocked if Kenji reached a low point of the arena.</li>
<li>Gurthka’s landing animation could not work properly when the boss fight started on levels 1-2 and 1-3.</li>
<li>Jagäzk’s ribcage was immune to the Grenade Spider Weapon.</li>
<li>On level 4-2, you could leave the camera bounds by using guillotine boosts on a helicopter.</li>
<li>Kumori’s Hypercharged roll-jump kunai projectile could traverse an enemy without hitting it.</li>
<li>On level S-8, a guillotine boost platforming section could be skipped by climbing a wall and moving through the ceiling.</li>

<li>Kenji could clip through the subway tunnel's ceiling during his epilogue.</li>

<li>Exiting the credits from the main menu caused the music to reset and make the portraits not move properly.</li>
<li>Many other performance improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Ragebound's frame rate was one of our biggest gripes when we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/ninja-gaiden-ragebound">reviewed it</a> back in August, and although those on the Switch might not benefit all that much from the patch, Switch 2 owners can now enjoy the game at a (mostly) silky-smooth 60fps. Glorious.</p>

            <p>The future of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> series will see multiplayer bits pushed "more predominantly", according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. The exec said this thing on stage at a conference in Saudi Arabia last month (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Game File</a>), around the same time he announced the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC the company have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">partnered with the Saudi government on</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked about the future of the series that brought us that one scene where the pirate guy talks about the definition of insanity before kicking you into a big hole, Guillemot said that the publishers' goal "on Far Cry [is] really to bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed, so that it can also be played for a long time by players."</p>
<p>Yves, believe me, you can play a single player game for a very long time. His comments come a couple of years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-working-on-far-cry-7-and-separate-far-cry-multiplayer-spin-off-game-says-report">reports claiming</a> that Ubisoft were working on both the next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-7">Far Cry 7</a>, and a multiplayer-only spin-off. Kotaku's report at that point alleged Far Cry 7 will see the series move on from the Dunia engine, in use since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a>. The muliplayer game was claimed by Insider Gaming to be an extraction shooter set in the Alaskan wilderness.</p>
<p>While Far Cry's always been more of a single-player romp of explosions and bullets for me, though the last couple of entries have obviously featured plenty of co-op in addition to traditional online multiplayer. I can't recall the matches and modes themselves being anything exceptional, if still fun. However, the map editors they came with were brilliant if, like me, you were a 15-year-old who liked building houses and hideouts, but reckoned getting really into Minecraft would be the final nail in your secondary school cool factor coffin.</p><p>Then again, maybe I'm not the person to ask given I've still not given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a> a go, despite having played every other entry since 2. I just keep forgetting 6 exists, then remembering, reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/far-cry-6-review">reviews</a>, and concluding that it's probably not worth it until the next sale, by which point I've forgotten again. Far Cries 2 and 3 were the shooter's peak in my book, at their best when you were setting half of Africa on fire just to kill three guys or blowing an outpost into the sea. My dad, meanwhile, swears by the original and caveperson spin-off Primal.</p>
<p>I'd interrupt his latest Horizon: Zero Dawn playthrough to ask if he'd care about a multiplayer-only Far Cry, but I think I know what the answer'd be.</p>

              <p>All of that wall-rattling bass and gigantic surround sound coming from your expensive home theater audio setup is impressive, but if you’re watching a movie or TV show and you can’t make out the dialogue, what good is it? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus that’s on sale right now for just $180</a> makes those voices come through loud and clear while it puts money back in your pocket.</p>
<p>This limited-time deal takes $70 off the price of this compact, plug-and-play 3.1-channel soundbar that brings Dolby Atmos and DTS:X sound to any TV, and is also Bluetooth compatible so you can hear your favorite playlists and podcasts with the same brilliant, clear sound.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>From Box to Boom in Minutes</h2>
<p>You don’t need to be a high-end audiophile or electrician to get the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus working within minutes of unboxing. Just connect it via the included cable into your TV’s HDMI eARC/ARC port, plug it into an AC outlet, and turn it on. The audio instantly moves from your TV’s built-in speakers to the soundbar, and if you’re connecting it to a Fire TV, you can use the remote control you already have to control both the TV and the soundbar — no coding or pairing necessary.</p>
<p>The compact 37-inch length and and light 8.8-pound weight of the Fire TV Soundbar Plus make it a natural fit on a mantelpiece below your wall-mounted big screen, or if you’re placing it on a TV stand, it’s low-profile enough to not block the screen. At that size and weight it’s also an easy speaker to mount to the wall. Wherever you end up placing it, the 3.1-channel sound is perfect for filling the room with rich, immersive sound without rattling the walls.</p>



<h2>All-Content Friendly</h2>
<p>The Fire TV Soundbar Plus’s voice-dedicated center channel ensures that you hear what’s being said, even during an action movie or live sports event, but that’s not coming at the expense of the rest of the sound. Four listening modes — Movie, Music, Sports, and Night — are all optimized to bring you the right sound mix at the right time. Connect your music source via Bluetooth and enjoy the extended bass from the built-in subwoofer, and hear the on-field ambient sound and roar of the crowd during the game while still hearing the play by play.</p>
<p>You don’t need to break the bank or break the walls of your home to wire up that monster surround-sound system in order to enjoy clear, high-quality sound. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Not while Amazon’s running this great deal on their Fire TV Soundbar Plus — it’s just $180 right now in a limited-time deal you will not want to miss.</a></p>

Yes, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has finally been released — leaving fans searching for a fresh game to pin all their hopes and inevitable disappointment on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> release date seeming fairly assured, fans are suggesting some of Nintendo's second-tier series to hope for next. This includes Star Fox (missing in action since 2017's Star Fox 2), Golden Sun (sunset in 2010) and F-Zero (which has only seen the bitesize release of F-Zero 99 since 2004). And <em>what about Mother 3</em>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, tomorrow's Nintendo Direct will likely feature non-Nintendo games too. Is it time to hope for news on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, Ubisoft's space-set sequel that now holds the Guinness World Record for the video game longest in development? You never know. (You probably do know.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week's big Nintendo Direct airs tomorrow, Friday September 12, at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern or 2pm UK time. It's set to be a bumper show, too, with an hour of announcements — and fan hopes of some big reveals by Nintendo are high. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this year (and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still slated for 2025, last we checked) we know relatively little of what Nintendo has cooking for Switch 2. There's spinoff Splatoon: Raiders and FromSoftware exclusive The Duskbloods. But beyond those, Nintendo's plans for the future remain under wraps.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nightmare Foxy (@NightmareFoxxyy) <a href="https://twitter.com/NightmareFoxxyy/status/1963291102536245697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light">— Cibles (@CiblesGD) <a href="https://twitter.com/CiblesGD/status/1965782505212309680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of a Direct tomorrow is also interesting — as many fans have pointed out — as it comes on the eve of Super Mario Bros.' 40th anniversary. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-in-the-super-mario-bros-35th-anniversary-direct-super-mario-3d-all-stars-mario-64-sunshine-galaxy-3d-world">Nintendo celebrated the game's last big birthday with a series of special launches</a>, including the time-limited Super Mario 3D All-Stars Collection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we see something similar announced tomorrow (hopefully including Galaxy 2)? Or a glimpse of the next major 3D Mario game? Or how about some news on next year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/untitled-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel">Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel</a>? Tune in tomorrow to find out what is there, as IGN reports live. (No one suggest Silksong 2.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, a former Nintendo employee claimed that the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-no-real-need-for-new-franchises-veteran-says-and-can-just-pick-whatever-existing-series-fits-new-gameplay">knew it no longer needed to create as many fresh franchises</a> — as fans were already waiting long enough for new entries in existing series, which could simply be adapted to fit new gameplay styles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>If you're looking for an alternative handheld controller for Nintendo Switch 2, popular third-party manufacturer GameSir just launched a new budget-friendly option that's worth checking out.

Another advanced feature is dual trigger modes. The Hall Effect triggers can move linearly like a regular controller, or you can lock them as rapid-fire buttons. Speaking of rapid-fire, there's also a turbo function that can be assigned to the face buttons, bumpers, or triggers. It also has 6-axis motion controls and a conventional, 4-way D-pad.</p><p>With GameSir's free mobile app, you can adjust stick and trigger sensitivities as well as the intensity of the dual rumble motors.

			<p>Per Famitsu's sales records published by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/famitsu-sales-9-1-25-9-7-25">Gematsu</a>, the PlayStation 5 has surpassed<strong> 7 million units sold in Japan</strong> as of September 7, 2025.</p>



<p>After the console hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million units shipped last month,</a> this is the latest hardware milestone reached, with an estimated 7,009,937 units sold in Japan between the PlayStation 5 Pro and the digital and physical versions of the base PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>It's leagues above the Xbox Series family of consoles, which have, according to the same list of Famitsu's latest numbers, sold only an estimated 682,927 units between the Xbox Series X/S, and is starting to catch up with the PlayStation 4, which has sold approximately 7,929,886 units in its lifetime.</p>



<p>The fact that PlayStation 5 is already catching up to the PS4 in the region shows how strong sales are in Japan for this current generation, though by that same token, it also shows just how strong the PlayStation 4's presence was in Japan, and how the PS5 continues to lag behind its predecessor in Japan, and across the world. And recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price increases to the console across the globe</a> certainly won't help move units. </p>



<p>That said, when it comes to videogame console sales in Japan, PlayStation continues to be dwarfed by Nintendo and its family of consoles. The Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold an estimated 1,980,483, while the Nintendo Switch has sold an estimated 35,969,655 since 2017.</p>

            <p>Where do you go after making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dorfromantik-review-pc">Dorfromantik</a>, the 14th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">best puzzle game</a> on PC? Unto infinity, chick. Unto infinity, and all the uranium-packed celestial masses it contains. Berlin-based Toukana Interactive are back with Star Birds - another “soft strategy” sim and laidback resource management game, in which you take charge of an avian asteroid-mining operation. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>The just-released early access build endeared itself to me instantly by having my bird captain quack like an Apple Macintosh, then sealed the deal with a procession of delightfully rotatable space boulders, some of which look like spangly Easter eggs and some of which look like handfuls of Emmental. Don’t call this a review, mind – I’ve barely played an hour, and the game won’t leave early access until at least this time next year – but I get the feeling Toukana are onto a good thing here. Another nice flourish: optional supply quests are presented as little dovecot windows from which a feathery Wesley Crusher peeks forth, waiting for you to accept their errand.

<p>An overview: Star Birds is broken into missions narrated by a cast of wisecracking astral warblers. The abundance of text dialogue is slightly stifling, for a puzzle game, but I suspect it’ll taper off beyond the initial tutorial sections. Each mission sees you parking your mothership next to a new asteroid field, and zooming on individual asteroids to build things and set up a production network. It starts with you socketing a launchpad into a crater, placing excavators on resource fields, and linking them to your launchpad with pipes to shuttle resources back to the mothership. 
</p><p>As the levels and story progress, you unlock and research new facilities, including chem labs that combine two kinds of resource into one. You’ll rarely find every resource you need for the quest at hand on any one asteroid. So you must build landing sites for rockets, and start moving resources between asteroids. All of this proceeds at a leisurely pace: no hazards, no mission timer.
</p>
<p>The UI consists of phat, pastel, pressable buttons that are begging for a touchscreen port. Pretty much every action is performed with the mouse. It feels like they’re treading a delicate line between efficiency and whimsy in terms of the controls, I must admit. I can imagine being annoyed by the act of dragging out snarls of pipework between structures, in a game with more threat or urgency, particularly because pipes can’t overlap. You'll probably have to go back and unravel them, whenever you need to alter the layout of your roids.
</p>
<p>In the context, though, I find the slight tangliness attractive. This is a factory sim that also wants to be a toy, and has so far stuck the landing. If you’re short of credits for construction, you can also pop down a buggy and drag out a path for it between piecemeal gold outcrops.
</p>
<p>I suspect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> players might find Star Birds too fussy, next to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dorfromantik-review-pc">bucolic immediacy</a> of popping down six-sided tiles, but people who loved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> and have at least a tolerance for ornithology puns should enjoy this. As may people who liked the vibe of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cobalt-core">Cobalt Core</a>, at the risk of setting a roguelike amongst the pigeons. You can find Star Birds on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> actually have better cheat protection? Is another big Nintendo leaker getting overly zealous before the coming Thwomp stomp? Why does Ubisoft want to shove PVP multiplayer back into <em>Far Cry</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I was up until 3:00 a.m. ET last night grinding the Depths in <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s new Deep of Night mode</a>. Who knew the answer to my<em> Destiny 2</em> burnout was an even more punishing loot chase that resets every 45 minutes?</p> <h2>Why are there so many leaks at Nintendo?</h2> <p>That’s what former Nintendo of America marketing staffers Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang ask <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vjxo31uVog">on their latest video</a> breaking down recent rumors about the upcoming Nintendo Direct. “They really do run a pretty tight ship on the first-party side still like we were saying,” Yang says. “Like, you’ve literally got the fear of God and being fired from your job. That fear was really real at Nintendo and you know we joke around about the Nintendo ninjas, like this is actual employees at the company. That is their job to investigate leaks. They’re a team at Nintendo that gets paid to do this and they are very elite. They’re very good at their jobs and and they will solve these cases.”</p> <p>The pair said a recent <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-leaks-mario-re7-smash-bros-2000624779">series of leaks from a user called SwitchForce</a> reminds them of Pyoro, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772">an infamous leaker</a> who appeared to be using a source with access to the backend of Nintendo’s websites to get information early. Pyoro later leaked his own source to <em>Bloomberg</em>, failed to break any more news after Nintendo changed how its new game pages go live online, and all but disappeared from the video game leaker-verse.</p>

 <p>“We all know what happened to Pyoro,” Ellis says. “So, I think just a word of advice to SwitchForce is be careful because, you know, yes, this can be an exciting thing of like, oh my gosh, everybody’s on pins and needles for my next update. You’re on pins and needles until you get that phone call or somebody shows up at your door and you disappear.”</p> <h2><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> will make progress in the war on cheating</h2> <p>That’s what Activision is promising <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05-reloaded#prompts">in its latest blog post</a>. It outlines how Ricochet anti-cheat features like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 will help prevent more players from ruining matches with aim-botting and other exploits. “RICOCHET Anti-Cheat uses Remote Attestation, a process that verifies critical PC security settings directly with Microsoft, as part of its implementation of TPM 2.0,.” the company writes.</p>

 <p>It continues, “Other games may lean on Client or Local Attestation, where the system checks itself and reports back. The limitation with that method is clear: cheats can sometimes disguise or manipulate what’s being reported, effectively tricking the local system into giving a false ‘all clear.’ By contrast, Remote Attestation places the verification step with an external, trusted authority, making it exponentially harder for tampered machines to pass as legitimate.”</p> <p>Cheating will still be a thing online, but Activision says it’s getting better. “What matters, and where we’ve seen real improvement, is how quickly we adapt,” it writes. “In <em>Black Ops 6</em>, detections are faster, mitigations are stronger, and enforcement is cutting deeper into the networks that try to harm fair play. With <em>Black Ops 7</em>, hardware protections like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 will add another layer of defense.”</p>

 <h2>Ex-Pokémon Company lawyer thinks developers will just ignore Nintendo’s latest patent</h2> <p>The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">recently acquired another patent</a> for what sounds <a href="https://x.com/inkydojikko/status/1965804322081722834">like the auto-battling feature</a>&nbsp;from its most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvNJKIG51g8&amp;t=5">recent<em> Pokémon Violet</em> and <em>Scarlet</em> games</a>. It comes amid the ongoing legal fight with PocketPair over <em>Palworld</em>, but could seemingly have repercussions for lots of other creature collecting games. Or maybe not. “I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art,” former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company Don McGowan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. “This isn’t <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-now-allowed-auxiliary-mini-games-during-loading-screens">Bandai Namco with the loading screen patent</a>.”</p> <h2>A 2023 shooter finally gets a kill-cam, but not on Xbox Series S</h2> <p>Free-to-play multiplayer FPS <em>The Finals</em> has received a familiar feature nearly two years after launch, but only for the most powerful consoles (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-finally-gets-a-killcam-but-not-on-xbox-series-s-ps4-and-certain-pc-builds">via <em>IGN</em></a>). “We had to calculate everything that matters: player movement, environmental destruction, object interactions in a level of data fidelity that’s hard to pull off in a Dynamism Shooter,” Embark Studios writes in <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/800">a new season 8 blog post</a>. “Then take all that info and quickly reconstruct the moment.” Microsoft usually requires feature parity between current-gen console versions, but has been bending the rules more and more. <em>The Finals</em>‘ kill-cam won’t be on PS4 either.</p>

 <h2>A tiny new update just sneaked out for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/503961862016073928">Patch 2.31</a> has fixed AutoDrive so that cars will now drive more smoothly when taking players to their destinations. No more getting stuck behind other cars or jerking to a stop at lights. Johnny also no longer always spawns in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service. Plus, the Photo Mode is gender neutral when it comes to poses now. My favorite bug fix? The Yaiba Semimaru no longer flips over during the Motorbreath chase, which was breaking the quest.</p> <h2><em>Far Cry</em> will push multiplayer more in the future</h2> <p>That’s according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot who recently spoke at Saudi Arabia’s New Global Sport Conference. “On<em> Far Cry</em>, it’s really to bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed so that it can also be played for a long time by players,” he said, according to <em>Game File</em>. Alongside the unannounced <em>Far Cry 7</em>, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/">also reportedly been</a> working on a <em>Far Cry</em> extraction shooter spin-off. Unlike <em>Far Cry 5</em>, which had an entire map editor for multiplayer, <em>Far Cry 6</em> backed away from online PVP gameplay.</p> <p>But wait, what was Guillemot doing in Saudi Arabia to begin with? He was there to publicly reveal a Saudi-based DLC for <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>, among other things. Is it funded by Saudi Arabia’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">controversial Public Investment Fund</a>? Ubisoft won’t say one way or the other. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia"><em>Game File</em> notes</a> that the person on stage interviewing Guillemot said, “Well, congratulations on the deal. It sounds very exciting.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/school-shooting-gun-violence-video-games-rfk-jr-2000624665">RFK partly blames video games for school shootings just days before new ones hit the headlines</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/its-the-perfect-time-to-play-assassins-creed-shadows-2000624758">Here’s why it’s a good time to go finish <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-reviews-team-cherry-2000624674">Steam reviewers can’t believe how stingy <em>Silksong</em> is</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sword of the Faithful. <a href="https://t.co/dL9erhNJdC">pic.twitter.com/dL9erhNJdC</a></p> <p>— The Lord of the Rings (@TheRingsofPower) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRingsofPower/status/1965822642016997550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
