            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks back, I got the chance to sit in on a press-only preview for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>set, Edge of Eternities! Now that the first batch of preview cards has just been released on MTG's official stream, we can share the exciting new images for the space-themed set - so follow along as we blast off and explore the unknown with our Edge of Eternities Preview!</p>

<p>Let's start by diving into new mechanics for this set - and showing off cards for each.</p>

<h2>Edge of Eternities Preview: How do Spacecraft, Planets, and Station work?</h2>

<p>New to the set are the terms Spacecraft and Station - Spacecraft is a new Artifact subtype, Planet is a new non-basic land subtype, and Station is an activated ability that Spacecraft and some Planets have that help them turn into Creatures.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edge-of-eternities-preview-spacecraft-planet-and-station.jpg?itok=ywrcHrhM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edge-of-eternities-preview-spacecraft-planet-and-station.jpg?itok=TKKuOD1g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the official mechanics document provided to us by Wizards, (and written by designer Matt Tabak), "Station is an activated ability that can be activated only as a sorcery, meaning during your main phase when the stack is empty. To activate the station ability, tap an untapped creature you control other than the Spacecraft itself... this can be any untapped creature you control, include one that came under your control this turn. As that ability resolves, put a number of charge counters equal to that creatures power on the Spacecraft."</p>

<p>The same applies to Planets with the station ability, except that, as you can see above, the Planets we've seen so far don't turn into creatures, but rather unlock more mana abilities when they hit their Station threshold.</p>

<p>Also as a helpful reminder, Vehicles and Spacecraft with a printed power and toughness&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;now be your commander!</p>

<h2>Edge of Eternities Preview: How Does Warp Work?</h2>

<p>Warp, just like the form of travel we see in so many of our favorite sci-fi stories, is a way to get cards onto the battlefield faster!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/untitled-presentation-1.jpg?itok=rbX4bN4j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/untitled-presentation-1.jpg?itok=iZJeLORd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Permanents with Warp (and while they're mostly found on creatures, any permanent can have a Warp cost) allow you to cast them from your hand for their warp cost and exile it at the beginning of the next end step - remember, you can't cast for Warp as an instant ability unless the card has flash - which means these cards will usually have a nice enter the battlefield effect.</p>

<p>I especially like Nova Hellkite, pictured above, which let's you zoom in for two and red with this 4/5 flier with haste, and it pings for 1 damage to a creature an opponent controls. That's going to really move the needle, allowing you to scoot in with it, swing in the air, and then effectively hide until a later turn!</p>

<p>I really like this approach, and there are even cards that will care about cards in exile, like a brand new 'goyf!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edge-of-eternities-cosmogoyf.jpg?itok=H6ZeOMw2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edge-of-eternities-cosmogoyf.jpg?itok=MiyL_hCl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Edge of Eternities Preview: How Does Void Work?</h2>

<p>Void is another new mechanic in Edge of Eternities that triggers if a permanent left the battlefield this turn&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;if a card was warped this turn. We've seen other abilities kind of like this before, like the&nbsp;"Morbid" ability from Innistrad which triggered when a creature died this turn - but I like Void's inclusion of leaving the battlefield, which doesn't rely on cards hitting your yard.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edge-of-eternities-void-cards.jpg?itok=4Gvyc-wY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edge-of-eternities-void-cards.jpg?itok=mfuPjUyQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the above examples, we can see how a creature benefits from Void - creating an artifact creature at your end step when Void triggers, and as a sorcery, turning a pretty solid -2/-2 for one black into a super-charged -10/-10 if Void conditions were met.</p>

<p>It's clear just how important exile is going to be for this set, and I think that's just so thematically on-par with the whole sci-fi vibe!</p>

<h2>Edge of Eternities Preview: What in the World are Lander Tokens?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>To help explain Lander, I have to just quote directly from our rules document because I love the flavor here: "Encountering new planets is sometimes tricky. Are there hostile residents? A place to park? Is there air? You don't know! But once you're ready to make planetfall, a trusty Lander will help you get the lay of the land in no time."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edge-of-eternities-lander-image.jpg?itok=z3TE-on1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edge-of-eternities-lander-image.jpg?itok=LP4Y8HoV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First off, that's so cute and flavorful. But does it actually do? A Lander token is a new predefined token type (like Treasure, Food, etc.), and is a colorless artifact token with "{2}, {T}: Sacrifice this token: Search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle."</p>

<p>Personally, I love the flavor here - you explore an uncharted planet, send down your little Lander, and it shows you the way (aka fishes for a basic for you). And while a few other cool cards were announced, there's one special card that's answering rumors on everyone's lips...</p>

<h2>Edge of Eternities... Slivers Return!</h2>

<p>Yes! That's right, everyone's favorite alien worm creatures are back! Are they from this part of the galaxy? Who knows! All we know is that we love Slivers and are scared/excited to see their return, as heralded by this incredible card:</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edge-of-eternities-sliver-card.jpg?itok=f8EX-cof 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edge-of-eternities-sliver-card.jpg?itok=ULMRyurD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Edge of Eternities Special Card Treatments</h2>

<p>Along with all of these great new cards and mechanics, I got a chance to preview some of the special art preview cards that will be released alongside the set in Collector Boosters and more! Check em out!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edge-of-eternities-borderless-surreal-space-alt-art-cards.jpg?itok=928wAdmw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edge-of-eternities-borderless-surreal-space-alt-art-cards.jpg?itok=GYlb1QPH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you can see from the various card art styles presented here, the design team is having a LOT of fun pulling inspiration from across the history of sci-fi artwork.</p>

<p>From paperback novels to trippy sci-fi posters, alt. art treatments of new and returning cards make this set, in my opinion, truly stand out visually!</p>

                <p>Celebrations are a part of most games, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a> is no different. Just like in last year's game, you can access a wide array of celebrations after your player or team does something positive on the field. Whether it's scoring a touchdown, getting a huge first down, or picking off a pass, you can celebrate with your players as long as you know what celebrations are available and which buttons to press.</p><p>Unfortunately, College Football 26 makes it a little difficult to see all of the celebrations and their button inputs. So, to make sure you never miss a beat after you make a good play on the field, you can check out the guide below to see a list of every celebration in College Football 26 and how to perform each one.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_perform_every_celebration_in_College_Football_26">How to perform every celebration in College Football 26</a><ul><li><a href="#Touchdown_Celebrations">Touchdown Celebrations</a></li><li><a href="#First_Down_Celebrations">First Down Celebrations</a></li><li><a href="#Interception_Celebrations">Interception Celebrations</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#When_to_perform_celebrations_on_the_field">When to perform celebrations on the field</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527865-img_6816.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527865" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527865-img_6816.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527865"></a><figcaption>Celebrations are a part of the fabric of college football</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527865-img_6816.jpg"></figure><p>In total, there are 30 celebrations you can perform in College Football 26. However, not all 30 are accessible during every celebration window.</p><p>Some celebrations are reserved for specific actions on the field. For example, there is one interception that you can only use after getting an interception, while another is only usable after securing a first down. The majority of celebrations are reserved for touchdowns, though, so that's when you'll have the most freedom to showboat. After all, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/most-ridiculous-mascots-in-college-football-26/2900-6739/" data-ref-id="2900-6739">mascots in CFB 26</a> aren't the only ones who can showcase some style out on the field.</p><p>You can see a full list of all 30 celebrations in CFB 26 below. They are grouped together by what action they follow (touchdown, first down, interception). You'll also see the button combinations to perform each celebration. All of this information is available by going to the CFB 26 main menu, scrolling to the "Profile" tab, and then viewing the celebrations from there. You can also see them during gameplay if you pause, but since pausing is limited online, you should keep this page open so you can easily stunt on your opponent in every way the game offers.</p><h3 id="Touchdown_Celebrations">Touchdown Celebrations</h3><ul><li><strong>Point To Fans </strong>- Right Stick (RS) (Up)</li><li><strong>Step Back On Em</strong> - RS (Right)</li><li><strong>Tiger Swag (a.k.a. the "Griddy")</strong> - RS (Down)</li><li><strong>Salute</strong> - RS (Left)</li><li><strong>Reach Low Flex</strong> - RS (Up) + L2 / RS (Up) + LT</li><li><strong>Shake With It</strong> - RS (Right) + L2 / RS (Right) + LT</li><li><strong>Wavy Walk</strong> - RS (Down) + L2 / RS (Down) + LT</li><li><strong>Little Baby</strong> - RS (Left) + L2 / RS (Left) + LT</li><li><strong>Get Your Roll On</strong> - RS (Up) + L1 / RS (Up) + LB</li><li><strong>Rodeo</strong> - RS (Right) + L1 / RS (Right) + LB</li><li><strong>Strike A Pose</strong> - RS (Down) + L1 / RS (Down) + LB</li><li><strong>Bounce On Em</strong> - RS (Left) + L1 / RS (Left) + LB</li><li><strong>Wave Goodbye</strong> - RS (Up) + R2 / RS (Up) + RT</li><li><strong>Run Up Flex</strong> - RS (Right) + R2 / RS (Right) + RT</li><li><strong>On His Head</strong> - RS (Down) + R2 / RS (Down) + RT</li><li><strong>Two Step Shuffle</strong> - RS (Left) + R2 / RS (Left) + RT</li><li><strong>Candy Karate</strong> - RS (Up) + R1 / RS (Up) + RB</li><li><strong>Wait For It</strong> - RS (Right) + R1 / RS (Right) + RB</li><li><strong>Blinded</strong> - RS (Down) + R1 / RS (Down) + RB</li><li><strong>Vibes</strong> - RS (Left) + R1 / RS (Left) + RB</li><li><strong>Walk Around After TD</strong> - LS</li><li><strong>Run Around After TD</strong> - LS + R2 / LS + RT</li></ul><h3 id="First_Down_Celebrations">First Down Celebrations</h3><ul><li><strong>Signal It</strong> - RS (Up)</li><li><strong>Touch Em Up</strong> - RS (Right)</li><li><strong>Jacked</strong> - RS (Down)</li><li><strong>Shake It Off</strong> - RS (Left)</li></ul><h3 id="Interception_Celebrations">Interception Celebrations</h3><ul><li><strong>Wave Goodbye</strong> - RS (Up)</li><li><strong>Why You Throwing My Way</strong> - RS (Right)</li><li><strong>Strapped</strong> - RS (Down)</li><li><strong>Head Swag</strong> - RS (Left)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527859-img_6815.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527859" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527859-img_6815.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527859"></a><figcaption>Half of the celebrations in College Football 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527859-img_6815.jpg"></figure><p>As you can see from the celebration list, you'll be able to perform a wide variety of dances and other classic football showboat moves. However, if you want to pull off the Griddy like Justin Jefferson, you'll want to use the Tiger Swag celebration, which simply requires moving your right stick down after scoring a touchdown.</p><h2 id="When_to_perform_celebrations_on_the_field">When to perform celebrations on the field</h2><p>Now that you know every available celebration in CFB 26 and the button presses to perform them, you also need to know the right time to perform them. You're given a brief window to celebrate using the celebration you want, and after that window passes, you won't be able to use the celebration until the next big play you make.</p><p>To make sure you always get a celebration off, wait one second after you've scored a touchdown, gotten a first down, or picked off a pass. You'll generally see the camera pan directly to the player who made the play, and a "Celebrate" prompt will appear above the scoreboard. As soon as that prompt appears on the screen, you'll want to start pressing the right buttons for the celebration you want to perform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527867-img_6817.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527867" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527867-img_6817.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527867"></a><figcaption>Celebrating after a first down</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4527867-img_6817.jpg"></figure><p>If you don't see your player start celebrating right away, try hitting the buttons again. If all works accordingly, your player will celebrate using the option you selected. However, if you wait too long or pull the trigger on the celebration too early, you'll simply see the same old cutscene with the players all celebrating as a team.</p><p>With celebrations down pat, how about you check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-uniforms-in-college-football-26/2900-6738/" data-ref-id="2900-6738">gallery of the best uniforms in College Football 26</a>?

<p>This figure covers the Switch 2, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC versions of the game. Along with this, the Japanese company has confirmed a Switch 2 physical version will release on <strong>7th August 2025</strong> in Japan. According to local listings on sites like VGP, it'll be the same date here, and the game is apparently "on the cart" ("like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a></strong>") with pre-orders now live (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/fantasy-life-i-nintendo-switch-2-physical-edition-photo-mode/">thanks, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>

<p>Along with this, Level-5 has also announced a Photo Mode will be added to the game including features such as pose settings. There'll also be a contest for this new mode allowing users to showcase their islands, homes, and more. This mode reportedly arrives "later" this month in July.</p>
<p>The additional free DLC '<strong>Update the World</strong>' is also planned and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-free-dlc-will-steal-more-time-in-huge-roguelike-open-world-mode">will transform the Fantasy Life i</a> into a roguelike, open world adventure. If you haven't already bought the game, on the Switch 2, there's also a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-gets-switch-2-release-date-with-paid-upgrade-path-for-switch-1-players">paid upgrade path for a small sum</a>.</p>

<p>Drop in this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The legendary skater <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk</a> is back this week and this time he's revisiting the third and fourth games across all platforms including the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Returning skaters can expect to drop into both new and old parks – shredding up places like the Foundry, Alcatraz, College and new locations like an <em>entire</em> pinball machine. On top of this are new and returning cast members, as well as multiple modes to work your way through.</p>
<p>The reviews for this anticipated release are now rolling in and while we should hear more about the Nintendo versions later this week, we've now got the first lot of impressions to give us an idea of how the game is performing so far. Here's the round up:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182162 @ 1751951679 -->
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">GameSpot</a> has given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> <strong>8/10</strong> and although it's "still the best skateboarding gameplay around" it's not all that happy about the decisions made with the fourth outing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a phenomenal game of skate, one that fans would flock to without hesitation if it weren't for some of the strange decisions regarding the game's Career mode and THPS 4 levels. Some of the changes feel needless, and overall, THPS 4 just doesn't fit as well into the same structure as the original three games...Once the initial disappointment fades, however, you're left with a remake that still handles as well as these games ever have, and that's something that's worth playing no matter who you are."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">IGN</a> also settled on a score of <strong>8/10</strong> - calling it a "largely successful rejuvenation" of the 2001 and 2002 originals, despite the changes to the fourth outing's formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"THPS 3 + 4 proves again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless and remains suitable for all skill levels...However, syncing THPS4 with the classic two-minute timer of the initial trilogy is probably going to be a sore point with fans who strongly regard the series’ fourth installment as their favourite, and discarding a whopping 80% of the original THPS3 and THPS4 soundtracks is a startlingly naive choice to make about such a famously crucial component of those games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gamingtrend.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review-spine-transfer-into-a-new-old-format/">GamingTrend</a> awarded it <strong>85/100</strong>, noting how it doesn't nail it "perfectly" but it's still a lot of fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 lands somewhere between remake and reimagining. It doesn’t land either perfectly, but it's still a ton of fun. There’s a lot to see and do"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/07/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-review/">But Why Tho?</a> gave it <strong>9/10</strong>, mentioning how it breathes new life into this classic series once again but seemingly wasn't impacted by the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The skating itself is the best it has ever been. <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and 4</em> is even smoother and more refined than its predecessor, making the skating action as lifelike as possible. Landing tricks feel fluid, and although it takes a while to master, it is pretty simple to pick up and play. There are special tricks that can be unlocked and assigned to skaters as well, scoring significantly more points than your average trick."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4/skating-it-safe">Game Informer</a> gave the Birdman's new game <strong>8/10</strong>, but left it wanting a little more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Iron Galaxy has excellently modernized the gameplay and graphics of these classics to feel right in 2025, I wish it had done a better job of highlighting the influence these games once had in their heyday."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems <a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/71640/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-switch-2-review">Nintendo World Report</a> has also got access to the Switch 2 version and while there are said to be some "technical issues on Switch 2" it was still happy to award this version <strong>9/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While online on Switch 2 ran great in my experience, the same can’t be said for overall stability. Visually everything looks fine docked and on handheld, but the game crashed back to the console’s home screen close to 10 times over my 20+ hours of gameplay...even if there’s a decent chance these issues get resolved, as it stands, it’s shaky right now."</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98golden-handcuffs%E2%80%99-are-screwing-over-laid-off-workers.1237809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week’s massive layoffs at Microsoft--<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Xbox in particular</a>--was terrible for all kinds of reasons. Careers were upended (or even ended) for the workers and couples and families and friendships involved, with lives thrown into turmoil and months or even years of work thrown in the bin. For the wider gaming public,<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it means Xbox will have less studios releasing fewer games</a>.</p><p>As the dust has settled on the layoffs, we keep learning more and more about them, and the more we learn the more awful they become.<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Stuff like the number of veterans affected, some with more experience than many of you have lived years on this Earth</a>. Or, as I discovered over the weekend, that Microsoft has (like many other gaming and tech companies) found new and innovative ways to fuck their workers over.</p><p>More and more companies around the world, but particularly in the United States, like to offer shares as a 'bonus' to their employees, an extension of their overall compensation. Come and work for us, this says, and keep working for us, and you'll be a part of the company not just on the timesheet but, in some small way, in terms of ownership as well. When it comes to companies like Microsoft, that can be a big deal; at time of posting, a single share in Xbox's parent company is worth $500.</p><p>There's a catch with these shares, though.<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> They're usually unvested, which means that while you're <em>kinda </em>given them when you join, you don't <em>actually </em>get to sell them until they become vested stocks at a later time, often after years of service</a>. It's commonly known as a pair of "golden handcuffs", with<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the technical term being RSUs, or Restricted Stock Units</a>. And, surprising absolutely nobody, many of those affected by the Xbox layoffs last week had unvested shares.</p><p>So when they were laid off, they didn't get to keep those shares, or at least didn't get to keep most of them (sometimes workers are granted a certain percentage per year), a loss which in some cases (and depending on seniority and bonuses) could have been worth up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more. Instead, all these shares go right back to Microsoft, where they can be sold off to millionaires, billionaires or redistributed to the company's senior leadership.</p><p>As someone who works for a co-op website, and who has previously only worked for a small media company and the NSW Government, last week I had very little knowledge about this concept, so how it affected laid-off employees never even occurred to me. Until I saw a Linkedin post by Noble Smith, who had worked on everything from <em>Killer Instinct</em> to <em>Age of Empires</em> at Xbox, and who shared his story of thinking he had enough Microsoft stock to afford to put his "kids through college", but ended up losing it all when he was laid off in 2023:</p><blockquote><div><p>What happens to all of that unvested stock from the 9,000 people who were just laid off from Microsoft?</p><p>Well, the corporation gets to take it back.</p><p>Poof! Like a conjuror's trick. That promised payment for all your hard work is gone.</p><p>Xbox doesn't pay royalties to people who work on its games. Executives like Matt Booty tell Xbox workers in company meetings (whenever he is asked if Xbox will someday pay out royalties) that your royalty equivalents are the stock shares that you are granted at your signing and any stock shares granted as bonuses.</p><p>Great health insurance and the promise of yearly stock vesting: The twin rings in the Microsoft golden handcuffs. But when you're laid off that stock is as insubstantial as a dream. (And once your COBRA runs out, that amazing healthcare is an apparition too.)</p><p>I lost a small amount of unvested stock when I was laid off from Xbox in 2023. Small by normal standards. But enough to put my kids through college. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, even a measly 10 shares is worth close to five thousand dollars. A lot of people who got laid off each had hundreds if not thousands of unvested shares.</p><p>And now Microsoft gets to reabsorb all of that vast wealth. Hundreds of millions of dollars? Billions?</p><p>Their coffers runneth over.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>"Microsoft actually did a great job letting you know exactly how many shares were granted, vested and unvested", Smith explained in a conversation with me. "That said, one of the most aggravating things about working there was the constant dangling carrot of those unvested shares. People might think that Microsoft just gives out heaps of stock to employees. Nope. Only if you’re at the executive level. The rest of us grunts had to work HARD to earn our shares. If the annual review cycle came along and you didn’t earn a stock award that year it was crushing."</p><p>"People at Microsoft look at their vesting schedules a lot!", he adds. "Those shares are your kids’ college tuition, or part of your retirement nest egg, or maybe even a down payment on a house. And it hurts when you get laid off with unvested shares that you had earned…but weren’t given enough time as an employee to finally receive."</p><p>I shared Smith's story on social media because the concept blew my socks clean off, and have since heard from many other former Xbox employees, employees of Xbox-owned studios and workers from other major video game companies that stuff like this is pretty common in the AAA space.</p><p>An employee at Bethesda, for example, says that despite the company being bought by Microsoft over four years ago, their promised shares are only just now materialising, and aren't even being <em>given </em>at all. Workers can purchase shares for a 10% discount, but then have to pay tax on them, which in the end works out to be a pretty bum deal.</p><p>Former workers at Bungie and EA (and EA-owned studios like Bioware) tell me they were also promised shares upon starting in their jobs, but upon being laid off--sometimes after <em>years </em>of employment--these had yet to vest, meaning they ended up worthless.</p><p>This is bullshit! To promise some ethereal form of compensation then so routinely (and cruelly) have it disappear in a puff of smoke leaving employees with <em>nothing</em>, sounds to someone from outside the US like it should be illegal. Especially since those shares just revert back to the company and ultimately end up in the hands of those who have, in some way (whether as an executive or a shareholder), contributed to the layoffs in the first place!</p><p>If you've ever experienced something like this in the video game industry and would like your story added to this piece, or have more details on Microsoft's policies with specifics to seniority and tenure, <a href="mailto:luke@aftermath.site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please get in touch</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> will send players to explore a new planet called Kairos. A previous trailer introduced the game's villain, the Timekeeper, and his minions. Now, the Borderlands 4 dev team is sharing a closer look at Kairos itself, as well as the various factions who live there.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkOMX7MoZW4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FkOMX7MoZW4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As mentioned in the video, Kairos is a prison planet that's been ruled by the Timekeeper for a long time. The Timekeeper's control over the population may not be absolute, but he still possesses the technology to oppress the people and see through their eyes at his whim.</p><p>Most of the new factions introduced in the video have their own reasons to hate the Timekeeper. The lone exception so far is Idolater Sol of the Fadefields. He's been exiled from the capital city and Sol is eager to get back in the Timekeeper's good graces and prove his worth after the players' party arrives on the planet. The other factions may oppose the Timekeeper, but there's no guarantee they'll be on the side of the player.</p><p>Narrative director Sam Winkler recently disclosed that Borderlands 4 is introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-introduces-its-best-feature-yet-a-claptrap-volume-slider/1100-6532865/" data-ref-id="1100-6532865">a volume control for Claptrap</a>. In other words, you can finally make Claptrap shut up. The dev team has indicated that Kairos is a "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/" data-ref-id="1100-6532503">seamless world</a>" that won't be bogged down by load screens while players explore the planet.

                <p dir="ltr">Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-and-quake-veterans-new-fps-loses-funding-with-microsoft-seemingly-to-blame/1100-6532939/">rumors and reports</a> that pointed to the contrary, Romero Games is in fact still kicking, though things are still touch and go as the team is forced to "reassess the staffing of [the] studio."</p><p dir="ltr">Romero Games, founded by industry veterans John and Brenda Romero, was deep in development on its latest game when its publisher suddenly pulled funding from the project last week, causing the game to be cancelled and casting a shadow on the future of the Galway-based team. In a statement shared to Romero Games' social media pages on July 7, the studio clarified a lot of the questions surrounding its future and the unfortunate cancellation.</p><p dir="ltr">The short post claims that the team's project did lose funding last week, putting the team in a difficult spot. Due to the nature of the deal, Romero Games cannot reveal the publisher that pulled the team's funding, but as news of layoffs and similar cancellations across several Xbox studios continued to trickle out last week, it was largely believed to be Microsoft. Romero Games' post suggests that "some may infer [the publisher's identity] from public information."</p><p dir="ltr">In a spot of good news however, it also states that interested parties have reached out to Romero Games in order to potentially "bring the game across the finish line." Crucially, it also makes clear that Romero Games is still open, and that the team was even in the studio as recently as July 7 to discuss possible next steps.</p><p dir="ltr">Romero Games was established in 2015 and has released a number of games since its inception, including the mods Sigil and its sequel Sigil II, which serve as unofficial continuations for DOOM, the foundational FPS which John Romero helped create during his time at id Software. The team most recently developed Empire of Sin, a strategy game set in the Prohibition era and published by Paradox Interactive, and was working on a new FPS before the waves at Microsoft seemingly ended the game's development.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Microsoft executed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/">another mass round of layoffs</a>, culminating in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">closure of The Initiative</a> and the cancellation of projects like Perfect Dark and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/">new MMO from the team behind Elder Scrolls Online</a>. The cuts are believed to target about 9,000 employees across Microsoft's portfolio, and a lot of teams working under the Xbox banner, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/">Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10</a>, were heavily impacted by the layoffs.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-no-reason-to-keep-putting-up-with-microsoft.1237755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some moments force you to step back and take stock of a situation, and last week was as good (read: bad) as any: Microsoft announced that it’s<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laying off another 9,000 people</a>, many of them in games. Meanwhile, Windows has been repeatedly enshittified, Office sucks, Xbox is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everywhere and nowhere all at once</a>, and the company is forcing AI down everybody’s throats, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ai-is-no-longer-optional-microsoft-is-allegedly-pressuring-employees-to-use-ai-tools-through-manager-evaluations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including those of its remaining employees</a>. It is also <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aiding and abetting a genocide in Gaza</a> via its Azure cloud and AI services. Nobody asked for this, and we don’t have to put up with it.</p><p>Recently, Luke argued that Microsoft should try <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off one person</a>, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, instead of thousands. I don’t hate this idea! But I also immediately saw people reply to Luke’s piece by saying that Xbox president Sarah Bond and/or Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty are the real problem; Spencer is merely the smug face of this flailing operation. That in mind, I come to you with a slightly different argument: No matter who’s in charge, there’s no salvaging Microsoft or Xbox. The entire enterprise is rotten to the core.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if we keep our focus squarely on games, we’re talking about a behemoth that chose to scoop up a mindbogglingly large chunk of fertile game development soil. Recent standouts include the entirety of Activision Blizzard (an operation spanning well over 20 studios), all of Zenimax/Bethesda (which includes subsidiaries like id Software and Arkane), Double Fine, Obsidian, and inXile – all with no apparent long-term plan beyond digging a very deep hole. The story of Microsoft’s tenuous grip on third place has <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not been the games</a>; instead, it’s one of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cuts</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closures</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>OK, that’s not entirely fair. Microsoft did sort of have a plan: Game Pass, a subscription service that was supposed to become the Netflix of games, but which so far has yet to transform the gaming landscape the way the latter did for TV and film. What if it did, though? What was the long-term play? Arkane founder (and current WolfEye Studios creative director) Raphael Colantonio recently summed it up by declaring the whole enterprise “unsustainable,” echoing a sentiment shared by many in the industry <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-of-games-a-threat-to-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for years</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] ‘infinite money,’ but at some point reality has to hit," he <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941512826687980019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has proven <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-confirms-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hesitant to publicly admit</a> what common sense would infer to be true: Games included in a relatively cheap – <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though increasingly expensive</a> – subscription package sell less. Microsoft, meanwhile, insists that Game Pass is at least profitable on its own terms, but Colantonio believes otherwise.</p><p>"Game Pass is only [profitable] if you ignore the 100 billions that MS spent in acquiring content for GP such as Zenimax and Activision," he <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941599266004259310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Game Business’ Chris Dring added another layer to this dynamic: “I asked for clarification on the 'Game Pass is profitable' claim, and was told no first-party costs are included,” he <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941933309900013850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “What they don’t count is the lost revenue that Xbox’s first-party studios are seeing as a result of the service. I have to imagine if first-party studios received similar compensation [to third-party studios on Game Pass], that profitability might not be correct.”</p><p>All of which is to say: Outside of funding indies – money that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/romero-games-reportedly-met-with-microsoft-just-a-day-before-the-publisher-pulled-funding-for-the-studio-and-there-was-no-mention-of-the-decision-that-put-over-100-people-out-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be drying up</a> – Microsoft’s presence has in the long run proven actively detrimental to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-delay-doesnt-mean-the-games-industrys-in-trouble-its-already-dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what remains of the video game industry</a>, in some ways by design. As massive mega-corporations are wont to do, it viewed games as a spigot from which to fill its buckets with capital. The drought it left in its wake – closed studios, laid off employees, a dearth of future opportunities, and a less functional approach to game sales – would be none of its concern. And what do we have to show for it? A first-party slate that, outside of gems like <em>Avowed</em>, is more defined by misses (<em>Crackdown 3</em>), curious absences (<em>Fable</em>), and cancellations (<em>Scalebound</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, <em>Perfect Dark</em>) than anything resembling hits.</p><p>There’s just no reason to support Microsoft’s gaming endeavors at this point. It’s had plenty of time to get things right; it’s not going to. The company’s other endeavors aren’t looking great, either. I’m not saying you’ve got to uninstall Windows right this second, but there’s a wider, better world out there than the misanthropic product universe Microsoft would very much like us all to remain confined to. The best time to start divesting from Microsoft was years ago, or when its products first began sustaining Israel’s endless assault on Palestinians, or yesterday. The second best time is now.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The anime and manga industry might not flaunt romances between its creators, but it certainly has its share of “it couples.” Arguably, the most beloved is the duo of <a href="https://x.com/catsuka/status/1882592418966675501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hunter X Hunter’s </em>Yoshihiro Togashi and<em> Sailor Moon’s </em>Naoko Takeuchi</a>. But during Anime Expo and Japan Expo weekend, I witnessed a quieter but equally powerful couple in <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> creator Hideaki Anno and his wife, acclaimed manga artist <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/2340/Moyoco_Anno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moyoco</a>, who showed off their bond in the most anime way imaginable: having Hideaki’s Studio Khara produce an animated short honoring the 20th anniversary of Moyoco's magical girl series, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-04/moyoco-anno-sugar-sugar-rune-manga-gets-new-anime-projects/.226309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sugar Sugar Rune</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem with Khara’s release of a CG prologue of <em>Sugar Sugar Rune</em>— directed by <em>Evangelion: 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time</em> CG director Yusuke Matsui—came with the announcement of the series getting a full anime adaptation. But as far as I and my Twitter timeline were concerned, the real headline wasn’t the adaptation. It was Hideaki being anime’s reigning “wife guy.” What I didn’t realize at the time though was that this sweet gesture was just one of many adorable, deeply supportive moments the Annos have shared over their 23-year marriage. Turns out, the couple’s love story has been quietly unfolding like a real life slice-of-life series, and they might just be my new favorite couple in the industry.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="『シュガシュガルーン』連載20周年記念短編映像「SUGAR SUGAR RUNE　Les deux sorcières」（ シュガシュガルーン  レ・ドゥー・ソルシエール）" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qidzapjAMVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In my own sleuthing on the couple over the weekend as Aftermath’s resident anime correspondent, I stumbled across this gem of a Twitter post. It referenced an old interview with Hideaki Anno, where he was asked about his ideal woman. Without hesitation, he simply replied, “My wife, of course.”</p><p>While this answer was the best he could have given, it hit me a little harder than I expected.&nbsp;Anno, like his mentor Hayao Miyazaki, is often reduced online to a caricature of himself—a brooding auteur with a mecha fixation and a backlog of unresolved self-esteem issues poured especially thick into <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Shinji Ikari.&nbsp;</p><p>This was something else. This was the sign of a man who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideaki-anno-the-final-challenge-of-evangelion-is-the-inside-look-into-anime-creation-fans-need/1100-6495833/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routinely oscillates between perfectionism and overwork</a> being visibly healed by his partner’s love. Somewhat tastelessly, some fans have joked about Moyoco needing to divorce him or something so his downward depressive spiral would yield another work like <em>Eva</em>, missing the entire point of how their partnership gave way to the rehabilitating theme of the <em>Rebuild </em>movies. The remakes of <em>Evangelion</em>’s narrative in movie form immortalized Anno’s love for Moyoco through <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Mari_Makinami_Illustrious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mari Illustrious Makinami. </a><a href="https://note.com/anno_moyoco/n/n5d5c137b64ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite Moyoco and Khara’s pushing back</a> on Mari being literally Moyoco, she is still <em>a lot</em> like Moyoco.</p><p>On a surface level, Mari’s addition to the sequel-meets-remake animated films disrupted the long-standing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/9u7ybg/rei_vs_asuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rei vs Asuka</a> discourse <em>Eva </em>fans are still debating over (<a href="https://youtu.be/abnEeNWxzNM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the correct answer is Misato</a>). However, knowing the real-life inspiration behind Mari makes her role resonate differently with me now. It’s not a stretch to see Shinji as a stand-in for Hideaki himself—an emotionally withdrawn guy burdened by legacy and locked in a strained relationship with his father. And then Mari comes parachuting into his life (<a href="https://youtu.be/4qK87ftbU5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">literally</a>). She’s bold, irreverent, blunt, and tonally different from anything in the series. She doesn’t just shift the narrative into uncharted waters; she shifts its emotional current for the better as a chaotic symbol of new transformation breaking through the static of an otherwise doomed narrative.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Evangelion 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time ENDING" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMmcwrb8OIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In <em>Thrice Upon a Time</em>, Mari is the one who reaches out to a once-doomed kid along the way with gentle nudges as he finally makes peace with his father and steps into adulthood. Given that Mari was modeled after Moyoco, its ending, which shows the two as grown-ups <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmcwrb8OIs&amp;pp=ygUkdGhyaWNlIHVwb24gYSB0aW1lIGV2YW5nZWxpb24gZW5kaW5n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving a train station hand in hand</a>, becomes even more meaningful. It also helps that his wife was a <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/3786/Shin_Evangelion_Movie_%7C%7C/characters#staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character designer for the film</a> and is a <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/info-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managing director at Khara</a> alongside Anno’s friends <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-kazuya-tsurumaki-interview-2000593812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki</a>, Hiroyasu Kobayashi, and Nobuo Kawakami.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Characters from "Neon Genesis Evangelion" drawn by Moyoco Anno (Happy Mania, Sugar Sugar Rune,...) who is also Hideaki Anno's wife. <a href="https://t.co/6uht0UJ1nM">pic.twitter.com/6uht0UJ1nM</a></p>— Otaking 🇵🇸 (@TheOtaking) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOtaking/status/1533526622057422851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Hideaki and Moyoco’s love is a collaborative and creative two-way street. Beyond drawing her take on <em>Eva</em>'s<em> </em>characters and <a href="https://x.com/anno_moyoco/status/765873763850125313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors in <em>Shin Godzilla</em></a>, Moyoco has also pulled a page from <a href="https://x.com/ShinEyeZehUhh/status/1846632512044351530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takeuchi’s playbook</a> in penning an autobiographical manga called <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-02-16/moyoco-anno-insufficient-direction-manga-launches-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Insufficient Direction</em></a>. In it, she chronicles the quirks and joys of being married to Hideaki. My favorite moments from the manga was when she revealed that Anno wore <em>Kamen Rider</em> cosplay at their wedding, and that she helped him overcome his picky eating tendencies by introducing zucchini into his diet.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world where Hideaki is so often reduced to a creative who's at his best when he’s going through it like anime’s Adele, it’s genuinely heartwarming to see a different portrait emerge online of him, one which paints him in a softer hue. What’s more, Moyoco didn’t just “fix” Hideaki, as many have joked about online. As she notes, being with him helped her embrace her otaku soul. For me, their relationship is a rare kind of alchemy where their personal and professional lives manage to converge in ways that are equally healing and wildly creative.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy]]></content:encoded>

Luckily, there’s good news: starting at 7PM Eastern today, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.walmart.com" rel="sponsored">Walmart Plus</a> members will be able to purchase Nintendo’s latest handheld console — either the standalone Switch 2 or the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle — through its website. The restock is happening just before its Walmart Deals event begins on July 8th; the event lasts through July 13th.</p><p>The <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%2F" rel="sponsored">standalone Switch 2</a> will go for $449 from Walmart.

The bundle includes everything that comes with the Nintendo Switch 2 — a dock, a pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers, etc. — as well as a download code for a digital copy of the new <em>Mario Kart</em> game (valued at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-World-U-S-Version%2F15940407280%2F" rel="sponsored">$79.99</a>).

It also features an improved U-shaped kickstand, 256GB of internal storage, and a pair of magnetic Joy-Con 2 controllers, which offer mouse-like functionality in select games and a new “C” button that provides quick access to Nintendo’s in-game voice and text chat feature, GameChat. The redesigned dock, meanwhile, features a built-in ethernet port and two USB-A ports.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/685578/nintendo-switch-2-restock-walmart-availability]]></content:encoded>

That cooling attention is having ripple effects, especially for high-rarity cards. While Special Illustration Rare (SIR) ex cards are seeing a notable drop in value, several Illustration Rares are climbing fast, in part due to shifting collector interest and low inventory levels in my opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this shift echoes the rise of <em>Groudon</em> IR from earlier this year, where unexpected demand met low availability. Now other Illustration Rare cards are following suit, gaining ground while their flashier SIR counterparts take a dip.

Surging Sparks is going through a sharp correction, with top cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 247/191</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydreigon ex - 240/191</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milotic ex - 237/191</a> dropping 51%, 34%, and 26% respectively. Even chase cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 238/191</a> and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latias ex - 239/191</a> are down over 20%. But this isn’t a crash, it’s a natural correction driven by rising supply.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, Crown Zenith is heating up fast. Cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giratina VSTAR - GG69/GG70</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR - GG68/70</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR - GG67/70</a> have surged 17%–24% in just days. Even <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mewtwo VSTAR - GG44/GG70</a> and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arceus VSTAR - GG70/GG70</a> are gaining ground. With the Scarlet and Violet era wrapping up and Mega Evolution returning soon, Sword and Shield sets like Crown Zenith are entering that sweet spot where older modern sets start gaining long-term value. I’m buying into both while the market is still adjusting.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy Japanese Pokémon Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-japan-black-bolt-and-white-flare-most-expensive">Japanese Pokémon TCG</a> booster boxes have far better odds at pulling chase cards, have far less bulk and are often half the price of English booster boxes. This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget? Go for Japanese cards.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Pokémon Cards In Packs Right Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s easy to envy those with deep pockets grabbing the priciest Pokémon TCG cards, there’s something way more exciting about pulling a massive hit straight from a booster pack, especially with sets like <em>Destined Rivals</em>, <em>Prismatic Evolutions</em>, <em>Twilight Masquerade</em>, and <em>Surging Sparks</em> still in print. Right now, cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umbreon ex - 161/131</a> are leading the market at over $1,000, followed by heavy hitters like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greninja ex - 214/167</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan’s Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</a>, all pushing $300+. The iconic <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 238/191</a> has cooled to around $295 after peaking last year, making it a solid buy. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More fan-favorite chase cards include <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roaring Moon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latias ex</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Rocket’s Moltres ex</a>, all hovering between $195–$260. And then there’s the Eeveelution invasion. <em>Prismatic Evolutions</em> is packed with top-tier art like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylveon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leafeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vaporeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon ex</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glaceon ex</a>, all sitting comfortably above $230. Each card is absolutley stunning, pumped with nostalgia and some competitive utility to boot (Although I'd suggest getting the standard ex cards for you deck). The odds of pulling them are slim, Prismatic Evolution is notoriously unforgiving with pull rates. Buying singles might be the smarter move if you're after specific cards, but I also don't like having fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

          <p>Epic Games, buoyed by the massive success of Fortnite, has spent the last few years throwing elbows in the mobile industry to get its app store on more phones. It scored an antitrust win against Google in late 2023, and the following year it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/epic-lawsuit-says-samsung-coordinated-with-google-to-get-around-trial-verdict/">went after Samsung</a> for deploying "Auto Blocker" on its Android phones, which would make it harder for users to install the Epic Games Store. Now, the parties have settled the case just days before Samsung will unveil its latest phones.</p>
<p>The Epic Store drama began several years ago when the company defied Google and Apple rules about accepting outside payments in the mega-popular <em>Fortnite</em>. Both stores pulled the app, and Epic sued. Apple emerged victorious, with <em>Fortnite</em> only returning to the iPhone recently. Google, however, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">lost the case</a> after Epic showed it worked behind the scenes to stymie the development of app stores like Epic's.</p>
<p>Google is still working to avoid penalties in that long-running case, but Epic thought it smelled a conspiracy last year. It filed a similar lawsuit against Samsung, accusing it of implementing a feature to block third-party app stores. The issue comes down to the addition of a feature to Samsung phones called Auto Blocker, which is similar to Google's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-review-post-hype/">Advanced Protection in Android 16</a>. It protects against attacks over USB, disables link previews, and scans apps more often for malicious activity. Most importantly, it blocks app sideloading. Without sideloading, there's no way to install the Epic Games Store or any of the content inside it.</p>

For now, Romero Games is seeking a new publisher to bring its game past the finish line. According to the statement, “several” publishers have reached out to the company about seeing the game through, and the team is “evaluating” its options. So while nothing’s set in stone, it does seem like there’s a chance that some interested party or parties will help salvage the game after Microsoft pulled out of the deal. (The statement itself says it cannot name the publisher due to “confidentiality agreements,” but members of the studio have already stated publicly that they were caught up in the layoffs at Microsoft.)</p><p>Hopefully, whatever Romero Games is working on sees the light of day.

No reason was given for why that didn’t work out. Cleveland, who directed the first game, has now broken his silence, shedding some potential light on a power struggle facing one of 2025's most-anticipated PC releases. </p><p>“We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it,” he wrote on Reddit on Monday. “And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings.” </p><p>According to Cleveland, the sudden upheaval came as a shock. The underwater survival exploration sim was set to come to Steam Early Access at some point later this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479">but as we reported last week</a></span> the cryptic press release from Krafton suggested that might no longer be the case. It alluded to quality controls and a milestone process needed to ensure the game meets player expectations. </p><p>“As part of its oversight, Krafton is committed to achieving regular milestones to assess progress across its creative studios,” the publisher wrote. “These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations.”<br></p><p>Reading between the lines of Cleveland’s Reddit post, it sounds like there was a fundamental disagreement over whether to ship sooner and get<em> Subnautica 2</em> into players’ hands for feedback, or wait  potentially until 2026 to make the game playable to the public. Cleveland and the others sold Unknown Worlds to Krafton in 2021, at which time the publisher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-inc-to-acquire-unknown-worlds-the-developers-behind-subnautica-and-natural-selection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-inc-to-acquire-unknown-worlds-the-developers-behind-subnautica-and-natural-selection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed it would</a></span> continue to “function as an independent game development studio.” I guess in 2025 that means independently of the co-founders.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-1851785764]]></content:encoded>

That led to dinosaurs being brought to the mainland, off their island habitat, and eventually spreading around the world. It was a cool idea that <em>Jurassic World Dominion,</em> the last film in the franchise, never did much with. Dinosaurs spreading around the world is a bonkers idea that could provide you with endless storylines, scenarios, and moments to build movies and TV shows around. That could power 20 years of storytelling. </p><h2 id="h29078"><a id=""></a>Rebooting <em>Jurassic Park</em></h2><p>Sadly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-world-4-rebirth-trailer-screenshots-2025-1851636033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-world-4-rebirth-trailer-screenshots-2025-1851636033"><em>Rebirth</em></a></span><em> </em>tosses that all out the window, reminding viewers four separate times in the opening half hour that dinosaurs can’t survive on modern Earth and most of them are now dead. The survivors can be found on some islands dotted around the equator, but that’s it. </p><p>We do get one scene <em>very </em>early into <em>Rebirth </em>that features a big brontosaurus stuck in New York City, covered in graffiti and trash and causing a traffic jam. The movie then swiftly moves on, but not before reminding you one more time that they are all dead and this big dinosaur is probably the last one in North America. </p><p>So, after essentially retconning the end of the<em> Jurassic World</em> trilogy, what does <em>Rebirth </em>do? It fires up a plot that has nothing to do with the rest of the world and takes place on an island. So why the retcon? Your guess is as good as mine! </p><p>Anyway, <em>Rebirth’s </em>plot involves mercenaries (led by Scarlett Johansson) heading to a top-secret island where dinosaur experiments happened, so they can grab some prehistoric blood samples from massive beasts for a rich pharmaceutical company that wants to make a new heart disease medication that will bring in trillions of dollars. </p><h2 id="h29079"><a id=""></a>Prehistoric questing</h2><p>This half of the movie is where a lot of the dinosaur action happens, and director Gareth Edwards knows how to put together intense, action-packed prehistoric setpieces. One sequence involving large flying dinosaurs and a giant rock cliff is a standout moment. But whenever there aren’t dinos on screen, the mercs’ plotline feels like a boring video game fetch quest.</p><p>Get three DNA samples from these big creatures, each in a different biome, and bring them back to get your reward. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876">Most of them are killed off</a></span> before you can care, and the one death that does leave an impact is undone to provide a nice, happy ending, though fans of corporate assholes getting their comeuppance will be satisfied by one late kill in the movie. </p><p>The other half of <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> involves a small family: A dad, his young daughter, his older daughter who leaves for college soon, and her lazy boyfriend. It’s here that<em> Rebirth</em> really shines, as the family members actually have character arcs and change as the movie goes on. The film’s script, while filled with some dumb moments, does a great job of fleshing the family out and making you care about them. When they were in danger,  I was sitting upright and hoping they’d all make it out alive. </p><h2 id="h29080"><a id=""></a>A mutated, hybrid narrative</h2><p>These two halves of the movie barely interact with each other. The family and mercs crash into each other at the start, but then spend 60 percent of the runtime separated, their paths only merging in the last 25 minutes or so.</p><p>This is when <em>Rebirth’s </em>mutant hybrid dinosaurs become a big threat to the family and the mercenaries. Sadly, because they are featured in the film so briefly, neither the raptor-like Mutadon nor the massive mutated T-Rex, known as a D-Rex, makes much of an impact. Their designs are strange and disturbing, but unlike <em>Jurassic World’</em>s now-iconic Indominus Rex, which played a huge part in that film, neither of these mutants is going on my list of favorite movie monsters. </p><p>As <em>Rebirth </em>wrapped up, and the familiar<em> Jurassic Park</em> music played over the survivors leaving dino island, I felt conflicted. I’m always down for dinosaurs, and the CG beasts in <em>Rebirth </em>are the best-looking in the franchise. And damn scary, too. But <em>Rebirth’s </em>two plotlines don’t come together well, and so I ended up hating one half of the movie  for getting in the way of the other. </p><p>The end result is, ironically, a strange, mutated hybrid of a movie that is mostly enjoyable if you don’t think too hard about what’s happening on screen. In other words, it’s another <em>Jurassic Park</em> sequel.

			<p>When Microsoft laid off <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">9,000 people last week</a>, a significant portion of its gaming business was also impacted, even studios Microsoft didn't own. Romero Games, the studio founded by DOOM creator John Romero, had its funding cut due to the layoffs and cuts at Microsoft,<a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/"> resulting in its project being cancelled</a>. After developers from the team reported that they had lost their jobs at Romero Games, it was believed that the studio had also closed down due to the loss of funding. </p>



<p>That's not the case, according to Romero Games, who published a new statement today on its social media channels. The studio did not deny that it had to make cuts to staff, and reiterates that the loss of funding resulted in the game it was developing being cancelled. But it refutes any claims that the studio had closed.</p>



<p>"<em>Romero Games is not closed</em>," the statement reads<em>, "and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that it does not come to that. Indeed, we were in the studio today to discuss next steps with the team</em>."</p>



<p>The studio also goes on to say that since the layoffs at Microsoft and Romero Games' project being cancelled, it has been in contact with "<em>several publishers</em>" who could potentially help bring the game they were working on back to life. The studio is "<em>currently evaluating those opportunities</em>."</p>







<p>At least there's still a chance for Romero Games to pick up where it left off, with this loss of funding potentially being nothing more than a speedbump on the studio's road to completing development on its current project. Hopefully that's how it looks in hindsight in the near future, when we're all playing whatever Romero Games has been cooking up.</p>

<ul><li>A Praetor in Saturnine Terminator Armor</li>

</ul><p>In a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/rzbpqwiz/the-horus-heresy-round-table-the-origins-of-saturnine-armour/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop posted an interview about the Warhammer: The Horus Heresy Saturnine army box. In it, they discussed the new addition of the Saturnine Terminator armor. In the interview, it was mentioned that the armor has been in development for a while; it has even popped up in expanded media material before this point.</p>

<p>The developers even mention an earlier version of the armor was repurposed as the Indomitus Terminator pattern from the 1980s edition of <em>Space Hulk</em>.</p>

<p>Since T<em>he Horus Heresy</em> is a quasi-historical period, an extended prequel of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: 40,000</em></a>, this attention to detail was important on the developer's part. Expressing the power of these Terminator armors while within the restraints of technology at the time. As for how these details will gel with the latest edition's new mechanics remains to be seen.</p>

Nearly everyone between the ages of 6 and 86 knows how Peter Parker became Spider-Man, how a billionaire orphan turned into Batman, and how an abandoned alien from Krypton became Superman. If those origins were questioned on <em>Jeopardy!</em>, they wouldn’t be worth any more than $100. That cultural ubiquity is exactly why Gunn <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Times</em></a></span> he has no interest in movies wasting time telling a story we’ve all known for decades.</p><p>“I don’t need to see pearls in a back alley when Batman’s parents are killed. I don’t need to see the radioactive spider biting Spider-Man. And I don’t need to see baby Kal coming from Krypton in a little baby rocket. We have watched a million movies with characters who don’t have their upbringing explained, like when we see <em>Good Night, and Good Luck</em>—we don’t need to know the early life of Edward R. Murrow to explain how he became a journalist. Who cares?”</p><p>That’s a good question: Who cares? The central purpose those origin stories serve is to connect us with the heroes on a human level. Most of us don’t have more money than God or a Batcave nicer than most homes, but we all know losing our parents could emotionally damage us forever. Yet with the success of grounded superhero movies like Matt Reeves’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-batman-part-2-sequel-delayed-2026-2027-dc-reeves-1851729434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-batman-part-2-sequel-delayed-2026-2027-dc-reeves-1851729434"><em>The Batman</em></a></span>, we’re now seeing more films take a similar approach, relying heavily on exploring their heroes as people as they seek to deconstruct these legendary characters. We don’t need to see his parents’ murder early in the film to grasp the nature of his internal torment later on. He’s a broken man throughout the film for numerous reasons and is only held together by a dutiful compulsion to prevent crime.</p><p>From defending his upcoming Superman movie’s political slant to deriding critics who think his choice for the Man of Steel is a “pussy,” Gunn didn’t hold back in his<em> Times</em> interview. And hopefully, he keeps disrupting the superhero industrial complex known as Hollywood for years to come. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/james-gunn-spider-man-batman-superman-dcu-1851785756]]></content:encoded>
