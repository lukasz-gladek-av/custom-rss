The third-person action title seems to borrow liberally from what we’ve seen in the Hitman games, but definitely has an active and fast-moving pace that establishes a unique identity.&nbsp;</p><p>From a storytelling perspective, this new installment takes us back to Bond’s earliest days in the spy service, and the tagline “Earn the number” suggests he won’t even have that familiar 007 designation as the game begins. We see a handsome younger version of Bond offering up plenty of swagger and confidence with the ladies, but the trailer also shows off some high-octane action sequences.&nbsp;</p><p>We also learned that 007: First Light is on track for a release in 2026. We don’t have full details yet on platforms, but its prior announcement appearance confirmed the game for Switch 2, and today’s appearance during State of Play confirms we’ll also see the game on PS5. We’d be surprised if the game didn’t also make an appearance on Xbox and PC, but that remains to be confirmed.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4qY9DYE184"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4qY9DYE184" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike the last two games, this one includes a split combat style, allowing you to swap between samurai and ninja styles. You can get a look for yourself with the trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The ninja style looks to be more fluid and acrobatic than the game's standard style, and in one shot, we can even see the player swap mid-battle. Stages have also expanded into open fields, which general producer Fumihiko Yasuda says will significantly increase player freedom and exploration in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer shows off lots of what we've come to expect from the series, including flashy attacks, elaborate boss designs, and a whole lot of swords. If it looks interesting, you're in luck – there's a demo for the game's alpha out today on the PlayStation store, complete with a character creator, but it will only be available until June 18, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-announced-for-ps5-limited-time-demo-available-today/">according to the PS Blog</a>.

            <p>You know the name, you know the number. Yes, it is James Bond 007, but like we have never seen him before.</p>
<p>During PlayStation's State of Play this evening, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> of Hitman fame gave us our first look at 007: First Light. "Earn the Number," reads the official blurb accompanying today's new trailer, which features plenty of those Bond-themes we know and love. The cars, the weapons, the girls, the music. Ahh, I am excited!!</p>
<p>"In 007 First Light, play as James Bond, a young, resourceful, and sometimes reckless new recruit, and discover an origin story for the first time," the developer continues, promising an "all-new game experience from IO Interactive", set for release in 2026.</p>
<p>Before I get more into it, here's the trailer:</p>

<p>"This is Bond as you've never seen him before - the youngest Bond fans have ever met," IO wrote in an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/unveiling-007-first-light-io-interactives-james-bond-action-adventure-game/">accompanying blog post</a>. In fact, this Bond is only 26, which makes me feel ancient (but, you don't look it, Victoria!). </p>
<p>
Anyway, First Light's Bond is "a man with sharp instincts, sometimes reckless, who is still learning when to fight, when to bluff, and when to disappear into the shadows", and he starts off the game as a Navy air crewman. However, various events soon throw him into the thrills and spills of MI6 life, and "this training coupled with his natural instinct, wits, and heart will see him grow into a fully-fledged spy". </p>
<p>I don't know if you can tell but guys, I really can't wait!!</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, IOI said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>, adding the release will not be a "gamification of a movie".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week">007: First Light will also feature again later this week during IO's own showcase</a>, which is scheduled for Friday, 6th June, at 6pm PDT. That's 2am on 7th June for those of us in the UK, but who am I kidding, I will be watching.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Beloved first-person stealth series Thief is being resurrected for a new instalment on PlayStation VR2. It's called Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow and it's out later this year.
</p>
<p>
Thief, the brainchild of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> developer Looking Glass Studios, first surfaced back in 1998. Its initial instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a>, was immediately heralded as something of a classic and three further entries followed. Unfortunately, 2014's Eidos-Montréal-developed Thief reboot was poorly received and the series floundered.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, over a decade later, Thief is back in the form of Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow. It'll once again see players slinking through the streets of The City, but this time there's a new protagonist doing the stealthy. Gone is the Garrett of earlier games, this time replaced by Magpie - a "cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest's brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive".

<p>
After stumbling across a legendary artefact holding a mysterious secret, players embark on a journey across The City that'll see them evading and outsmarting its controlling forces as they seek to expose a "sinister conspiracy". All this, of course, takes the series' classic shadow skulking and gives it a VR twist.
</p>
<p>
"Physically crouch, hide, and move between shadows, using every inch of the environment to stay undetected," Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow-announced-for-ps-vr2-out-2025/">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "Whether you're sneaking through darkened alleys or scaling the rooftops of towering buildings, your every movement feels real. Extinguish light sources with your water arrows, hands, or even a well-aimed breath to deepen the darkness and expand your cover. The VR mechanics allow you to live out the fantasy of stealth in a way that no other medium can replicate."
</p>
<p>
Thief VR is the work of Vertigo Games and Maze Theory, and is being developed in collaboration with Eidos-Montréal. It doesn't have a release date yet, beyond a vague "2025" window, but more details are promised "in the coming months".

		<p>The first Mortal Kombat games are being gathered together in to one pack with over 20 versions of the titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/st7exi9Oo8U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection includes Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat III, Ultimate Mortal Kombat III, Mortal Kombat IV, and Mortal Kombat Advance., with variations of the games including the original arcade titles as well as home versions such as the the Nintendo Gameboy game. Each game will include “modern enhancements” and online play using rollback netcode.</p>
<p>You will also be able to unlock and play all of the secret modes and characters from the games. “We will give you open access to everything in these games without need for hidden codes or memorization. How will we do that? Uh… that’s still a secret. But it won’t be for long. We’ll have much more to say about Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection later this year,” say Digital Eclipse.</p>
<p>There will also be an interactive documentary packed with rare concept art, archival footage, and brand-new interviews. Earlier this year, Digital Eclipse travelled to NetherRealm Studios to interview Mortal Kombat co-creators Ed Boon and John Tobias alongside literally dozens of other developers, actors, industry luminaries, fans, and Mortal Kombat experts.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the playable games announced so far – with more on the way.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat – 1992:</strong>&nbsp;Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear</li>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat II -1993:</strong>&nbsp;Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X</li>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat 3 – 1995:</strong>&nbsp;Arcade, SNES, Genesis</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 – 1995:</strong>&nbsp;Arcade, SNES</li>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat 4 – 1997:&nbsp;</strong>Arcade</li>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat Advance – 2001:</strong>&nbsp;Game Boy Advance</li>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance – 2002:</strong>&nbsp;Game Boy Advance</li>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition – 2003</strong>: Game Boy Advance</li>
</ul>
<p>Netherworld have recently announced that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/14/mortal-kombat-1-review/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> is concluding as the move on to their next project. The game acted as a reboot for the franchise, changing some key story points.</p>

		<p>IO Interactive dropped an announcement trailer for 007 First Light, a new origin story for the iconic spy that is set to launch in 2026. A full gameplay reveal is set for later this summer, with the game in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-fgtpwEMPM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is James Bond’s first mission for the British Secret Service, an up and coming operative with a reckless streak that M sees a little potential with. 009 seems to have gone rogue, and Bond will have to earn his 00 status</p>
<p>There’s all the hallmarks of a James Bond story, such as just announcing who he is, getting a bit flirty with the ladies, playing with gadgets that Q has cooked up, and some classic car chases while jet-setting around the globe.</p>
<p>There’s snippets of gameplay-like action. An environment scan, tagging guards with a gadget, takedowns and a bit of brawling and gunplay. Much of the trailer is cinematics and story, mind you, so we’ll have to wait for some gameplay deep dives to see how it all comes together.</p>

<p>At the very least, it’s a much more suave, action-packed looking take on the covert assassinations that IO Interactive made their own with the Hitman series. The movement looks slicker, there’s almost certainly cars and other vehicles, and it will be interesting to see how IO strikes the balance between open and linear sections to join up their story.</p>
<p>Might as well look back on their last game then, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-ps5-xbox-pc-switch-stadia/">Hitman 3 launching in 2021</a>. We said, “Charting the series’ progress since that 2016 Paris debut has been a fascinating journey. IO have learned a lot over the past five years and that really shows in Hitman 3. It’s a flashier, more fluid evolution of IO’s original template – a rewarding conclusion to one of the most unique video game franchises around, and one we’ll continue playing for many weeks and months to come.”</p>

			<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul, a new fighting game developed by Arc System Works, the studio behind the Guilty Gear series and Dragon Ball FighterZ, has been announced today for a release next year.</p>
<p>The game, which was revealed with a new trailer shown during today's State of Play presentation, will be the first tag fighting game to feature 4v4 fights, which promise to be intense and explosive, judging from the trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the State of Play presentation, a blog post shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">Official PlayStation Blog</a> provided some additional information on the game. Learning multiple characters in a fighting game can be a daunting task, but Arc System Works aimed from the very beginning to make a game that could be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. <em>"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game,"</em> said Game Director and Lead Battle Designer, Kazuto Sekine. <em>"We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together – creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience."</em></p>
<p>More information has also been provided on the Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul character roster and how each character was picked. According to Producer Takeshi Yamanaka, the team picked characters that could be considered as the face of Marvel and characters that could deliver a balanced variety of fighting styles. Despite featuring many popular characters, the game will also feature some characters who have never been playable in a fighting game before.</p>
<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul will launch on PC in 2026 via Steam and the Epic Games Store, and PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p>Konami has announced that<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-gets-new-trailer-details-and-pc-requirements/"> Silent Hill f</a> will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 25, 2025, with a new trailer showcasing a good chunk of gameplay during the PlayStation State of Play event for June 2025.</p>
<p>The new trailer showed more of the chilling atmosphere that Konami is creating in Silent Hill f, and some more combat, exploration, and, of course, a few of the terrifying creatures you'll have to face over the course of the story.</p>
<p><iframe title="SILENT HILL f | Release Date Trailer (4K: EN/ESRB) | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lpf9LoIWylA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a> also dug more into the story and the gameplay, and the different editions that'll be available when it launches in September, which is just a standard and a deluxe edition for now. The deluxe edition will include a digital artbook, soundtrack, and an additional cosmetic for Shimizu Hinako, the story's protagonist.</p>
<p>Notably, the blog&nbsp; post did point out that players on PS5 Pro will be able to take advantage of the Enhanced graphics mode that's only available on the Pro. It doesn't specify what the Enhanced mode will look like, just that Pro players will see that Silent Hill f "<em>retains graphical fidelity at a stable FPS</em>" when playing on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>When Silent Hill f was revealed, we were all still waiting for Silent Hill 2 Remake from Bloober Team. Now that the remake has come and gone, and Bloober Team largely knocked it out of the park, players are ready for more Silent Hill. Right now, Silent Hill f looks like it'll ramp up the momentum the remake kicked up. Hopefully, it delivers.</p>

Developers IO Interactive showed off a trailer for 007 First Light during Sony's State Of Play stream this evening, days after announcing the third-person action adventure's full title (it was previously known as "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-007">Project 007</a>"). It's an origin story about a baby-faced Bond that looks considerably more quippy than any of the recent movies. Find the trailer below. </p>

<p>This is certainly ticking a lot of classic Bond boxes, like soirées and yachts and insufferable machismo. He looks like a Dreamworks Chris Pine. I am excited about IO turning their Hitman experience towards a game with a broader list of verbs though, like "drive" and "talk".</p>
<p>It makes sense that Bond is younger here, given that First Light <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/io-interactives-project-007-could-be-the-beginning-of-a-bond-trilogy">could be the beginning of a trilogy</a>, IO Interactive have said in the past. The studio are best known for their own recent trilogy of Hitman games, which let you playfully murder all types of terrible people, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitman-and-the-joy-of-killing-your-boss">including your boss</a>. Choosing such a studio to make a game about the world's least suble spook seemed a logical choice for the rights-holders of James Bond, although we know by now that this Jimmy wouldn't was never going to be an anti-aliased photograph of Daniel Craig on top of a bunch of polygons. </p>
<p>“It's the beginning of something new and it's the beginning, hopefully, of something that the gamers can call their own," said studio co-owner Christian Elverdam, explaining how the developers wanted a Bond "who's comfortably just his own game character." This is a common refrain from devs who make a game based on a license. Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-avengers-interview-noah-hughes-crystal-dynamics-e3-2019">said similar things</a> when faced with player scrutiny over their depiction of well-known heroes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The big news out of the trailer is the first official reveal of the game’s new James Bond, which you can see in the image above. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s the full trailer straight from State of Play:</p><p>And here’s the game’s official description, courtesy of YouTube: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> In 007 First Light, follow James Bond as a young, resourceful, and sometimes reckless recruit in MI6's training program, and discover an origin story of the world’s most famous spy. Coming 2026.</p></blockquote><p>Earlier this week, IOI, the studio famously behind the excellent <em>Hitman</em> franchise, finally revealed more about its upcoming Bond game, including its name: <em>First Light</em>. The game is coming to PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, and PC in 2026. </p><p> According to <em>First Light’</em>s website, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which was updated earlier this week</a></span>, IOI’s game will feature a “wholly original Bond origin story” that will let players “step into the shoes of the world’s favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status.” And in this new trailer, we got a good look at this new Bond. Personally, while the game looks very exciting and fun, I’m disappointed by how bland and boring the new Bond looks. He looks like the guy you start with in a big RPG character creator, the guy you immediately modify to make them look interesting. </p><p>It’s been a long wait for this game. IOI first announced this new <em>007</em> game nearly five years ago, back in November 2020. Now, we know that nearly six years later, <em>007: First Light</em> will finally be arriving on consoles and PC. Will Agent 47 make a cameo appearance? I hope so. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Our hero Romeo Stargazer is a man stuck between life and death. His own was saved mere seconds before the end by way of a time paradox that shattered the space-time continuum, which was created by a genius scientist screwing around. Now, Romeo is FBI Space-Time special agent “Dead Man”, and sporting a rad mask called Dead Gear, must hunt space-time’s most wanted fugitives through multiple universes! </p><p>GhM’s bloodiest action game yet</p><p>Romeo swaps between guns and swords, using his enemies’ own power against them to absolutely annihilate the evil hordes in this peak example of full-on bloody action, featuring ridiculously clever level design in which you’ll be jumping back and forth between the real world subspace, and white-hot battles cathartic enough to collapse the universe itself! When the going really gets tough, unleash Bloody Summer – an instant-kill special attack that uses blood accumulated from your enemies – to turn things around and get back on top!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>An action-packed story of adventure that transcends space-time</p><p>Romeo’s search for these space-time fugitives ends up intertwining with his search for his suddenly missing girlfriend, the mysterious Juliet… You’ll just have to play the game to see how (and even if) these mysteries unravel, but after all is said and done (and dead), will Romeo be able to see the tears of time?!

                <p>As a part of today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">PlayStation State Of Play livestream</a>, Digital Eclipse and NetherRealm Studios have announced the Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, a collection of classic Mortal Kombat games from across the series' arcade, handheld, and console titles.</p><p>The collection includes several games from Mortal Kombat's history, including Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat III, and Mortal Kombat IV. The trailer stated it will include additional titles as well, though the studios have yet to clarify what games that might entrail. Here are the games currently included in the collection:</p><ul><li>Mortal Kombat – 1992: Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear</li><li>Mortal Kombat II -1993: Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X</li><li>Mortal Kombat 3 – 1995: Arcade, SNES, Genesis</li><li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 – 1995: Arcade, SNES</li><li>Mortal Kombat 4 – 1997: Arcade</li><li>Mortal Kombat Advance – 2001: Game Boy Advance</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance – 2002: Game Boy Advance</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition – 2003: Game Boy Advance</li></ul><p>Each game will feature modern enhancements as well as online play thanks to the inclusion of rollback netcode. On the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/mortal-kombat-legacy-collection-launches-on-ps5-ps4-this-year/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Sony confirmed that the collection will give players "open access to everything in these games without need for hidden codes or memorization." However, how exactly this will be implemented is "still a secret." Sony stated that fans can look forward to hearing a bit more about the Legacy Kollection ahead of its release later this year.</p><p>The announcement comes after NetherRealm Studios stated that the most recent game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-devs-respond-to-calls-for-more-dlc/1100-6531826/" data-ref-id="1100-6531826">Mortal Kombat 1, would no longer be in active development</a> after the release of the Definitive Edition last month. Mortal Kombat 1 served as a soft reboot for the franchise, with the in-game universe under the direction of Liu Kang instead of Raiden. Guest characters added via DLC included Invincible's Omni-Man, Scream's Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian.</p>

                <p>Announced during the February State of Play earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" data-ref-id="5000-663007">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a> reappeared during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">June State of Play</a>. The new trailer offered a more detailed look at the RPG's story as well as a release date: October 3.</p><p>Time Stranger is the next game in a Digimon RPG series that dates back to 2006 on the Nintendo DS. As the title implies, this new game puts you into the role of a time traveler who has mysteriously been sent back in time eight years, just before a devastating disaster--it seems it's up to you to ensure it doesn't happen, as well as investigate other timeline anomalies. Like the past games, you'll also collect and train Digimon partners, which you'll command in turn-based encounters against enemy Digimon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvDc7_w5ZY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IVvDc7_w5ZY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The story will take place in both the real and digital worlds, and you'll be able to recruit and train over 450 different digital monsters. As seen in the new trailer, each Digimon has a wealth of options when it comes to customization, too. The full depth of options available is still unclear, but it looks like Time Stranger is shaping up to be an ideal game for folks who want to really dive into the minutia of turn-based combat.</p><p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC.</p>

                <p>As part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">Sony's State of Play event</a>, Team Ninja announced Nioh 3 and you don't have to wait long at all to play it. A free demo is launching today on the PlayStation Store. The full game is set for release in early 2026 on PlayStation 5.</p><p>Fans have been waiting some time for another Nioh game, as Nioh 2 was released in 2020. It scored strong reviews and <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/02/nioh-2-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipped more than 2.5 million copies.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXGm-JaxY54" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two fighting styles in Nioh 3, and they are are Samurai and Ninja. Below is how Team Ninja describes each.</p><h3><strong>Samurai: </strong></h3><p>"The Samurai style provides a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles. New actions such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment have been added, helping create a series of intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations."</p><h3><strong>Ninja:</strong></h3><p>"The Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions, giving ninjas the advantage of being able to attack from outside of the enemy’s range by utilizing a variety of 'Ninjitsu' techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players have the ability to use techniques like Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows for narrowly avoiding enemy strikes. Both techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind."</p><p>The game allows players to switch between the two styles at any time, so they can play how they want. Team Ninja also confirmed that Nioh 3 includes an "open field that offers a new freedom of exploration" for the series. </p><p><span>"Experience unexpected encounters with formidable yokai, explore suspicious villages riddled in violent secrets, and take on the daunting challenges of The Crucible. Enjoy the thrilling, hostile new environments as you fight to survive the cursed kingdom!" Team Ninja said.</span></p>

                <p>The Sony State of Play on June 5 debuted the next game from the Bloodstained series. Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is coming in 2026, and the first trailer showed some of the metroidvania action we can expect.</p><p>The cutscenes for The Scarlet Engagement featured Victorian-style intrigue as guards spoke about castles and magic, but the real thrust of the game was in its combat. The gameplay looked very similar to Ritual of the Night, though it appeared to have much more emphasis on player customization. It's not clear if this game will have a single, specific protagonist like the first game.</p><p>The first Bloodstained was a crowdfunded game from Koji Igarashi, best known for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Ritual of the Night had a similar tone and spirit, with some of its own intricacies and new features that helped set it apart. Two retro demakes, Curse of the Moon and Curse of the Moon 2, were produced by Inti Creates, to help flesh out the world.</p>

                <p>Grasshopper Manufacture and Suda51 have finally announced a brand-new game for PlayStation 5, and it as every bit of strange as you would expect it to be. Romeo Is A Dead Man is Suda51's first new game in over four years. Players will be controlling the hero Romeo Stargazer, an FBI investigator recently brought back to life by a mysterious device injected into his face by his grandfather. Resurrected as the masked hero "Dead Man," Romeo battles all sorts of undead with a variety of weapons including beam swords, machine guns, and what appear to be electric boxing gloves.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW1cE6sj6h8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Suda51 describes the game as a "strong-style action game," with its aggressive blood sprays and inspirations from Japanese action shows like Kamen Rider. It's very much like previous titles by Grasshopper Manufacture but with a much more aggressive style of combat more like Devil May Cry. The trailer shows off a huge variety of weapons to use and all of their strange effects, like a freezing shot that turns enemies into ice, or electric gauntlets that chain energy across nearby targets. Enemies also have tons of strange effects, shooting massive beams as Romeo as he dodges them.</p><p>It's not known if this game will have open-world elements like in No More Heroes 3, but it's likely with the story involving chasing criminals across spacetime, there will be exploration alongside all the action as well. There were also some hints of vehicle use with some visuals of Romeo riding a motorcycle in the trailer, but we don't see any gameplay of it.</p><p>Romeo is a Dead Man will be out sometime in 2026.</p><p>For more news, check out GameSpot's coverage of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">PlayStation State of Play from June 4th.</a></p>

                <p>In the June 2025 State of Play, Capcom reintroduced Pragmata, an oft-delayed sci-fi game, and announced a planned 2026 release window. Pragmata was originally announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-is-a-new-ps5-xbox-series-x-and-pc/1100-6478339/" data-ref-id="1100-6478339">back in 2021</a>, delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-has-officially-been-delayed-to-2023/1100-6498139/" data-ref-id="1100-6498139">six months later</a>, and then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-reminds-us-pragmata-still-exists-then-delays-it-indefinitely/1100-6515152/" data-ref-id="1100-6515152">dropped from Capcom's release calendar entirely</a>. A space action-adventure game, the game follows an astronaut exploring an abandoned space station who encounters a mysterious young girl.</p><p>The trailer shown at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">State of Play</a> is the most in-depth look Capcom has given of the game so far. It alternates briskly between cutscenes and what appears to be gameplay; a "captured on a PS5 Pro" disclosure displays early on in the footage.</p><p>The trailer starts with the young girl awakening the astronaut after he has been injured. The two begin to wander the space station where he has awoken, bounding through hallways and boosting across gaps, with the girl riding piggyback. They encounter a thin robot wielding a laser sword. During combat, it appears the astronaut can boost for a quick evade, utilize drones, and enlist the girl to use her hacking powers to "freeze" robots. Later in the trailer, you see the pair fight a larger, mech-like robot. The UI displays damage numbers as each hit collides with that enemy.</p><p>At the trailer's end, the astronaut dubs the girl "Diana," loosely based on the string of numbers and letters she offered as name earlier. A note written by the girl appears, reading "2026, It's real XD." Though it reveals more, the trailer hardly breaks the marketing's cryptic streak.</p>
