<p>Two previously unreleased games are also coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Those of you excited to relive the glory days of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy</a> only have a few more weeks to wait until you can play them on Nintendo Switch Online on Switch 1 and Switch 2. <strong>17th February</strong> is approaching fast!</p>
<p>Today, Nintendo has dropped a brand new trailer confirming the launch line-up for the new service along with a handful of features and surprises.</p>
<p>Seven games will be available from the jump, with more to be added "in the future". As per usual, then. Here's all the games you'll be able to play from 17th February:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/galactic_pinball">Galactic Pinball</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/3d_tetris">3-D TETRIS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/golf">Golf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/innsmouth_no_yakata">The Mansion of Innsmouth</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>A pretty healthy starting line-up, if we do say so ourselves. Wario Land felt like a day-one given, as did 3-D Tetris. Of course, more are coming in the future, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/marios_tennis">Mario's Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/jack_bros">Jack Bros.</a>, and two never-before-released games in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D(ragon)-Hopper</a>.</p>
<p>To play Virtual Boy games, you'll need to grab the Virtual Boy accessory for your console; either the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">standard one</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">cardboard version</a> will do.</p>
<p>Other features available on the service include the ability to Rewind gameplay, make save states, check and remap controls, and — later in the year — change the colour of the screen.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-warbond</link>
            <guid>1417426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead have announced Siege Breakers, the latest Warbond for <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and this one's all about big, loud explosions, which are, as I'm sure we can all agree, the ideal way to spread democracy throughout the galaxy.</p><p>In many ways, Siege Breakers provides the perfect counterpoint to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-warbond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="460a9d06-01c8-4dde-8dcd-17b098a9a0f5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Redacted Regiment</a>, the Warbond from a couple of weeks ago, because that one focused on stealth and this one...absolutely does not.</p><p>The first major addition to <em>Helldivers 2 </em>in Siege Breakers is the LAS-16 Trident, an updated version of the beloved weapon from the original arsenal. This one fires six beams instead of three, and when it comes to annihilating enemies, that's definitely a marked improvement.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Siege Breakers brings new weapons like this laser-focused bad boy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you prefer to get up close and personal (well, even more up close and personal), then the new CQC-20 Breaching Hammer stratagem will allow you to do just that. It's a massive sledgehammer that can optionally also explode. I say "optionally", but that sounds pretty mandatory to me.</p><p>Joining the new hammer is the GL-28 Belt-Fed Grenade Launcher, which, as the name suggests, is an explosive weapon that lets you continuously fire grenades. It should be perfect for those pesky Terminid hives.</p><p>Should you prefer to make one very loud noise rather than a series of slightly less loud noises, you may want to check out the EAT-411 Leveller, a single-shot missile launcher with a serious kick.</p><p>Lastly, if all of this ordnance isn't working for you and you need to protect yourself, the G/SH-39 Shield should help you do just that by providing a barrier that should stop more than a few Automaton shots.</p>
<p>All of this is, of course, coming in addition to new armors, capes, and other accouterments to help your Helldiver stand out and look snazzy on the battlefield.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Siege Breakers Warbond launches across all platforms on February 3rd.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-adds-the-looney-tunes-sweetheart-tweety-bird-to-its-valentines-day-deal-at-a-record-low-2000663257</link>
            <guid>1417420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure is a 412-piece kit that lets you turn the iconic yellow canary into a heart-inspired display you can pose and change up. Once you have completed the figure and used the posable head, wings, tail, and feet, you can choose to either position Tweety on the pedestal, cloud, as a matchmaker, or by removing Tweety from the base, placing the bouquet under his arm, and attaching the heart above his head so he appears to be providing a gift.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/">You can go to Amazon and purchase the LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure for $24, which is $11 cheaper than the original retail price of $35, and a 31% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A LEGO project featuring the Looney Tunes’ most iconic bird</h2>
<p>This Valentine-themed build of Tweety offers a couple of obvious options to style the figure so it continues to interest you after you finish the build. First, you can put Tweety on the pedestal cloud, place the bow and arrow within his wings, and create a fun playfulness by posing Tweety as Cupid to fit in with Valentine’s Day on a nightstand or desk. Second, when you want to tone things down a bit, you can take Tweety off the pedestal, give him the bouquet, and place the heart on top of his head so he looks like the giver.</p>
<p>The use of posable joints allows the LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure to appear more lively than a fixed decoration that never changes position. Additionally, since the model is made from LEGO elements, you can move some pieces around if you would like to slightly change how he looks or stands, without using a specialized tool or additional components.</p>



<p>The design features and functionality of this set also enable it to serve a dual purpose as a decorative item rather than simply a one-time build that you throw in storage. The pedestal is compact, so the space required for this item will be small enough to fit on a dresser corner, a bookshelf, or an office shelf.</p>
<p>The step-by-step instructions for building the model are intended to create a fun, satisfying experience as each part goes into place. The directions start by showing you how to form the body and head of Tweety, and then proceed to the pedestal and accessories so that you see the character develop in stages. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/">Once the figure is placed on display, you have a charming Looney Tunes figure that you can re-position as many times as you desire, and given the fact that the item is available for $24 on sale, down from the normal $35</a>, it makes for a simple and affordable little project that’s worth building.</p>

              <p><span>Not even the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> community is safe from AI ensloppification.</span></p> <p><span>With the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252"><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update</span></a><span> only a few weeks old, players have been hard at work sprucing up their islands and posting pictures of all their hard decorating work. But some have been using generative AI to “enhance” their photos or fabricate them altogether, and fans are getting pissed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sharing stylistic edits of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> screenshots online is a foundational pillar of the game’s community. Photos are typically edited to enhance the game’s lighting and shadows, or put through filters to achieve a certain vibe. Photos with the best vibes are rewarded with likes, upvotes, or whatever the clout currency is for a particular social media website. However, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-ai-slop-aesthetic/"><i><span>Polygon </span></i><span>reports</span></a><span> that on X and elsewhere, </span><i><span>AC </span></i><span>screenshots enhanced with AI have started trending, often without disclosure that genAI was used.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think it’s time we talk about the AI use in </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>aesthetic posts that are trending,” </span><a href="https://x.com/cozyberru/status/2015462841139314792?s=20"><span>wrote user Cozyberru on X</span></a><span>. In a thread, they highlight how a number of recently trending&nbsp;<em>AC</em> screenshots were likely created with genAI, pointing out the usual suspects of funky-looking numbers and warped textures on background items. But their issue isn’t so much with using the tool itself. “All I am asking is to be honest and disclose your use of AI or editing,” they wrote.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> has thousands of little knick-knacks, pieces of furniture, and more. Not sharing that an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> photo has been enhanced with AI can lead to confusion in players who might want to get their hands on something they don’t know has been wholly made up.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the thread, one commenter </span><a href="https://x.com/salFreeApps/status/2015536285998625106?s=20"><span>thanked Cozyberru for their service</span></a><span>. “I’ve been sitting here thinking, ‘is there a mod or hack or glitch going around that I don’t know?’ Because there’s no way to place that item that close to the furniture as much as I want to.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Cozyberru doesn’t explicitly share their feelings about genAI, but others shared theirs in the thread’s comments and elsewhere online. Though it’s not called out specifically in the rules, it seems the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> subreddit has a strict “No genAI policy.” In a post regarding fanart, a moderator advised community members not to report anything that wasn’t </span><span>“</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1q4powt/please_stop_reporting_art_posts_as_low_quality/"><span>blatantly NSFW or AI.</span></a><span>”</span><span>&nbsp;In another post, a user reposted a video of their island after the original was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qaz4ms/nearly_3000_hours_and_35_years_later_my_island_is/"><span>taken down for using text-to-speech AI voiceover</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘We’re Next to Go’ – Why Ubisoft’s ‘Creative Network’ Employees Fear Imminent Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-creative-network/</link>
            <guid>1417414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a week since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> announced its massive restructuring, which saw six projects cancelled, seven titles delayed, and two studios closed. The company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-12-year-low-amid-company-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stock price dropped to a 15-year low</a>, a 95% decline from its peak valuation. </p>



<p>The company’s announcement revolved around its new ‘Creative Houses’ structure, which will see its IPs placed into five different categories, organized around distinct genres and franchises. As announced by Ubisoft, each Creative House will have its own leadership structure and will be responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction for that particular Creative House.</p>







<p>A ‘Creative Network’ of studios will strengthen these Creative Houses, providing technical support, QA, and other development resources. It’s a change that Ubisoft say will bring more structure, speedy game development, and the ability to deploy technical resources across its portfolio. </p>



<p>It’s yet another change enforced at the publisher that has made employees feel uneasy. Some tell me that they feel like this is just a way to eventually sell off their IPs, while others theorise it’s a means to get cash injections into creating more subsidiaries with other companies more easily. Very few think that’s a meaningful change that will make much of a difference because, at the end of the day, it’s still the same people in charge who put the company is this place in the first place.</p>



<h2 id="h-creative-network-employees-are-worried">Creative Network Employees Are Worried</h2>



<p>For the most part, and understandably so, most employees who currently work at Ubisoft are frustrated, confused, and worried about the future. Ubisoft’s third, and apparently final, cost-cutting measure will aim to save another 200 million euros by March 2028, a move that could result in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands of developers being laid off.</a> But the most noticeable of the worried employees come from Ubisoft’s new ‘Creative Network’, who tell me that the restructuring feels like it only applies to half of the company and suggests that they are easy targets for future layoffs.</p>



<p>That’s because, while not released to the public, Ubisoft has already outlined and assigned studios to each Creative House and the Creative Network, with around 20 studios now in the Creative Network. But internally, nothing has been set in stone or assigned regarding how they will assist the Houses.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has been sent documentation outlining which Ubisoft Studios will go to which Creative House.</p>







<h3 id="h-creative-house-1-vantage-studios">Creative House 1 (Vantage Studios)</h3>



<p><strong>Games </strong>– Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six</p>



<p><strong>Studios –</strong> Barcelona, Montreal Vantage, Quedec, Saguenay, Sherbrooke, Sofia</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-2">Creative House 2</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, The Division, Avatar</p>



<p><strong>Studios </strong>– Paris (Ghost Recon), Massive, Montreal CH2, Toronto</p>



<p><em>Avatar was missing from the publicly released documents. When asked for comment about the future of Avatar, a Ubisoft spokesperson told Insider Gaming, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a live game with internal teams working on it.”</em></p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-3">Creative House 3</h3>

<h2 id="h-darker-days-to-come">Darker Days to Come</h2>



<p>It’s unfortunate to say, but despite an insane amount of good IPs and games to hopefully come, it still feels like Ubisoft’s darkest days aren’t yet over. Officially, it’ll be March 2028 before the cost-cutting will stop, but it feels like Ubisoft’s rollercoaster story of twists and turns are only just beginning.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, and even before the impending announcement of more layoffs in February, Ubisoft announced it aims to cut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 jobs at Ubisoft Paris’ headquarters</a>, a move that has seen the French <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft unions propose a strike from February 10-12</a>. </p>



<p>The unfortunate thing about all this is that, as always, it will be the developers who suffer the conseqeven before the impending announcement of more layoffs in February, Ubisoft announced it aims to cut 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters, a move that has prompted the French Ubisoft unions touences of years of misleadership. </p>

<p>The French Ubisoft unions have unanimously agreed to organize a strike against the company between February 10 and 12, 2026.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft recently announced a major restructure to the organisation, which would lead to multiple studio closures and layoffs. The first set of dismissals has already been revealed, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 job cuts proposed</a> at the Paris Headquarters. The French unions have agreed to strike and are coordinating with international counterparts. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-strike-to-take-place-this-february">Ubisoft Strike to Take Place this February </h2>



<p>According to a report by the French publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Les Echos</a>, several unions representing Ubisoft workers—namely the Video Game Workers’ Union (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps Écologique—have unanimously agreed to strike from February 10 to 12. The unions also plan to collaborate with their international counterparts to raise awareness of the situation on a global scale.</p>



<p>The reason for the strike is the new austerity measures aimed at reducing the company’s fixed costs by €200 million over the next two years, along with&nbsp;stricter remote working conditions. This decision is expected to result in layoffs, with the first voluntary mutual termination already proposed. The layoffs could affect 20% of Ubisoft’s headquarters workforce and 5% of its total workforce in France.</p>



<p>The Ubisoft restructure has already led to the cancellation of the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. The new operating model will focus on open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences, featuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 creative houses</a>. The restructuring has already led to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major decline in the company’s share price</a>. </p>

Ahead of Raiders, it felt like the perfect farewell to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and a way to solidify its continued online domination on Switch consoles until a fourth game hits, as it sounds like the spinoff's priorities are PvE-oriented.</p>
<p>Today, 27th January, we've been surprised by yet another major patch coming to Splatoon 3 as soon as this week. The meta-shaking <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html">11.0.0 update</a> drops on 29th January, so plan your weekend accordingly.</p>
<p>The "meta-shaking" bit isn't a joke or an exaggeration. While it doesn't add new content to the jumbo-sized threequel, it changes and expands the gameplay significantly with tweaks and even an all-new mechanic: Flow Aura.</p>
<p>"Inklings and Octolings who splat multiple opponents in quick succession will enter a new state called Flow Aura," the official post explains. This multi-frag boost of sorts goes on for longer than 30 seconds if you splat more opponents and/or assist teammates. During this period, ink bursts around the player and speed, resistance, and "intensify actions" receive enhancements. This will no doubt encourage more aggressive play styles across the board, perhaps in an attempt by the devs to minimize the impact of campers and cheap opportunist strategies, further pushing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> into the classical "arena shooter" space.</p><p>Another massive addition is that of a Stealth Jump gear ability which "allows players to jump to their teammates without the opposing team necessarily seeing where they will land." As a way to offset its massive potential, the developers have increased the flight time for this type of respawn jump.</p>

<p>Last but not least, health bars will now be shown above damaged players, but not when they're behind cover or diving into ink. While this has been a common bit of most online team-based shooters for years, Splatoon only indicated the damage sustained by other players with the amount of ink covering them. Coupled with smaller hit boxes for Inklings and Octolings when in "swim form" (as well as adjustments to weapons' own hit boxes), combat encounters might change in a big way come Thursday. Getting behind cover and swimming away from danger will be more important than ever before.</p>
<p>You can find the full patch notes (complete with stat changes) <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Splatoon-3-2266003.html">here</a>. More updates for Splatoon 3 might also arrive in the near future, since a native Switch 2 version with further improvements <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">may be arriving soon</a>.</p>

            <guid>1417384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As promised by <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, the new <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong> feature is now publicly available via an update released for the <strong>NVIDIA app</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-soon-add-dynamic-fx-responds-to-in-game-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced earlier this month at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> for a late January release, RTX Remix Logic enables modders to <strong>dynamically trigger graphics effects in direct response to real-time in-game events</strong>. Critically, it achieves this without requiring source code or engine access, which would otherwise make it a dealbreaker in most cases.</p>



<p>NVIDIA says there are <strong>over 30 in-game events</strong> that can be triggered, such as:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Event Category</th><th data-align="left">Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Player state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Camera position, camera zoom, player world coordinates</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>World bounding boxes</strong></td><td data-align="left">Indoor/outdoor detection, region-specific triggers</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Object state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Any tracked object's position, visibility, and proximity to the player</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Time flow</strong></td><td data-align="left">In-game time of day, elapsed real-time</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Input</strong></td><td data-align="left">Specific key presses by the player</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p> These triggers can manipulate <strong>over 900 RTX Remix graphics parameters</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lighting conditions (time of day, color temperature, intensity)</li>



<li>Weather systems (rain, snow, fog density, volumetric effects)</li>



<li>Material properties (displacement, reflectivity, emissiveness)</li>



<li>Post-processing effects (chromatic aberration, bloom, vignette)</li>



<li>Path-traced volumetrics (smoke, atmospheric scattering)</li>
</ul>



<p>You won't even need to be a professional coder to add RTX Remix Logic to your mods. <strong>NVIDIA has introduced an accessible, no-code node-based interface</strong> where modders can easily drag-and-drop nodes representing triggers and actions, connect cause and effect relationships visually, fine-tune parameters with dedicated sliders and dropdowns, and finally preview all the changes they've made in real time within the Remix editor. More crafty RTX Remix modders will even be able to <strong>create and share custom event triggers</strong>, and new action nodes can be added via plugins, making the framework heavily extensible.</p>



<p>NVIDIA's demo was created in <strong>Half-Life 2 RTX</strong>, where RTX Remix Logic can trigger a '<strong>Ravenholm multiverse</strong>' whenever the player opens a specific door, as shown below. There are many RTX Remix mods in development (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we reported a new one for <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong> just yesterday</a>); it will be interesting to see which modders decide to add this new system to their mod projects. According to NVIDIA, RTX Remix Logic can be added to <strong>over 165 classic PC games</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Today, NVIDIA also shared a small update on new games that support its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) set of technologies. <strong>Half Sword</strong>, a physics-based medieval combat simulator scheduled to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will debut with built-in support for <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> with the option to upgrade <strong>Super Resolution</strong> to the second-generation <strong>DLSS 4.5</strong> transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong>, which is out now in advanced access (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find our review here</a>), supports DLSS Super Resolution. The same goes for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released free-to-play PvP raid shooter <strong>Highguard</strong></a>, in which GeForce RTX owners can also upgrade Super Resolution to DLSS 4.5 via the app.</p>

            <p>Quick confession: every time I come up with an absolute Frankenstein’s cocktail of allusion-cobbling Google-bait like the headline for this article, a fairy dies. But that’s OK, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-express">Hell Express</a> is a top-down 3D extraction shooter about delivering letters to the dead. When I play it – there’s no release date yet – I will convey a note of apology to the soul of the fairy I’ve just slain with my appalling SEO practices. This may be difficult, however, because many of the underworld’s denizens are hostile. The only thing you’ll be delivering to them is bullets, fire and explosives.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Hell Express is a PvE isometric extraction shooter for 1-4 players, blending heart-pounding combat, high-risk treasure hunts, and strategic resource management in a world teetering between life and death,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564490/Hell_Express/">the Steam page</a>. “As a member of Hell Express—an armed delivery company that sends delivery to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>—you'll choose from a diverse cast of characters, each with unique abilities and personal motives. Dive into the perilous depths of Limbo, complete dangerous deliveries, and scavenge for treasures to upgrade your gear and vehicles. But beware: every decision could mean the difference between survival and ruin.”</p>

<p>Further down the page they call it a "road trip", with a "Hell Trakker" van you can equip with flamethrowers. There are glimpses of the extraction mechanics, too, with a squad of players holding the line against boglins while hauling somebody's KO'd ass to the van. Still, I think I prefer what I've seen of the stealthy interior stretches. I hope it scrubs up well as a solo play - I don't need any co-op partners trampling on my atmosphere of mounting trepidation. Go watch the van, why don't you.</p><p>Hell Express was announced last year, and developers Full Metal Bagel Games have just signed up with Arc Games as publisher. Arc Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-sell-neverwinter-and-star-trek-online-devs-cryptic-allowing-them-to-gather-their-party-and-boldly-go-where-saber-went-before">used to be part of Embracer</a>, before Embracer fell into a giant, self-dug hole of layoffs and restructuring. They and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-online">Star Trek Online</a> developers Cryptic are now part of Project Golden Arc, an operation run by members of the Arc Games management team with funding from XD Inc. </p>
<p>As for Full Metal Bagel, they apparently include “industry veterans who’ve worked on highly acclaimed titles like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last of Us Part II</a>, Assassin’s Creed Origins, Honor of Kings, and more.” As ever with these things, it’s unclear whether “veterans” here means people whose contributions to those games were significant enough to imply anything substantial about the game they're making now.</p>
<p>A quick LinkedIn trawl reveals that Full Metal Bagel’s art director is Keyi Li, who was a senior concept artist at Ubisoft and Tencent. I do like the art direction of Hell Express. There’s an enticing balance of crisp military tech, convoluted and decayed layouts, and paranormal fixtures or interruptions. Did you see the queue of petrified people by the derelict bus in the announcement trailer? I thought that was one of the better queues of petrified people I’ve seen in a game – probably, one of my top three.</p>

<p>Look out for a Hell Express playtest this spring.

A fairy probably died for that headline, too.</p>

              <p>Desk space is a luxury these days, especially for people working from home or studying in smaller apartments. A full-size tower PC can feel excessive when all you really need is reliable performance which you can get from something more compact. Mini PCs solve that problem neatly, and the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is a strong example of how much power can fit into a surprisingly small box. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6899/">Right now, it’s also much cheaper than usual, thanks to Amazon discounts that shave as much as $240 off select configurations.</a></p>
<p>The first thing you notice about the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is its size. It’s compact enough to sit unobtrusively on a desk, tuck onto a shelf, or mount behind a monitor. It works for students, professionals, or really anyone building a clean, minimalist workspace.</p>
<p>ACEMAGIC is offering multiple configurations to suit different needs and budgets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p><strong>The entry-level option comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with integrated graphics</strong>. This setup is more than capable of handling everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and light creative work. It normally sells for $459, but the current discount drops the price to $329, marking a 28% savings.</p>

<p>Users who need extra power can step up to the higher-end model, which includes 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. This version runs on the AMD Ryzen 7 H 255 processor and is better suited for heavier multitasking, larger and more plentiful files, and more demanding applications. Its usual $759 price tag has been cut to $519, a 32% discount that brings premium specs into a far more approachable range. Storage expansion is also supported, with room to add an additional SSD for up to 4TB total capacity.</p>
<h2>Small Stature, Big Performance</h2>
<p>In daily use, performance feels snappy and responsive. The system handles office software, photo editing, and multitasking without slowing down, particularly in the 32GB configuration. Windows 11 Pro comes preinstalled, so setup is quick and straightforward right out of the box.</p>



<p>Display options are well supported. Using USB4 Type-C or DisplayPort 2.0, it can drive an 8K display at 60Hz. An HDMI port supports 4K at 60Hz. The three together means up to three monitors can be connected at once without any extra adapters.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 4.2 keep wireless connections fast and stable, while six USB 3.2 ports provide enough room for wired peripherals. Cooling is handled by dual centrifugal fans, a layered fin design, and a dedicated aluminum heatsink for the SSD, keeping noise and temperatures under control.</p>
<p>For anyone looking to reclaim desk space without giving up performance, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is worth a look—especially with current discounts pushing the top configuration down to just $519.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Landmark case could have huge repercussions for the wider industry.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A UK court has ruled that the unauthorized stealing of in-game currency can be legally classified as criminal theft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Jagex developer Andrew Lakeman was charged with allegedly stealing 705 billion Gold from almost 70 RuneScape players, with a real-world value of over half a million pounds, equivalent to around $750,000. He then sold this currency online for Bitcoin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Lakeman had no access to player accounts in his position at Jagex as a content developer, he allegedly accessed them by "hacking and/or using credentials of members of the account recovery team." In all, 68 players allegedly lost gold to Lakeman, starting around 2018.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here comes the science bit: the defendant's defence claimed that the in-game currency could not be classed as property under the definition of the UK's Theft Act, and initially, the court agreed, concluding that as RuneScape gold is not real — or "pure information" or "knowledge" as it's legally defined — it could not technically be stealable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The judge at the time also deemed RuneScape's supply of Gold as being infinite, and it wasn't "rivalrous" given that having a piece of Gold doesn't deprive another player of getting Gold, too. The Court of Appeal, however, disagreed and last week handed down a <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2026/4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>judgment</u></a> while explaining its reasoning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We differ from the Judge in his reasoning for reaching the contrary conclusion on rivalrousness. The two reasons which the Judge gave in his ruling do not, with respect, bear analysis," Judge Popplewell wrote. "The first was that 'one gold piece is like any other, and their supply is infinite.' This does not, however, distinguish them from many other forms of rivalrous property. One paper clip from a given manufacturer is like any other; and the manufacture and supply of them infinite, in the sense that is not capped at any finite number. Yet each paper clip constitutes property. The same is equally true of gold pieces."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[RuneScape's gold is] properly described as something which can be stolen as a matter of normal use of language," the judgment added. "They do not fall within any of the established exceptions. They are not 'pure knowledge:' functionally, they exist as identifiable assets distinct from the code which gives rise to them and outside the minds of people. There is no good policy reason for excepting them from the category of property which can be stolen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The judgment concluded: "On the contrary, they are assets which have an ascertainable monetary value and which may be traded for that value both in the game and outside the game. Within the rules of the game they represent money’s worth as the product of purchase of a bond. Outside the game they are regularly traded for money’s worth. They are capable of being subject to dishonest dealing which deprives their possessor of their use and value. It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if such dishonest dealing did not amount to the offence of theft."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a judgment that could have profound implications for the games industry, as up until now, vendors that sell (or re-sell) in-game currency have existed in a grey market wherein <em>technically,</em> no theft has occurred if the digital asset stolen did not meet the definition of an intangible item under the definitions of theft in that country. The dubious line of when ownership of any such in-game currency transfers from the developer to the player — if at all — further compounds an already complex issue, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the issue of whether removing gold from player accounts constituted theft now settled, the case against Lakeman can proceed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension! Yayayaya.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015156898040049967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 24, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That comment, which pointed to Highguard’s confirmed release date, came alongside an image of a supposed Highguard event badge, which some have speculated may have been generated by AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Highguard’s launch, questions were raised about the validity of Dr Disrespect’s post. Then, Wildlight Entertainment creator manager Chin Pua <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter</a> to confirm Dr Disrespect had not attended the event, and that the badge was not official.

Did we say we went to the event? Did we say we got hands on? Did I say I was going to give you my review and feedback today? Huh? Did we say we were going to give our feedback and review today? ‘We got hands-on Highguard.’ Did I say that? Did we play the game? No. We just put together a photo poking fun. All these f***ing people took it seriously. Holy s**t. How brain dead is this f***ing industry? How stupid is this industry?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr Disrespect went on to hit out at his critics, defend his current brand, and insist he remains relevant. Dr Disrespect returned to YouTube in September 2024 three months after he was demonetized and suspended from the YouTube Partner Program following allegations regarding past conduct with a minor. Beahm has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highguard launched last night and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-launches-to-big-steam-concurrents-but-its-getting-absolutely-destroyed-in-user-reviews">met with big Steam concurrents but also a flood of negative user reviews</a>.

<p>The new sales figure means <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>has garnered <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">another million sales since the end of March</a>, which rather validates Capcom's concern that sales slowed down dramatically after launch, although whether the so-called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"PS5 barrier" is to blame</a> is another matter.</p><p>Capcom also says that sales of the <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake<em> </em>and <em>Resident Evil Village </em>grew thanks to the announcement of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which is due to arrive next month. Both games had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="649d13dc-948c-45a4-b39b-fbab7260a9b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million sales barrier</a> at last count.</p><p>With regards to Capcom's future, the company has a pretty packed slate. The aforementioned <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>leads the pack, but there's also <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 </em>and <em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection </em>to look forward to in March.</p><p>In total, Capcom sold 34.64 million game units between March and December 2025, which is around four million units higher than the previous year's total. It's fair to say Capcom is on the up right now.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-all-in-on-soundbars-ht-s400-with-wireless-subwoofer-is-even-cheaper-than-airpods-2000663275</link>
            <guid>1417321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most TVs don’t come with strong built-in speakers. If your entertainment setup is missing solid sound, and you often find yourself fiddling with the volume settings and rewinding scenes just to hear what was said, it might be time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>A soundbar can be an excellent investment, and you don’t have to break the bank to pick one up today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/">The Sony HT-S400 2.1ch soundbar bundle, which includes a wireless subwoofer, is currently going for $228 at Amazon, after an impressive 24% discount on its usual $300 price</a>. You’re saving $72 on an option that’s going to make movies and TV shows a lot more enjoyable by offering a truly immersive listening experience. This $228 price is also the lowest we have seen the soundbar go for in the last 30 days. Just note that the stock is already running low. We suggest placing your orders without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>Both the soundbar plus the subwoofer come in a minimal design, and are made to easily blend into any room. The soundbar features a flat back, so you can mount it on a wall for an even cleaner setup.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it’s got S-Force PRO Front Surround and Dolby Digital that come together to create a 3D, cinematic style surround sound that follows you. Audio won’t be blasted from a single place but instead, fill the room in a natural way. Think whispers coming from across the couch, laughter in the air, footsteps around the room – basically, the kind of immersive sound that makes you feel like a part of whatever’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>Then there’s the X-Balanced Speaker Unit and Separated Notch Edge, which deliver wide-ranging sound and enhanced vocal clarity for crisp dialogs. You won’t miss a word, whether the characters are mumbling to themselves or whispering a secret out. The included wireless subwoofer takes the experience even further. It has a large 160mm speaker unit to push deeper, richer bass that brings music to life. You’ll enjoy all the highs and lows exceptionally well. What’s more, there are multiple sound modes to choose from, including Sound Field, Voice Mode, and Night Mode. The Voice mode, for instance, offers clearer dialogs, while the night mode reduces the overall volume to avoid disturbing others around the house. So, just to recap – this system gets you better dialogs, richer bass, and an overall surround sound experience for all your favorite movies, TV shows, and tracks. That’s almost like bringing the cinema home!</p>
<p>Setting things up and getting started couldn’t be easier. You can connect the system to your TV with either HDMI ARC or optical connection, or other devices via Bluetooth. The OLED display window on the sound bar keeps you in the loop about information such as input source, volume, and sound settings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/">There’s plenty more to like here, especially now that the soundbar, along with the subwoofer, can be yours for just $228</a>. It’s a rare drop on a highly-rated model, but it won’t last long. It’s best to grab it while the offer is still live to avoid paying full price later.</p>

            <guid>1417318</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994"><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i></a> <span>was one of the big surprises during last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>Gamescom: Opening Night Live</span></a><span> showcase. Not only is it mechanically a pretty big departure from the usual fare of Traveller’s Tales’ </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games, but it also kind of seems like a follow-up to the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games that we’ve been lacking for over a decade. The game’s still a few months away, so let’s break down everything we know so far.</span></p> <h2><b>The obvious </b><b><i>Arkham </i></b><b>influence</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>draws heavily from Rocksteady’s </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games. Like those games, it takes place in an open-world Gotham with Bruce gliding and grappling around as he finds thugs to beat up and Riddler puzzles to solve. When he’s on the ground, the mini-figure Batman rides around on a motorcycle and in the Batmobile, and in combat, he throws almost rhythmic punches, kicks, and parries like he does in the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games. When I played the game in October, my muscle memory for those old games kicked in pretty quick. It’s QTE-driven, which means that if you’re on top of your blocks and dodges, you can pretty much dance your way through a fight without taking a hit.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>fans will also recognize a few of Batman’s tools, including the explosive gel that he uses to break through walls. Overall, it looks like Traveller’s Tales is stepping up in Rocksteady’s absence.</span></p> <h2><b>Playable characters</b></h2> <p><span>Like most </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games, </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>is a co-op game. One player will play as Batman, while the other can play as multiple characters from a rotating roster of partners. The ones we know of include Catwoman, Jim Gordon, Nightwing, Robin, and Talia al Ghul. Each of them will have a special ability, which will sometimes be necessary to progress through a level. Gordon, for example, has a foam gun which can be used to block obstacles in Batman’s way. If you don’t have someone to play with, you can swap between characters on the fly to use these abilities.</span></p>

 <h2><b>An homage to the many Batmen that came before</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>seems to pay tribute to multiple versions of Batman from movies, animation, and of course, comic books. Some notable cameos we’ve seen in the trailer include characters from the Christopher Nolan, Tim Burton, and Matt Reeves films, and no matter what version of </span><i><span>Batman</span></i><span> is your favorite, you’ll probably see it celebrated here. The idea is that you’ll be playing through a blocky version of Batman’s life, drawing from different iterations but telling the general story of how he went from sad orphan boy to sad orphan man who beats up people in dark alleyways. We’ll surely see cameos from different characters, such as the rest of the Bat Family, his butler Alfred, and maybe members of the Justice League and League of Assassins. Plus, we know we’ll see plenty of Batman’s iconic villains, such as the Joker, Bane, the Penguin, and Poison Ivy.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Release date and system info</b></h2> <p><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S on May 29, with a Switch 2 version expected later in the year.</span></p>

			<p>If you are a fan of the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series, you are well aware of how <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is <strong>struggling</strong> in more ways than one. Launched successfully in late February 2025, the game's <strong>low challenge level</strong> and <strong>performance issues</strong> prevented it from capitalizing on its launch momentum.</p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">Title Updates</a></strong> released last year <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">addressed the low challenge level</a></strong> of the experience, this wasn't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enough</strong> for many fans of the series, who <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">returned to previous entries in the series</strong> such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter World</em> to get their hunting fix.</p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>producer Yuya Tokuda pleaded with lapsed players to return</strong></a>, but it seems the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation</strong> and the <strong>performance issues that still persist</strong> are not only keeping players away, but are <strong>deterring new ones</strong> as well.</p>



<p>Earlier today, CAPCOM shared <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf"><strong>a list of its best-selling games</strong></a> for the third quarter of the current fiscal year. While <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/"><strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong></a>,</em> and the <em>Resident Evil</em> series <strong>enjoyed strong sales</strong>, the same cannot be said of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>



<p>The latest entry in the series sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">354,000 units</strong> in the third quarter, as opposed to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">453,000 units of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em> and the 431,000 units of its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sunbreak</em></a> expansion</strong>. This difference in units sold (which may have been helped by the deep discounts of the older games offered during the holiday period), and its status as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">publisher's worst-selling game in the quarter</strong>, further highlight the struggle <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is facing, and can't seem to overcome.</p>



<p><span><em>"Rise selling more than Wilds is pretty damning,"</em>&nbsp;commented <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-q3-fy2025-best-selling-games-re4-1-08m-re-village-717k-sf6-600k-re2-529k-mh-rise-453k-mh-wilds-354k.1417129/post-150569974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetERA forums member Gilo</a></strong>, a sentiment that describes well a&nbsp;<strong>baffling and unexpected situation,</strong>&nbsp;a</span>nd that reflects how the gaming community is reacting to <strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' low sales.</strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bluetti-mini-portable-power-station-drops-below-black-friday-prices-now-an-affordable-emergency-backup-for-outages-2000663272</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power stations make it easy to keep your important devices, as well as essential home appliances, running during outages and off-road trips. If you’re concerned about a winter storm affecting the electricity supply in your area, or just want a reliable backup power solution for your outdoor adventures, a power station can come in handy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/">Now is a great time to pick up a portable option, as Amazon is offering the Bluetti Elite 10 mini at a 43% discount today.</a> You can pick it up for just $113, after saving a nice $86 on its retail price. This offer applies to both grey and meadow green versions of the power station. The only thing to note here is that the offer is only around for a limited time. We highly suggest grabbing it sooner rather than later if you want to avoid paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to Carry</h2>
<p>This power station is truly portable. It fits in your palm, weighs just 4.0 lbs, and features an ergonomic handle that makes the thing incredibly easy to carry around. In fact, it fits within the size guidelines of most airlines, so you can take it with you on flights, too.</p>
<p>As for the power, the Elite 10 is a 128Wh option that’s equivalent to 4 regular power banks. You’re getting a 200W AC outlet, 100W USB-C fast charging, and multiple DC ports to keep multiple devices charged and running. The capacity is more than enough to charge your smartphone more than 6 times and juice a laptop to full twice. You can even power a mini fridge for around 1.8 times, or keep a projector running for a bit. It plays nicely with a wide range of devices, so whether it’s your tech essentials that need a boost or some emergency lights requiring power, it supports them all.</p>



<p>The Elite 10 mini includes a built-in light with three lighting modes with up to 50 hours of illumination, too. These include warm, cool, and SOS, which is handy in low-light situations and emergencies. You can control the power station right through your phone using the dedicated app. It lets you keep an eye on the charging situation, choose light modes, adjust input, and more.</p>
<p>When it comes to recharging the power station itself, you can power it back up in three ways. The first is 150W AC charging, which helps it hit 100% in just over an hour. The 100W solar charging (best to pair with Bluetti 60W/100W panels), and 100W car charging via cigarette lighter are supported too. What’s even better is that the Elite 10 mini comes with a built-in 10ms UPS and features 350W bypass output, which can keep gadgets running without interruption during outages.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the Bluetti Elite 10 mini power station itself, an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, and a user manual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/">You can pick this portable, easy-to-use, but powerful option for $113 at Amazon.</a> This is nothing considering the ease of mind and convenience this appliance brings. Be sure to get your orders in fast, as the deal can wrap up any moment now.</p>
