			<p>A new Star Wars Outlaws update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 on PC and a PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvement, among other small fixes.</p>
<p>Title Update 1.5.1, which is around 3 GB big on PC and Xbox consoles and 1.93 GB big on PlayStation 5, introduces NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on PC, allowing owners of any NVIDIA RTX graphics card to enjoy better image quality with the new Transformer model and RTX 50 series graphics card owners to boost FPS by using AI to generate up to three frames per traditionally rendered frame.</p>
<p>The new Star Wars Outlaws title update also brings, as mentioned above, a PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvement, updating the PSSR upscaler to the latest version, which addresses some image quality issues that were very clearly noticeable in the previous version of the game. Additionally, the update fixes a few other small issues on every platform, as detailed in the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1O5273Z4vy6zpjNxkW4htN">official patch notes.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws launched last year in a far from optimal state, but developer Ubisoft Massive has consistently improved the game, fixing the biggest issues and tweaking the gameplay as needed. In a previous update, the developer also removed some divisive <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stealth missions to </a>enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

I don’t think it’s appropriate.” </p><p>By some estimates, average AAA game budgets have more than doubled every console generation. The first <em>Spider-Man </em>on PlayStation 4 was around $100 million to make. <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>on PlayStation 5 was over $300 million. But the games don’t sell dramatically better and are only priced $10 higher. </p><p>Some games try to make up the difference with aggressive microtransaction shops. Karch thinks part of <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s success, and the way fans flocked to it, can be attributed to its one-and-done campaign and the fact it doesn’t “milk, nickel and dime” players like live-service games. </p><p>Insomniac Games, the studio behind <em>Spider-Man 1</em> and <em>2</em>, like many teams in the video game industry over the last few years, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233">suffered layoffs just a few months after the sequel came</a></span> out despite strong sales. “I don’t know how best to put it...I think if anything has contributed more to the loss of jobs, it’s the multi-hundred million dollar budget,” Karch told <em>Game File</em>.</p><p>He pitches <em>Space Marine 2 </em>as an alternative. Last year, former id Software studio director turned Saber Interactive chief creative officer, Tim Willits, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-sequel-dlc-expansion-1851654810&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-sequel-dlc-expansion-1851654810">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> that<em>&nbsp;</em>the sequel to the cult-favorite Xbox 360-era shooter<em>&nbsp;</em>only cost half of what it took to make <em>Doom Eternal</em>, but looks and plays equally well. No doubt part of that is due to much cheaper development costs outside of the U.S. where most of Saber Interactive’s staff work. </p><p> “We can make games [like] <em>Space Marine,</em>” Karch told <em>Game File </em>this week. “You’re not going to tell me it doesn’t have a Triple A vibe to it. You may say, ‘Oh it’s double-A plus.’ It’s a solid game. Its budget was a quarter of what anybody else would spend.” </p><p>Whether <em>Space Marine 2</em> proves to be the exception or the new rule remains to be seen. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017">Others warn</a></span> that the mid-level space it’s playing in is essentially dead for all but the biggest standouts, swallowed up by <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and other mega-hits that consume an increasing amount of money and time from a limited number of players.

                <p>Despite a decade of anticipation from Dragon Age fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">EA confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> failed to meet the company's financial expectations <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-dragon-age-the-veilguard-coming-up-short-and-explains-what-happened/1100-6529252/" data-ref-id="1100-6529252">during a recent earnings call</a>. EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that The Veilguard's underperformance is a reflection of the "evolving industry landscape." EA's CFO Stuart Canfield went one step further <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and seemed to suggest</a> that The Veilguard would have performed better if it was a live-service game. Now, a former Dragon Age developer has shared his response to EA.</p><p>Ex-Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw posted his thoughts on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lhhb477frc2h" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, where he facetiously asked "Who'd be silly enough to demand something like that? ...Twice." At one point during its development, The Veilguard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">was going to be a live-service title</a> before the decision was made to reverse course and go back to a single-player experience.</p><p>"Look, I'm not a fancy CEO guy," wrote Laidlaw. "But if someone said to me 'The key to this successful single-player IP's success is to make it purely a multiplayer game. No, not a spin-off: fundamentally change the DNA of what people loved about the core game,' to me, I'd probably, like, quit that job or something."</p><p>Laidlaw actually did quit his job at BioWare, and he went on to found an indie studio called Yellow Brick Games, which recently released its first game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/eternal-strands-review-magic-weaver/1900-6418331/" data-ref-id="1900-6418331">Eternal Strands</a>.</p><p>If EA executives really believe that live-service would have made The Veilguard a success, it calls into question whether the company will make Mass Effect 5 into a live-service experience. BioWare was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">hit with a number of layoffs</a> after The Veilguard's poor performance, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-reportedly-has-fewer-than-100-staff-members-left/1100-6529194/" data-ref-id="1100-6529194">now reportedly has less than 100 devs left</a> to work on the next Mass Effect.</p>

This will enable a hip-fired Starlight Beam to apply Jolt to any targets damaged for a short time. You can slow the rate at which the battery drains by aiming down the weapon’s sights. This new Exotic can be obtained in the season pass, and its Arc energy means it’s a perfect pairing for the Arc adjustments that have been made for all classes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Finality’s Auger</h3><p dir="ltr">This Solar Linear Fusion Rifle is the Exotic you can get from completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-new-dungeon-sundered-doctrine-release-date-race-details-and-everything-to-know/1100-6528872/" data-ref-id="1100-6528872">Sundered Doctrine dungeon</a>. Its Ruinscribe’s Forge perk allows you to hold your alternate weapon action button to fire a special projectile that will deploy a Ruinscribe Turret. This costs three ammo to fire, and can be aimed towards the sky to provide the best and clearest sightlines for the turret. When deployed, the turret will automatically shoot at nearby enemies. While the turret is deployed, Finality’s Auger can paint targets with its laser projectiles, making the turret prioritize those painted targets, firing more powerful rounds at them. You can use the alternate weapon action button to trigger the laser fire mode on or off. While this weapon isn't yet viewable in-game, you can expect to see it following the first completion of the new dungeon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439789-destiny-2-heresy-barrow-dyad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439789" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439789-destiny-2-heresy-barrow-dyad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439789"></a><figcaption>Barrow-Dyad Exotic submachine gun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439789-destiny-2-heresy-barrow-dyad.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Barrow-Dyad</h3><p dir="ltr">One of the most interesting-looking weapons in Destiny 2 to date, not much is yet known about Barrow-Dyad. It was revealed during the Heresy broadcast on Bungie’s channels, and seems to be an overpowered Strand SMG. Its intrinsic perk, Panic Response, means that it generates Blight by dealing damage to enemies. When not firing, Blight depletes, and the magazine is refilled automatically. Reloading manually will convert the stored Blight into Blighted Seekers, which hunt down enemies and deal Strand damage when bouncing between multiple foes. Taken Divergence, another of Barrow-Dyad’s perks, grants large amounts of Blight if you hit three or more targets in rapid succession. While it’s not yet known how you grab this weapon, we’d place our bets on it making an appearance during one of Heresy’s Exotic missions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439792-destiny-2-heresy-weapons.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439792" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439792-destiny-2-heresy-weapons.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439792"></a><figcaption>The Destiny 2 Heresy seasonal weapons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439792-destiny-2-heresy-weapons.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Destiny 2 Heresy seasonal weapons</span></h2><p dir="ltr">There are four new weapons available to get through Heresy Act 1’s seasonal activity, The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-nether-activity-explained-and-how-to-get-secret-loot/1100-6529277/" data-ref-id="1100-6529277">Nether</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Adamantite</h3><p dir="ltr">Adamantite is a Strand Auto Rifle capable of healing allies and injuring enemies. Dealing damage to targets will build a restorative charge that can be deployed at an ally to heal them by hip firing. Rapid healing will also increase the weapon damage of your ally, and spawn additional Unraveling projectiles that will seek out and injure nearby foes.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Reciprocity</li><li dir="ltr">Slice</li><li dir="ltr">Unrelenting</li><li dir="ltr">Subsistence</li><li dir="ltr">Ensemble</li><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist</li><li dir="ltr">Pugilist</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In its second perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Elemental Honing</li><li dir="ltr">Hatchling</li><li dir="ltr">Circle of Life</li><li dir="ltr">Tear</li><li dir="ltr">Attrition Orbs</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzy</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Clip</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Psychopomp</h3><p dir="ltr">One of the catchier names of the new weapons, Psychopomp is an Arc Grenade Launcher with burst-fire projectiles. Each one creates a lingering pool on impact that deals damage over time--think Witherhoard, but without taking up an Exotic weapon slot. In this way, it's reminiscent of Lost Signal which behaves similarly, and was added during Episode: Echoes. In its first perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Envious Arsenal</li><li dir="ltr">Eddy Current</li><li dir="ltr">Ambitious Assassin</li><li dir="ltr">Feeding Frenzy</li><li dir="ltr">Pugilist</li><li dir="ltr">Stats for All</li><li dir="ltr">Threat Detector</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In its second perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Harmony</li><li dir="ltr">Elemental Honing</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzy</li><li dir="ltr">Full Court</li><li dir="ltr">Rolling Storm</li><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist</li><li dir="ltr">Unrelenting</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Watchful Eye</h3><p dir="ltr">Watchful Eye sits in the Power weapon slot, and is an Arc Machine Gun. It rolls with Aggressive Frame, meaning it has high damage at the sacrifice of high recoil. Aside from that, it seems to be your run-of-the-mill Destiny 2 Machine Gun.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Overflow</li><li dir="ltr">Dynamic Sway Reduction</li><li dir="ltr">Mulligan</li><li dir="ltr">Wellspring</li><li dir="ltr">Hip-Fire Grip</li><li dir="ltr">Field Prep</li><li dir="ltr">Eddy Current</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In its second perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Jolting Feedback</li><li dir="ltr">Rolling Storm</li><li dir="ltr">Killing Tally</li><li dir="ltr">Elemental Honing</li><li dir="ltr">Surrounded</li><li dir="ltr">Target Lock</li><li dir="ltr">Sword Logic</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Abyssal Edge</h3><p dir="ltr">Abyssal Edge is a Strand Sword that has the Wave Sword Frame intrinsic perk. This means its heavy attack can deploy a shockwave to uppercut and launch you into the air. Immediately following this up with a swing will deploy a strike that homes in on and aggressively seeks out a nearby target.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Energy Transfer</li><li dir="ltr">Slice</li><li dir="ltr">Tireless Blade</li><li dir="ltr">Relentless Strikes</li><li dir="ltr">Duelist’s Trance</li><li dir="ltr">Valiant Charge</li><li dir="ltr">Flash Counter</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In its second perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hatchling</li><li dir="ltr">Elemental Honing</li><li dir="ltr">En Garde</li><li dir="ltr">Sword Logic</li><li dir="ltr">Redirection</li><li dir="ltr">Surrounded</li><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439793-destiny-2-heresy-trials.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439793" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439793-destiny-2-heresy-trials.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439793"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2 Heresy Trials of Osiris weapons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439793-destiny-2-heresy-trials.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Destiny 2 Heresy - Trials of Osiris weapons</span></h2><h3 dir="ltr">Keen Thistle</h3><p dir="ltr">This Solar Sniper Rifle is brand new to the game, and comes with the Aggressive Frame perk: high damage, but high recoil.

            <p>Roblox shares have dropped by 20 percent after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter (ending 31st December), the number of daily active users fell by four percent to 85.3 million compared to the previous quarter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/roblox-shares-plummet-after-miss-on-daily-active-users-bookings?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> has reported. Wall Street analysts had forecasted 88.4 million. Overall player engagement also declined by 9.7 percent in the same period to 18.7bn hours.</p>
<p>Bookings, the company's measure of sales, totalled $1.36bn (£1.09bn), also falling shy of its forecast of $1.37bn(£1.1bn).</p>

<p>In an earnings call, Roblox CFO Mike Guthrie noted growth in Eastern Europe was "quite a bit slower" than anticipated, owing to a ban of the platform in Türkiye over child safety concerns.</p>
<p>That ban took place in August last year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">Roblox responding at the time</a>: "We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers' commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Now, Guthrie has stated this last quarter was "the first full quarter where Türkiye has been off".</p>
<p>On a more positive note, in this quarter Roblox shared a record $281m with its game developers. CEO David Baszucki said in the earnings call this reflected the company's commitment to paying creators.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">report by People Make Games</a> accused Roblox of exploiting children as young developers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift">Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza further discussed this with Eurogamer</a> last year, with the company later clarifying it does not hire minors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will get an official prequel story, fittingly told by a tie-in manga series. 
</p>
<p>
But rather than simply adapting the story of Ubisoft's upcoming feudal Japan stabathon, the series will instead be set some time prior.
</p>
<p>
The manga's first slice will be available in Japan alongside Shadows itself, when it arrives on 20th March. Elsewhere in the world, however, we'll have to wait a little longer.
</p>
<p>
"Follow the story of a young Assassin apprentice, as she fights against the growing presence of the Templars order in Japan," reads Ubisoft's description of the manga series. "Available in Japan at the launch of the game and later elsewhere."
</p>
<p>
Cover art for the first issue shows a young female Assassin wielding a sword as well as the iconic Hidden Blade. Is this Naoe, the shinobi co-protagonist of Shadows itself? I'm not sure. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> will get its own manga!</p><p>Discover the official prequel of the game. Follow the story a young Assassin apprentice, as she fights against the growing presence of the Templars order in Japan.</p><p>Available in Japan at the launch of the game and later elsewhere. <a href="https://t.co/TLn6DyOVB7">pic.twitter.com/TLn6DyOVB7</a></p></div>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1887426010427089267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
For starters, the moment that Naoe obtains the Hidden Blade for the first time is actually shown early on in Assassin's Creed Shadows itself - meaning she likely isn't the menacing looking Assassin shown here. Beyond that,  its opening sequences - which Eurogamer has now played - seem to indicate Naoe isn't yet versed in who either of the Assassins or the Templars are.
</p>
<p>
So, this looks to be an entirely different protagonist entirely - unless Ubisoft has some other kind of time-wimey shenanigans going on.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-spoilers-splurged-on-adult-cartoon-website">spoilers for the upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows popped up online</a> after the game's unreleased artbook was leaked via an adult cartoon website.
</p>
<p>
"Shadows looks to be very much on track to become that feudal Japanese fantasy we've long been hankering for," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows hands-on preview</a>. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait."

<p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-studios-staff-silently-reduced-by-over-100-people-japan-pension-service-database-shows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, the Japanese online pension registry, which shows how many employees business have enrolled, shows a diminished number of staff in February when compared to April 2024.</p>

<p>Automaton says that the register showed Bandai Namco employed 1,294 people in April 2024, but that this number had fallen to 1,177 as of the last update, which took place on February 4th. That represents a drop of 117 people.</p>

<p>As Automaton points out, a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;in October alleged that Bandai Namco staff were essentially being coerced to leave the company voluntarily through the use of "oidashi beya", or "banishment rooms".</p>

<p>Employees were allegedly placed in these rooms with no real tasks to complete, effectively pressuring them into leaving the company and circumventing what Bloomberg calls "some of the world's strictest labor protection laws".</p>

<p>Bandai Namco itself denied those reports, and the reduction in headcount at the studio naturally doesn't provide any kind of evidence that oidashi beya were being used, but it does look like the studio underwent a fairly significant staff drop between April and February.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=CPbVS1Pf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=mYs-zAVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bandai Namco is gearing up to release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that since this staff reduction hasn't been officially announced, it might not even technically be correct to call them "layoffs", since some staff may have left voluntarily or retired.</p>

<p>This report also comes after Bandai Namco released its <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250205_en_Result.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a> for the nine-month period between April and December 2024, which shows growth in both profit and sales for the company.</p>

<p>That boost is, according to Bandai Namco, attributable in part to things like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">"massive success"</a> of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, as well as strong sales for both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>.</p>

<p>The VALORANT Esports division of Riot Games announced today that Sony gaming gear brand INZONE will operate as a primary sponsor for the VCT EMEA league through the end of 2026. INZONE branded monitors will be primary display used at the Riot Games Arena in Berlin.</p>



<hr>



<p>Officially, INZONE will act as a “Main Partner and the Official Gaming Display Partner” for the VCT EMEA league. INZONE is no stranger to VALORANT sponsorship: the brand already sponsors the use of its headsets in the VCT. Two prominent organizations in Fnatic and ZETA DIVISION also have pre-existing sponsorship deals with the company. INZONE says Fnatic even helped design the monitor used on stage, which features a unique picture mode optimized for VALORANT.”</p>



<p>As part of the sponsorship deal, INZONE will put INZONE M10S OLED monitors in “coach rooms, practice areas, and co-stream rooms,” per the official announcement. They will also be highlighted at the “1v1 station in the fan zone” during match days. INZONE branding and advertisements have already been featured on the broadcasts, alongside other sponsors PaysafeCard and Red Bull.</p>



<p>While the addition of INZONE as a main sponsor is a welcome addition to VALORANT Esports and Riot Games, many viewers are curious to see if and when gambling sponsors are eventually implemented. This past December, Riot confirmed to Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teams in Americas and EMEA would be allowed to “explore” partnerships with Riot approved betting platforms</a>. At the time, Riot stated that no betting brands would appear on broadcasts or socials: “Riot-owned channels will stay betting-free.” But based on the success of betting partnerships with teams, Riot could easily change the rules. Back in 2021, after barring TSM from using cryptocurrency exchange partner FTX in their name, Riot themselves <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/sources-lcs-lands-seven-year-ftx-sponsorship-deal-as-first-crypto-exchange-partner-of-any-riot-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">landed a seven year sponsorship deal</a> between the LCS and FTX.</p>

Excellent indie adventure Dungeons of Hinterberg will belatedly launch on PlayStation next month.
</p>
<p>
A PS5 version will become available on 13th March, after previously arriving for PC and Xbox Series X/S last summer.
</p>
<p>
This new version will also include a "new, secret bonus episode", publisher Curve Games said today - though details of what exactly this will be remain under-wraps. Presumably, the PC and Xbox versions will get this addition via a free update too.

<p>
If you're yet to try Dungeons of Hinterberg, it's an enjoyable Zelda-inspired adventure that splits its time between exploration and combat in various Alpine biomes, breezy dungeons filled with monsters and puzzle-solving, and then a social side set within a nearby town full of residents to befriend and side-quests to take on.
</p>
<p>
"Combat and RPG progression get an ingenious social twist in this disarming slice of fantasy," our Chris Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review">Eurogamer's Dungeons of Hinterberg review</a>, reserving particular praise for the game's overall narrative.
</p>
<p>
"The protagonist's story hinges on burnout, but also the question of how one should spend their time and what they should value," Donlan wrote. "The story that unravels in the village, meanwhile, slowly starts to blur the distinctions the game has been careful to build up, touching on everything from the cost of tourism to the question of authenticity. It's gripping stuff."
</p>
<p>
"If you play games for escapism, there are few this year that did it better," Chris Tapsell added, recommending Dungeons of Hinterberg in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's best games of 2024</a>. "It's a dreamy, warm-hearted, timely and deeply welcome retreat."

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne PSX&nbsp;</em>(using the console's early PlayStation X codename) was previously available on Itch.io, but a <a href="https://itch.io/takedowns/1370201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">takedown</a>&nbsp;was issued by Sony yesterday, and the game's <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/bbpsx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a> now simply leads to a single line of text stating its files have been "suspended for copyright or trademark claim".</p>

<p>This is the second&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-related DMCA notice Sony has issued in a week. Last Friday, modder Lance McDonald revealed he'd received a DMCA instructing him to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow">take down his 60fps patch</a> for the game, an instruction with which he quickly complied.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-lantern.jpg?itok=WgvfGR1F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-lantern.jpg?itok=e4SISVv_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lilith Walther's&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne PSX&nbsp;</em>demake is no longer available to download thanks to a DMCA.</figcaption></figure><p>These DMCA notices have sparked speculation that Sony could be about to announce its own official&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster; after all, there's got to be a reason Sony is suddenly taking notice of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-related fan projects online, right?</p>

<p>Well...not necessarily. This isn't the first time Walther has run afoul of Sony with regards to&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fan projects; last year, she was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date" rel="nofollow">told by Sony</a> that she needed to scrub the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>branding from racer&nbsp;<em>Nightmare Kart&nbsp;</em>and release it as its own thing.</p>

<p>Of course, it's possible that was also part of Sony's plans to release a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster, but many months have passed between then and now, and no&nbsp;remaster or remake of the game was revealed in the interim.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that this DMCA, as well as the one aimed at McDonald, just represents Sony's lawyers suddenly waking up and realizing they need to look busy, but as a huge&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fan myself, I understand the need for hope.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-kart-nightmare-kart.jpg?itok=SQI8iow2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-kart-nightmare-kart.jpg?itok=1dIYdGt1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nightmare Kart&nbsp;</em>was once known as&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne Kart&nbsp;</em>before Sony got involved.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Bloodborne</em>'s age and relatively poor performance on PS4 have resulted in repeated calls for a remaster or remake over the years, but Sony has yet to heed those calls.</p>

<p>However, a State of Play presentation is rumored to be landing next week, as <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hinted at</a> by Switch 2 date leaker NateTheHate. It's possible that Sony intends to reveal its own&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster during that presentation, and that that's the reason behind the increased DMCA frequency.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see. In the meantime, you can still check out the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/bloodborne/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and PS5 via backwards compatibility).</p>

Simmons) problem. After flying off from Earth following his brutal pummeling of his son and the world finding out he was a genocidal maniac looking to conquer them to continue the Viltrumite race at the end of Season 1, the show has largely been devoid of his enthralling mixture of superhero stoicism and brutal pragmatism. After the third episode of the current season, it’s clear his son Oliver (Lincoln Bodin) is ready to pick up that mantle, and Simmons is ready for it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193781" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Top Five Anime Couples Who Never Got Together" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="223" data-playlist="193781,197298,197284" data-current="193781"><div><p>Top Five Anime Couples Who Never Got Together</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19239.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the end of this season’s third episode, entitled “You Want A Real Costume, Right?” the Mauler Twins (Kevin Michael Richardson) launched an EMP missile to destroy Earth’s communications network to incentivize people to pay to use their shielding system. While Invincible (Steven Yeun) darted to the sky to stop the missile from impacting, his younger brother, overly excited to use his newfound powers to fight evil, does battle with the pair of villains. Earlier in the episode, the show expertly displayed Oliver as a carefree child still figuring out how to fly, pestering his big brother to hang out and train him, and strutting around in his new superhero suit. Up until his duel with the Mauler Twins, we were made to believe Oliver’s superhero inexperience was simply an excuse for lightheartedness. We forgot for a second that Viltrumite blood still burns in his veins.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, Oliver kills one of the Mauler Twins by flying through his body. Before killing the second one, the blood-soaked preteen coldly says, “That’s what happens when you’re a bad guy.” His actions become more disturbing when he seems to revert back to childlike innocence, pleading that his murders were accidents. When we spoke with Simmons, even he couldn’t believe what his fake son had done.</p><p>“We get shocked and surprised by some of these plot developments as we read them before we put them down,” the actor said. “Oliver is a really cool new character that hopefully keeps people guessing.”</p><p>When asked if Oliver’s pragmatic reasoning for killing the bad guys was inherited from his father, Simmons slyly answered, “Nothing’s ever Omni-Man’s fault. Omni-Man is always innocent of any wrongdoings.” The sarcasm in his voice and smirk on his face told us all we needed to know. The child who wanted to honor his homicidal father by donning the name Omni-Kid earlier in the episode isn’t too far removed from his exiled father. But, him reverting back to a clueless child who claims to have accidentally killed two villains we all saw him murder with clear, cold intention means either his Viltrumite killer genes are (literal) sleeper cells that activate when someone disrupts his moral compass or Oliver knows he’s a killer at heart, but must act docile in order to ingratiate himself with the Earthlings he may one day conquer. </p><p>If this is only the third episode of what is already shaping up to be the best season of <em>Invincible</em>, we’re in for a hell of a ride. Now, let’s bring Omni-Man back from space jail immediately. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-baldurs-gate-iii-miniature-review-theres-something-off-about-that-ox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the incredible popularity of <em>Baldur's Gate III,</em> and with Wizkids returning to previous <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> expansions, it was only a matter of time until players could get their hands on a set of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> minis focusing on characters from the incredibly popular video game by Larian, as well as the <em>5e</em> adventure <em>Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus.</em></p>

<p>I received the <em>Icons of the Realms: Baldur's Gate III</em> Characters, the iconic party that adventures with your Tav, as well as eight of the Blind Boxes containing a mix of miniatures based on creatures you might see around<em> Baldur's Gate</em>, be part of the Descent into Avernus Adventure, or be important characters from Baldur's Gate III (including a suspicious looking Ox…).</p>

<h2>Icons of the Realms: <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> Characters</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-party.jpg?itok=M7FEzcWS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-party.jpg?itok=UcsL9NMU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>Characters box comes with seven pre-painted miniatures highlighting the different BG3 party members along with Withers.</p>

<p>Each member of the party is sporting their iconic weapons; the large battle axe Karlach is holding against her body, Lae'zel holds her sword high above her head ready to strike, Shadowheart holding Selune's Spear Of Night out from her, and Astorion holding out one hand as if to invite you towards him while brandishing a dagger in the other.</p>

<p>For fans of Wyll he holds his sword outstretched as if mid-duel and is sporting the horns he can obtain early on for breaking his pact with his patron.</p>

<p>The outfits each character wears aligns with their promotional artwork meaning that even from a distance each is immediately recognizable and whether you want to purchase these minis to display or to throw the <em>BG3 </em>party in for a crossover at your own table you wont be disappointed.</p>

<h2>Adventures From <em>Baldur's Gate</em> Miniatures</h2>

<p>As with all Wizkids miniatures each blindbox has with it three Medium or Smaller miniatures and one Large miniature. There will always be some good multi-purpose stuff, while also ensuring you're going to get an impressive miniature to throw down at your table.</p>

<p>As I go through the different minis that I unboxed I'll break them out into generic <em>Baldur's Gate</em> creatures or those specific to Descent Into Avernus and those that fans of <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> will recognize.</p>

	<li aria-level="1">Goblin Novice and Goblin Sharpshooter</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Two Duergar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Two Bugbear Assassins, and</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Doppelganger</li>
</ul><p>A thing I am always thankful for in the Blind Boxes are that there are a healthy number of standard enemies. Having a high-quality Wizkids miniature of a dragon is great for the few and far between times where that specific dragon will appear but the above listed minis could be used anywhere and everywhere.</p>

<p>The Goblins are of the yellow-skinned variety brandishing a club and a shortbow, allowing for visual differences (even if Novie and Sharpshooter don't exactly have a stat block outside of BG3).</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Gnoll</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Warg</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bear</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Minotaur</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Spectator, and</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bulette</li>
</ul><p>Again a fantastic range of miniatures. Bears for a random forest encounter (maybe it's a Druid in disguise), Gnoll once the party has adventured a bit further, and then for some deadlier encounters you can break out the Spectator and Bulette.</p>

<p>The design of the Bulette is completely different from the once previously included in Sand and Stone. Unlike the previous one, which was partially exposing itself from the ground that it's burrowed into, the new Bulette miniature stands totally above ground, showing off it's metal top coat that glistens in the light. Underneath its fleshier stomach is exposed.</p>

<h3><em>Baldur's Gate III </em>Miniatures</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-medium.jpg?itok=GAFTL6hq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-medium.jpg?itok=fN9IjHHf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Of the miniatures that I got that were explicitly flavors of <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>for the range of Tiny to Medium sized creatures I opened:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Dark Justicar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Fist of Bane</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Flaming Fist Soldier</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Githyanki</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Halsin</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hollyphant</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Necromyte of Myrkul</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Omeluum</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orin the Red</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Priestess Gut</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Reaper of Bhaal</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Sovreign Glut</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Zevlor</li>
</ul><p>For fans of the game there's plenty to be excited for from important named characters like Umeluum, Halsin, and Priestess Gut to the interesting enemies you'd encounter like the Flaming Fist Soldier.</p>

<p>I always enjoy when a character is posed in a way that allows you to understand who they are or what affinities they have. In this way Priestess Gut creating an arch of power over her head make it a really interesting piece for your table.</p>

<p>The Dark Justicar wears contrasting blacks with golden armor brandishing his sword and the Githyanki holds up a crossbow ready to strike. Putting so many of these characters together the theme of 'red' really does seem to show up a lot though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-large.jpg?itok=kM-uNREE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-large.jpg?itok=0-ykApNz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The large <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>miniatures that I opened include:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Lump The Enlightened</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shambling Mound</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Slayer of Bhaal</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Strange Ox</li>
</ul><p>I love how much of a strange mix of miniatures this is. Lump is great as an Ogre miniature but manages to also bring a smile as you remember the strange circumstance of an Ogre swallowing a Headband of Intellect. Likewise having the Strange Ox, that for all intents and purposes could be a simple Ox miniature, present in this collection brings back fond memories of strange conversations.</p>

<p>Taking a turn for the terrifying the Shambling Mount miniature here, while described generically has the same blueish light emanating from within like that of the Shadow-Cursed Shambling Mound. For something that is meant to be glowing blue I do wish they used a blue transparent plastic instead of just painting those areas blue.</p>

<p>The last of the giant minis was the Slayer of Bhaal, or simply a Slayer in <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em> This is one of those excellent miniatures that can be used for anything that you want to scare your players with. It looks fast, it can slice and dice, and will be able to easily throw your players around. A very nice and precise touch on close inspection is the almost orange glow from the eyes.</p>

<h2>Wizkids <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> Miniatures Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While the blind boxes advertise both Adventures From <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>this set is really there for the fans of <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em> Every miniature, even the generic ones, will be more aligned with the models that you'll be more than familiar with if you've played <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em></p>

<p>This sense of knowing is also extra fun when you'll pull these out in games to come and will get to be brought back to&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-datavault-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment have released a brand new <i>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</i>update, and it's bringing a new area on the Battle Barge, a new PvP map to fight on, and more.</p>

<p>First up, the Datavault is a new area on the Resilient. Completing in-game challenges will give you the chance to earn Research Data, which you can use to unlock information on elements of the game's world, as well as new cosmetics.</p>

<p>A new PvP map, Tomb, has also been introduced. The map is&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s smallest, but it utilizes "a different approach" to its brethren when it comes to design, so make sure to give it a look if you want a more unconventional PvP experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-6.0-datavault-update-biovore.jpg?itok=c8fKQgTM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-6.0-datavault-update-biovore.jpg?itok=siVKkI1w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Biovore is here to ruin your day in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The Tyranids' ranks have grown with a new enemy in this&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>update, too. The Biovore is a new Extremis-class enemy that serves as long-distance artillery, but it can also defend itself by stabbing with its legs.</p>

<p>If you've been looking for ways to communicate with your fellow Ultramarines, but good old-fashioned conversation isn't doing it, then the new Emote system should do the trick. It allows you to perform "a pound to the chest, a battle cry, and even a stoic handshake", plus others.</p>

<p>What's more, if the base challenge of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s PvE modes wasn't enough for you, a new Absolute difficulty mode has been introduced that features "new, more diverse enemy packs" and limited resources to contend with.</p>




<p>You can read the full Datavault update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/529837904419094594" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a> to see everything that's new. There are a ton of balance changes in the update, specifically pertaining to class perks, so make sure to read them all to stay in the know.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-haemimont-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paradox-to-buy-jagged-alliance-3-and-surviving-mars-dev-haemimont-games.1101897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-haemimont-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Paradox Interactive has announced that it will purchase&nbsp;<em>Jagged Alliance 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Surviving Mars&nbsp;</em>studio Haemimont Games.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/year-end-report-january-december-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">year-end financial report</a>, Paradox reveals it has "entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the shares" in Haemimont. No change in management was announced, so it seems like Haemimont will continue doing its own thing under Paradox.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Paradox and Haemimont will have crossed paths, either. The company served as the publisher for colony sim&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/surviving-mars" rel="nofollow">Surviving Mars</a>&nbsp;</em>in 2018, although Haemimont is perhaps better-known for working with THQ Nordic and Kalypso Media on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Tropico&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Grand Ages: Rome</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paradox-haemimont-games-surviving-mars.jpg?itok=jjJeSDWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paradox-haemimont-games-surviving-mars.jpg?itok=m7GcNdml 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paradox has worked with Haemimont before, on colony sim&nbsp;<em>Surviving Mars</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As for the financial report itself, Paradox says its revenue has fallen 17% when compared to last year, but that profit has increased by 10%.</p>

<p>As a reminder, major Paradox releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-ii-announced" rel="nofollow">Cities: Skylines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/age-of-wonders-4-announced-for-pc-ps5-xbox-with-release-date-details-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Age of Wonders 4</a>&nbsp;</em>took place in the previous financial year, so Paradox didn't really have a major tentpole title to base its finances around in 2024.</p>

<p>Additionally, hotly-anticipated projects like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">the console release of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">Cities: Skylines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>are either slated for this year or don't have a release date yet, so the company is in a sort of limbo right now.</p>

<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester says the studio closes its year with "a period of high revenue and good margins" and says that the studio's "persistent work over time" is more important than between-quarter variation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-paradox.jpg?itok=A33m4Wqm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-paradox.jpg?itok=fpnT516m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paradox's future includes big releases like&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Paradox's yearly financial assessment comes a few months after the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">announced the cancellation</a> of its&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life sim&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>, which caused its quarter-by-quarter profits to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled" rel="nofollow">plummet by 90% in July</a>.</p>

<p>According to the studio, however, that fall was factored into its yearly assessment; Paradox says write-downs of around 208 million kronor, or about $19 million, are included in its operating profit report.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of 2025 Paradox has, as well as whether or not its purchase of Haemimont affects that developer's day-to-day operations. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>In the recent video game Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, the role of Indiana Jones was played by Troy Baker, not Harrison Ford. The esteemed and veteran actor has reflected on the game, saying Baker did a "brilliant" job bringing his character to life, and it didn't require AI.</p><p>"You don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent," <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told The Wall Street Journal</a>. "[Baker] did a brilliant job, and it didn't take AI to do it."</p><p>AI was used, however, to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-de-aging-tech/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">de-age Ford in the movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</a> with striking results. The movie didn't score well with critics, and Ford reflected bluntly, "Shit happens," going on to say he believed the story was worth telling and he was happy he made the movie.</p><p>Going back to the talk of AI, Ford dismissed the idea that his estate could one day cash in on his likeness through some kind of digital recreation of himself.</p><p>"My plan is to keep working behind that face till I don't care what happens anymore. I'm selling that piece by piece while I'm alive," he said. "There won't be any need for me. There's somebody behind me. Doing what I did."</p><p>Bethesda boss Todd Howard originally <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn08epwy152o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"rolled his eyes" about the idea of Baker playing Indiana Jones in The Great Circle</a>, but eventually came around to the idea. Ford and Baker appeared on stage together at The Game Awards this past December, where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-pulled-a-john-travolta-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528440/" data-ref-id="1100-6528440">Ford praised The Great Circle and Baker's performance.</a></p><p>The Great Circle has reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-whips-up-4-million-players-before-ps5-debut/1100-6529145/" data-ref-id="1100-6529145">4 million players on Xbox and PC</a>, and the game is slated for release on PS5 this spring.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-seemingly-leaked-via-playstation-store.1101852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>release date appears to have been leaked via the game's PlayStation Store listing, and if the leak is correct, then the hotly-anticipated remake will be launching in summer.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-releases-august-25th-2025-new-trailer-on-ps-store-snake-vs-monkey-teased.1101735/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NateDog</a>, a new <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trailer</a> has appeared on the PlayStation Store's backend that shows off some of the game's content, including various iconic scenes and boss battles from&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>. The release date is then given as August 28th.</p>

<p>Perhaps most excitingly, the trailer also seems to confirm the release of the Snake vs. Monkey gameplay mode, which saw the worlds of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ape Escape&nbsp;</em>collide in an unlikely crossover.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-snake.jpg?itok=Aw9T2VUp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-snake.jpg?itok=g0UYVW71 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>looks set for an August release.</figcaption></figure><p>If the Snake vs. Monkey minigame is indeed included, it could well mark the<em>&nbsp;Ape Escape</em>&nbsp;series' first appearance outside the PlayStation ecosystem, although there's also every chance that the minigame is PlayStation-exclusive.</p>

<p>A quick look at the current <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007293/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Store page</a> for&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>also shows the August 28th release date, so it's likely Konami will soon officially release the trailer and confirm the date.</p>

<p>According to leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885592410589110653" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NateTheHate</a>, who accurately predicted the date on which the Nintendo Switch 2 would be revealed, a PlayStation State of Play showcase will air this month. He currently seems to be suggesting that it'll take place <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Valentine's Day</a>.</p>

<p>If that is indeed the case, then I wouldn't be surprised if the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>release date trailer aired during that presentation, which would also probably be why the Snake vs. Monkey minigame is shown.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a remake of the classic 2004 PS2 stealth-action game&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-announced-at-state-of-play" rel="nofollow">during a PlayStation showcase in May 2023</a>, the remake will offer completely reworked visuals and gameplay, complete with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal" rel="nofollow">transition to Unreal Engine 5</a>. It will, however, retain the voice audio of the original game and won't recast any actors.</p>

<p>The game is also being developed without the involvement of series creator Hideo Kojima, who's currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed" rel="nofollow">hard at work on&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed" rel="nofollow">Death Stranding 2</a>&nbsp;</em>(as well as a stealth action game of his own mysteriously codenamed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Physint</em></a>).</p>

<p>Assuming this leak is indeed correct,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007293/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater/9pjln214rtkq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 28th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

That’s the intended release date for the long-awaited remake of 2004's <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>. It’s looking likely to be a faithful recreation of the two-decade-old game, rather than one of those more complicated re-imaginings, albeit now built for PS5, rather than PS2. Part of that is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819">give the player a more modern perspective</a></span>, more akin to <em>MGS5: The Phantom Pain</em> than the pulled-back view of the original, alongside a control scheme that matches the most recent entry. But it’s keeping its original voice acting, and has rebuilt its original cutscenes in the Unreal Engine, rather than reinterpreting them.</p><p>The store page for the game, presumably also uploaded unintentionally, mentions <em>Snake Eater</em> will be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-support-8k-60fps-update-ff7-1851644737&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-support-8k-60fps-update-ff7-1851644737">PS5 Pro Enhanced game</a></span>, so you can start getting excited about all those frames happening in the same second, <em>Zack</em>. Just try to imagine them all, flickering by faster than the human eye can perceive, and feel confident&nbsp;that justifies spending $800 on a console. Feels <em>good</em>.</p><p>Sony has a State of Play stream due later this month, and you can only imagine this release date news was intended to be part of that. Someone is kicking themselves, or perhaps being kicked by others around them. But then, look, look at all the press this is getting! Everything’s good!
