			<p>When it comes to early 3D gaming classics, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> is definitely up there. It may not have become as prolific a series as, say, T<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomb-raider">omb Raider</a> or <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> yet it definitely had something special, so much so that fans have been pining for a new Legacy of Kain game for more than two decades.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpKy31RzDBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the original game‚Äôs 25th anniversary, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics</a> has teamed up with <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/aspyr">Aspyr</a> to remaster Soul Reaver and its 2001 sequel. But is Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered the definitive way to experience these games? The short answer is yes, though the makeover isn‚Äôt as thorough as we‚Äôve come to expect from modern remasters, and the experience is hampered by bugs and the absence of a major quality of life feature.</p>


<p>For those completely new to the series, Soul Reaver isn‚Äôt the first Legacy of Kain title. It all started a few years earlier with the release of Blood Omen, a top-down action adventure game that cast players as a noble-turned-vampire whose quest for revenge leads to a seismic upheaval within the gothic lands of Nosgoth. On the cusp of restoring balance, Kain is offered a choice: sacrifice himself to save the world, or condemn it to oblivion.</p>
<p>In Soul Reaver, the developers chose to make Blood Omen‚Äôs bad ending canon, thrusting the narrative forward several centuries. Suspecting that his chief vampire lieutenant will one day surpass him, Kain murders our hero Raziel, who is then risen by an Elder God to embark on a revenge odyssey of his own.</p>


<p>The Legacy of Kain boasts a rich narrative and setting that, at the time, seemed a strange fit for a 3D action game. The superb performances of Soul Reaver‚Äôs voice cast serves to elevate this, especially Michael Bell‚Äôs monologuing as Raziel throughout which is even more prevalent in the sequel. There‚Äôs a gothic grittiness to the presentation of these games too, spliced with themes of dark magic and decadence.</p>
<p>Aspyr‚Äôs remasters feature improved character models, textures, and effects, though the end result is surprisingly subtle. In some instances, especially when playing Soul Reaver 2, toggling between the new and original graphics (which can be done at any time with a single button press) offers a granular improvement rather than a noticeable facelift. With that said, the work done to character models is impressive and avoids masking over the charm of the original games.</p>

<p>Other enhancements include the option for modern control and camera movement. A new map and compass have also been added to the game‚Äôs UI though have a limited impact on actually helping you navigate Soul Reaver‚Äôs maze-like world. This has always been a weak point; without any real signposting, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in Nosgoth and work out where you need to head next. This isn‚Äôt helped by the fact that Raziel is returned to a hub area whenever loading a save, forcing players to trace a path back to wherever they left off. In some cases, this can mean replaying pretty large chunks of the game.</p>
<p>This is compounded by game-breaking bugs found within the remasters. On a couple of occasions I lost more than a hour‚Äôs progress to random crashes, which begs the question: why didn‚Äôt Aspyr work to improve Soul Reaver‚Äôs save and checkpoint systems? It‚Äôs an oversight made only more apparent by the fact that Blood Omen and its sequel were both released only days ago on PlayStation 5, both enhanced with quick save, quick load, and rewind features.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay it‚Äôs serviceable, though the original Soul Reaver is really showing its age. The sequel certainly holds up better with a greater emphasis on dynamic combat that transcends the original game‚Äôs basic button bashing. There are still some interesting ideas at play, however, such Raziel‚Äôs ability to switch between planes. This mechanic seamlessly morphs the world around him, exposing hidden secrets and creating new pathways.</p>
<p>For die-hard Nosgoth nerds, there‚Äôs plenty of bonus material too such as galleries for original concept art and renders, as well as full scripts for both games. There are even a clutch of ‚ÄúLost Levels‚Äù but don‚Äôt get too excited ‚Äì these amount to a handful of unfinished 3D environments cut from the original game.</p>

According to the description, it allows fans to "run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses." It also claims the game will be released in May 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4412228" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4412228"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg"></figure><p>The page includes fake review quotes from GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer "from [a] parallel universe where the game is already out."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-first-video-game-concert-was-pretty-cool.1055892/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/my-first-video-game-concert-was-pretty-cool<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, my friends took me to see a <a href="https://www.bam.org/installation/2024/journey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live performance</a> of the soundtrack for <em>Journey</em>, where a group of players went through the game while composer Austin Wintory directed an orchestra alongside them. I‚Äôve never been to a video game concert before, and now I want to know everything about how video game soundtracks are made.</p><p><em>Journey</em>, you may remember, is an indie game that came out for PS3 in 2012 and made waves for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/13/22972989/journey-10-year-anniversary-multiplayer-jenova-chen-austin-wintory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer element</a>, where a stranger could show up in your game to accompany you across the sandy landscape. You were limited in how you could interact, and the whole experience was pretty revelatory for the time. The game ultimately came to PC in 2019, but when it first released I didn‚Äôt own a console, so my familiarity with it is mostly playing a bit of it at the house of the friends who took me to the concert. I hadn‚Äôt played any multiplayer games with strangers back then, so I remember the fascination and nerves that filled me when another player appeared in my game, and my curiosity and relief when we could only communicate through movement and musical chirps.&nbsp;</p><p>Wintory conducted the <a href="https://www.americancomposers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Composers Orchestra</a>, which prominently featured a very excellent cello soloist who made me miss playing the cello. The game showed on a giant screen behind them, while players seated to the side took turns trading off the controller. I split my time between watching the gameplay and staring at the orchestra, wondering what it was like to follow a score that had to line up to someone playing the game in real time. At one point, a player missed a jump, and the orchestra seamlessly looped the music to keep it in time. Sometimes the experience felt like watching a Let‚Äôs Play at home; at other times, it felt like watching a concert.</p><p>As the end credits rolled, the user names of several players appeared on the screen. My friends and I assumed they were real players who just happened to be online and matched up with the concert, which was kind of wild to contemplate. Who was playing <em>Journey</em> on a Saturday afternoon in 2024? Would they ever imagine that hundreds of people had watched them live, including the game‚Äôs composer?&nbsp;</p><p>I‚Äôm ashamed to admit I‚Äôve never thought super hard about how video game scores work on a compositional level. In many games, a player could spend unlimited time in an area, so how do you structure a score that doesn‚Äôt have a defined length like a song would? When you play <em>Journey</em>, the music <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/11/18/20970945/journey-ending-soundtrack-austin-wintory-interview-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responds </a>to where you are, what you‚Äôre doing, and whether there‚Äôs another player. I‚Äôve always just kind of thought ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs a thing video game music does‚Äù and considered the technical aspect of how it‚Äôs implemented in a game, without ever thinking much about how someone <em>writes</em> a score that can do that. As Wintory told <a href="https://egmnow.com/playing-your-song-the-evolution-of-dynamic-music-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EGM</a> in 2019:</p><blockquote><p>The issue [with dynamic scores] is reconciling the player agency with some sort of musicality‚Ä¶ Music is by definition a linear art form, playing out over time. Great music (and great performers) leverage that to take you on emotional adventures. When that passage of time is subject to tinkering, it can destroy the storytelling instantly. My goal is always to find a way to preserve the best of what traditionally linear music can offer (particularly with regards to storytelling) while giving the player maximum agency in the process.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Combining a performance of the soundtrack, which could easily just be static, with the elements of gameplay, which require responsiveness and change, was way cooler to witness than I expected it to be when my friends invited me. A video game music concert is definitely not something I would have gone to on my own, and I‚Äôm really glad I went. </p><p>I know at least some of you are video game music composers, so please fill the comments with notes about your creative process, which I will read and then respond to with phrases like ‚Äúgosh!‚Äù and ‚Äúwow!‚Äù because, outside of <a href="https://aftermath.site/let-humans-not-ai-be-bad-at-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing a few little songs</a> on guitar, my only experience with arranging is from high school music theory, wherein I attempted to create a band version of the Counting Crows song ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bxohwsx14Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raining in Baltimore</a>‚Äù for an assignment, but failed utterly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to be among the biggest video game launches of all time, if not the biggest, and its release window, which is still up in the air with a potential 2026 delay, is already influencing the video game industry as a whole.</p>
<p>In a new report posted on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> today, it has been revealed that anticipation surrounding the game is so high that competing video game publishers are waiting as long as they can before committing to Fall 2025 release dates for their games, as they want to see if Grand Theft Auto 6 will indeed release next year or if it will slip into 2025, and want to launch their games as far from it as possible. This is far from surprising, considering how analysts expect it to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, which could have a massive impact on the entire industry, and not just in terms of release timings.</p>
<p>It has been some time since Rockstar Games discussed Grand Theft Auto 6. Back in May, publisher Take-Two confirmed that the game was still on track for a Fall 2025 release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S but has said nothing since. The game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">ambitious nature could make it slip into 2026</a>, but for the time being, the game's release window hasn't been changed.</p>
<p>Those who want to experience Grand Theft Auto 6 at its very best, however, will have to wait longer than everyone else, as a PC release, which is undoubtedly coming at some point, has yet to be officially confirmed. Compromises will likely be made on consoles, and even the PlayStation 5 Pro may not be able to run the game at <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/">60 FPS</a> if the game is targeting 30 FPS on the base model, mostly due to CPU limitations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>art director Raf Grassetti has joined up with&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>developer Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1866135153497768034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>&nbsp;earlier today, Grassetti shared a picture of the Naughty Dog logo, together with the simple caption "new chapter" to announce that he'd signed up with the studio.</p>

<p>It's likely that Grassetti will be working on Naughty Dog's next project, which is almost certainly the same game Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said has been in development since 2020</a> last month, although we don't know any more about the game than that yet, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=zu-Y20et 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=g657UAyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Raf Grassetti is perhaps best known for his work on the two most recent&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Grassetti, he's probably best known as the art director on 2022's&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, having served as an artist on the 2018 predecessor as well. If you loved the art direction of Kratos' latest adventure, you've got Grassetti to thank, at least in part.</p>

<p>Of course, that's not all the work Grassetti has done in the gaming industry. After <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1659618787036110848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaving Sony in May 2023</a>, Grassetti joined up with Netflix to create "a brand-new studio and AAA multiplatform game", although it seems like he may have been one of the casualties when Netflix <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down "Team Blue" in October</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to his time with Sony, Grassetti worked as a character artist on projects like BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 3</em>, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em>, and CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>, among many others. Suffice it to say he's an old industry hand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-raf-grassetti.jpg?itok=MCCxfEcq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-raf-grassetti.jpg?itok=g-X3sfu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you loved&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>'s art direction, you have Raf Grassetti to thank.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Naughty Dog is a Sony subsidiary, Grassetti is effectively coming home to Sony, although he'll technically be working under different management in this new position.</p>

<p>As for Naughty Dog itself, it's currently working on at least one as-yet unannounced project.</p>

<p>Given that the studio moved towards <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-online-canceled-as-naughty-dog-works-on-more-than-one-ambitious-single" rel="nofollow">focusing exclusively on single-player games</a> back in December last year, it's likely the new game won't be a multiplayer live-service affair, which, given one of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent high-profile failures</a>, is probably for the best.</p>

            <p>Fancy taking the piss out of video games? Here you go, a fun little tool you can run in your browser easily lets you rewrite famous game quotes. <a href="https://deathgenerator.com/#gallery">The Death Generator</a> offers a gallery full of (mostly) retro games and a simple text box that will replicate the exact font used by those games, all so you can make the little shopkeeper in Zelda say rude words, or entirely rewrite the pre-mission dossiers of Goldeneye 007. There's a lot more than that though. I've done a bunch, come see what I mean and have a go yourself.</p>

<p>You can mess about with the FBI warning that famously told every arcade visitor in the United States (and beyond) that "Winners don't do drugs". You can play with Dracula's existentialist screed in Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night. Or reimagine the letter Princess Peach sends to her plumber pal in Super Mario 64. </p>

<p>But my favourite is probably <a href="https://deathgenerator.com/#mgs">the Metal Gear Solid one</a>, because it not only lets you re-type the text of your codec conversations, it also lets you customise who is in the call. You can make up conversations with Otacon, Mei Ling, the Colonel, Meryl, and Naomi - it even lets you choose how many bars of reception is showing. The attention to detail is admirable.</p>

<p>You can also just type in a small phrase and hit a dice button to cycle through the screens at random, just to see how your words might fit if, say, Sub-Zero were speaking them.

<p>The tool is made by programmer "Foone" who shared it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/foone.bsky.social/post/3lcro77ertc2t">on Bluesky</a>. "I've got 270 games in it so far and I'm adding more all the time," they said on the social media site. "The most recent one is the GBA <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> game,  Chain of Memories. That one's fun because it's full of Disney characters."</p>
<p>The coder then posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/foone.bsky.social/post/3lcrofp7qv22t">an image of Winnie The Pooh swearing</a>. Excellent. Go see if you can top that, readers. Have fun!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters%E2%80%94every-leaked-upcoming-hero.1055868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The topic of Marvel Rivals and leaked characters is unlikely to ever go away. While the community rightly lauds the current crop of heroes, everyone is keeping an eye on the next superhero to grace our screens. So, we‚Äôve taken a trip to the rumor mill, and unearthed every bit of gossip pertaining to new Marvel Rivals heroes.</p>



<p>Heroes were the big selling point of the Marvel Rivals launch. While Marvel is blessed with a cornucopia of iconic characters, the initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hero list</a> could have impacted Marvel Rivals in different ways. Thankfully, players seem to be enjoying the content, and this is evident with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in Rivals‚Äô first three days</a>.</p>



<p>You can‚Äôt sit around and bask in your success in the live-service market though. Times move quickly, attention spans shrink, and you need new content in the pipeline. This is where Marvel Rivals leaked characters are a big selling point of the shooters‚Äô future, and any info is helpful.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-leaked-character">Every Marvel Rivals Leaked Character</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don‚Äôt get used to the status quo. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>So far, <strong>12 new Marvel Rivals characters have leaked</strong>, and the speculated names span various Marvel franchises: <strong>Fantastic Four, The Avengers, Captain Marvel, and X-Men</strong>.</p>



<p>We‚Äôve already discovered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron and The Thing</a> are destined for Marvel Rivals, but this is a small mackerel of what‚Äôs allegedly to come. The leaks come courtesy of various X social media sources including <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals ‚Äî Leaks</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Facio_Leaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matfacio | Leaker of games</a>, <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miller Ross</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/FumoLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fumo Leaks</a>.</p>



<p>Here is every leaked Marvel Rivals character so far, and their attached Marvel franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li>Angela</li>



<li>Blade</li>



<li>Captain Marvel</li>



<li>Emma Frost</li>



<li>Hit-Monkey</li>



<li>Jean Grey AKA Phoenix</li>



<li>Johnny Storm  AKA Human Torch</li>



<li>Knull</li>



<li>Mister Fantastic</li>



<li>Susan Storm AKA Invisible Woman</li>



<li>The Thing</li>



<li>Ultron</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Knull</strong> was seen in the Season 0: Dooms‚Äô Rise Official Trailer, so his debut is very likely. The rest of the rumored characters are all datamines and speculation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals"></a>In addition to these potential heroes, I‚Äôve also seen Daredevil discussed, but only in memes showing his gameplay to be nothing but a blank screen‚Äîif you know, you know. Otherwise, these 12 names are the common heroes outed by leakers, and datamines have revealed info about each including movesets and Team-Up abilities.</p>



<p>Interestingly, there‚Äôs still no mention of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a>‚Äîa hero we‚Äôve discussed before in great detail. The villainous Victor was the heartbeat of the No One Rivals Doom trailer on Jul. 26, and also the Dooms‚Äô Rise video. There‚Äôs still no confirmation of his arrival yet though, so we‚Äôll keep our eyes peeled.</p>

            <p>Indie retro RPG Chained Echoes is set to receive DLC next year, as its solo developer Matthias Linda has opened his own studio.</p>
<p>Ashes of Elrant will expand Chained Echoes with a new land and story, as well as a new playable character: the White Wolf.</p>
<p>It's set for release in the second quarter of 2025 across all platforms: PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Chained Echoes was first released by Linda at the end of 2022. It's a retro, pixel art adventure following Japanese RPGs like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-89">myself</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-golden-age-for-jrpgs">ex-Eurogamer editor Martin Robinson</a> were big fans when it came out, thanks in part to its Overdrive battle system where players must balance offence and defence or risk overheating.</p>
<p>In fact, the game proved such a success for Linda, he's now opened his own studio: Umami Tiger. Ashes of Elrant will be its first release.</p>
<p>The DLC promises new areas, 40 new monsters and bosses to fight, and 15 new tracks from composer Eddie Marianukroh.</p>
<p>"And also grab yourself a fishing rod - you will need it," reads the press release. Expect a fishing minigame, then.</p>
<p>The release of Chained Echoes DLC puts it in direct competition with another retro RPG, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-free-carnival-themed-dlc-throes-of-the-watchmaker-revealed">Throes of the Watchmaker out next Spring</a>.</p>
<p>For something brand new, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-revealed-rpg-threads-of-time-will-compete-with-sea-of-stars-as-chrono-trigger-spiritual-successor">check out Threads of Time</a> - a spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger announced at this year's Tokyo Game Show. There's no release date yet, but it looks gorgeous.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-brick-festival-storm-chasers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-reveals-lego-fortnite-social-experience-brick-life-and-major-new-storm-chasers-update.1055844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-brick-festival-storm-chasers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed big changes for&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>in the coming days, including a major new social roleplaying experience and an update to the core mode that adds lots of new content.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is coming on December 12th. Described by Epic as an "all-new social roleplay experience in the&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>universe", the mode will allow you to "make new friends, explore the sights, land your dream job, and move into your new home", according to Epic's description.</p>

<p>Brick Life looks to be an experience that wants to compete with&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>(and also <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, perhaps), so of course, you'll also be able to build your dream home and furnish it with all kinds of fun accessories, by the looks of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=bS3qgpjP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=HaYo1H59 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is a "social roleplaying experience" that has shades of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>about it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we also see&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>characters riding on vehicles, working out at the gym, stealing diamonds from some kind of bank vault, and engaging in plenty of other activities, so it looks like there'll be lots to do in Brick Life.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for this new&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode right here.</p>




<p>The second major piece of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>news released by Epic today is a name change and major update for&nbsp;the main&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>&nbsp;mode. It's now called&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>, and it'll be part of a new bespoke&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>section within the main&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Tomorrow,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will get a brand new update by the name of Storm Chasers, and it's set to bring a new biome, new dungeons to explore, and new enemies to fight, plus "a formidable big bad" in the form of the titular Storm King. Here's the trailer!</p>




<p>In case you're not aware,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is a spinoff mode within massively popular battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>Released in December last year, the mode debuted to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early" rel="nofollow">staggering number of concurrent players</a>, with that number <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">only increasing in the following days</a>.</p>

<p>Since then,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including new features, tweaks to existing mechanics, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">a crossover with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>, among many other things.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, which is available to play on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices.</p>

It‚Äôs still the earliest days for <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, which came out in preview mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 6 alongside its Steam Early Access release (the game is currently $30 but will be free-to-play at its 1.0 launch). </p><p>And dealing with unexpected difficulty curves or build nerfs is better than battling down servers or long queue times. ‚ÄúFor those still in queue, what we are doing right now is letting in players in batches so that we can make sure to monitor the backend and not overload it,‚Äù the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a></span> late on Friday. ‚ÄúThanks once again for your patience and hopefully it won‚Äôt be too much longer.‚Äù </p><p>Things seem to have improved as of Monday.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-game-director-reveals-new-details-about-companions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Avowed‚Äôs Game Director, Carrie Patel, has disclosed details on how companions interact with the player in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-more-interactivity-and-reactivity">‚ÄúMore Interactivity and Reactivity‚Äù</h2>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/after-starfields-strict-companions-im-glad-avoweds-crew-wont-be-backseat-driving-and-second-guessing-all-your-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Carrie Patel discussed how they wanted to provide ‚Äúa little more interactivity and reactivity‚Äù to companions ‚Äúbased on the events and conversations and quests that you‚Äôre encountering in the game.‚Äù Patel added that they wanted companions ‚Äúto have a little bit more to say‚Äù about their journey together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patel then goes on to talk about how engaging with companions is a significant part of RPGs, but finding the ‚Äòbalance‚Äô is also crucial. They didn‚Äôt want Avowed‚Äôs companions to ‚Äúfeel like someone is backseat driving and second-guessing all your choices.‚Äù Patel also compared Avowed‚Äôs companions to Starfield‚Äôs, stating that they won‚Äôt have as extreme reactions when you do something ‚Äòevil‚Äô but will provide some form of pushback.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-s-companions-will-have-opt-in-engagement">Avowed‚Äôs Companions Will Have Opt-In Engagement</h2>



<p>Patel then talks about the opt-in engagement players can experience with companions in Avowed. The developers have ‚Äúwritten a lot of content for these characters for their engagement in the story with one another, with the player.‚Äù However, it‚Äôs up to the players whether they want to explore this content. For example, when they return to the party camp, players ‚Äúmight hear their companion say a thing or two‚Äù, but they decide whether to have the conversation and ‚Äúget to know their companion a bit better.‚Äù</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Lego Fortnite</a> is expanding in a big way this week. Not only are we getting a new Lego Pass with piles of new content for the existing Lego Fortnite survival/crafting game, but we're getting an entirely new Lego game, dubbed Brick Life.</p><p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life, which launches on December 12, is an open-world social sim in which you and 31 of your closest friends can hang out in Brick Bay, a lively Lego City that's full of activities, jobs, and empty lots you can build on, and Brick Bay will be expanding all the time. For example, December 18 will mark the opening of the Rooftop Club, a fancy social space that provides stunning views of the city from above. The launch of Brick Life happens to coincide with the addition of text chat to every Fortnite experience, which will be key for a social sim like this one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411527" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411527"></a><figcaption>Brick Life is designed as a family-friendly social sandbox mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png"></figure><p>Brick Life isn't just some new Creative Lego island, however--Epic is treating Brick Life as a full new game on the same level as the existing Lego Fortnite survival game. As a result, that original Lego Fortnite game is being rebranded as Lego Fortnite Odyssey, with the term "Lego Fortnite" now referring to everything under that umbrella, rather than a specific mode.</p><p>Lego Fortnite Odyssey, meanwhile, is getting its own massive update this week that introduces a new villain, the Storm King, and a new faction that opposes him called the Storm Chasers. This new quest line will cause destructive storms to pop up all over the map at random--you'll need to navigate treacherous Storm Dungeons to make them go away and make progress toward defeating the Storm King.</p><p>All this new content for Lego Fortnite is being accompanied by an all-new Lego Pass, which is headlined by the new Raven Team Syd skin, which unlocks as soon as you buy the pass. Remember that access to the Lego Pass, along with the Music Pass and OG Pass, are now included with Fortnite Crew, so if you subscribe to Crew at any time while this Lego Pass is active, you'll immediately receive the Raven Team Syd skin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411523"></a><figcaption>The original Lego Fortnite survival game has been rebranded as Lego Fortnite Odyssey.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png"></figure><p>On top of that, Lego Fortnite has some completely free skins it wants to give you. Connecting your Lego and Epic accounts will grant you the Mr. Dappermint skin--he's that giant candy cane that they sell in the shop each December--as well as the Explorer Emilie skin that has been available for doing that since last year. And just for good measure, playing Fortnite on mobile and earning any amount of XP before February 21 will grant you the Chord Kahele skin, which will be the first Festival default skin that will be equippable as a skin, and which also has a Lego style.</p><p>Brick Life is just one of Fortnite's big new modes in Chapter 6, along with the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-1-weapons-map-and-changes/2900-6012/" data-ref-id="2900-6012">OG mode</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-finally-getting-official-first-person-mode-but-its-not-battle-royale/1100-6528295/" data-ref-id="1100-6528295">first-person Ballistic mode</a>. Fortnite's got plenty of stuff to keep us occupied through the holidays, it seems.</p>

                <p>Hold on to your potatoes, because developer MachineGames has released the first patch for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The update adds path tracing for select Nvidia cards, improved whip behavior, and a host of gameplay fixes, as detailed in the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/ZKn6jyPTe2ElFSJ0yZ2WA/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tm-update-1?linkId=100000316950846" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda's website</a>, MachineGames provided a laundry list of improvements for the action-adventure game, headlined by path tracing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-run-on-your-pc-check-out-the-requirements/1100-6528208/" data-ref-id="1100-6528208">for PC players</a>.

That means, for example, offering even more realistic lighting sources and reflections.

		<p>Around a year after its debut, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> is getting its biggest update yet, with a big update for the existing experience (now rebranded as LEGO Fortnite Odyssey) and a whole new social roleplaying game LEGO Fortnite Brick Life. Both will be available through the regular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> client later this week on 12th December, with LEGO Fortnite now a permanent unique category for all the modes and UGC within.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Odyssey - Storm Chasers Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8EMI5CLx2IA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let‚Äôs start with Lego Fortnite Odyssey and the new update for the game, dubbed Storm Chasers. The Storm King has kicked off a quest to consume the whole world, and it‚Äôs up to you and your friends to find Storm Chaser Village, make new friends, and build up the strength to stop him.</p>
<p>Storm Chaser Village is the new hub, with a bunch of Storm Chaser characters to meet and grab missions from. These will take you out into the Storm where you‚Äôll look for Storm Dungeons to take on ‚Äì these are regenerated and randomised every 24 hours.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs some new gameplay mechanics, and overhaul of progression and component-based crafting that will have you scavenging for resources of higher rarity. Enemy difficulty has been equalised across biomes to help improve balance through the game, as well. LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is compatible with split-screen across PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Brick Life Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KoF7Xfp-ako?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life is something completely new, though. Ever wanted to live in a Lego city? Because now you can, hopping onto servers alongside 31 other players and hanging out in restaurants, parties and clubs in what looks a little more like the social side of GTA Online.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll have your own home to decorate, but affording all that will require you to get a job, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courier ‚Äì Deliver parcels to other Brick Bay residents!</li>
<li>Academy Professor ‚Äì Share your knowledge with the class at Moundale Academy.</li>
<li>Security Officer ‚Äì Make sure crime doesn‚Äôt pay.</li>
<li>Scoundrel ‚Äì Prank fellow city-goers.</li>
<li>Sushi Chef ‚Äì Serve up the tastiest fish in Brick Bay!</li>
<li>Bobom Milk Tea Bobarista ‚Äì Serve Brick Bay‚Äôs most refreshing beverage.</li>
<li>Fortune Teller ‚Äì What does your future hold? New furniture!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap careers whenever you like.</p>
<p>With cash in your account, you can buy and then customise your own home at one of several empty lots in the city, whether that‚Äôs in the suburbs or the heart of the city. Just open your phone and use the furniture catalogue to personalise it, or visit the furniture shop for more bespoke items. If you own any Decor Bundles and Builds from the wider Lego Fortnite, you can use these as well.</p>
<p>You can visit locations including the town square, the beach, Durrr Burger, and Mourndale Academy to socialise with other players. The Rooftop Club will open on 18th December with an in-game event. Importantly there‚Äôs the standard Fortnite chat restrictions to keep a lid on interactions, which can take place using text chat, or through the use of emotes and jam tracks.</p>
<p>It sounds really interesting, finding yet another new direction to push Fortnite in and reviving some of that early 2000s social game space vibe in the process.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs.1055799/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Legion Studios is a relatively new and small studio that contains a team of 12 people who all have a significant amount of experience. The team consists of developers from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-playstation-5-ports-halo-gears/">Halo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-takes-top-spot-in-revenue-in-october-2024-newzoo-reports/">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">Destiny</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/">Doom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-from-the-rift-update-available-today-adding-new-cosmetics-launch-royale-more/">Apex Legends</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/">Battlefield</a>, all of which are announced in the first gameplay trailer that they revealed. They have just announced their new and upcoming game called Covenant, which is a first-person dark fantasy combat game. To get a glimpse at what the game will be looking like, check out the first gameplay trailer below. The trailer is just under three minutes long.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxeAuWTduC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Covenant will have a Metroidvania and Soulslike world, where players will get to explore a vast, interconnected world, where you'll get to go on a long and arduous journey to discover the fighting stances, weaponry, spells, and armor that can help you become powerful in the game. The footage seen in the trailer shows that Covenant will be developed using Unreal Engine 5, with the footage in the video being from a pre-alpha, in-engine build of the game. Despite that, the quality looks great, and the world looks incredibly detailed and reminiscent of FromSoftware games. Even the narration that sets the tone of the video feels very much like a Soulslike. However, it is pretty rare to see a first-person Soulslike, so it'll be interesting to see how Covenant will shape up and whether it'll be closer to a game like Remnant. However, even that title is in the third person. With how quick movements and attacks are in a Soulslike, it seems like being in first-person will provide an additional challenge that may not sit well with those who are fans of the genre.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sort of ETA or release window for Covenant, which is to be expected, considering this is really the first time anyone is hearing about the game. They shared some relatively generic PC specs for the title, which can be found on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. If this game is something you are interested in, you are able to wishlist this game now on Steam.</p>
<p>Much like many Soulslike or Metroidvanias, you will be able to play alone, as well as play with friends in co-op, if that is your preferred method for these types of games. There are also plenty of PvP opportunities, as you will be able to battle in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this reveal?</p>

elaborate about what this means as it relates to exclusivity. Beyond that, the decision on "spacing" when a game might come to a rival platform after Xbox needs to also factor in production timelines, Booty said.</p><p>"We want to make sure there's a great experience for our Xbox players, and then the gap between [when it becomes available on PlayStation] is as much a production decision as it is anything else. This is a game that was in production before we acquired Bethesda, even," Booty said.</p><p>Microsoft announced it would acquire ZeniMax, the parent company of Machine Games studio owner Bethesda, in 2020--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-now-officially-owns-bethesda-in-7-5-billion-purchase/1100-6488574/" data-ref-id="1100-6488574">the deal officially closed in 2021.</a></p><p>After Microsoft acquired ZeniMax, it acknowledged that making some of Bethesda's games exclusive to Xbox, including Starfield and The Great Circle, would lead to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-being-an-xbox-exclusive-means-millions-in-lost-sales-microsoft-believes/1100-6515976/" data-ref-id="1100-6515976">millions of lost game sales.</a> Microsoft said at the time that it would aim to make that up with Game Pass sign-ups and hardware sales.</p><p>In February 2024, Microsoft disclosed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-now-has-34-million-fully-paid-subscribers-growth-coming-from-pc-and-cloud" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Pass had reached 34 million members</a>, but the company hasn't revealed a new figure since. We do know that the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 led to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">boost in subscribers</a>, though. As for Xbox hardware sales, US video game industry research company Circana reported that Xbox Series X|S sales dropped 18% in October 2024 compared to October 2023 (PS5 and Switch sales in the US were down, too).</p><p>The Great Circle is coming to PS5 in Spring 2025, but Microsoft has yet to reveal a specific release date or any other details pertaining to the PlayStation edition of the game. For more, be sure to read GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a> and consult <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/indiana-jones-great-circle-tips-to-know-before-you-play-beginners-guide/2900-6016/" data-ref-id="2900-6016">our guides hub to hit the ground running.</a></p><p>Some of Microsoft's other games that have landed on PlayStation (and Switch in some cases) in the past year have included Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-Fi Rush. Microsoft's Minecraft series, meanwhile, has been on PlayStation and Switch for years.</p>

<p>"It sure is nice see miHoYo have some proper competition for once, and I know I'll still be returning to Miraland whenever I'm in need of a mood boost, whether that be in the form of humming along to catchy tunes while Whimcycling my way towards hot air balloons, or laughing at the melodrama in future story updates," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">Eurogamer's Infinity Nikki review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Epic Games has announced a second major <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> mode, Brick Life, that's set to arrive within the main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> game on 12th December. 
</p>
<p>
The arrival of Lego Fortnite Brick Life means the game's original Lego Fortnite mode, launched last December, is getting a slight rebranding - to Lego Fortnite Odyssey.
</p>
<p>
So, what is this new Brick Life offering? Well, it's described as a social experience set in an ever-evolving city where you can hang out with others, take on jobs (courier! professor! sushi chef! fortune teller! scoundrel!) and build a Lego home.

<p>
Lego components for your home will come from the Decor Bundles and Builds you've unlocked within Lego Fortnite so far.
</p>
<p>
There's lots new in the rebranded Lego Fortnite Odyssey, meanwhile. The mode's latest update, Storm Chasers, adds a fresh village to build up alongside new allies, and storms that strike until you defeat the Storm Dungeon at their centre. 
</p>
<p>
These dungeons - which will shift around the map - look to be an attempt at providing more of a different experience each day you play. Storm Dungeons will reform after 24 hours, as will the boss behind it all: the Storm King. 
</p>
<p>
I've always felt that, beyond village progression, Lego Fortnite lacks a proper end game. Now, similar to the Ender Dragon in Minecraft, the mode has a final boss you can work towards being powerful enough to defeat.

<p>
Fresh vehicles in the update include an aquatic barge, new items include the healing Slurp Launcher, while NPCs can now revive you upon defeat.
</p>
<p>
Other welcome enhancements include melee attacks having increased range, stamina consumption being reduced, and another buff to your inventory size.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, we reported on leaks that suggested virtual popstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">Hatsune Miku was headed to Fortnite in 2025</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tactical-shooter-phantom-squad-hotline-miami-strategists-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Super Rare Games and developer Ctrl Freak have announced <i>Phantom Squad</i>, a top-down tactical shooter with more than a hint of psychotically fast-paced run-and-gun game&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>about it.</p>

<p>Described by its devs as an "intense 1-4-player tactical top-down shooter" which combines "fast-paced combat with real-time strategy",&nbsp;<em>Phantom Squad&nbsp;</em>asks the question: what if you really had to think about what you were doing in&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>?</p>

<p>The game utilizes a similar top-down perspective, and its moment-to-moment action is quick and relentless, but you'll also have access to "in-game tools" to help you meticulously plan and execute your strategy before and during missions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phantom-squad-reveal-gameplay.jpg?itok=IV0e3AQC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phantom-squad-reveal-gameplay.jpg?itok=KWEcNK6a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phantom Squad&nbsp;</em>asks: what if&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>was also a strategy game?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Phantom Squad</em>'s story revolves around the titular Phantom Squad, a "unit of officially KIA operatives" deployed to different locations around the world in order to help fight terrorism in all its forms.</p>

<p>Each member of the squad fills a different role, with combat duties defined by "the player's choice of weapons and gadgets". Missions will offer a range of objectives, too; you might, for instance, be extracting hostages, or you might be asked to neutralize a certain enemy within the mission.</p>

<p>Not only will you be able to use in-game tools to communicate with your squad, but you'll also have access to in-game voice chat to help you figure out how to approach each mission, so you can play this one online with your buddies as well.</p>




<p><em>Phantom Squad&nbsp;</em>is one of a number of games seemingly inspired by neon-drenched classic&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>in recent years; others include the likes of trippy black-and-white roguelite&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/otxo-review" rel="nofollow">Otxo</a>&nbsp;</em>and Devolver's own first-person ass-kicking simulator&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foot-is-hotline-miami-for-foot-fetishists" rel="nofollow"><em>Anger Foot</em></a>.</p>

<p>In any case, <i>Phantom Squad&nbsp;</i>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2841770/Phantom_Squad/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime next year. There's no word yet on whether the game will also be coming to consoles, so watch this space for more info.</p>
