            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has issued a DMCA takedown against a fan-made patch that allowed 2015 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>to run at 60FPS, sparking fresh speculation that a remaster of the game could be in the works.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/manfightdragon.bsky.social/post/3lh2cipa4rk2v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">modder Lance McDonald</a>, who's also one of the most prominent members of the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>community, Sony asked him to "remove links to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dropping-this-month" rel="nofollow">the patch</a> [he] posted on the internet" via DMCA notice, which means it's no longer available for download.</p>

<p>In the replies, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/powerful.crabf.art/post/3lh2eegkh4c2x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">users</a> are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/turbohotdog.bsky.social/post/3lh2eg7nc3s2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that Sony's sudden flurry of activity aimed at the patch could mean that the company is working on its own version of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>that runs at 60FPS.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca-old-hunters.jpg?itok=Q6hcoT7F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca-old-hunters.jpg?itok=n1bloLO- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony has DMCA'd a 60FPS&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>patch, but does that mean anything?</figcaption></figure><p>There is precedent for this standpoint. Back in 2022, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-leak-dmcad-by-konami" rel="nofollow">issued a DMCA notice</a> against a leak for a then-upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game, and that game subsequently turned out to be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em>, so that DMCA was issued in order for Konami to get ahead of the leaks.</p>

<p>Of course, the obvious (and unfortunate) fallacy in the argument is that companies don't always issue DMCA takedowns because they're planning on creating something similar to what's been taken down.</p>

<p>Studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-2-dmcas-gta-mods-save-file" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> are extremely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-issues-another-wave-of-dmcas-for-gta-mods" rel="nofollow">au fait</a> with DMCA takedown notices, and often, those takedowns are issued simply because the company is protective of its IP and doesn't want anyone else coming within sniffing distance of making money from that IP.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that Sony has only just become aware of the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>60FPS patch and that it has no intention of doing anything with the IP; it just doesn't want anyone else doing anything with it either.</p>




<p>It's a shame if the DMCA is purely for IP protection reasons, because&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster is frequently requested by fans thanks to the game's popularity (as well as its relatively shoddy performance in its current state).</p>

<p>Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-february-2023-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">has been known</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-january-2024-recap-heck-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">hold State of Play presentations</a> around this time of year, though, so with all that said, it is possible we could be about to learn that a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster is indeed in the works.</p>

<p>For now, you'll have to content yourself with <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/bloodborne/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">picking up the original on PS4</a>. It's also playable on PS5 via backwards compatibility, of course.</p>

That hasn’t been DMCA’d. Yet.</p><p><em>Bloodborne</em> has languished for a decade now with no meaningful official upgrades on PS4 Pro, PS5, or PS5 Pro. It never got a remaster or even a PC port. Fans have waiting patiently for a sequel to the FromSoftware action game, but not even a whiff of one has ever materialized. Ex-PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356">recently speculated</a></span> that Sony is waiting until original director Hidetaka Miyazaki is ready to continue the spin-off series, and the timing has just never worked out. </p><p>But then Sony does things like this. Why randomly hit a 60FPS mod  that only works on hacked last-gen consoles with a takedown request? Why wait almost four years to do it? Does this suggest Sony might actually have something <em>Bloodborne</em>-related in the works, like a PS5 upgrade that boosts the resolution and framerate on regular modern consoles? Or was Sony somehow just never aware of the project before and only got around to enforcing its copyright just now?</p><p>A chance meeting  looks both funnier and more ominous now in light of the current circumstances: MacDonald tweeted last year that he had just met Yoshida for the first time. “[I] said to him ‘I make mods for PlayStation games’ and he said ‘oh!’” he wrote. “And I said ‘I made the 60fps mod for bloodborne’ and he laughed so hard. Beautiful to meet him, such a wonderful person.” Did Yoshida narc? Or is this another mystery that will drive <em>Bloodborne </em>fans deeper down their conspiratorial rabbit holes? </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A former Midnight Society dev recently revealed that the Studio and devs discovered that Dr Disrespect was being fired at the same time as the world did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HUN2R’s recent post on <a href="https://x.com/HUN2R/status/1885346960766378441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) sheds some light on conversations between Midnight Society’s Director of Technical Product, Rich Cabrera, and the fans. After the news about the studio shutting down was confirmed, multiple members of the community asked why they let Dr. Disrespect go. Cabrera answered that the decision was not in the hands of the “studio and devs” and that the “leadership” made it. They found out at the same time that we did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same thread, Cabrera was also asked why the Studio didn’t release an NFT token, which might have saved them from closing down. Cabrera confirmed they were working on a Token and conversing with a launch platform. However, the shutdown came too soon, leaving them no time to execute this plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those unaware, Midnight Society recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/midnight-society-has-announced-its-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it is cancelling its NFT-backed extraction shooter, DEADROP. Hence, it is seeking other gaming studios to offer employment opportunities to its talented team members. Dr Disrespect founded the development studio; however, the allegations surrounding the streamer last year led to Midnight Society cutting ties with him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Dr. Disrespect is streaming for Rumble and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-run-rumble-head-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping them run the platform</a>. Here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his side of the story</a> on last year’s allegations. What do you think about Midnight Society’s devs being as unaware as we are of Dr. Disrespect’s decision?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-2-pc-port-bad-reviews<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>has officially hit PC, and fans are flocking to Steam to express their dissatisfaction with what they see as an unsatisfactory port, citing extensive technical issues.</p>

<p>The game landed on Steam yesterday, and a quick look at its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews on the platform</a> shows a Mixed rating across almost 2,000 reviews (at time of writing), which isn't a great look for a first-party Sony game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">sold gangbusters</a> on PlayStation and serves as one of the company's flagship titles.</p>

<p>Common themes have emerged across the negative reviews, too. One user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that calling the port "rough" would be "an understatement", pointing to improperly-loaded features like lighting, extra-slow framerates, and regular freezes and stutters, which <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/RootyBlues/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other users</a> have also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199237301221/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complained about</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=342RL_r5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=qq17ncnN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>is picking up some bad reviews on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, some reviewers are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198276342581/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> that they've been able to get the game running with relatively <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralKamo/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">few problems</a>, so it seems the crashes and bugs aren't affecting all players equally.</p>

<p>Still, though, enough players are complaining about technical issues with&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>'s PC port that I'd imagine Sony will issue an emergency patch in the next few days to address some of the more common problems.</p>

<p>The timing of this issue is particularly unfortunate for Sony. Just a couple of days ago, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives" rel="nofollow">walked back its PSN requirement</a> for certain PC single-player games, including&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>, promising incentives for those games if you linked a PSN account.</p>

<p>It's a move that's bound to garner goodwill from the PC gaming community given just how <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">unpopular mandatory PSN accounts are</a> with those folks, but low-quality PC ports like this one apparently is will probably do a lot to erase that goodwill.</p>

<p>Shang Chi actor reveals that his dream has been to bring Sleeping Dogs to the big screen and then a sequel that players have been hoping for for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>zengames44 recently tagged Simu Liu on <a href="https://x.com/zengames44/status/1884321313923424362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, asking if he’s working behind the scenes to bring one of the fan-favourite games to the movies. To everyone’s surprise, Simu Liu replied to the post, stating that he is already “Working with the rights holders to bring Sleeping Dogs to the big screen.” However, fans are a bit confused, as it was shared during a recent interview that the Sleeping Dogs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie is dead</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, in a <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1885252869483340236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent post</a>, Simu Liu doubled down on his plans with Sleeping Dogs, discussing his dreams for the franchise. Liu shared that only some movies can make it from the “pitch phase to greenlight” and that “it has been tiring” pitching the film to executives who do not understand the game. However, his dream remains: “First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone.”</p>



<p>“Sleeping Dogs,” released in 2012, was developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. Fans quickly fell in love with the game’s open-world setting, which allows players to explore a vibrant and bustling city set in Hong Kong. The combat and parkour mechanics are well-designed and intuitive, enhancing the overall experience. Additionally, the story centred around the Triads, the impressive visuals for a game from 2012, and the high-quality soundtrack were all standout features.</p>

A full campaign in Civilization 7 is one that goes through all three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. Once the Age is completed, all players (and any AI opponents) experience an Age Transition simultaneously. During an Age Transition, three things happen: you select a new civilization from the new Age to represent your empire, you choose which Legacies you want to retain in the new Age, and the game world evolves. The Civilization games have never had such a system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beach then explained why Firaxis chose Small as the default map size for Civilization 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know that many veteran Civ players love to play on the largest map size and see the maximum number of empires battle it out,” he said. “However, there's a very deliberate reason that we chose Small as the default map size. With three other empires on your home continent, and a few more to discover later in the game, Small Maps make for a very comfortable experience while you are learning the ins and outs of Civ 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We especially recommend this map size as you get your feet wet with our new Diplomacy system. Tracking your relationship and ongoing diplomatic activities with a manageable number of opponents makes it way easier to get the hang of how you want to spend and manage your Diplomatic Influence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also recommend sticking with Continents Plus for your Map Type selection. The extra islands just off-shore help ease you into the ocean exploration – a key element of the Exploration Age, the second chapter of our game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Tutorial and Advisors, Beach confirmed that when you launch into your first game of Civilization 7, it turns the Tutorial on for you. He also strongly recommended Civ pros play with the Tutorial on, at least for their first full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Tutorial is designed to provide tips and explanations exactly when you first encounter something new,” Beach explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans experienced with earlier Civ titles may scoff at the idea of playing with the Tutorial on, but with so many of our game systems having received upgrades and revisions, we really do recommend sticking with the Tutorial for your first full campaign through our three Ages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Keep in mind that the game has four different Advisors, and you can control which ones are actively leading you through a series of quests to teach you their portion of the game. If it's too much to take in all at once, we suggest listening to only a single Advisor at a time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after you’ve mastered enough systems to turn the tutorial off, you should switch to the setting Only Warnings, Beach recommended.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This setting allows these same Advisors to jump in and warn you if your empire's progress is about to undergo a major setback,” he said. “Even our internal team at Firaxis that knows this game so well plays with these warnings enabled!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overnight, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-post-launch-roadmap-reveals-free-and-paid-content-updates-for-2025">Firaxis unveiled <u>Civilization 7</u>’s post-launch roadmap</a> as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKbxcOGKINE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a special livestream event</u></a> (Great Britain has been relegated to DLC). Civilization 7 itself launches on PC via Steam, on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S on February 11, although the more expensive Deluxe Edition grants access from February 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Games free of microtransactions have become increasingly uncommon, but one such game is on the way. The upcoming Mouse P. I. For Hire breaks away from that with the developers announcing to players the cartoony FPS won't feature any sort of microtransactions whatsoever.</p><p>On the game's official Twitter account, the creators promised an "awesome single-player, noir-fueled, guns-blazing FPS" without the need for microtransactions so players can buy the game and enjoy it as is.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/1885154644328145215" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">MOUSE: P.I.

You play as Private Investigator Jack Pepper in the corrupt and crime-ridden city of Mouseburg.</p><p>"His journey starts with a seemingly cliché damsel in distress, but as P.I. Pepper begins to scratch the surface of Mouseburg’s seedy underbelly," the official synopsis reads. "His journey for justice quickly spirals into a complex web of intrigue, involving murder, corruption, and the unlikeliest of enemies."</p><p>From what we've seen from the footage and trailers, the gameplay will have a classic Doom or Duke Nukem feel--even with Pepper sounding like he's doing a really good Duke impression. The weapon system slides more into cartoonish violence territory with not just tommy guns and shotguns, but playful-looking bazookas with enemies falling in comedic and violent ways.</p><p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch, although it does not yet have a release date.

			<p>It's not long until Civilization VII releases, with just 11 days to go until the<a href="https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-system-requirements-announced/"> full release of the title</a>. However, those who have the Deluxe or Founders Edition of Civilization VII will get access to the game from 6 February. To get people excited about the long-term plans of Civilization VII, Firaxis has posted the roadmap for the game so you can see what to expect for the rest of 2025.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>March will be getting some significant updates, with the addition of Ada Lovelace as a leader, as well as Carthage and Great Britain added as two new Civilizations. There will also be four new Natural Wonders added to the game that players will be able to find when exploring and uncovering the map. Along with those smaller updates, there will also be some major updates that add new events to the game. This includes the Natural Wonder Battle, the Marvelous Mountains event, and even more Natural Wonders, such as Mount Everest and the Bermuda Triangle. There will also be the addition of Simon Bolivar as a leader, as well as Bulgaria and Nepal as civilizations.</p>
<p>All of the updates taking place in March will be added to the game as free content for all players to access, allowing players to experience a bit more of a shake-up to the game before paid DLC starts being released.</p>
<p>After March, the next updates will be released between April and September. This update collection will be called Right to Rule, and will add two new leaders, four more civilizations, and four World Wonders. There will also be new events and challenges for people to enjoy if you're someone who likes a challenge when playing Civilization VII.</p>
<p>During this time, there will also be a variety of free updates, which will include events and challenges, but during this, there will be bug fixes and quality-of-life achievements added to the game to make it a smoother experience for the fans of Civ.</p>
<p>That is where the roadmap ends for 2025, as it says "More to come" for October 2025 and beyond. This is likely when they start to add paid DLC to the game, the same way expansions like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/947510/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI_Gathering_Storm/?curator_clanid=25030453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gathering Storm</a> and Rise &amp; Fall were added to Civilization VI. These DLCs are typically pretty pricey and can cost the same as a game, but these DLCs typically go on sale frequently where you can get them for a much lower price.</p>
<p>Are you excited about Civilization VII?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-updates-will-end-after-season-5-offline-mode-being-added.1096983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Player First Games and Warner Bros. have announced that their crossover platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more updates after its next season, and that an offline mode will be added as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, Season 5 of&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, which begins on February 4th and runs until May 30th, will be the game's last. Following that, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1885327981758865568" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promised</a> that you'll be able to enjoy the game offline "for the foreseeable future".</p>

<p>Two new playable characters, Aquaman and Lola Bunny, will be added to&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' roster as part of Season 5, and Player First says you'll be able to obtain both characters "through gameplay", with Aquaman coming as part of the battle pass' first tear and Lola Bunny being offered as the game's daily login reward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-fight.jpg?itok=suYIAw3w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-fight.jpg?itok=4BXqARRH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros.' platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more updates after May.</figcaption></figure><p>As of today, you also can't buy anything in&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>with real money, but you can still use any of the premium currency you've accumulated until the end of Season 5.</p>

<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>before, you won't be able to download it after Season 5, although you'll still be able to reinstall the game if you've played it and deleted it. Make sure that you check this one out before May 30th if you've got any interest in it whatsoever.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://multiversus.com/en-gb/faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>,&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First somewhat bafflingly dodges its own question regarding why the game's updates are ending, but a quick look at its Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">numbers</a> suggests that it's probably unsustainable to continue development with such a low player count.</p>

<p>This is a situation that will probably feel hauntingly familiar if you've been keeping up with Warner Bros.' other high-profile flop <i>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</i>. Just like&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, that game's updates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">also ended following its last season</a>, and an offline mode was added in that case as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad-updates-ending-multiversus.jpg?itok=p4lbnaTi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad-updates-ending-multiversus.jpg?itok=QV-dIR3m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros.' game&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>suffered a similar fate to&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Both&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>were major failures for Warner Bros., with the former <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">costing the company $100 million</a> and the latter's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">disappointing sales</a> contributing to a $200 million writedown.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. Games also recently announced that its boss David Haddad, who's been with the company for over a decade, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">will step down</a>. The aforementioned games' failures weren't given as a reason (and Haddad did also oversee a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">major success in&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Legacy</a>&nbsp;</em>recently), but they certainly won't have helped his case.</p>

<p>You can still download&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/multiversus/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/multiversus/9ndkxxbl90gf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, so make sure to do so before May 30th if you want to play it offline in future.</p>

Developed by Nixxes Software, which has collaborated on tons of other Sony ports that didn’t have day-one issues, Insomniac Games’ open-world comic book game appears to be giving even players with powerful gaming rigs trouble unless they drastically dial down the settings. </p><p>“After my excitement to swing through New York City, I ran into significant technical problems with <em>Spider-Man 2</em> on my RTX 4090,” one Steam player wrote. “Despite having a high-end GPU and running the latest NVIDIA drivers (566.36), the game frequently crashes with graphics controller errors.”</p><p> Another was similarly flummoxed. “Hold off on buying until they get a couple of stabilization patches out because holy hell,” they wrote. “To say this is ‘rough’ is an understatement. Lighting doesn’t load in some cutscenes, those same scenes run at seconds-per-frame, audio desync issues up the wazoo, freezing, stuttering, and just about every other performance issue I can think of.”</p><figure id="" data-id="b8d2db4a418363e1419ef45261163fab" data-recommend-id="image://b8d2db4a418363e1419ef45261163fab" data-format="png" data-width="1599" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam users review Spider-Man 2.

Others have spent so much time trying to optimize settings to stop the game from crashing that they’ve exceeded the refund limit. “I can’t even refund this now because I’ve spent more time trying to optimize this game than actually playing it,” one wrote. “Worst birthday gift ever.”</p><p>Of course, not everyone’s having a bad time with Spider-Man 2 on PC. There plenty of players who aren’t reporting any major issues as they take on Kraven The Hunter and Venom. Only about half of the reviews are positive at the moment, however, so that’s potentially a 50/50 chance of whether prospective buyers are in for a good time or not. </p><p>This isn’t the first Sony port to get heavily criticized  at launch. <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> came to PC in even rougher shape. Updates subsequently solved most of the problems, and it currently has a 94 percent rating among recent reviewers. But it raised questions around why Sony would release the game if things were in such poor shape. Then again, we’ve seen lots of big blockbusters struggle day-one on PC as developers perform triage on unique issues isolated to certain PC gaming setups that couldn’t be tested during production. </p><p>We’ll see how long it takes <em>Spider-Man 2</em> to get sorted out. It’s one of 2023's best games and something that no doubt has the potential to look even better on PC than it did when it first came to PS5.  <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sonderzüge Sabotage ramps up the difficulty in Resistance. There are enemy snipers everywhere, a multi-floor hotel crawling with Germans, and Sniper Elite Resistance’s Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage has a tough Workbench (or three) for Harry to locate.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s main levels have three Workbenches each. They can be up high or down below, you never know! They’re trapped behind locked doors and situated on crowded floors. But seeking them out is a delight, even if a waiting Nazi is destined to give you a fright. </p>



<p>But enough with the rhyming, Sonderzüge Sabotage awaits. Below is a detailed guide showing you the mission’s Workbench locations and how to get there. Furthermore, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-clues-superweapon-sonderzuge-sabotage-sniper-elite-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to find clues for the Superweapon in Sonderzüge Sabotage</a>, if you’re struggling.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage">Every Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Keep referring back to this. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The screenshot above shows three circled symbols representing Sonderzüge Sabotage’s Workbenches.</strong> </p>



<p>They’re evenly distributed throughout the level, and looking at the location doesn’t always tell the story. Use each one as guidance if you’re off to find them yourself. If you want more granularity and detail, read on for complete guidance.</p>



<h2 id="h-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage-workbench-location-1">Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage Workbench Location 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot One. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Start the level, go down the stairs, and head left along the path that dissects the grass. Head to the nearest Workbench symbol on the map we showed you under the “Every Workbench Location in <a href="https://rebellion.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage” section.</p>



<p><strong>The Workbench is behind a locked door on the ground floor</strong>. Unless you’re already there, you probably need to go down some stairs to reach the ground. You’re in the right location if you can see a bike propped up against the wall, an enemy alarm, and a small statue surrounded by benches.</p>



<p>Screenshot One shows a locked door, and the Workbench is behind this. To the left of the door is a stack of boxes with <strong>Bolt Cutters</strong> resting against them. Use them to access the door quicker.</p>



<h2 id="h-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage-workbench-location-2">Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage Workbench Location 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot Two. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>From Location 1, I recommend getting back onto the main road, <strong>going across the main bridge on the left</strong> (not the railway bridge on the right), and reaching the other side. Do this, reach the first intersection, and head down the road until you a <strong>barbed wire enclosure</strong>. Past it on the right is a set of stone stairs—go down them.</p>



<p>Carry on to the pier, turn right, and the Workbench is in an open building and you can’t miss it.</p>



<h2 id="h-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage-workbench-location-3">Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage Workbench Location 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot Three. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Exit the building, go back up the stairs, head back out onto the main road, and head toward the railway bridge in the distance. Turn left at the red and white road barriers, and go right of the first sandbags you come to. <strong>There’s a long alley you can head down</strong>. Go to the very end, turn right at the white sheet covering, go up the stairs, and open the locked gate.</p>



<p>Carry on in a straight line against the wall with the road slightly leveling out as you go. <strong>Do a complete u-turn around the sandbags and spotlight and go past the red and white “HALT” barrier.</strong> Go into the building with white windows on the left and break open the locked door guarding the stairs. Ascend those very stairs and the Workbench is in the room at the top.</p>

			<p>Sony has released Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC without too much fanfare. The system requirements were only <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a couple of days ago, way later than usual, and the launch experience leaves more than something to be desired, which was a bit surprising since the port was handled by the usually very competent Nixxes Software.</p>
<p>The biggest issue that is driving <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam user reviews way down</a> (only 55% are positive at the time of writing) is the crashing. The game often crashes, as I experienced myself, with the following error message:</p>
<p><em>A problem has occurred with your display driver. This can be caused by out of date drivers, using game settings higher than your GPU can handle, an overheating GPU (current GPU temperature: 70 Celsius), or an error with the game. Please try updating your graphics drivers, or lowering your in-game settings. Current GPU and graphics driver: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, 572.16 </em><br>
<em>(0x887A0006: DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG).&nbsp;</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-30-200037-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, 70° Celsius is definitely not a possible cause for GPU overheating; the drivers are the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-572-16-driver-available-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-dlss-4-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published just yesterday by NVIDIA;</a> and there's no way the problem would be too high in-game settings with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Clearly, the issue is related to the game itself, as evidenced by the fact that many users have reported it across wildly differing PC configurations.</p>
<p>Since we mentioned graphics settings, let's take a look at what's available in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture Quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Texture Filtering (up to 16x Anisotropic)</li>
<li>Shadow Quality (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Depth of Field (up to High)</li>
<li>Level of Detail (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Traffic Density (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Crowd Density (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Hair Quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Screen Space Reflections (up to High)</li>
<li>Weather particle quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced reflections (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced interiors (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced shadows (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced ambient occlusion (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Raytracing object range (a slider that goes up to 10)</li>
<li>DLSS Ray Reconstruction (Legacy, which means CNN, or Transformer)</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-30-185225.png"></a></figure>

<p>The biggest surprise is the inclusion of the latest transformer model for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which greatly improves the ray tracing quality. Menno Bil, Graphics Programmer at Nixxes, said about the feature:</p>
<p><em>In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PC with ray reconstruction enabled, we see more detailed ray-traced reflections and better-defined ray-traced shadows, especially when viewing raytracing effects at steep angles. We also see improvements in the ray-traced interiors and less ghosting and noise in the ray-traced ambient occlusion.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve included two models of NVIDIA’s Ray Reconstruction, the original model introduced in DLSS 3.5 and a newly improved model designed for RTX 40 series GPUs and newer. This new model results in an overall more temporally stable image, further improving the visual quality of raytracing</em></p>
<p>However, in between the crashes, I also noticed a graphics issue during cutscenes with character hair flickering in a very distracting way. Between this, the crashes, and the fact that NVIDIA said DLSS Multi Frame Generation will be added soon to the game, it's best to take a rain check on the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 for the time being.</p>
<p>As you can read in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my original review of the PlayStation 5 version</a>, the game itself is well worth waiting for the fixes, though.</p>

			<p>The rumors were circulating for a little while that MultiVersus may be on death's door, as the game wasn't performing how they wanted it to. Today, it's been confirmed by the team working on MultiVersus that it will, in fact, be closing its doors on the fighting game for the "foreseeable future." The announcement was <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1885327981758865568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1885327981758865568%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a>, with the comments expressing their sadness and disappointment but also stating that they weren't surprised. While they added new characters for people to experiment with, the game wasn't well optimized, with the menus being incredibly laggy. Players felt that the team didn't support the game enough and that it was at its prime during the Beta test. Between the Beta test and the official release, a lot changed, and it wasn't for the better. While there were people regularly playing the title, the interaction with MultiVersus dropped considerably.</p>
<p>For those who want to get involved with the final season, Season 5 of MultiVersus will begin on February 4 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM GMT and will end on May 30 at the same time. Despite the game ending for the foreseeable, Season 5 will still have a 70-tier Battle Pass, as well as Aquaman and Lola Bunny being added as new playable characters to the game. However, none of the MultiVersus content that is being added in Season 5 will be paid for with real money. It is now all earned by playing the game.</p>
<p>As of today, real money transactions are no longer available. However, if you still have unused Gleamium or character tokens, you can use them to purchase in-game content until the end of Season 5. Once the season ends, the game will no longer be available online, and it won't be able to be downloaded on any storefront. However, the game will still be available to play after the online features are gone, as there will be solo vs AI options, or you can play with up to three other players in person.</p>
<p>If you want to play MultiVersus, you will need to make sure to create an account before Season 5 ends on May 30. Additionally, if you delete or uninstall the game before the end of Season 5, you will be able to reinstall after May 30.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are no announcements or updates given on what will happen to the development team, but with there now being no game to work on, it is likely there will be layoffs or a closure of the studio. Along with this, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO</a> left the company last week after the failure of both Suicide Squad and MultiVersus.</p>

		<p><em> A bunch of speculative money in the world of AI was lost this week. Boo hoo?</em></p><p><em>But it's also undeniable that AI, a term that has in many ways lost any and all meaning, will be a major part of the coming years. Its loss of meaning matters not. It might very well go the way of crypto, but for the moment, it's inescapable.</em></p><p><em>How do you handle your children interacting with AI videos? What will it mean for young people to enter an internet full of lies and, as the headline implies, slop?</em></p><p><em>Naturally, Rob and Patrick have some thoughts.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Rob, it was a little strange to watch the headlines this week about billions in market capital disappearing and simply blink. It appears the next century will not necessarily be dominated by Silicon Valley guys who love to align with fascists while chatting on podcasts!</p><p>Who could’ve thought?</p><p>I blinked because it’s been strange to watch the “AI revolution”—an endless, accelerated stream of hype, money, discourse—and feel so utterly disconnected. Besides ire at its obvious potential and material impacts on labor and art, it often feels like a situation where I’m being <em>told</em> my life is going to change. No. If you buy the arguments, <em>has</em> changed. The way Apple pitches its ludicrous Apple Intelligence makes it sound like the world is already shifted, when in reality what they’re pitching are notification summaries that mostly suck. I’m trying to figure out the FOMO!</p><p>I have, on occasion, asked ChatGTP a basic history question out of curiosity. It seemed fine. <em>Seemed</em> fine. But I lump ChatGPT in the same bucket as the dreadful “AI” summaries that you find while doing a Google search these days. Consulting ChatGTP about a sports question, though, is a choice. Google’s AI summaries are not, and busted as they might be, I have found myself defaulting to scanning them for information because they take up the most important real estate that Google has: the first thing you look at when a search has gone through. I hate it.</p><p>Can I tell you an upsetting story?&nbsp;</p><p>My eight-year-old is in a theater class at the moment and their production is <em>The Wizard of Oz.</em> (My child, bless her heart, swung for the fences to be Dorothy in auditions, but it’s a class for older and younger kids, so she’s a munchkin. Thankfully, she’s very excited to be a munchkin.)</p><p>While picking her up this week, she excitedly asked me “Dad, did you know there’s going to be a sequel to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>?” I blinked, figuring she meant the second <em>Wicked</em> movie that’s coming out this year. All we’ve done lately is listen to the soundtrack and watch inspired dances on TikTok. But before I could ask, her friend came up and gave more details about this sequel.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, this sequel is coming soon “according to a trailer on YouTube.” I’m not sure if you’ve made the mistake of accidentally clicking on the ludicrous amounts of fake trailer AI slop on YouTube, but once you make the mistake once, your algorithm is <em>fucked</em>. It just swarms you with AI content from then on. I wasn’t going to ask this 10-year-old if what they’d watched was AI or not, but there’s little doubt in my mind they watched some AI video slop and took all of it literally.</p><p>I quietly sighed internally, told the kids “oh, that sounds cool,” and walked out.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s going to get so much worse!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@lorenzoherrera?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Lorenzo Herrera</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>That’s the vision Silicon Valley has for us, isn’t it? Promise a massive hardware and resource-intensive infrastructure to power a wholly owned counterfeiting machine, because the sheer absurdity of those demands justifies raising impossible amounts of capital for investors who want big, easy yields on their already ridiculous piles of assets. Use the counterfeiting machine to create content for platforms that have an insatiable appetite for audience size and engagement numbers. Trick elders and children at scale, but if that strategy doesn’t produce sufficient growth, create entire fake “content creators” reaching audiences with increasing numbers of bots performing bleak pantomimes of online life. The end result is theoretically a thriving economy of black box platforms claiming growth that is impossible to verify, blotting out the ability of real creators and audiences to find one another or even be certain that both parties are actual human beings. Is there a real hardware innovation here? Hard to say, it seems like the OpenAI model was partly predicated on being able to buy more expensive hardware than anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Is there platform innovation? If fraud is innovation (and investors largely decided those two things were synonymous since 2000), then it might qualify insofar as it solves the problem that Facebook’s membership is aging and disengaging by replacing real, live human users with machines posting a slurry of AI content into their feeds. The plans Google and Facebook have for your kids involve them spending their lives glued to their phones watching AI-generated short-form video that makes them feel poor, unattractive, and insufficient, because that is the ideal consumer on those platforms, assuming all their money doesn’t end up in Roblox.&nbsp;</p><!--members-only--><p>Now this week’s big news is that a Chinese-funded and developed competitor to Silicon Valley’s LLM boondoggles called DeepSeek appears to be able to significantly outperform their programs at a fraction of the cost and hardware resources. If all this pans out, it’s possible that a lot of Silicon Valley investors are going to lose massive amounts of money and will not own nearly as much of the infrastructure of this AI dystopia I described above. However, a lot of the companies who want to <em>use </em>AI against their users and workers will not care where the models come from and will happily move on from OpenAI <em>et al. </em>to DeepSeek-powered tech solutions. I hope Silicon Valley investors like Marc Andreesen end up taking a financial beating in this, but I don’t think DeepSeek will halt the encroachment of AI counterfeiting into our lives.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, a better and more efficient system for generating fake answers, fake pictures, fake writing, and fake people will result in <em>more </em>of that stuff, not less.</p><p>Yet here I must make a confession of optimism and admit I don’t think the plan outlined above is going to work. The AI bubble is inflated in large measure thanks to its promise to help prop up platform bubbles across technology. (It also promises to help companies lay off and reduce the value of skilled employees, but that’s a different threat.) I think it might do that in the short term but I think in the long term it’s poison, because once people begin to suspect that <em>nothing </em>on these platforms is trustworthy, not even the people commenting and posting, you’re going to see a lot of users disappear and a complete failure to capture young audiences.</p><p>Bubbles are about the <em>perception </em>of value versus <em>actual </em>value. The history of tech platforms is one where consistent failures to generate actual value is masked by speculative values and acquisition valuations. That works when the whole ballgame is about attracting investors in a world where capital flows freely between markets and you can recoup massive losses with one successful sale (usually to <em>another </em>overcapitalized underperforming firm). But actual human attention is more fickle. The most likely outcome in your daughter’s case is not that she is just cluelessly guzzling fake movie trailers and watching fake influencers. It’s that she stops engaging with that type of content <em>entirely </em>because it all loses value to her. Even a lot of the real stuff, unfortunately, because the rampant counterfeiting is going to devalue it, and eventually she’s going to be looking for places where she doesn’t have to sift through quite so much bullshit to find something authentic. It won’t be a moral stand, it’ll just be a practical one. But all this shit is predicated on connecting people with stuff to sell with people who might potentially want to buy it, and once the sellers realize they’re paying to access phantom audiences, platforms that embraced AI slurry and bullshit growth metrics are going to be in trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re already nervous about some of these trends I think, which is why they were so bullish on AI (it also made them look dynamic and innovative), and it’s the nature of a bubble that a lot of interested parties have no interest in popping it. Marketers who have relied on platforms for decades certainly don’t want to tell their clients they’ve wasted 95% of their spend accidentally promoting ads into the feeds of pornbots and disinfo accounts. But the platforms and middle men can only keep this going so far when you’re training these unprecedentedly large audiences that the global commons has turned into something less convincing than the floor show at Chuck E. Cheese.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@hudsoncrafted?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Debby Hudson</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I think your instincts are right. Where I see AI slop show up for my oldest is in YouTube Shorts, their equivalent of shortform TikTok-like videos. They are often about showing something heroic, sad, or something in-between. It really is no different <a href="https://www.404media.co/email/1cdf7620-2e2f-4450-9cd9-e041f4f0c27f/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>than the shrimp Jesus stuff that’s all over platforms like Facebook</u></a>, engaged by a collection of bots and old people.</p><p>But young kids and old people have something in common: a lack of perception. Or they don’t care. The result is the same, though, a steady stream of thoughtless engagement with colors.</p><p>With my kid, at least, her reaction to these platforms, despite the slop, is to create. She recently filmed a “YouTube video” with her younger sister, coaching her on what to say, how to walk people through coloring a drawing, and how to “like and subscribe at the end.” The impulse was human. I take solace that beyond the misleading algorithms is a self-driven impulse for art, and you try to unpack that indescribable impulse using the platforms available when you’re alive.</p><p>These companies can try to bury it, but history shows us it will not be denied.</p><p>I mean, sure, she’s emulating a YouTube video, but that’s all you can do at eight years old, you know? You emulate what you know. You emulate, before you can wander into <em>your</em> identity.</p><p>The natural impulse of some parents, I think, is they’ve gotta teach their kids how to suss this bullshit out. I’m not so sure. I think kids are smart, and they will suss out the bullshit on their own. The rise of places like YouTube and Twitch, for all their many faults, is driven by a sense of authenticity—it’s a direct <em>reaction</em> to a long line of media institutions that sanded down personality into bylines. What we’re left with, of course, is often all personality and little substance, but I think the broader point stands. I do not think they will settle for slop. The slop might surround them, might be forced upon them, and they might (to our own frustrations) leverage tools of slop in creating art, but truly, I think they come out the other side mostly okay.</p><p>I am an optimist by nature, though. That’s in my bones. Why else have children in such a despairing age, you know? Because I have some faith they fight to emerge on the other side.</p>

There won’t be refunds on recent purchases either. “This announcement does not change any current refund policies or terms offered by the storefront(s) from which content was previously purchased,” the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://multiversus.com/en/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://multiversus.com/en/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a></span> states.</p><p><em>MultiVersus</em> originally <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-return-review-fps-laggy-locked-characters-1851506741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-return-review-fps-laggy-locked-characters-1851506741">launched in 2022</a></span> and was the new online hotness for a brief period, before people bounced off due to lack of new content and the novelty and gameplay balance wearing thin.

<p>MultiVersus is coming to an end. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-season-5-end-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors began to circulate</a> on Thursday that the game could wrap up after Season 5, it’s been announced that MultiVersus is shutting down.</p>



<p>In a post on social media and <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games announced that Season 5 “will serve as the final update for MultiVersus”. The season will run from February 4-May 30. After that day, the game will be taken offline with the game only playable in an offline state.</p>



<p>“At that point, there will be an option to play&nbsp;MultiVersus offline via the local gameplay mode, either solo against A.I. opponents or with up to three friends,” the blog post reads. “To do this, you’ll need to install/download the latest version of the game and log in during Season 5, any time between February 4 at 9 a.m. PST and May 30 at 9 a.m. PST. </p>



<p>“After logging in, a local save file will be automatically created connected to your PlayStation Network, Microsoft Store, Steam, or Epic Games Store account, allowing you to enjoy the game offline with all earned and purchased content moving forward.​”</p>



<p>Starting today (January 31) real-money transactions will no longer be available in the game. Everything, including the two new characters—Aquaman and Lola Bunny—will be unlockable by playing the game. Lastly, once Season 5 ends on May 30, the game will no longer be able to be downloaded from any marketplace.</p>



<p>As far as the future of developer Player First Games is concerned, that’s currently unknown. Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the studio</a> in July 2024.</p>



<p>“This decision was not made lightly,” the developers said. “All of us on the Player First Games and&nbsp;Warner Bros&nbsp;Games teams have put our heart and soul into MultiVersus, creating a unique social and cooperative experience from the ground up that brings together a variety of popular characters and worlds.</p>



<p>“We are very proud of the game we have built and are incredibly thankful for the support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey. Your passion and enthusiasm have been unmatched.”</p>
