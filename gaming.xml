            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is certainly off to a strong start. Sales estimates <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that it has already sold more than six and a half million units across all platforms</a>, and the game launched to a positive vibe in the community.</p>



<p>That said, fans already disagree with the development team on a few things. For example, yesterday the developers <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled out a backend update</a> that reduced the beginning ticket count when playing Conquest on all maps:</p>



<p><em>We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace. Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Empire State from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</em></li>



<li><em>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</em></li>



<li><em>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</em></li>



<li><em>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The community isn't really convinced this was needed, though. Most comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o7cerx/backend_update_battlefield_studios_has_reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a> state that they never had that occurrence (rounds hitting the time limit instead of one team running out of tickets) happen to them. Some even go as far as accusing the developers of pursuing the Call of Duty crowd in Battlefield 6 with changes like this. That goes hand in hand with criticism leveled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the upcoming Season 1</a>, which will include new 4v4 and 8v8 modes. Veteran Battlefield players would rather get more large maps for classic franchise modes like Conquest, as they believe that the launch maps are on the smaller side.</p>



<p>For its part, Battlefield Studios has introduced a small change born out of user feedback: in the Manhattan Bridge map, when playing Conquest and Escalation modes, the Out of Bounds timer for vehicles has been doubled from five to ten seconds. Lastly, the developers actually just pushed a very small (27 MB on Steam) patch, updating the game to version 1.0.1.6. This update merely improves backend stability in anticipation of the Season 1 launch, scheduled for Tuesday, October 28.</p>

            <p>Tomonobu Itagaki, responsible for creating both the Dead or Alive and 3D <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series, has died.</p>
<p>The announcement came via one final post on his Facebook profile. This news was corroborated by Itagaki's friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3m3c3gq5q7c2k">James Mielke on Bluesky</a>, who posted their own statement mourning Itagaki.</p>
<p>The final message from Itagaki reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Final Words,</p>
<p>"The flame of my life is about to go out. The fact that this message has been posted means that my time has finally come. I am no longer in this world. (I have entrusted someone important to me with this final message).</p><p>"My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too. I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. So it goes.</p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90's, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games and Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.</p>
<p>His career was not without strife. In 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker of Itagaki sued him for sexual harassment</a> which he denied, losing his executive officer role as a result. Ultimately, he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007.</p>
<p>Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.
</p>
<p>Valhalla Game Studios eventually closed, leading Itagaki to form Itagaki Games in late 2021. This studio has been working on a new game ever since.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki, known for his love of sunglasses and long-lasting career in the games industry, leaves behind a daughter.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/open-world-mmo-sword-of-justice-launches-november-7-path-tracing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/open-world-mmo-sword-of-justice-launches-on-november-7-with-path-tracing-and-an-ai-metaverse-of-intelligent-npcs.1326232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ZhuRong Studio, an internal development team of NetEase, announced that the global launch of the open world MMO Sword of Justice has been set for November 7 on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2782500/SWORD_OF_JUSTICE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.nshmna&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sword-of-justice/id6743792551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>.</p>



<p>This is a free-to-play game, although the developers have promised that there is no pay-to-win at all and character progression is gameplay-driven, with strict stat limits and regular seasonal resets, creating an even playing field, where players are rewarded for their skill.</p>



<p>The MMO's narrative is adapted from Wen Ruian's classic literary masterpiece, The Four Great Constables: Sword of Justice. The story is set during the Song Dynasty (between 960 and 1279), and players can explore a vast open world, conquer peaks and caverns, seek out lost weapons and martial techniques, solve ancient puzzles, and, most of all, master martial arts to battle mythical beasts and outlaws in the wilderness and in dungeons to gather rare treasures.</p>



<p>The Windstride and Shadowbearer skills facilitate traversal of the world, as players can parkour, sprint on walls, glide, and more. Furthermore, unlike most MMOs, there are many paths to character development, including life skills such as cooking, fishing, case solving, performing, farming, archeology, presiding over court trials, and many more. Combat roles also reportedly break away from genre conventions, allowing tanks to heal and healers to deal significant damage. Players will thus be able to create their own unique fighting styles.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Sword of Justice also features an 'AI Metaverse' of intelligent NPCs with unique personalities, fluid routines, and personal memories, allowing them to interact with the player realistically. Lastly, the game was also enhanced with the latest visual technologies: ray tracing is supported on mobile devices, while the PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports full path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction and DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> to get the best performance and graphics.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, the base requirements to play Sword of Justice on PC are actually very low:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum<br>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit or newer<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5 9th generation or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX750TI or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 55 GB available space<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD Recommended</p>



<p><strong>Recommended<br>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit or newer<br><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel i7 9th generation or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX1060 or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>DirectX: </strong>Version 11<br><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 55 GB available space<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD Recommended</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-getting-invasion-pvp-mode-in-time-for-halloween/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outlast-trials-is-getting-an-invasion-pvp-mode-in-time-for-halloween.1326226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Montréal-based developer Red Barrels announced that the co-op horror game The Outlast Trials will be getting an Invasion PvP mode next week, on October 21, in time for Halloween.</p>



<p>Players can access the new Invasion Mode via the Sleep Room Terminals and join as either a Reagent or an Imposter. Only a limited number of Imposters can invade any given Trial. While waiting, the others can serve as the eyes and ears of their murderous teammates. As their peers succeed in their sabotage… or die trying, each Imposter will get a chance to invade the Trial.</p>



<p>These are the key features of the new PvP Invasion Mode:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Become the hunter:</strong> stalk your prey from the shadows. Use stealth and subterfuge to sneak up on unsuspecting reagents before going in for the kill.</li>



<li><strong>Surveil the trials:</strong> Plan your route and attack strategy by carefully considering surveillance camera footage. Your fellow Imposters</li>



<li><strong>Don a Deadly Disguise:</strong> Dress in the garb and skin of your targets to gain their trust. Then, when the moment’s right…</li>



<li><strong>Stab them in the back:</strong> Close-quarters combat is the only rule of engagement. Outwit your opponents with multiple blade strikes or a single lethal stab. One slip-up means certain death, ratcheting up the intensity in the high-pressure trial arenas.</li>
</ul>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The update that goes live next week in The Outlast Trials will also add the Geister 2025 New Time-Limited Event and Time-Limited Catalog, two new MK-Challenges (Beguile the Children and Investigate the Minotaur), and the debut of the new In-Game Store.</p>



<p>As a reminder, The Outlast Trials <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-launches-on-march-5-2024-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on March 5, 2024</a> for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X after less than a year of early access on PC. The game has had a positive reception from fans, with between two and three million units estimated to have been sold via Steam alone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Electronic Arts Sale Facing Resistance From ‘Concerned’ US Politicians: ‘National Security Risks’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-us-politicians/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-from-%E2%80%98concerned%E2%80%99-us-politicians-%E2%80%98national-security-risks%E2%80%99.1326208/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the end of September, it was announced that Electronic Arts, one of the largest game publishers in the world, was to be privately acquired by a consortium headed by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. The investment group also includes Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, founded and run by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law.</p>



<p>In a letter to the United States Secretary of the Treasury, key politicians Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have voiced ‘profound concern’ about the ‘foreign influence and national security risks’ of the impending acquisition.</p>



<h2 id="h-pushback-was-inevitable-in-the-ea-deal">Pushback Was Inevitable in the EA Deal</h2>



<p>If the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that lawmakers and regulatory bodies will always try to get their two cents heard as these immense acquisitions unravel. The Microsoft purchase of Activision Blizzard King was a great example of that, with the deal being scrutinized and challenged in the courts numerous times.</p>



<p>Electronic Arts is now facing a similar situation, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the consortium’s purchase</a> of the publisher being doubted by US lawmakers.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent email</a> to Scott Bessent, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, it was stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We write with profound concern about the foreign influence and national security risks posed by the potential acquisition of American video game producer Electronic Arts (EA) by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (Silver Lake), and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners.</p>



<p>We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company.</p>



<p>The proposed transaction poses a number of significant foreign influence and national security risks, beginning with the PIF’s reputation as a strategic arm of the Saudi government.</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia’s desire to buy influence through the acquisition of EA is apparent on the face of the transaction—the investors propose to pay more than $10 billion above EA’s trading value for a company whose stock has “stagnated for half a decade” in an unpredictably volatile industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter went on to detail the concerns around Saudi Arabia’s attempts to strengthen foreign influence within the United States, suggesting that a data privacy concern will arise from EA having collected the information of ‘millions of users’ over the years. There are also worries from US politicians that the deal will ‘eliminate transparency’ in the company’s operations.</p>



<p>In a final request, the letter asks that the CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) conduct a thorough investigation and review of the privatization of Electronic Arts, feeding back findings by November 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Do you think the United States government is right to be concerned about the Electronic Arts acquisition? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Liam Hemsworth stepped into the boots of Geralt of Rivia some time ago, replacing Henry Cavill, who departed the show because of creative differences with the showrunners. While the masses have voiced their concerns about this switch, Hemsworth has proven willing to give the character all he has, which is the sentiment he professed in a recent interview.</p>



<p>Love or hate the casting, The Witcher returns this month with a penultimate series, and Liam Hemsworth is now the star of the show. In an interview with IGN, he explained how he’s handling all the doubt circulating online.</p>



<h2 id="h-liam-hemsworth-has-given-everything-he-has-to-geralt">Liam Hemsworth Has Given Everything He Has to Geralt</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witchers-final-seasons-liam-hemsworth-and-showrunner-lauren-schmidt-hissrich-on-replacing-henry-cavill-and-crafting-a-really-good-payoff-to-the-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Liam Hemsworth and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich (showrunner) sat down to talk about the upcoming series of The Witcher, which returns after a two-year hiatus between seasons.</p>



<p>For the last few months, fans of the show have been wrestling with the recasting of Geralt of Rivia, the instantly recognizable lead previously played by Henry Cavill. It was a sour move for many when Cavill departed the show, and plenty of viewers feel that Hemsworth doesn’t embody the character well enough.</p>



<p>Hemsworth disagrees:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a unique situation, to come into a show that someone else has been doing for a period of time. There was obviously a lot of talk from fans and opinions, and I think that’s great. This show has very passionate fans that care about these characters and care about this world. I appreciate that. I understand it.</p>



<p>I poured everything I had into this character. I wanted it to feel grounded. I wanted it to feel authentic. I really hope the audience enjoys the character and my interpretation of it… I got to work with so many great actors and play this wonderfully complex character that has a huge fan base. And I hope people come along for the ride. I feel very grateful to have had this experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hemworth referenced that he’d played The Witcher games ‘years ago’ and tried to get back into them when playing Geralt of Rivia for the live-action series. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I had just started playing [Geralt] and I was like, ‘I don’t know how many minutes or hours I can spend walking around as this character right now whilst shooting the show at the same time.’ So I had a quick look at it and it reminded me of what I experienced years ago when I played it.</p>



<p>It didn’t feel like it was going to be hugely helpful to my experience at that time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that The Witcher show is based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-book-sapkowski/">on <strong>the books</strong></a><strong> </strong>and not <strong>the games</strong>.</p>



<p>Hissrich, the series’s showrunner, expressed how pleased she is with Hemsworth’s portrayal of Geralt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You need someone who you can imagine can excel at these action scenes, who has such a physical presence that they could be both intimidating in the story, but also, Geralt has a huge emotional side as well… What I really loved about Liam’s work that I had seen is that he was able to organically blend those two things. He didn’t have physical scenes and then emotional scenes. He was able to really carry this specific, I guess I call it soul. </p>



<p>He has a soul that he brings into the role… To have that present even through action scenes when he’s fighting monsters, and it’s the same thing that’s present when he’s having conversations with Ciri or with Yennefer, that was a really special thing that we were able to capture. And when I had watched some of his work, specifically going back to Hunger Games, that’s something that I felt from him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Witcher season four will be released exclusively on Netflix in its entirety on October 30. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to invest any time in the show.</p>

<p>Overall, the achievement and trophy list in <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> seems rather doable. While there are a lot of missions, a lot of these trophies have specific qualifications that revolve around cleaning a particular item first or last. We highly recommend taking a look at the trophy list before you start a job so you can square away the requirements as you move along.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Making a surprise return from the original entry on the Nintendo GameCube, Kirby Air Riders is yet another mascot racing game set to release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With that said, what about the prospects of the new game coming to the Nintendo Switch 1? Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> have made their debut on both console generations. Is the same happening here?</p>



<p>Here is the answer to whether or not Kirby Air Riders will be on Nintendo Switch 1 or if it is a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-1">Is Kirby Air Riders on Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dyna Blade is not ready to go back to the original Switch. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately for those who have not upgraded their console yet, </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kirby Air Riders is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong></a><strong>, and it is not releasing on Nintendo Switch 1.</strong></p>



<p>With the Switch 2 releasing just earlier this year, why would Masahiro Sakurai’s latest game not be available on the original Switch? Most of it likely comes down to performance. On the Switch 2, Kirby Air Riders may not be the most impressive graphically, but it runs at 60 fps, which might not be the same situation on the original console.</p>



<p>Of course, newer hardware is always more powerful than what came before, so we could definitely see a world where Sakurai and/or Nintendo wanted his first release since Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to be as smooth-running as possible. The Switch 1 is a great console, but its history of poor performance is well-known, even in Nintendo games.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-kirby-air-riders-ever-come-to-nintendo-switch-1">Will Kirby Air Riders Ever Come to Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<p><strong>While it is certainly possible that Kirby Air Riders one day comes to Nintendo Switch 1, it’s not something we would bet on.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, the Switch 2 is, simply put, a more powerful console, and we’re not game developers ourselves, but we would wager a guess that the Switch 1 can’t handle <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOoozuGVBxvh8fJftx43dJCineND4wXoWmBaXjdJiS58nTSdFgtbl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kirby Air Riders</a> quite as well.</p>



<p>Another thing to keep in mind is whether or not Sakurai and his team at Bandai Namco would want to put in the resources to port the game over to the original Switch post-release. You would imagine that the focus would be on supporting the game that is already available and then moving on to the next project.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you bummed out that Kirby Air Riders is a Switch 2 exclusive and likely won’t ever release on the original Nintendo Switch? Vent your frustrations in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now available on the Switch and Switch 2, and the first Mystery Gift distribution event has officially gone live.</p>
<p>In case you missed the initial announcement, The Pokémon Company will be offering trainers across the globe an "early-purchase bonus" in the form of a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite stone as a gift. When trained, Ralts evolves into Kirlia and then Gardevoir. From there, it can be Mega Evolved into Mega Gardevoir.</p>
<p>Along with this, the digital version early-purchase bonus includes a "gift of 100 Poké Balls". Both of these gifts will be available to claim until <strong>28th February, 2026</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2mqrskz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>As mentioned in the promotion above, it takes "approximately one hour of play time" before you can access the Mystery Gift feature. <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii.net</a> adds to this with some additional information:</p>

<p>This bumps the game up to Version 5.5.2, and according to the patch notes, it fixes an issue with League Battles tied to Switch 2 and Switch users. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Splatoon 2 - Ver. 5.5.2 (Released October 15, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Fixed an issue with League Battles where, when both Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch users were included in the eight players who battled, sometimes League Power did not change after the battle."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If there's anything else discovered about this latest software update, we'll let you know. The patch before this (Version 5.5.1) was released in November 2022.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also released a bunch of other Switch patches recently, including updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and even the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> title.</p>

<p>No sensitive data appears to have been compromised</p>

<figure data-uuid="c11f95762e385"><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c11f95762e385/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, the hacking group Crimson Collective <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/notorious-group-crimson-collective-claims-to-have-hacked-nintendo">claimed it had breached Nintendo</a>. At the time, there was no official response from the video game giant.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, Nintendo has shared a statement with <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, and it appears to suggest there's been no personal, development, or business-related leaks.</p>
<p>Some external servers displaying Nintendo's website have reportedly been compromised, but there's apparently no evidence of this impacting customers or the company. Here's a rough translation including the statement shared on 15th October 2025:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo responded to an interview with the Sankei Shimbun on the 15th, saying, "We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information." Some external servers that display Nintendo's website were defaced, but the company said there was no evidence of damage to customers or intrusion into the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, at this stage, there's been no personal data leaked, and it seems there seemingly won't be any secrets popping up about the company's games or business operations.</p>
<p>This update follows a story from earlier this week about the supposed hacker behind the Pokémon 'Teraleak' reportedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-z-as-source-code-and-beta-builds-have-now-supposedly-leaked">leaking the new game's source code</a> and beta builds.</p>

                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog is well known as Sega's enduring mascot, especially during the publisher's nearly two-decade stint as a console manufacturer from 1983 to 2001. The company is also a pioneer in the arcade space, with many of its most important games starting out as groundbreaking arcade cabinets. However, despite that, the original Sonic the Hedgehog never got its own dedicated arcade version--until now. Sega is teaming up with My Arcade on a new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player</a> mini cabinet. The tiny device includes the first two Sonic the Hedgehog games with fully playable controls, but is small enough to fit on your shelf. The collectible launches on November 1, and preorders are available for $60 at Amazon.</p><div title="6534625 -- Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4318" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534625 -- Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases November</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Sonic the Hedgehog mini-arcade includes both the first game and its sequel, all housed in a device that features a 3.5-inch full-color display, a joystick, three buttons, and artwork inspired by the original Sonic the Hedgehog arcade cabinet. In terms of dimensions, this is a snug little machine that measures 4 inches wide and 6.8 inches tall, so it can easily fit on your desk or your shelf. It can be powered by four AA batteries or a USB-C connection, and for audio it has a built-in speaker and a 3.5mm audio jack in case you want to connect a headset. </p>                      </div><p>My Arcade also has several other compact arcade cabinets to choose from right now, if you'd like to build a cute collection of gaming machines.

			<p>What was once a slice of alternative history with a Irish prisoner escaping the Tower of London and becoming an influential samurai in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-review-a-samurai-epic-with-souls/">first Nioh title</a> has expanded now into a story of time travel and dual identity. Nioh 3 aims to reinvent the tale that Team Ninja has told over the past eight years with a new time period and setting.</p>



<p>As the grandson of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, players assume the role of a samurai whose unique set of skills allows them access to two completely different playstyles. With the Samurai playstyle, players engage in combat like William did in the first game, complete with multiple stances available for each weapon and a Ki Pulse maneuver to regain expended stamina. Playing as a Ninja, on the other hand, removes the stances completely and instead gives the player access to various ninjutsu and ninja tools to approach the combat with surprise attacks and less head-on assaults. Swapping between these two is a simple affair during combat, although I found myself sticking more to the tried-and-true Samurai style because of all of the muscle memory from the two previous Nioh titles. Unfortunately, weapon types are locked between the two combat styles for reasons that Nioh 3 Producer Kohei Shibata mentioned in our interview below.</p>



<p>Much like earlier Nioh titles, enemies are literal fountains of loot with showers of weapons and gear of various rarities that pool forth and litter the screen. New loot filters allow players only to seek out higher rarity tiered items and automatically destroy/sell lower ranked gear that would otherwise clutter their inventory. While this doesn’t solve the issue of a lack of bespoke, unique items, it does at least push the player only to seek out stronger gear that would come with a potentially better roll of abilities.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 doesn’t pull any punches in terms of combat this time around either. Facing the bosses at the end of the Tokyo Game Show demo was an exercise in frustration and learning the intricacies of defensive abilities as Takeda Shingen wails on the player. Despite the challenges, this fight was a fantastic way to immerse players in the combat changes to Nioh 3 and allow them to use every ninja tool in their arsenal to best the boss. If other fights in Nioh 3 can match the intensity of this single fight, I’m looking at another 100-hour obsession when this finally launches on PlayStation 5 and PC next year <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026-amazon-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on February 6, 2026</a>. We couldn’t get a good peek into the time travel this time around, but that’s something to keep our eyes open for in the months to come.</p>



<p>After getting thoroughly worked by Takeda Shingen's demonic form, we had the pleasure of sitting down with Nioh 3 Producer Kohei Shibata for an intimate 1-on-1 interview, translated by one of Koei Tecmo's in-house interpreters.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>One of the reasons that we came to the time travel idea for this game is that with Nioh 3, one of the things that I wanted to challenge was having an open field. Basically, the open field was the starting point of how we got to this time-travel idea. The reason behind that is when thinking of ways that we show the open field, we wanted to make sure that players would be able to recognize that there are different areas of the field. One effective way of portraying this is by showing a completely different time period.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why go with these time periods in Japanese history specifically for Nioh 3?</strong></p>



<p>With Nioh 3, we decided that we wanted to go with the idea of traveling through time. While in the past, we have focused on the Sengoku, or Warring States, Period and focused on major events in that period. Various major characters or historical figures have been included at key points within the story. This time, we wanted to use traversing through time as a key idea, but for the story, we would incorporate the Sengoku Period as well. For the start of the story, it might be better to start with something a little bit different than what people would expect. We decided to, rather than start from a period of war and battles, we wanted to start from a peaceful period, and from there, the protagonist ends up against the wall in terms of being targeted, and this leads to being able to travel through time, so then we can visit the various periods within Japanese history.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>When you were creating the first Nioh title with William as the protagonist, did you already have plans for the story to evolve into time travel?</strong></p>



<p>No, it wasn’t something that we had in mind from the first game. We didn’t have this mapped out at all. One of the reasons that we came to the time travel idea for this game is that with Nioh 3, one of the things that I wanted to challenge was having an open field. Basically, the open field was the starting point of how we got to this time-travel idea. The reason behind that is when thinking of ways that we show the open field, we wanted to make sure that players would be able to recognize that there are different areas of the field. One effective way of portraying this is by showing a completely different time period.</p>



<p>We’re using time travel to really showcase the open field element of Nioh 3, so we’ve incorporated that into the story. I guess I gotta say we got a little bit of a hit of this from the DLC for Nioh 2 because one of the DLCs does go through time.</p>



<p><strong>The Nioh series has predominantly been mission-focused, but in titles like Rise of the Ronin, it was largely open world with smaller discrete missions. When transitioning from a mission-based design to an open world, how do you keep that feeling structured and created in a specific way?</strong></p>



<p>One thing when creating this game that we really wanted to make sure that we kept to is that we wanted to make sure that there was freedom and exploration within the field. We wanted to make sure that we had that ability given to the player, but also at the same time, when they pick it up, they’ll instantly realize that Nioh 3 feels like a Nioh game. It’s this dark action RPG, but in terms of how we would portray it, we kept an eye on the density of the fields created and kept that feeling of tension throughout.</p>



<p>Not to say that it was easy, obviously. We went through a lot of trial and error. At one point, we were trying to keep it as an intense action game, but we had just too many enemies on the field. We found that just trying to defeat them gets a little bit tiring. You couldn’t really feel a difference, and it just felt like the same thing over and over again. We decided to formulate it in a way that you’ll encounter areas on the field that have a lot of enemies, but you might encounter a few enemies, but they’re very strong. On the other hand, you’ll also have an area that’s harder to get through. We wanted to make sure that players know there are various ways to progress.</p>



<p>We incorporated a sort of mission, or various strategic ways that you can choose which path you want to go in order to clear the game. We want to make sure that we have that balance in the game as well. In the end, we have given players a lot of different options in how they can explore and get through the various missions, but in the end, when they play it, they’ll definitely feel that this is a Nioh game.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>At one point, we were trying to keep it as an intense action game, but we had just too many enemies on the field.

On the other hand, you’ll also have an area that’s harder to get through.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Masocore (Masochism Hardcore) has been an identity of the Nioh series. You’ll have veterans who are very comfortable with this type of difficult action, but there will also be new players who are playing Nioh 3 for the first time in the series. How do you balance where you want to challenge veteran players while also making the game accessible for new players?</strong></p>



<p>The first thing I want to say is that the enemies themselves have not become weaker and they’re still very strong. I think that in terms of Nioh 3, in order to defeat those enemies, players will have to reach a level where they can defeat them.</p>



<p>We’ve incorporated elements such as player growth, skill growth, as well as being able to learn the game systems. As players learn the system mechanics, they’ll catch on to how to defeat the enemies. We’ve made sure that it’s easier to learn as you play, so we do have tutorials in Nioh 3. We have onboarding elements as well incorporated into the main structure of the game. Even though the enemies themselves remain powerful, those who are new to the game won’t be able to instantly defeat them but as they play through Nioh 3, they’ll understand the mechanics and ways to defeat them so that it isn’t a frustrating experience.&nbsp; For those who are used to the series, they can get right into Nioh 3.</p>



<p>One of the changes that we’ve done is with the Samurai Style. In previous games, you were instantly given the different stances of High, Mid, and Low. This time, when you start the game off as a Samurai, you’ll start with just the Mid stance so that you can learn the mechanics and get used to it and then learn the other stances so that you’re not instantly overwhelmed. For players who haven’t played in a while, maybe they just need a reminder on how to get into the game. We’ve retained the difficulty level of the Nioh series, but we’ve given players the opportunity to be able to overcome the game and skill up in a fair way.</p>



<p><strong>With Nioh 3 having two different combat styles, I did see that weapon types were segregated between the two styles. Does that mean that the Samurai style will not be able to use the Tonfa or Kusarigama?</strong></p>



<p>Essentially, no, you cannot switch between the two. When we came up with the Ninja and Samurai styles, we also decided on the weapons that would match that image of a Ninja. Up until now, Nioh has only had Samurai in it. This might be more because I’m Japanese and it’s our intrinsic feeling, but it’s about what kind of weapons we would see. The Tonfa and Kusarigama were very common for Ninjas, but we don’t have that image for Samurai or didn’t think that it would be fitting for a Samurai to be able to use those weapons. Even for things like Spears, you know that Samurai would use them, but not a Ninja. But for weapons like the Katana, that’s something that both Samurai and Ninja have used and wield a single, or even double blade. That is one common weapon between the two, but even with the same weapon, the way they use it is quite different. A Samurai might hold the weapon up above their head, whereas Ninjas would hold it behind them in a different style. Even though it’s the same weapon, how they use it is quite distinct but also fitting for that style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a veteran Nioh player, I typically play with a Kusarigama in High stance, so with that weapon being limited to the Ninja style, I have to relearn that weapon with a new moveset. I understand, and it was the dev team’s decision to do things like that. We apologize for that, but if you could use a weapon in either style, the distinct elements between the two Styles would be a little bit muddled. We wanted to make sure to keep the two Styles distinct and one of the ways was in the weapon selection.</p>

<p><strong>Onmyo Talismans have been very powerful in previous Nioh titles, and I was wondering if they will still be as powerful in Nioh 3. Will you be rebalancing those, or have players play with less of a focus on that playstyle?</strong></p>



<p>The Talismans are still in and we have made some adjustments. They are overall powerful and we have made some adjustments, but it’s not to the extent that they seem a lot weaker or stronger than in pervious games. One thing that has changed is how you obtain Talismans. In Nioh 3, you obtain them by defeating Yokai.</p>



<p><strong>Nioh games have a lot of equipment you can gather; some say the loot is quantity over quality. When you’re going through a level and you have 20 different Katanas dropping, how do you make it feel like players want to upgrade and look for new equipment?</strong></p>



<p>One thing that we’ve done is make it easier to handle or look at your stock of weapons. One of the new features you can set is that the most powerful weapon in your possession is automatically equipped. We’ve also added a setting so that if something drops and it’s below a certain rarity, you can automatically sell it off or get rid of it. You can immediately tell what is of the most value and what isn’t. It should be easier to get through the quantity.</p>



<p>Another thing that we’ve done with Nioh 3 is because of the two Styles. For example, with the Ninja style and Ninpo, you can find equipment with stronger effects. We’ve given players an incentive to look for these things and equip them to become stronger.</p>



<p><strong>Once you finish Nioh 3, will you unlock a higher difficulty level?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we have incorporated that into a second playthrough where you can increase the difficulty level and I think that has become a staple for the Nioh series.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you very much for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages just got a new patch, Update 2.2, and the notes bring up some bug fixes and Steam Deck verification.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, Doom: The Dark Ages brought the rip and tear of past titles to Medieval times. Reviews called the game a bloody good time, besting the previous Doom Eternal. While it wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-steam-player-count-is-the-lowest-of-the-reboot-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as popular as others</a>, it remains one of 2025’s best shooters. Luckily, there’s more to enjoy thanks to Update 2.2, which releases today.</p>



<p>The patch, releasing on all platforms, aims to fix many bugs and Quality of Life (QoL) issues. Furthermore, Doom: The Dark Ages is now Steam Deck Verified, so the game can be played successfully on the portable console. More additions include adjustments to The Ripatorium and tuning of the Brink of Death system.</p>
