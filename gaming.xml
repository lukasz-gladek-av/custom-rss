			<p>We’ve known for a while that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gta-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is coming out sometime in 2025, but when specifically in the year it might arrive has remained an open question. Some have held out some despearate hope that an early-2025 might happen, but it seems that’s not in the cards. <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/c189ec33-cb0d-44a0-8d20-2d3352836999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today as part of their latest earnings report</a> Take-Two Interactive clarified that GTA VI is coming out in fall of calendar year 2025.</p>
<p><em>“As we enter Fiscal 2025 with positive momentum, we expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.55 to $5.65 billion. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. As we deliver our pipeline, we are confident that we will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders.”</em></p>
<p>So there you have it, mark your calendars GTA fans! Of course, there are still plenty of opportunity for delays. Some analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-delay-likely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already predicted a slip to late 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-falling-behind-early-2025-release-target-2026-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further delays are possible</a>. That said, hopefully Rockstar has enough runway do deliver on time. In other news, Take-Two has confirmed the unstoppable <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1791200143800487952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTA V has reached “approximately” 200 million copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>Haven’t been keeping up with GTA VI? Rockstar hasn’t revealed a lot of info about it yet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-the-first-gta-6-trailer-live-trailer-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond that kickass first trailer</a>, but here’s a quick official description…</p>
<p><em>“Grand Theft Auto VI continues our efforts to push the limits of what’s possible in highly immersive, story-driven open-world experiences. We’re thrilled to be able to share this new vision with players everywhere. Grand Theft Auto VI heads to the state of Leonida, home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond in the biggest, most immersive evolution of the Grand Theft Auto series yet.”</em></p>
<p>Grant Theft Auto VI will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 in late 2025. Are you counting down the days?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158450/never-let-go-trailer-release-date-halle-berry-crawl-director<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8EGTyG">The low-key king of the modern survival-horror movie, Alexandre Aja — who’s made movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/12/20690919/crawl-movie-review"><em>Crawl</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22432477/oxygen-review-netflix"><em>Oxygen</em></a>, and <em>The Hills Have Eyes —</em> is back with a new film staring Halle Berry. The first trailer for <em>Never Let Go</em> was released on Thursday, and the movie already looks like a terrifying addition to Aja’s impressive canon of people trying to survive the very bad things that are happening to them. </p>
<p id="jglVk7"><em>Never Let Go</em> stars Berry as a mother of two twin boys. The whole family lives in the woods, way off the grid, with Berry insisting that they have to stay safe from the evil spirits that surround their cabin. One day, however, one of the boys starts to wonder if these spirits are real and sets out to discover the truth, only to get stranded in the woods, with his mother desperately trying to save him. </p>
<p id="hVdQO7">The trailer feels like a mix of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134076/trap-trailer-thriller-release-date-m-night-shyamalan-pop-star">M. Night Shyamalan</a>’s <em>The Village</em> and John Krasinski’s <em>A Quiet Place</em>, with all the tension that combination implies. Berry’s character leads her kids into the woods, a rope tying them all together so no one gets lost, making for a pretty haunting image, and that’s not including the strange hands that reach out to grab the characters every now and then. </p>
<p id="SjRO7S">Along with Berry, the movie will also star Anthony B. Jenkins and Percy Daggs IV as her two sons, as well as Matthew Kevin Anderson as “The Stranger” and Stephanie Lavigne, whose character is simply called “The Evil.” </p>
<p id="gB2xwj"><em>Never Let Go</em> is set to be released in theaters on Sept. 27.</p>

I’ve only played a few hours so far but the beginning of a new era for <em>Diablo IV</em> is beginning to take shape, one where climbing the loot ladder feels more methodical and meaningful thanks to permanent unlocks (aspects and affixes) and more streamlined customization (tempering and masterworking). Gear stats make more sense and character builds are easier to experiment with earlier on. </p><p><strong>Buy <em>Diablo IV:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-IV-PlayStation-5/dp/B0BPPPPYK7/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-d4-loot-reborn-season-4-helltide-1851482897&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0BPPPPYK7" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/ckXEP7sdqsD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/ckXEP7sdqsD" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>The result is an endgame that’s more nuanced while also being less tedious. The economy’s less broken, gold matters more, and leveling to 100 isn’t just a mindless Nightmare Dungeon grindfest. There are still things that may need tweaking in the future. Is leveling <em>too easy</em> now? Are the gold costs for masterworking putting players in the poor house? Maybe.

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Reveals Plans for Skull & Bones Season Two]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-season-two/</link>

<p>Do you remember Skull &amp; Bones? It’s that pirate-themed game from Ubisoft that was released on February 13 following approximately 178 delays that made it seem as though the game would never see the light of day. When it was finally released, Skull &amp; Bones failed to take the gaming world by storm, and it was revealed that the player count was struggling somewhat shortly after launch.</p>



<p>Despite that, Ubisoft has remained optimistic, and off the back of a ‘tremendous community response’, the developer has outlined the plans for the game’s impending second season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-skull-amp-bones-staying-afloat">Skull &amp; Bones Staying Afloat</h2>



<p>There’s almost nothing memorable about Skull &amp; Bones, but there’s a dedicated community holding up the game on a shaky set of shoulders – and that’s all that matters. For that community, Ubisoft is preparing a plethora of tweaks, changes, and additions for the second season of the game.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/4JskVoFQcIbc50OENc1JxT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on the Ubisoft blog</a>, it was revealed that a platform-wide ‘soft reset’ will take place as season two is deployed. This will include resetting Pieces of Eight, manufactories, and territories for almost every player. This is a balancing effort but it’ll also encourage players to get back out there and start building up again.</p>



<p>Here’s what Ubisoft is bringing to Skull &amp; Bones in season two:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ship Upgrades</li>



<li>Fleet Management</li>



<li>Helm Leases</li>



<li>New PvE &amp; Solo Game Modes</li>



<li>Balancing Manufactories</li>
</ul>



<p>It was noted that there would also be a fresh boss fight, a new and terrifying sea monster to battle, a brand-new ship, and a slew of weapons, armour, and furniture. That’s plenty for players to sink their cutlasses into, but more updates will be shared regarding the second season soon.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 will be releasing in Fall 2025. The news comes as part of <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fourth-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s FY 2024 earnings call</a> on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Our outlook reflects a narrowing of&nbsp;Rockstar Games’&nbsp;previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>,” the company said. “We are highly confident that&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.”</p>



<p>The news of the Fall 2025 release for GTA 6 confirms recent rumors and reports surrounding the game’s status. There had been rumors of a possible announced delay into 2026, but Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-gta-6-delay-isnt-what-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was told at the time</a> that the game remained “on schedule” with it’s development. Any talk of a delay outside of 2025 at the time was “pure conjecture”</p>



<p>Also, there was never any possibility of the game launching “early 2025” as some had suggested. The plan since the trailer’s first release in December was to see a launch in Fall 2025, heading towards the holiday season.</p>



<p>To add to the confirmation of the release date, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Take-Two and Rockstar “feel highly confident that we’ll deliver [GTA 6] in fall of 2025”.</p>

<p>Manor Lords has well and truly taken the gaming world by storm. Before being released on April 26, Manor Lords set the record for being the most wishlisted game on Steam, finding a spot on more than 3.2 million lists worldwide. Within a single day, Manor Lords sold one million copies, and now, less than three weeks later, the game has ticked over the two million mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-the-beginning">Just The Beginning</h2>



<p>Manor Lords is a monumental success, created by a solo developer and being built over several years. It came to be backed by Hooded Horse, a publisher specialising in strategy games, and that’s where the marketing magic began. Before long, Manor Lords was shaping up as one of the most innovative and highly-anticipated titles on Steam – and eventually on other platforms.</p>



<p>It was released on Game Pass when it dropped on April 26, which boosted the game’s profile to no end. In a statement, the CEO of Hooded Horse, Tim Bender, praised the game’s success:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s been wonderful to see so many players give&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;a try. We had some pretty optimistic expectations and even some wild hopes, but reaching two million copies on&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;so quickly has exceeded even those.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to information released by Hooded Horse, Manor Lords boasts a conversation rate of a whopping 26 percent. That’s a solid number, and the game is still a hit – it might have slipped down the top sellers list on Steam, but it’ll be a long time before it disappears entirely, especially with the plans that are in the pipeline to continually develop the game over time.</p>



<p>Have you given Manor Lords a try yet?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-moves-grand-theft-auto-6-out-of-current-fiscal-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Rockstar's latest now set to arrive fall of 2025 as impairment charges see publisher post $3.74bn net loss</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Take-Two today released its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter, covering the three months ended March 31, narrowing the Grand Theft Auto 6 release window while taking a massive loss thanks largely to goodwill impairment and restructuring charges.
</p>
<h2>
The Q4 numbers
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net revenue:</strong> $1.40 billion (down 3% year-over-year)</li>
<li><strong>Net loss:</strong> $2.9 billion (compared to a $610 million loss in the year-ago quarter)</li>
<li><strong>Total net bookings:</strong> $1.35 billion (down 3% year-over-year)</li>
</ul>
<h2>
The full-year numbers
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net revenue:</strong> $5.35 billion (flat year-over-year)</li>
<li><strong>Net loss:</strong> $3.74 billion (compared to a $1.12 million loss in the last fiscal year)</li>
<li><strong>Total net bookings:</strong> $5.33 billion (up 1% year-over-year)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>
When Take-Two reported its fiscal 2023 earnings last year, it took the unusual step of talking about numbers more than a year into the future, saying it expected $8 billion in bookings for fiscal 2025. While it never said it outright, this was largely taken to mean the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 would launch in the company's fiscal 2025, which ends March 31, 2025.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar has indeed announced a 2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto 6, but Take-Two today said that has been narrowed to the fall of 2025, putting it in the publisher's fiscal 2026.
</p>
<p>
"We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase," Take-Two chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick said in announcing the company's earnings. 
</p>
<p>
In a briefing call with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> around the earnings, Zelnick acknowledged the increasing expectations around Grand Theft Auto 6, but declined to confirm whether those expectations are now larger than those of any other game the company has previously released.
</p>
<p>
"I couldn't be more enthusiastic than I am about Grand Theft Auto 6 and everything it can bring to consumers," Zelnick said. "I couldn't be more excited, but I'd probably stop short of establishing any expectations. As a practice, we prefer to talk about success after we've had it."
</p>
<p>
On that note, he pointed out that Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold in about 200 million units worldwide, and engagement in Grand Theft Auto Online "is higher than we possibly could have expected."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two said Grand Theft Auto 5's audience size grew 35% for the full year, while Grand Theft Auto Online's audeince grew 23%.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar's other big game, Red Dead Redemption 2, has also now sold-in almost 64 million units worldwide.
</p>
<p>
On the 2K side of things, NBA 2K24 has sold-in 9 million copies, down from 11 million for NBA 2K23 at the same point in its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
And while it didn't give sales figures, Take-Two said that WWE 2K24 has been "a resounding success" with the highest Metacritic average for the franchise since Take-Two acquired it, and Borderlands 3 "outpaced our forecasts." 
</p>
<p>
Take-Two also said Zynga delivered "outstanding" results, with Toon Blast and Match Factory in particular performing well and Rollic passing a cumulative 3.5 billion downloads all-time.
</p>
<p>
Despite those upsides, Take-Two posted a GAAP net loss of $2.9 billion for the fourth quarter, primarily thanks to $2.18 billion in goodwill impairment charges and another $304.3 million in charges for acquisition-related intangible assets.
</p>
<p>
Further bringing down the bottom line were $93.3 million in charges because of its third cost-reduction program involving layoffs and restructuring in a little over a year.
</p>
<p>
When asked why the company needed three cost-cutting programs in such a short span of time, Zelnick gave his reasons for each.
</p>
<p>
"Anytime you acquire a company of [Zynga's] scale, you would naturally expect to have integration savings, and we certainly did," Zelnick said of the first cuts, noting that Take-Two aimed for $100 million in savings with that program and exceeded the goal.
</p>
<p>
"Thereafter, we looked around and said times are a little tougher than we thought," he continued. "That was a reflection of post-pandemic consumer behavior being a bit more cautious than perhaps we and others expected."
</p>
<p>
That led to the second $50 million cost-reduction program, another target he said the company met.
</p>
<p>
"Most recently we said we expect to reduce current and expected spending by about $165 million, which will benefit us this year and going forward. And that's simply a reflection of the fact that as an industry and a company, perhaps we became a little less disciplined."
</p>
<p>
He then reiterated the company's strategy to be the most creative, innovative and efficient company in the entertainment business, saying the programs have been an effort to "put a fine point on efficiency." 
</p>
<p>
Taking the goodwill impairment and amortization out of the equation, Take-Two reported fourth quarter EBITDA of negative $19.6 million. For the full-year, that would have been positive EBITDA of $272 million.
</p>
<p>
Amortization of acquired intangibles is likely to dampen the company's current fiscal year as well, with Take-Two forecasting a net loss in fiscal 2025 between $606 million and $674 million, thanks in large part to a $710 million amortization hit. It would be the third straight year of net losses for the publisher.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the outlook numbers for the current fiscal year are a bit better, with revenues between $5.57 billion and $5.67 billion (up 4% to 6%) and bookings between $5.55 billion and $5.65 billion (also up 4% to 6%).
</p>
<p>
"Looking ahead, we believe that our company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027," Zelnick said. "As we deliver our pipeline, we are confident that we will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders."

<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Slavic Magic has confirmed that <em>Manor Lords</em> has sold over 2 million copies across all storefronts in the three weeks since its launch. The developer has also broken down the numbers and when the most copies were sold, showing just how much the game has grown in popularity over time. </p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">In the lead up to its release, there was quite a lot of excitement around <em>Manor Lords</em>, especially because it was coming to Game Pass. However, the game’s sales have gone beyond what anyone at Slavic Magic hoped it might achieve. After an initial 1 million units sold and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/manor-lords-hits-peak-concurrent-player-count-as-game-tops-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurrent player count of 173,000</a> in the first weekend alone, the game has gone on to sell another 1 million copies in the time since, with early access having only just begun. </p>
 <h2 id="h-manor-lords-developer-is-hard-at-work-processing-player-feedback-and-testing-its-first-patch" data-injectable="false"><em>Manor Lords</em>‘ developer is hard at work processing player feedback and testing its first patch</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Slavic Magic</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">In a statement with today’s news, Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender explained, “We had some pretty optimistic expectations and even some wild hopes, but reaching two million copies on <em>Manor Lords</em> so quickly has exceeded even those.” </p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">The game’s first patch is now in open testing and should be pushed live for all players soon. It adds features and fixes from the developer and those the community has requested. My favorite so far has to be that corpses being carried away now have their own sprites, to add a massive dose of mortality to the experience of going to war. </p> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="826" data-injectable="true">It’s impressive that <em>Manor Lords</em> has sold so well, considering it’s an in-depth city builder with large-scale battles, economics, and social issues to manage as your settlements grow. It’s a blend of some of the best parts of games that sees you manage an entire civilization, and much smaller groups of people going through their day-to-day lives. I would have said that this made the game’s appeal much more niche, but that’s obviously not the case. </p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="false">The game was released three days after <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bellwright-tops-200000-sales-in-early-access-and-is-rapidly-developing-a-dedicated-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bellwright</a></em>, which looks very similar on a surface level. However, <em>Manor</em> <em>Lords</em> offers a lot more to players who want in-depth management and the experience of running a medieval region as a lord. This is very different from <em>Bellwright</em>‘s tale of rising from the ashes to fight back against the lord of the land, which is why I feel the two haven’t really been competing, despite offering what might at first appear as the same experience. </p>

True to its title, the hook here has combatants using their shields as projectiles, and you can see a sample in Statera’s reveal trailer below.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Shield Strike | Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2_wOGux55A?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false"><em>Shield Strike </em>currently has plans for eight playable characters, and up to four players can get in on the action in both versus and cooperative modes. There’s also a story mode that unravels more of what’s going on in this medieval fantasy world, complete with a bunch of enemies and five boss battles.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="870" data-injectable="true">With a match-start countdown timer that ends in “MURDER,” <em>Shield Strike </em>aims to deliver the kind of fast-paced, frantic action fans of the sub-genre have come to expect. The shield mechanics certainly have my interest piqued, but what I really want to see are more of those obstacles and other means of disruption. I don’t fancy myself a competitive platform fighter player by any means. I play <em>Smash </em>for the chaos. If <em>Shield Strike </em>can harness that level of borderline frustrating unpredictability in its versus battles, count me in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="138" data-current-count="138" data-injectable="false">While we wait for a more concrete launch date, <em>Shield Strike </em>is currently in the works for PC and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877870/Shield_Strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> is live for wishlisting. &nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-coming-to-kickstarter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League Publishing has announced a new expansion is coming to their official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/blade-runner-roleplaying-game-preview"><em>Blade Runner</em> TTRPG</a>. This licensed game, based on Ridley Scott's critically acclaimed sci-fi film, will explore a different perspective of its universe with<em> Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> is a supplement that massively expands the scope of the <em>Blade Runner</em> RPG. Overall, this new book remains focused on the main setting of Los Angeles in the year 2037, but with one major twist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-graffiti-artwork.jpg?itok=X3a-XHl1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-graffiti-artwork.jpg?itok=Bk-U9gF3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you know where to look, you'll find shelter.</figcaption></figure><p>The twist is that players aren't Blade Runners, but Replicants. You can join the Replicant Underground, get into intense cat-and-mouse chases with Blade Runners, and oppose the establishment.</p>

<p>In <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em>, players will run their own independent crew. That crew can undertake various operations while maintaining their covers and keeping their records clean. Those operations can include helping fugitive Replicants escape, sabotaging Replicant trade, weeding out moles, or just fighting with warring crews and syndicates.</p>

<p>Naturally, this set-up flips the script on the Blade Runner experience. You aren't investigators shutting down rogue synthetics; you are the prey striking against unjust institutions. It's an expansion that asks players how much they will lose for a righteous cause, a question most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-2077-uncanny-tone">cyberpunk sci-fi explores</a> in one form or another.</p>

<p><em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> will contain the following resources:</p>

<ul><li>An overview of the history and organization of the Replicant Underground, charting its presence throughout the entire <em>Blade Runner</em> setting</li>
	<li>Guidelines on how to play a Replicant Underground campaign. This includes several new player character archetypes and various new rules like maintaining a cover and sweating Heat as the law closes in.</li>
	<li>Several complete prewritten Operations set within the Replicant Underground</li>
</ul><p><em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/blade-runner-rpg-replicant-rebellion-and-asset-pack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">coming to Kickstarter May 28</a>. The campaign will include an Asset Pack. GMs can use this pack to create their own Case Files and Operations.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/internet-goofballs-are-having-a-field-day-with-king-charles%E2%80%99-portrait.873357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158329/king-charles-portrait-meme-jokes-red<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UnUJGN">The purpose of art is to inspire and incite discourse, and the recently unveiled portrait of King Charles has certainly done that. The current monarch of the United Kingdom was coronated last year, and it’s a common tradition for painters to sit down with heads of state to create a personalized portrait of them. On May 14, King Charles’ portrait by artist Jonathan Yeo was revealed to the public, and while some art critics wanted to debate the heavy use of red in the portrait and the symbology therein, other people decided to just make some banger memes out of the painting. </p>
<p id="vIKP9e">There’s the very obvious comparison to Soulsborne games. FromSoftware designers seem to love nothing more than decorating a crumbling castle with massive, ominous portraits. (Actually, some members of FromSoftware might love <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/elden-ring-has-multiple-poison-swamps-because-i-cant-help-myself-miyazaki-says/">poison swamps</a> <em>slightly </em>more than ominous paintings, but it’s debatable.)</p>

<div id="C9YONs">
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">this the type of shit you see hanging on top of a guy's throne in Elden Ring and then the dude's called 'Morgorem, Bloodrot Baron' and he lives in the 'Sanguine Temple of Decay' <a href="https://t.co/jUn0Fs77wk">https://t.co/jUn0Fs77wk</a></p>— RED  (@DemonfireTanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/DemonfireTanto/status/1790499913379324250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="Kwpmc1">Of course, a painting this ominous can fit into a whole smorgasbord of settings. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dishonored/mods/99/?tab=videos">Consider this mod for Dishonored,</a> which allows you to steal King Charles’ portrait in-between murdering Corvo’s many enemies. The image would also fit nicely in the original <em>Doom, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1790518505634480157">as this mock-up proves</a>. </p>

<p id="ZjwrSU">Personally, I’m a fan of this <em>Disco Elysium</em> interpretation of the portrait created by Stivkun on X.</p>

<p id="LRh4My">The portrait is also easily substituted into movies. <em>Ghostbusters </em>2<em>’s </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kronethjort.bsky.social/post/3kshsscrspo2t">painting of Vigo the Carpathian</a> is an easy example here. Or the painting could fit neatly into the environment of <em>The Shining</em>, which is a notoriously unsettling hotel. Some artists are even taking the portrait’s style — which I personally find striking and evocative — and applying it to other fictional characters. </p>

<p id="7FZr0Y">The painting has inspired a lot of genuine critical discourse about its style, the message, and the monarchy itself. But I’m an easily amused magpie, and I love seeing how moments like this are re-interpreted through a goofy lens. These memes are brief, and fleeting, but for a moment they are beautiful. </p>

His story has been adapted into books, manga, and even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/yasukes-intense-first-trailer-is-here-and-its-gory-and-1846602108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/yasukes-intense-first-trailer-is-here-and-its-gory-and-1846602108">an alternate-history Netflix anime</a></span> starring <em>Sorry To Bother You</em> and <em>Knives Out</em> actor LaKeith Stanfield. Fictionalized versions of Yasuke have also appeared in video games like <em>Nioh</em> and the <em>Samurai Warriors</em> franchise.</p><p>While some of the specifics of Yasuke’s life are disputed by historians, the commonly understood story is that he arrived in Japan as a bodyguard for Italian Jesuit Alessandro Valignano in 1579, before going on to serve the Japanese feudal lord Oda Nobunaga. The nature of his service is a matter of debate for those who have studied Yasuke, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://historyofyesterday.com/how-an-african-slave-became-a-samurai/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://historyofyesterday.com/how-an-african-slave-became-a-samurai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some claiming</a></span> he was a slave. Thomas Lockley, co-author of <em>African Samurai: The True Story of Yasuke, a Legendary Black Warrior in Feudal Japan</em>, told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Time</em></a></span> that he speculates Yasuke was a “free actor” who was likely enslaved as a child and taken from Africa, but that he had possibly been freed by the time he met Valignano and was a working mercenary.</p><p>Ubisoft’s marketing describes Yasuke as a samurai, but it’s unclear just how holistic that label is in <em>Shadows</em>’ take on historical fiction. While the version of Yasuke seen in <em>Shadows </em>clearly wears the armor and uses the Japanese swords commonly associated with samurai, the samurai moniker encompasses <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2127.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2127.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both an occupation and a social caste</a></span> that became more codified in the 1600s after the last known record of Yasuke. According to Lockley, the concept of a samurai <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fluid during Yasuke’s time</a></span>, and if you took up weapons in service of a lord, you could take on the name. So right now, we don’t know how much Ubisoft is playing with history with Yasuke’s samurai status.</p><p>Yasuke served Nobunaga from 1581 to 1582, and his service ended after Nobunaga was betrayed by his general, Akechi Mitsuhide. Nobunaga performed seppuku, a ritual suicide considered a way to retain one’s honor in defeat. Lockley describes it as his “last victory,” and says Yasuke would go on to join Oda Nabutada, Nobunaga’s son, who also fought Akechi’s men the following day and performed seppuku. Lockley says the last known record of Yasuke is of him being escorted to a Jesuit mission house by Akechi’s troops.</p><p>According to <em>Shadows</em>’ associate narrative director Brooke Davis, the team is using what is known about Yasuke and filling in the blanks with its own story. Davis describes the team’s version of Yasuke as a “thoughtful, level head” compared to Naoe, who is more passionate and fiery. The two are meant to contrast in both personality and playstyle, as Naoe will focus on stealth as a ninja, while Yasuke will be a more action-oriented fighter utilizing samurai skills.<br></p><p>Yasuke differs from previous <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>protagonists in that he’s the first character who is based on a specific historical figure. Most of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>’s heroes have been original characters striving to stay invisible and nudge history from the shadows, hence providing a neat explanation for why little historical record exists for them. They’re still maintaining that in <em>Shadows</em>, of course, as Naoe is an original character in the Assassin faction. But Yasuke’s known history is another wrinkle in the series’ storytelling that will be interesting to watch unfold when <em>Shadows </em>comes to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on November 15.<br></p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft</a></span></p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There's the Chicago Bears' <a href="https://x.com/ChicagoBears/status/1790894961199595793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teen movie-themed</a> reveal, the New England Patriots' <a href="https://x.com/Patriots/status/1790894935471751504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Will Hunting inspiration</a>, the Jacksonville Jaguars'<a href="https://x.com/Jaguars/status/1790896080793616492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> homage</a> to the intro for X-Men '97, and the Minnesota Vikings <a href="https://x.com/Vikings/status/1790895432576471202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parodying a tech keynote</a>, in addition to various other pop culture-inspired reveals.</p><p>But, arguably, the team with the best schedule reveal this year was the <a href="https://www.chargers.com/news/los-angeles-chargers-2024-schedule-announced" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Chargers</a>, which got creative by announcing their 2024 opponents through The Sims. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>should we REALLY make our schedule release video in the sims?</p><p>yes          yes          yesyes<br>yesyes    yes      yes         yes<br>yes  yes  yes     yes           yes<br>yes    yesyes     yes           yes<br>yes      yesye      yes        yes<br>yes          yes           yesyes <a href="https://t.co/MXzfAPyhe8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MXzfAPyhe8</a></p></div>— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) <a href="https://twitter.com/chargers/status/1790895458581467314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The Chargers posted a nearly four-minute video last night on social media. It starts with a group of Sims wearing jerseys from every team the Chargers will face this season before an unseen figure is shown removing the ladder, an act that is familiar to <em>plenty</em> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a03d90e6355dafdc&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1097US1097&amp;q=Sims+remove+the+ladder+meme&amp;uds=ADvngMhhDoUiRlghAkhZNdYT43b0oKAf1ITlYzhXy1U_F4LGE6Yc8YjQWdw4ZIu6RBf0GYrHwtFcRNw-0arJg4daX38Mjwt0L0lTbCaRmdg5489EJuOnyBJgqW0wbhM_y0W9kl2oR1sM6xF4L36C4463frAryLG_RS6o2uKfk3TFBANZO_75UEosmP62-BFpcJ08PNFeRU00jK49w54RN1RBwNzkHiFpKC6kVD4wJiNMY_XXsHXj6nhpAxkmTr__7Gkr2SDDiAhAUaWEFhPSNidhajExshdRN71kTCQ7vbpnpT7xOj5kH9ACCW8HVqzZszx8poTr2APKIrCC1azHWNcQ855O-edVsw&amp;udm=2&amp;prmd=ivsnbmt&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiHhrKM1pKGAxVNEFkFHYQ0BG4QtKgLegQIDhAB&amp;biw=1295&amp;bih=1261&amp;dpr=1.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of diabolical Sims players</a>. </p><p>From then on, the Chargers announce which teams they'll play for the 2024 regular season, presenting many jokes, memes, pop culture references, and <a href="https://x.com/AustinPlanet/status/1790907064375476578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ChargersMuse/status/1791128965962489905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few</a> <a href="https://x.com/lindseyyok/status/1790900813176373722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jabs</a> at several <a href="https://x.com/ChargersMuse/status/1791128965962489905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">individuals</a> and teams. Some are more upfront and in your face, while others linger in the background. While the Sims gimmick is reason enough to watch, there are so many references that it encourages multiple viewings. </p><p>Here are a few I personally found hilarious: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Chargers' Week 4 game versus the Chiefs shows a snippet of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce recording an episode of <a href="https://www.newheightshow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his podcast</a> before he skedaddles with <a href="https://people.com/travis-kelce-talks-filming-taylor-swift-eras-tour-on-his-phone-8649140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his girlfriend Taylor Swift</a> on her private jet. </li><li>In Week 8, the Chargers face the New Orleans Saints, showing a Falcons fan picking up a voodoo doll before seeing four prompts appear, mentioning moments in the Saints franchise history, most infamously <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1441646-reviewing-the-complete-timeline-of-nfl-saints-bountygate-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bountygate</a>. </li><li>On Thanksgiving Day, the Chargers' Week 12 opponent is the Baltimore Ravens. The scene shows a young Jim and John Harbaugh, who are the head coaches of the <a href="https://www.chargers.com/team/coaches-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chargers</a> and <a href="https://www.baltimoreravens.com/team/coaches-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ravens</a>, respectively, playing in a shared room before it fast-forwards to older versions of both in a pillow fight.</li><li>In the second to the final week of the regular season, the Chargers will face the New England Patriots; it depicts a retirement home of many of the Patriot's best players from the team's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39260168/bill-belichick-new-england-patriots-legacy-nfl-greatest-dynasty-innovation-tom-brady" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historic sports dynasty</a>, such as Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, before a pop-up appears saying "Your dynasty has ended, but the town lives on. There's no reason to let this house stay empty. Would you like to restart?"</li><li>It also features a shot of Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who can be seen cooking and cleaning in a kitchen - no doubt a knock on Butker's controversial comments in a recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251778598/nfl-harrison-butker-commencement-speech-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commencement address</a>.</li></ul><p>The Chargers never expliclty say which Sims game they're using, but internal discussions between me and my fellow Simmers and colleagues Reb Valentine and Alex Stedman deduce that the Chargers likely back to the Sims 2 for their reveal. A little vintage, but we're not complaining.</p><p>This isn't the first time an NFL team used a video game to reveal its schedule. In 2020, the Detroit Lions used Animal Crossing: New Horizons to unveil its schedule. But The Chargers usually get pretty creative, as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/los-angeles-chargers-anime-opening-2022-schedule-one-piece-naruto-attack-on-titan">past two</a> <a href="https://www.chargers.com/video/chargers-anime-schedule-release-2023-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">years</a>, the organization used anime-themed reveals to announce its opponents for that respective season. </p><p>You can see some of our other favorite pop culture-inspired NFL reveals below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChicagoBears/status/1790894961199595793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do you like schedules? <a href="https://t.co/xxNTeCxFvv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xxNTeCxFvv</a></p>— New England Patriots (@Patriots) <a href="https://twitter.com/Patriots/status/1790894935471751504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To Me, My Jaguars! 💥<a href="https://twitter.com/Dream_Finders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Dream_Finders</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DUUUVAL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DUUUVAL</a></p>— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaguars/status/1790896080793616492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next generation of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vikings?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Vikings</a> schedules is here!<a href="https://t.co/UeiFxRs60a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/UeiFxRs60a</a> <a href="https://t.co/RTpkaEmlLF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RTpkaEmlLF</a></p>— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) <a href="https://twitter.com/Vikings/status/1790895432576471202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Activision has released a <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1791166606640545883" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new teaser trailer</a> for the upcoming Season 4 update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The season is confirmed for May 29, and the big update brings the return of Warzone's popular Kar98k bolt-action rifle.</p><p dir="ltr">The brief video clip doesn't give much away, with quick images of clocks, timers, and keypads. These teasers could be referring to the bunkers in Warzone, which haven't been unlocked yet, and they could be preparing to open in Season 4. The images could also be teasing an upcoming reveal for Call of Duty 2024. The new game reveal may or may not be tied to the Warzone bunkers, which is something we've seen in the past with Call of Duty in-game reveal events.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Season 4 clip, Activision also <a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeScope/status/1791155295189701030" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent packages to Call of Duty influencers</a> that contained teasers to reveal the popular Kar98k rifle is returning. It's uncertain if this will be the marksman-rifle version seen in Modern Warfare 2019 or Call of Duty: Vanguard's sniper-rifle version, but it was described in the teasers as being a bolt-action rifle, which makes sense, seeing as it's a real weapon used by Germany in WW2.</p><p dir="ltr">More details will likely arrive in the coming days leading up to Season 4's launch. In other Call of Duty news, Warzone's recent update has added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-how-to-unlock-the-black-ops-6-sally-weapon-blueprint/1100-6523521/">secret "Sally" pistol weapon blueprint</a>, which seems to be teasing Treyarch's rumored Black Ops 6.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-stream-details-response-to-recent-ddos-attacks-benchmark-updates.873339/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-live-letter-details-on-benchmark-ddos-attacks/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ffxiv-live-letter-details-on-benchmark-ddos-attacks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="222" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During today’s Live Letter update stream, director and producer Naoki Yoshida sat down to discuss the recent string of DDoS attacks aimed at <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, along with more changes planned for the<em> Dawntrail</em> Benchmark.</p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">On the subject of the DDoS attacks, Yoshida acknowledged that the recent string of attacks against <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>has been not only the largest scale attack in the game’s history but also the longest. Despite this, Yoshida reassured that there is a dedicated and talented infrastructure team working around the clock in shifts to protect players during these attacks.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">Not only is this team working internally within Square Enix, but also with external vendors to figure out the best way to deal with these attacks moving forward. Although there is massive packet loss at times, occasionally with more than 2,000 players losing connection at a time, there has been no critical damage as a result of these attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">He went on to thank players for their kind and encouraging comments on social media during these attacks, apologizing for any inconvenience experienced due to disconnection.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Moving on to the <em>Dawntrail Benchmark</em>, Yoshida shared some rather impressive screenshots detailing what the development team is trying to achieve. In these screenshots, it’s clear to see that the lighting effects are looking better over the current game and even the current version of the Benchmark, with shadows falling much more naturally and character details shining through. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="true">Yoshida also took a moment to discuss Miqo’te canine teeth. Well, more than a moment, if I’m honest, but the news was definitely welcome. Previously, in the current Benchmark, Miqo’te players had noticed that their characters’ canines were much smaller than they were used to. This, we were informed, has been rectified and Miqo’te players are looking vampire-esque once again.&nbsp;<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">In further detail, Yoshida said that while all Miqo’te characters will benefit from this change, certain face types will have to have slightly smaller canines due to the shape of the face. Keeper of the Moon females, mostly, will suffer from this issue, with face types 1 through 3 having longer canines and face type 4 having slightly shorter ones.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Lalafell players are also receiving a small tweak to their teeth. After feedback from the community, Lalafell teeth will now fit the shape of the mouth much better, rather than sitting bizarrely in the middle of the jaw.&nbsp;<br></p> <figure data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Smile lines have also been addressed. With the new lighting update, players were noticing that their characters had newly developed smile lines. While these, I’m reliably informed, are a sign of a life well lived, many players were unhappy with their sudden appearance. Yoshida stated that the development team has made slight adjustments, essentially giving characters some filler in the area.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">There’s still no set date for the release of the updated Benchmark, though Yoshida tentatively stated that they’re aiming for May 31, or sometime around that point. We were promised that as soon as they have a set date, they’ll make an announcement. Until then, Yoshida is making his final checks of both the Benchmark and <em>Dawntrail</em> itself, all while undertaking a Media Tour at the same time.</p>

  <p id="CrVMSw"><em>Minecraft</em> is turning 15 years old. Somehow, it feels like it’s been around for much, much longer, which speaks to the ubiquity of the game. Despite its age, <em>Minecraft</em> is still wildly popular due its its sandbox-style gameplay — you can do or make almost anything. You can already play it on your computer, console, or mobile phone, but Microsoft’s added one more platform: Google search.</p>

<p id="UmFO8Q">To celebrate the game’s 15th anniversary, <em>Minecraft </em>is playable in Google Search — sort of. Head over to Google and search for <em>Minecraft</em>. You’ll see a little grass block at the bottom of the screen. Hit that, and it’ll turn into a pickaxe. Then just click away. All over the screen, you’ll uncover a bunch of different <em>Minecraft </em>vignettes. Keep on tapping to bludgeon your way through all sorts of <em>Minecraft</em> bricks and experience the satisfying crunch of breaking stuff.</p>
<p id="O4JFDT">Since I found it, I’ve been breaking my way through wood, dirt, snow, stone, and even clouds. There’s not much — or anything — else you can do in there, as far as I’ve experienced, but it has proved amusing enough for me! I’ll be over here clicking away until I understand <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24022852/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve">how Jack Black is playing Steve in the upcoming <em>Minecraft </em>movie</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy XIV </em> is gearing up for its next expansion debut on July 2, though you can begin <em>Dawntrail’s </em>early access on June 28. With Version 7.0 comes the usual flood of Job reworks and changes, and today’s Letter from the Producer Live was filled with a flood of information about all of its 21 Jobs, including both Viper and Pictomancer.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">There’s a lot to cover, the May 16 stream almost hit the 5-hour mark. If you’re looking for the bullet points — they very long, brief version — here’s a recap of the <em>FFXIV</em> Live Letter, including all of the Job previews, trailers, system changes, and even some weird collaborations with Mountain Dew and KFC. As a note, we’ll keep updating this Job recap as more information from the Live Letter clears up. </p>

 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">As the Level cap increases to 100, all Jobs will see new actions and Traits. In an effort to streamline the gaming experience and avoid clutter on hotbars, a new setting called <strong>Action Change</strong> also debuts in <em>Dawntrail</em>. Action Change Settings will “allow you to individually choose whether or not specific changing actions will be replaced by their follow-up counterparts upon execution.” </p> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Then there’s the new Jobs, Viper and Pictomancer. The Live Letter doesn’t provide all of the exact potencies and ability names, those come much later. Regardless, we did get a few details on some guiding design ideas and a look at how both play. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The fishing and deep sea exploration hit <em>Dave the Diver</em> is adding one more wonder to its ocean next week, as Godzilla DLC will be joining the game, albeit with a caveat.</p>

<p>The <em>Dave the Diver</em> Godzilla DLC will be completely free to players on all platforms, much like the <em>Dredge</em> crossover of last year, which came not long before Nexon announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-3-million" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Dave the Diver Sales Break the 3 Million Barrier"><em>Dave the Diver</em> had crossed 3 million sales</a>. If it's like that you'll need to download it separately to add to the game, making this an optional addition to the game for players who want it.</p>

<p>Beyond the king of the monsters himself, several other parts of the <em>Godzilla</em> franchise will be making their way here, as the G-Force is tracking the injured Godzilla, who will see Dave in the depths of the Blue Hole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-godzilla.jpg?itok=-eIGMUen 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-godzilla.jpg?itok=o0nGsXqE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maybe Godzilla won't be spending all of its time beneath the waves...</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond G-Force and Godzilla, another Kaiju will be making its appearance in <em>Dave the Diver</em> as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/16/dave-the-diver-free-godzilla-dlc-arrives-may-23/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Dave the Diver: free Godzilla DLC arrives May 23">part of the DLC</a>. During the DLC, Dave will be evading pursuit from Ebirah, a sea Kaiju who was featured in the 1966 movie <em>Ebirah, Horror of the Deep</em>.</p>

<p>Finding his trusty harpoon unable to stop Ebirah, Dave will use the G-Force submarine to battle the seabound Kaiju and penetrate its shell. As for what Godzilla will be doing during all this? That is left as a mystery for now, but it's possible he might ally with you against the destructive Kaiju as he has in some of his cinematic appearances.</p>

<h2>When is the Dave the Diver Godzilla DLC releasing?</h2>

<p>The <em>Dave the Diver</em> Godzilla DLC will be released on May 23 for free on PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, and Nintendo Switch. The DLC will only be here for a limited time, so make sure to grab it before it goes away on November 23, as Toho sends it to the depths of removed content. If you are wanting to serve Kaiju sushi, this will be the time to get on board and take action.</p>

<p>For players who are interested in <em>Dave the Diver</em> but haven't picked up the game by Mintrocket, it is currently available as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-playstation-plus-april-2024-games" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" All Confirmed PlayStation Plus April 2024 Games">April PlayStation Plus Extra</a> lineup. Otherwise, you're looking at its normal retail price, and it generally hasn't gone on deep discounts.</p>

This version of BioWare's RPG includes all the post-launch DLCs: Jaws of Hakkon, The Descent, and Trespasser. The last two, in particular, are absolutely vital to fully understanding the storyline, which is expected to continue in the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition is the third installment in the RPG franchise. It was the first BioWare game to utilize the Frostbite engine when it launched in November 2014. The game earned widespread acclaim, winning over 130 Game of the Year awards and becoming BioWare's most successful release in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>While this isn't the first time the game has been given away (it already happened <a href="https://wccftech.com/prime-gaming-november-drops-include-control-ultimate-edition-dragon-age-inquisition-and-rise-of-the-tomb-raider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2021 via Amazon's Prime Gaming</a>), the timing of this new promotion is fairly obvious: EA and BioWare are enticing any potential users who still haven't checked out the game to do so ahead of the long-awaited gameplay reveal of the next installment, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which will happen at some point next month during Summer Game Fest. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-has-everyone-at-bioware-really-happy-with-how-it-turned-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last rumors</a> suggest that the game's launch will happen this year, and they also hint at a strong level of satisfaction regarding the level of quality.</p>

<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition Game of the Year Edition is the first freebie of the latest <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store MEGA Sale</a>, which runs through June 13. The next game is still clouded in mystery, but in the meantime, users can enjoy substantial discounts on many big games. All eligible purchases (including in-game purchases) also provide 5% back as part of the Epic Rewards program.</p>
<p>By the way, the Epic Games Store is not the only place to get free PC games: Amplitude Studios is now giving away 2014's turn-based 4X fantasy-strategy game ENDLESS Legend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd-deals-2024-silicon-power-2tb-2tb-ps5-compatible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Amazon Prime member exclusive deal</h2></div><div><section><p>SSD prices are trending upwards for 2024, so it's much more difficult to find a PS5 compatible 2TB M.2 SSD for the same  low prices we saw last year. Even so, <strong>Amazon Prime members</strong> can pick up a <a href="https://zdcs.link/GdxoM" target="_blank">Silicon Power 2TB</a> PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 solid state drive (SSD) for only $109.99 shipped. This is one of the lowest prices we've seen this year for a PS5-compatible SSD.</p><h2>Silicon Power 2TB SSD (PS5-Compatible) for $109.99</h2><p><em><strong>Amazon Prime member exclusive deal</strong></em></p><div id="179170"><p><h3>Silicon Power 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD</h3></p><div><p>Amazon Prime members only</p></div></div><p>The Silicon Power 2TB meets all the requirements for your PS5 SSD upgrade. It supports transfer speeds of up to 7,000MB/s read and 6,500MB/s write which is well above the 5,500MB/s minimum threshold. However, it does not include a heatsink. Compatible <a href="https://zdcs.link/6YE8Z" target="_blank">heatsinks starts at $7</a> and they are very easy to install yourself.</p><p>The PS5 is an outstanding  gaming console, but the 1TB SSD is a real bottleneck. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, for example, can exceed 200GB alone. NBA 2K23 weighs in at 150GB and even older games like God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West  require 90GB of space. Future games like Grand Theft Auto VI will undoubtedly demand even more space.</p><p>If you have a gaming PC, this SSD would make a great boot drive. There are faster drives out there, but for OS and general app performance, you won't notice any real world performance difference compared to this drive, which is already very, very fast. The capacity is also ideal. For most people, a 2TB SSD should be enough to cover your OS, apps, and games. A 4TB would be even better, but it would <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ay34j" target="_blank">run you over $200</a>. Instead, put all of your other files on a bigger, cheaper, traditional hard drive and you're set.</p><h2>A 2TB PS5 SSD with preinstalled heatsink costs $129.99</h2><div id="180988"><p><h3>Adata Legend 960 Max 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7400MBps) with Heatsink</h3></p><div><p>Amazon Prime members only</p></div></div><p>Installing your own heatsink is very, very easy. However, if you don't want to get your hands dirty, there's an A-Data Legend 960 Max 2TB SSD that's currently on sale for Amazon Prime memberes for $129.99. It has a robust aluminum heatsink pre-installed and it's definitely fast enough for your PS5 console.</p><p>If you want more options, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">best SSDs of 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 16, 2024 5:55 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, some of that feedback has been put to use in the game's first patch, and there are still more adjustments on their way.</p><p>Today, Supergiant Games released the first Early Access patch for Hades II, which includes substantial changes to player movement, encounters, and level design as well as a handful of bug fixes. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The patch notes</a> are available on Steam.</p><p>"Here's our first patch in <strong>Early Access</strong>!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes." the patch notes read.</p><p>Most notably, the patch makes sprinting faster, dashing out of attack recovery animations more reliable, and gathering easier (now, players can get resources from any resource point once they unlock the right Gathering Tool, and Tools can be prioritized to make its respective resources appear more often). The design of several areas has also been altered to make dashing and resource gathering easier.</p><p>It also fixes a few frustrating bugs, including certain Boons not working as expected and foes spawning out of bounds.</p><p>The patch is almost entirely inspired by players, with every item in the notes except for two spurred by community feedback. The patch notes also mention that the next patch will focus on balance changes and other adjustments based on feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Hades 2 Early Access Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>First <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-ii-announced-at-the-game-awards">announced during the Game Awards in 2022</a>, Hades II had a short <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-technical-test-announced-how-to-join">technical test last month</a> before heading into <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-technical-test-to-wind-down-today-steam-early-access-release-date-relatively-soon-after">Early Access</a>.

<p>Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1791161114538987820">statement</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today is an incredibly difficult day. After a long period of evaluating how to navigate our economic structure, we have had to significantly restructure the company to pave a path for a strong future. We are reorganizing Phoenix Labs to focus on our best-in-class live service titles, Dauntless and Fae Farm, and serving their communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This unfortunately means canceling work on all other projects at the studio, which will impact many of our colleagues immediately. We are giving notices to everyone whose roles are affected. This restructure has not come easily, and truly has been the last resort to ensure Phoenix Labs can survive, and thrive in the long term. It's impossible to put into words how deeply we value every talented individual who have contributed their hard work and passion to every project at our studio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are doing all we can to help our departing team members in this interim period and encourage any studios looking for incredible talent to speak with the one-of-a-kind people that have been a part of Phoenix Labs' journey."&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BF5C0KohZHI" width="640"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="196" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Rumors and leaks suggested that the KAR98k would be included in the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 update, but Raven Software may have finally confirmed it as part of a marketing campaign. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">The <em>Warzone</em> devs sent 98 care packages to content creators ahead of Season 4. On Twitter, JGOD <a href="https://x.com/JGODYT/status/1791152147494731806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed</a> that the box had a letter K, a bolt-into-action label, and a car with 98 on its door, essentially confirming that the KAR98K will be in the new update. Based on the Season 3 Battle Pass, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> will likely start on Wednesday, May 29.</p> <figure data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">Activision usually releases a blog post for <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone</em> with initial details about the next update one week before a new season starts, so players should expect more news soon. In saying that, the Kar98k is already a noteworthy addition worth paying attention to. <em>Modern Warfare 3’s</em> iteration of <em>Warzone </em>improved one-shot sniping by removing the explosive ammunition requirement. Without needing to use the ammunition type that drastically decrease bullet velocity to get a one-shot kill, sniper rifles dominate the battle royale and are capable of taking out enemies from impressive ranges. </p>
 <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="false">During <em>Warzone</em> Pacific in 2021, the Kar98k was widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, weapons to use on Caldera. If the bolt-action sniper rifle can one-shot kill enemies in Season 4, there’s no doubt that the Kar98k will be a must-use weapon. Because even though the MORS is arguably the best sniper rifle in <em>Warzone</em> right now, the KAR98k will have better mobility and aim-down sight speeds. It will all come down to how far away the new weapon can kill enemies. </p>
