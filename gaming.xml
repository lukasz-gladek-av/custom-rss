            <p>
Developing games for Apple platforms has been described as "like an abusive relationship", due to a lack of support or strategy.
</p>
<p>
In a new report, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/">MobileGamer.biz</a> has spoken to a number of anonymous developers making games for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> mobile platform and the Vision Pro VR headset.
</p>
<p>
Sources describe a whole litany of issues, suggesting Apple simply "does not understand gamers" or the industry.

<p>

A key problem is reportedly a lack of contact or technical support. "We can go weeks without hearing from Apple at all and their general response time to emails is three weeks, if they reply at all," said one source.
</p>
<p>
"We're supposed to be able to ask product, technical and commercial questions, but often half the Apple team won't turn up and when they do they have no idea what's going on and can't answer our questions, either because they don't have any knowledge on how to answer it, or are not able to share that info for confidentiality reasons."
</p>
<p>
This is particularly apparent for developers working on Vision Pro, with one developer describing Apple's technical support as "the worst I have seen anywhere".
</p>
<p>
"Developing for Vision Pro is like going back in time 10 years because despite the advertised power - and the cost - it is not a machine built for gaming," they said. "Getting any complex games working on the platform is difficult."
</p>
<p>
Apple also does not offer financial incentives for studios to develop for Vision Pro, unlike its main rival Meta, which was described as "utterly baffling" by an anonymous developer.
</p>
<p>
Other problems include discoverability on Apple Arcade, and grim QA and update processes. Said one source: "It feels like the game's been in a morgue for the last two years... It's like we're invisible."
</p>
<p>
Another developer detailed the QA and localisation process, which involves submitting a thousand screenshots at once for every device aspect ratio and language. "My team were like: there's no fucking way we're going to do that," they said.
</p>
<p>
On the plus side, the interviewed sources stated Apple does pay well, although times have changed since the first few years of Arcade. Now, however, there's a five month backlog on royalty payments - one developer had not been paid for six months and nearly went out of business, while another said they had been "stonewalled" by Apple reps for chasing payments.
</p>
<p>
And while developers believe Apple sees games as a 'necessary evil', Arcade seems to be directionless. One source said it "feels like a bolt-on to the Apple company ecosystem" and isn't "truly supported inside the company".
</p>
<p>
"Honestly, I think Apple doesn't understand games and gamers," said another source. "I believe Apple Arcade is a good idea in general, but they need a clear goal for where it should go and what it is for. That's a question they need to answer and then act accordingly."
</p>
<p>
Another source was particularly disgruntled. "Given their status as a huge tech company it feels as if they treat developers as a necessary evil, and that we will do everything we can to please them for little in return, in the hope that they grace us with another project - and a chance for them to screw us over again," they said.
</p>
<p>
"It's like an abusive relationship where the abused stays in the relationship hoping the other partner will change and become the person you know they could be."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer requested comment from Apple, which it declined but did point to an interview with Arcade's senior director Alex Rofman in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/apr/23/apple-arcade-future-alex-rofman-interview">The Guardian</a>. "Arcade is a place for games that might not otherwise exist, and I think that's a really important part of our strategy," he said, adding "games are more important to Apple now than they ever have been."
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-concerned-about-apple-arcade-future-report">previous report in February</a>, also from MobileGamer.biz, stated developers were concerned about the future of Apple Arcade and described "the smell of death" around the platform.

</p>
<p>
It's certainly a tricky time for mobile gaming. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">Capcom's iOS port of Resident Evil 7 has reportedly made under 2000 sales</a> since its launch at the start of July. The likes of Assassin's Creed Mirage, Resident Evil Village, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> have fared similarly.

In a quick but informative scene, we learn that she’s staying with a man Rodney doesn’t approve of. He offers to help financially, but she promises she’s got a good life and is happy. Distraught, he asks to stay and even offers to pay rent, but she denies him because her partner, Rick, is not approving. The implication is that Rodney’s white mother chooses this new person and new family over him, her biracial son, motivates Rodney to reunite with Michael and the other superheroes.<br></p><h2 id="h106101"><a id=""></a>You’re being watched</h2><p>Throughout the series, we’ve seen an experimental facility in which a white man oversees the superheroes and Black captives behind bars. In this episode, we learn that he and his staff have been actively tracking the main characters, and that he takes a special interest upon learning four of them have been in the same location concurrently. The facility gets more cut scenes this episode, emphasizing how they are invasively tracking the superheroes.</p><p>Whenever multiple heroes are in proximity of each other, the people in the facility take notice. Because community social worker and Michael’s fiancee Dionne doesn’t have superpowers, she’s able to operate under the radar as she investigates disappearances.<br></p><p>We continue to see the devastating impact of Sickle Cell Disease as Michael’s mother experiences a crisis. He stays overnight at the Sickle Cell Center, then decides to tell Dionne the truth about the future and her possible murder, as he learned about it by visiting the future the first time he used his powers in the initial episode. He laments being unable to change the outcome of her death, even when given some of the information he might need to do so.. The disproportionate presence of Sickle Cell Disease in Black communities, the lack of support for patients and families struggling with this disease, and Michael’s perceived inability to change outcomes for both his mother and Dionne represents a large picture in the struggle of the Black communities represented in the show, and the greater human experience – it’s like always swimming against the current.<br></p><p>As we now know, the Sickle Cell gene is also related to the superpowers the characters have, exposing pain in a more chronic way, and bringing characters together to heal.<br></p><p>Investigating the disappearance of Jasmine, Dionne (Adelayo Adedayo) tracks down her parents. She learns that Jasmine’s father has Sickle Cell Disease, but Jasmine was able to heal his pain using her superpowers. Brought back together by Michael’s mother’s health crisis, Dionne and Michael get a chance to talk – but they’re interrupted by Rodney, who insists Michael leaves now.<br></p><p>This is hard to watch. Michael has been on a quest to be there for everyone, save everyone, and do the right thing, and he drops the ball. Instead of telling Rodney he needs to hold on a moment, Michael abandons Dionne, delaying off their big conversation.</p><h2 id="h106102"><a id=""></a><em>Supacell </em>and women characters</h2><p>This could have been an opportunity for Michael to be truthful, but instead he falls short, and for a weak reason.. In the beginning of the series, Michael was so easy to root for. But like many of the male characters, he treats women as an afterthought if not an object, and this makes it hard to believe he’s going to act with responsibility in the future–even though he can see the future himself. </p><p>My assumption is that his failure to warn Dionne or be honest with her will lead to her death, making her a plot point and another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenInRefrigerators&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenInRefrigerators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fridged female character</a></span> in superhero history, because having a motivational tragedy for Michael is more important than having him treat his fiancee with respect. I hope the show moves in a better direction, but it isn’t looking good in conjunction with Sharleen’s (Rayxia Ojo) abuse becoming her personality in addition to a plot point. Taze (Josh Tedeku), meanwhile, potentially murders a woman in broad daylight, leading him to be a less redeemable character by the minute.<br></p><p>Sharleen’s constant dive into danger overshadows Sabrina’s (Nadine Mills) good news. Here, however, it’s not careless writing buried in tropes, but it’s clearly meant to be an injustice that Sabrina’s career achievement is overshadowed by abuse and violence.<br></p><p>The male characters in the show are constantly examined, judged, and captured by systems in society. In truth, most of them don’t trust each other, which is why it takes so long for Michael and Rodney to get Andre (Eric Kofi Abrefa) to trust him and consider joining the team. And even then, Rodney only wants to help Michael because he thinks Michael can and will rewind time to help his injured friend. The overarching power structures intentionally damage the trust and the Black community. But it’s clear the women suffer most, and the men can’t break free of the cycle of both receiving and perpetuating unfairness.<br></p><p>Overall, this episode should have had more like pieces come together, but instead the storytelling was disjointed and it fell flat. Hopefully, the final episode packs more of a punch when it comes to connectedness, or permits Michael to use his powers to access the past in a way that changes the story and empowers all of the characters, including Dionne.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Five games in two years; 15 in five. That’s the type of output that independent studio Strange Scaffold has had. From action-packed titles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-el-paso-elsewhere-tells-a-special-story-while-being-a-game-you-didnt-know-you-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like El Paso, Elsewhere</a> to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V62f-PsKhyY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tense atmosphere of Clickolding</a>, Strange Scaffolding’s clear mission is to make games that players don’t necessarily know they want or need. Insider Gaming was able to sit down with creative director Xalavier Nelson Jr. for an exclusive interview to talk about Strange Scaffold and their new game I Am Your Beast.</p>

<h2 id="h-strange-scaffold-interview-with-xalavier-nelson-jr">Strange Scaffold Interview with Xalavier Nelson Jr.</h2>



<h3 id="h-where-is-the-time-coming-from-to-create-all-these-different-types-of-games">Where is the time coming from to create all these different types of games?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr:</strong><em><strong> </strong>It’s just different priorities.&nbsp;I remember when a game studio, even say from software would launch one, two, three&nbsp;games a year, Activision, if you look back 10 years back in, or even at this&nbsp;point, 20 years back to like 2004, Activision would publish something&nbsp;like 20, 30 games in a year.&nbsp;Now they update their live service games and they might have one or two.</em></p>



<p><em>And those changes in how we release and make games and the priorities we have&nbsp;along the way, a single game, partially because it keeps getting updated, has to&nbsp;generate more revenue, which means more microtransactions for players, which&nbsp;means more exploitative game loops that get you caught up in this being the one&nbsp;game you play, all those things have an impact on the developers, but very much&nbsp;also the player experience.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>When you change the process, you change the project and Strange Scaffold, we’re&nbsp;just trying to provide people with the next game they didn’t know they needed.&nbsp;And those priorities, those very player centric thing of, you didn’t know you&nbsp;needed a dark fantasy horror kidnapping sim. </em></p>



<p><em>So here it is.&nbsp;Here’s an open world comedy adventure game, entirely stock by stock photos&nbsp;that makes most of the people who play it cry.&nbsp;Here’s a game that brings back Max Payne, because we haven’t done that. No one, we’re bringing back the boomer shooter, which is great, but no one’s&nbsp;bringing back Max Payne, no one’s bringing back those classic third person&nbsp;shooters. We make games in a different way, which lets us explore games with&nbsp;different priorities and bring new things to the table.&nbsp;So Clickolding into I Am Your Beast is one of the clearest, I think, examples of&nbsp;when we release I Am Your Beast, we’ll have released 15 games in five years. </em></p>



<p><em>And it’s just because we want to make sure that players are seeing something new and&nbsp;exciting on a consistent basis.&nbsp;And even if it makes less money than a Fortnite, knowing that at this point,&nbsp;we’re one of a smaller group of people exploring that territory means that we&nbsp;kind of have to do it.&nbsp;Otherwise, the medium of art and experiences that I love becomes more and more like&nbsp;hash machines in digital form.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-how-do-you-come-up-with-the-different-premises-for-these-games">How do you come up with the different premises for these games?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>At this point, it’s mostly my brain, although something I really believe in is&nbsp;making sure that the way the game is developed allows a lot of other people to&nbsp;bring their voices into it to make it better than the sum of its parts.</em></p>



<p><em>A lot of the best pieces of El Paso elsewhere, because a level designer inspired&nbsp;by the vision and direction of the game did something weird or Romero Bonicaus in&nbsp;the primary programming design collaborator I had on the project said, hey, can we do&nbsp;this? That’s where the wall bounce came from.&nbsp;He was like, hey, I found a bug, but I want to keep it.&nbsp;Is this OK? And he jumped and he bounced off of a nearby wall because of a change we&nbsp;had made in the movement code. </em></p>



<p><em>So he had basically found a way to basically do a double jump with a with a combat&nbsp;dive, getting more air to take down enemies while you’re falling in slow motion.&nbsp;I said, no, that’s it.&nbsp;That’s it. That’s in.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>And that’s where I think auteurship, there’s a lot of discussion that’s happened&nbsp;around it in film and in games.&nbsp;I think that’s where auteurship can be at its best is when it can provide something&nbsp;so strong that it facilitates other people to do things. But yeah, the the the ideas do mainly come from my head.&nbsp;And a lot of it is saying both what is a thing that can be made?&nbsp;Yes, but also what makes it make sense, because a game like click holding, unless it&nbsp;has a very specific scope and efficiency of design, it doesn’t make sense to make&nbsp;it. No one is coming into twenty twenty four saying one of the sensational horror&nbsp;games of the summer is going to be the game where you click for a guy in a click&nbsp;chair</em>.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-creating-games-that-can-tell-a-story-or-accomplish-a-goal">Creating games that can tell a story or accomplish a goal?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>The idea that regardless of that specter, if it was haunting my&nbsp;nightmares, I wouldn’t make a game about that character or that world unless I also&nbsp;knew exactly what we were trying to accomplish with it and how it provided value to a&nbsp;player’s life.</em></p>



<p><em>I think it’s why strange scaffold stands out, because there’s people&nbsp;who make games very quickly.&nbsp;There’s people who make there’s a lot of people who make really high quality games.&nbsp;But the fact that we’re saying, hey, efficiency and quality are not opposing sides of&nbsp;the spectrum.</em></p>



<p><em>They are just one there.&nbsp;They can be taken as one way to facilitate making experience you never could&nbsp;otherwise. It’s something that means a space warlord organ shredding simulator gets made&nbsp;in the first place, because if you’re just looking for how to maximize profit or what’s&nbsp;selling right now, you don’t have the tools to find your players next favorite game,&nbsp;which is one of the interesting things about how our ultimate set of partnerships came&nbsp;about for that game was we had pitched Space Warlord to a lot of people and everyone&nbsp;either stalled the conversation or was just like, I’m not sure about this.</em></p>



<p><em>Then we did our own reveal trailer and because we were like, you know, we’re not going&nbsp;to. We’re not going to wait for the rest of the industry to catch up to us, we did it&nbsp;for Dog Airport game. We were talking about development from the beginning.</em></p>



<p><em>And so for Space Warlord, we tried to go dark and do things the right way.&nbsp;It didn’t do anything special.&nbsp;So we were like, screw it.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re going to we aren’t going to let the rest of the industry, especially since we&nbsp;can’t finish it under our own power.&nbsp;We’re going to let them determine whether or not this game gets made.&nbsp;And we put our own announcement trailer.</em></p>



<p><em>And suddenly all those people are writing back and we end up eventually on things like&nbsp;Game Pass, but only after we had kind of stepped out front and&nbsp;proved this is a game that deserves to get made.&nbsp;Oh, you feel weird about organs?&nbsp;Oh, no. How will players not like that?&nbsp;You have to show it to them in the first place.</em></p>



<p><em>We are as an industry in a place where people are terrified to even give players&nbsp;something to like, let alone dislike.&nbsp;Yeah. What if it’s not like Lethal Company?&nbsp;What if it’s not like Civilization?&nbsp;What if it’s not like Change Together or whatever is the current du jour of the&nbsp;industry? So, yeah, I give a lot of props to my fellow developers.</em></p>



<p><em>And I think there’s a lot of amazing work still being done in the medium.&nbsp;It is contrary to what some commentators might say.&nbsp;It’s not a hotbed of exploitation, even for projects with really messed up microtransaction models. There’s a lot of developers who love players who are doing&nbsp;good work on those projects and trying to do their little part to make experiences&nbsp;better. </em></p>



<p><em>But Strange Scaffold, we have managed to carve out a place for&nbsp;ourselves where we work so efficiently that the rest of the industry can’t tell&nbsp;us no. And I’m very thankful for that because we kind of ended up here by&nbsp;accident.</em></p>

<h3 id="h-what-was-the-inspiration-behind-i-am-your-beast">What was the inspiration behind I Am Your Beast?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>A lot of it was, again, kind of seeing gaps where the rest of the industry was either&nbsp;not following down a path or it’s determined that a path wasn’t worth following anymore.&nbsp;Like things like Max Payne and debt to rights in the Die Hard trilogy on PS1 for the real OGs out&nbsp;there.&nbsp;And for I Am Your Beast, it was looking at, OK, a lot of people are going into this tactical&nbsp;space, that kind of Tom Clancy early 2000s era Splinter Cell Ghost Recon space and satisfying&nbsp;the nostalgia there.</em></p>



<p><em>But that’s kind of where the conversation and the thought process stops.&nbsp;We have a lot of games that are emerging that are following down the same paths.&nbsp;And the paths are cool when they’re doing something unique for it and they’re satisfying&nbsp;players.</em></p>



<p><em>But there’s nothing new being explored there.&nbsp;They’re not saying, you loved Ghost Recon.&nbsp;Here’s what comes next.</em></p>



<p><em>And the idea of comic book Doom guy in a Tom Clancy setting, what happens when you have&nbsp;someone who can jump kick people so hard their heads explode when greeted with what would&nbsp;otherwise be a kind of po-faced military combat gameplay space.&nbsp;It was something that was deeply enticing, even going back to the efficiency of it all,&nbsp;saying, hey, if it’s all happening in a bit of an arctic tundra, then that means that we&nbsp;can reuse a lot of things because it’s all just covered in snow.&nbsp;You can reuse levels and level concepts and you can pull really interesting things about&nbsp;this.</em></p>



<p><em>We have a level that’s called Burning Crescent, which is basically a giant pit.&nbsp;And in the center is a sniper tower that’s overlooking you at a bunch of different points.&nbsp;And you’re bouncing around between points of cover while taking out enemies as quickly as&nbsp;possible.</em></p>



<p><em>And right before you hit the finish, there is a point where you can veer off and get a&nbsp;lower level time.&nbsp;But you can take out that gosh dang sniper who’s been harassing you for the entire level,&nbsp;even though it’s only been roughly 30 seconds.&nbsp;And that idea of very instant catharsis and pursuit.</em></p>



<p><em>And again, frenetic things applied to a tactical military setting that could very easily just&nbsp;be overdone or bland.&nbsp;That’s where we live.&nbsp;We don’t just make the game you’ve seen before.</em></p>



<p><em>We say, what can we provide inside of that same space?&nbsp;If we’re doing a Max Payne, if that’s noir, what does that look like when it’s neo-noir?&nbsp;What does it look like when we’re playing sick hip hop beats over you shooting a werewolf&nbsp;in slow motion?&nbsp;And we didn’t expect it to do as well as it did.&nbsp;We thought we knew we had made a good thing.&nbsp;But partially just out of realism, we never believe anything will be a hit before it happens.</em></p>



<p><em>So seeing the wildly enthusiastic response to it and knowing that you don’t get to an&nbsp;I Am Your Beast without throwing out a lot of stuff in the process and doing those games&nbsp;justice too.&nbsp;It’s just made us more confident in our approach of saying, hey, regardless of how well I Am&nbsp;Your Beast does, we’re not going to make it a slot machine three years from now.&nbsp;You know that within six to nine months, you’re going to have another strange scaffold game&nbsp;that’s going to give you another thing you didn’t know you needed.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-how-do-you-blend-chaotic-gameplay-with-a-compelling-story">How do you blend chaotic gameplay with a compelling story?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>I think something that we’ve lost consideration of in games is that we see quality&nbsp;as just like a linear trajectory.&nbsp;It’s just a straight arrow going up.&nbsp;If you have a cut scene and then you have four realistic characters in the cut scene&nbsp;and each little notch up, the game just gets better.</em></p>



<p><em>I think over time, we’ve lost or really never had the vocabulary to understand when you&nbsp;use different tools, you get to have a different impact.&nbsp;So El Paso, Elsewhere thrives because it has really cinematic cut scenes.&nbsp;We have over 40 minutes of fully voiced, fully animated, lush cut scenes that immerse you&nbsp;in this world and in this character.</em></p>



<p><em>And I Am Your Beast, we went with a kinetic text style for the cut scenes.&nbsp;So if you’ve ever seen a video on YouTube of either a comedic or dramatic thing where&nbsp;words are coming in and slamming into the screen and coming in different arrangements&nbsp;with different backgrounds.&nbsp;In traditional games industry terms, it’s like, oh, that’s a downgrade from El Paso&nbsp;Elsewhere’s cut scenes because you don’t have 3D characters in a space.</em></p>



<p><em>But because you don’t have visuals, you just have words and audio, your brain stays locked&nbsp;into the space of the previous level you’re in.&nbsp;You’re still angry.&nbsp;You’re still ready to fuck a dude up and you have nothing pulling you out of that flow&nbsp;visually until you go into the next level and you’re right in the middle of it.</em></p>



<p><em>You’re right back into it again.&nbsp;And the idea that every game, every single thing in a game is an opportunity to say,&nbsp;does this pull focus where it needs to be?&nbsp;Does this give the player a better experience?&nbsp;Does this give the player a space to either rest if rest is required or to get amplified&nbsp;if what you need to do is turn them up a notch?&nbsp;I think the lack of really intentional discussion and how those tools come to be and how we&nbsp;use them is part of why we’ve ended up right now in a time where we have the most expensive&nbsp;games that have ever been made.&nbsp;And people might not care about the entire thing.</em></p>



<p><em>They might only care about 10% of that thing.&nbsp;And the idea that you can have a game that costs $500 million and players care about&nbsp;5% of it because all of those tools are not angled towards a very specific purpose to&nbsp;do and say something and give the player something really specific.&nbsp;I think it just is a source of dissonance that I really want to see confronted because&nbsp;I want every game I play to hit me as hard as humanly possible in the way it’s trying&nbsp;to hit me.</em></p>



<p><em>And when we, as an industry, see the only things that determine quality to be, is it&nbsp;going up that bar of fidelity?&nbsp;Can you see the cloth move on a character’s body?&nbsp;Then we also lose the ability to even ask for the things that will give us a better&nbsp;experience.&nbsp;So every game at Strange Scaffold, we’re saying, where do we pull back on scope or fidelity&nbsp;because it makes the game better?&nbsp;Where do we put time and energy and sometimes weeks of focus to pull off something really&nbsp;special that gets the ability to be highlighted because it is the star of the experience?&nbsp;How difficult can that be to make sure that everything that you guys are building for&nbsp;a specific game stays on that trajectory to where everything matters?&nbsp;Obviously, there’s times where there’s something in a game, it doesn’t work.&nbsp;It has to go.</em></p>

<h3 id="h-how-do-you-figure-out-what-works-in-a-strange-scaffold-game">How do you figure out what works in a Strange Scaffold game?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr</strong>: <em>I think it is having, to a degree, the luxury as a team to say that we’re going to have a&nbsp;focus.&nbsp;It’s part of the reason why we’ve struggled so much with getting funding in the past is&nbsp;we come to, say, a publisher, and we say, hey, here’s the game, and here’s where it’s&nbsp;going to be focused.&nbsp;And here’s other pieces in the game that are important, and they’re all going to work&nbsp;towards this.</em></p>



<p><em>And in fact, because there’s less going towards them, we can make that focus brighter.&nbsp;But we aren’t going to kill ourselves to put money or time into a place where it isn’t&nbsp;going to directly benefit the player’s experience.&nbsp;Publishers get really leery of that perspective, of focus.</em></p>



<p><em>They see games not as a space of where you can give players something, but as a space&nbsp;to avoid something that will make a player angry.&nbsp;It’s like, oh, what if players are upset that you don’t see the characters in 3D who&nbsp;are talking?&nbsp;It’s like, well, what you get to instead have is an audio drama, which has an entirely&nbsp;different effect, which supports this and this and this.&nbsp;And they’re like, oh, but I don’t know.</em></p>



<p><em>So a lot of people passed on I Am Your Beast.&nbsp;Everyone, actually.&nbsp;And it was FrostyPop who looked at what we were doing there, and the game had actually&nbsp;been canceled twice internally.</em></p>



<p><em>The first time because we didn’t have the bandwidth we were focusing on other projects,&nbsp;and the second time because we needed to make sure the studio survived to ship El Paso&nbsp;elsewhere.&nbsp;It was FrostyPop who resurrected it and said, we know that you make games that matter,&nbsp;and games that make choices, and games that hit players.&nbsp;I think that this will make a splash.</em></p>



<p><em>So that game got to exist.&nbsp;But that type of focus, the type of focus that results in games like  Kunitsu-Gami recently,&nbsp;where it’s like, man, this is like a PS2 experience.&nbsp;It only has the budget in the places where the game needs it.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s wild that that’s the place where games exist in 2024.&nbsp;It’s kind of like the old era of games back in the Xbox 360 era, where people were shoving&nbsp;in multiplayer on every game because they were forced to.&nbsp;Even if it detracted from or pulled resources from the single player experience, and it&nbsp;wasn’t the intention of the project, and it resulted in a lot of dead servers.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re kind of there now, but specifically in the sense of, oh man, if you don’t have&nbsp;X or Y or Z, if you don’t have Steam trading cards ready at launch, then players won’t&nbsp;care.&nbsp;They won’t love the game.&nbsp;We question that assumption, and we’ve been very thankful to find players going with us&nbsp;on that journey.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-going-right-the-most-that-helps-with-the-growth-of-strange-scaffold">What is going right the most that helps with the growth of Strange Scaffold?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>I mean, I think there’s the grace of God, of course,&nbsp;but there’s also the fact that it was intentional.&nbsp;We apply game design to games&nbsp;and we’re really good as an industry&nbsp;at doing that at this point.&nbsp;We know that if you adjust a piece of even,&nbsp;say the color of a UI element,&nbsp;then it will change the player’s experience,&nbsp;but we just don’t apply that to production cycles.</em></p>



<p><em>So from the beginning, what I was telling people&nbsp;who even joined the studio or prospective publishers&nbsp;was Strange Scaffold doesn’t wanna sell people one game.&nbsp;We wanna sell them five.&nbsp;We wanna be presenting the type of artistic approach&nbsp;they can get behind,&nbsp;like their favorite director and musician,&nbsp;where even if you don’t love&nbsp;the latest Martin Scorsese film,&nbsp;you probably go and see it&nbsp;because it’s a Martin Scorsese film.</em></p>



<p><em>You wanna see what he has to say next.&nbsp;And in games, we don’t consider&nbsp;the individual voices of creators often&nbsp;to be worthy of that value and prioritization.&nbsp;We say, oh, it’s a new Kratos game,&nbsp;but we try to, in the process,&nbsp;even if we aren’t trying to,&nbsp;we somewhat say, it’s a new Kratos game,&nbsp;not the next game from this person&nbsp;and their creative perspective&nbsp;that you’ve already fallen in love with before.</em></p>



<p><em>So again, at Strange Scaffold,&nbsp;something we did very intentionally,&nbsp;our game design was,&nbsp;we’re going to give you more experiences.&nbsp;We’re gonna give you something that you care about.&nbsp;We’re going to, and we’re gonna do it quickly enough&nbsp;that even if you don’t like one individual game,&nbsp;the next game is around the corner.</em></p>



<p><em>So the Strange Scaffold collection now on Steam&nbsp;of like seven to eight video games&nbsp;that all have that perspective,&nbsp;every Steam sale, even outside of Steam sales,&nbsp;people find one game like Clickolding,&nbsp;which is three bucks,&nbsp;and they buy the $100 collection.&nbsp;And that’s in capitalism terms,&nbsp;that’s what keeps the studio afloat.&nbsp;And we built it that way.</em></p>



<p><em>And you can, and most people do,&nbsp;build your studio around blockbusters.&nbsp;Three years from now, five years from now,&nbsp;we’re gonna have the biggest game of all time.&nbsp;I don’t wanna do that, so I don’t.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-why-put-out-so-many-games-in-such-a-short-order">Why put out so many games in such a short order?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr:</strong> &nbsp;<em>It’s not so much driven by fear.&nbsp;It is more so driven by mortality,&nbsp;if we wanna get down to the core reasonings here.&nbsp;I am going to die one day.</em></p>



<p><em>And if I have a choice between making one perfect game,&nbsp;even though we know perfection does not exist,&nbsp;in this world at least,&nbsp;if I have the choice between spending 10 years&nbsp;making my magnum opus,&nbsp;or 10 years making 30 buck wild things&nbsp;that would never exist otherwise,&nbsp;I’d rather say that I’d rather do the second one.&nbsp;And there’s some people who would only rather do the first.&nbsp;And one of the things I tell people&nbsp;when they’re trying to start a studio,&nbsp;or when we’re talking about building a new project&nbsp;is know yourself.</em></p>



<p><em>I know because among other things,&nbsp;I worked on Hypnospace Outlaw.&nbsp;That was like a five, six year game.&nbsp;I was only on there for two and a half, three years of it,&nbsp;but it was still a rough time.</em></p>



<p><em>And we come sprinting to the finish line&nbsp;and we’re wiped out and exhausted.&nbsp;And we are at the total mercy of this one day&nbsp;will determine whether we get to keep making video games.&nbsp;How do the rest of our lives go?&nbsp;Right?&nbsp;And I was like, I don’t want to do that again.</em></p>



<p><em>It was so great to see the response to Hypnospace Outlaw&nbsp;that people did find value in what we had done.&nbsp;But one other flip of the coin&nbsp;and Hypnospace Outlaw is one of dozens,&nbsp;hundreds of stunning indie and double A and triple A games&nbsp;that just falls through the murk.&nbsp;So I don’t want to be at risk.</em></p>



<p><em>I want to provide for my family&nbsp;and I want to say more in the limited time&nbsp;that I have on this earth.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-favorite-feature-in-i-am-your-beast">Favorite feature in I Am Your Beast?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr:</strong><em> I really think the feature that I’m most excited about,&nbsp;I’m, the thing I geek out about&nbsp;when I play other games as well,&nbsp;and this even goes back to before I was a game developer,&nbsp;was when artistic quality and efficiency meet in the middle&nbsp;and two things work together to provide something&nbsp;that never could have resulted without either one.&nbsp;I love those kinetic text cut scenes so much&nbsp;because they’re the exact type of thing&nbsp;that this industry, as it currently exists,&nbsp;would say is not enough.</em></p>



<p><em>This doesn’t tell the story.&nbsp;This doesn’t tell the story well for players.&nbsp;This isn’t stylish.</em></p>



<p><em>This isn’t, whatever is the intention behind it,&nbsp;this is not up to par is the thing I have heard&nbsp;and the thing that I have seen this industry say&nbsp;to all sorts of similar solutions over time.&nbsp;And having the audience so joyously react to that,&nbsp;hearing from other game developers&nbsp;that when our, even before the Next Fest demo was playable,&nbsp;even though it was playable that day,&nbsp;but when the demo came out and when the trailer came out,&nbsp;I have been told by multiple developers now&nbsp;that they’ve taken this back to their publishers&nbsp;and said, hey, we want to,&nbsp;this is something people are really excited about.&nbsp;We want to use it to do our own take on this&nbsp;and that they’re getting approval to do more efficient&nbsp;takes on storytelling that work for their games.</em></p>



<p><em>That’s what brings my heart eternal joy.&nbsp; Not only do we get to make a really cool,&nbsp;very stylish thing, we were right,&nbsp;I’ll say I was right about that one,&nbsp;but that solution gives other developers the freedom to say,&nbsp;what actually makes the player’s experience better?&nbsp;In Ace Combat 7, it’s a JPEG of a dog.</em></p>



<p><em>We don’t have the time, budget,&nbsp;we can put that into more cool ass planes flying at Mach 10.&nbsp;So we put it, so we can just have a JPEG of a dog&nbsp;and it makes people happy.&nbsp;It looks wild as hell.</em></p>



<p><em>Giving other people the internal permission even to say,&nbsp;what makes the player’s experience better?&nbsp;That’s what makes my day&nbsp;and that’s what makes me excited about I Am At Peace&nbsp;because it’s filled with that.&nbsp;And I can’t wait for people to play it&nbsp;and to either have their day get made&nbsp;or to find a path for their own creativity&nbsp;in the things that we chose.</em></p>

			<p>As proudly individual as each game in the SteamWorld series is, sometimes you just want a good old fashioned sequel, a game that goes back over familiar ground and tries to make things bigger and better. With close to a decade since the original, it feels like high time that Thunderful return to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/21/steamworld-heist-review/">one of their most popular entries</a> with the side-scrolling turn-based action of SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uh7iOX-TCjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Where the first Heist was a space-faring jaunt in junky steampunk ships, SteamWorld Heist 2 throws you right into the midsts of a great ecological crisis threatening its watery world where boats and subs are the order of the day. Oh sure, it’s already just a fragment of a planet hurtling through space, but where now Steambots are struggling to find clean water, afflicting them with Rust, and there’s literally just one ship’s captain who’s got a hope of unpicking the mystery of what’s going on. Captain Leeway steps into the breach – no, not “Krakenbane” herself, but her son – or at least, he would do, but at the start of the game, he’s very much down on his luck, his inherited submarine having been confiscated and having lost his good arm for shooting.</p>


<p>So the game opens with an introductory mission with his last two trusty crew members embarking on an audacious mission to steal his submarine back, facing off against the Dieselbots of the Royal Navy to do so. This personal task successfully completed, and Captain Leeway is thrust into continuing his campaign against the Dieselbots, the mysteriously bony Rattlers, and trying to get to the bottom of what’s giving all the Steambots a nasty case of Rust – hint, it’s the salty water.</p>


<p>Just as before, SteamWorld Heist 2 is XCOM given the Flat Stanley treatment. Instead of commanding your handful of crew members through 3D spaces, you’ve got a side-on view of every combat location. It’s a nice and permissive kind of turn-based tactical battling though, letting you aim and shoot through the cover you’re hiding behind and past allies, through thinner gantry-like flooring, and using ricochets to hit enemies who are in cover themselves. And instead of aim being a percentage based roll of the dice, it’s more like Worms in that you have to line up your shot and then time it with the natural sway of the weapon – It helps greatly that one of your first characters is a sniper, which gives you a laser sight that even shows bullet bounces.</p>
<p>SteamWorld Heist 2 comes with a new Jobs system for classes, though, all dependent on which primary weapon is equipped. There’s no limitations to Job switching, and as soon as you’ve gained a level in one role, those skills can then be unlocked for another role by assigning Cogs. The Flanker and Brawler are easy to synergise, giving a melee character much enhanced movement, while you could turn your Sniper into a backline support with cover building and team healing abilities from the Engineer.</p>

<p>The deeper you get into the game, the more weapons and gear that you’ll earn, and there’s further avenues to upgrade your characters and roster as a whole. Higher levelled weapons will dish out more damage, and there’s also Epic weapons with special effects, like a sniper with electric discharge, or a crossbow for the Reaper instead of an SMG.</p>
<p>There’s some great nuances to explore here, especially as you need to make the very most of every advantage your get on higher difficulties, and there’s missions that will hew toward one style of play or another. Compared to the original, level layouts are now fixed, but with randomised cover and enemies, so you have much more repeatable experiences than the more broadly procedural levels of before. That leads to missions where, confronted with countless Rattler totems and a secondary objective not to destroy any of them yourself, you’ll need precision and minimal ricochets –&nbsp;it took me a few tries. And then there’s just stages that are designed for varying team sizes.</p>
<p>Another big area that SteamWorld Heist 2 improves upon is with everything between missions. Yes, there’s downtime at safe havens and bars, where you can rest up to get to the next day, shop for better gear and chat to NPCs –&nbsp;you’ll also get the luxurious vocal harmonies of the original songs by Steam Powered Giraffe stuck in your head – but then there’s the neat open world to sail around to get to each location, and enemy ships to battle.</p>

<p>The submarine is pretty weak to start off, but with weapon mounts to the side, front and top, as well as more unlockable slots for upgrades, it can become a pretty fierce little thing, capable of taking on enemy capital ships. That’s especially true because of how agile it is with responsive arcade handling, not to mention the upgrade to let you dive beneath the surface –&nbsp;where you’ll come to find other subs and mines. It’s a fun diversion between the sometimes gruelling battles.</p>
<p>By default, the game comes at you with the Experienced difficulty level, and through the opening regions, that’s pretty straightforward to handle. However, the Rattlers can really swarm you and levels often have enemy spawn points that make you scramble and rush just to survive –&nbsp;by the third or fourth region the difficulty had really stepped up a few notches. Thankfully the difficulty is customisable beyond the fistful of presets, and a checkpoint system mid-level lets you roll back up to two turns if you want to slap yourself for a dumb move or fluffed shot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/armor-games-publishing-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reports are emerging of staff at Armor Games' publishing division being laid off, and some staff are suggesting that the entire publishing department of the company has been let go.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/michelle_lega/status/1818708889627697485" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, senior producer Michelle Lega said yesterday that she had been laid off and that the studio's team <a href="https://x.com/michelle_lega/status/1818710369294336177" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would "all be looking for jobs soon"</a>, suggesting that nobody at Armor Games has kept their jobs in this latest layoff wave.</p>
<p>Several <a href="https://x.com/bearskvlls/status/1818722008739586413" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other</a> Armor Games <a href="https://x.com/kenzie__du/status/1818943712300609839" rel="noopener" target="_blank">employees</a> have corroborated the reports of layoffs, suggesting that at the very least, the studio has undergone a fairly severe "restructuring", as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures">Humble Games would likely call it</a>.</p>

<p>It's not exactly clear what's going to happen to Armor Games' published titles, which include the likes of cozy woodland management sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bear-and-breakfast"><em>Bear and Breakfast</em></a>, escape room adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tartarus-key-review"><em>The Tartarus Key</em></a>, and black-and-white RPG&nbsp;<em>In Stars and Time</em>, among others.</p>
<p>Assuming that Armor Games' publishing department has shut down, it wouldn't be the first indie studio to undergo mass layoffs in the last few months. There's the aforementioned Humble Games, of course, which has supposedly completely shut down, and other indie companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs"><em>Palia&nbsp;</em>developer Singularity 6</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs"><em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>studio Bossa</a> have also been hit by layoffs.</p>

            <p>Hardened battle royalists will remember Caldera, the sandy island map of bunkers and palm trees in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call Of Duty: Warzone</a>. It got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pour-one-out-for-call-of-duty-warzone-caldera-which-is-shutting-down-in-september">shut down last year</a> as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Open-source assets like Caldera play a vital role in the advancement of artificial intelligence," says <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-releases-call-of-duty-warzone-caldera-data-set">a post by Activision</a> accompanying the map files. "By providing a rich, diverse environment, we facilitate the training of AI models, enhancing the industry’s understanding of complex geometries and interactions. This can lead to more intelligent systems, paving the way for the next generation of gaming and simulation technologies." </p>
<p>It is easy to read this and assume it is Activision's way of saying: hey, level designers, your job is also unsafe. The data they're releasing also includes records of the paths players took across the island. That information is often critical to designers of these sorts of huge landmasses. </p>
<p>Whatever the company's motivation, it is certain to elicit mixed emotions in game development circles. Releasing something as open source is often viewed as a virtuous act in software development, since it has benefits that stretch beyond profit margins. But suggesting that your open source offering be used to train machinery that replaces paid human craft and artistry somewhat poisons that virtue. Activision don't seem to be bothered though.</p>
<p>"In an era where AI training and the evolution of authoring tools are pivotal, the availability of production-proven maps is crucial," they say. "This is about collaborating with the gaming and research community to build a foundation for responsible innovation and learning across the industry."</p>
<p>Maybe I'm worrying too much. Yes, we can probably assume Activision would like to further automate processes that involve humans, but it's not certain the data will be as useful to AI researchers as they might hope. For example, their enthusiasm comes at a moment when investors are starting to realise that maybe all those billions of dollars pumped into artificial intelligence <a href="https://futurism.com/investors-concerned-ai-making-money">won't see any profitable result</a>. "Despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful," said one Goldman Sach's analyst.</p>
<p>The map data for Caldera is <a href="https://github.com/Activision/caldera">available on Github</a>, and is designed to be opened and viewed with a tool called <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usdview/latest/quickstart.html">USDView</a>. Ignoring the AI-motivated stink, I do think it's cool for normal humans with some technical nouse to be able to fly around maps like this, drinking everything in with nostalgia. I've done the same thing to old Halo 2 maps and get a buzz from peeking around on browser-based toys like <a href="https://noclip.website/">noclip.website</a>, which let you explore maps from Dark Souls, Banjo-Kazooie, and Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Shooty sequel Warzone 2 is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">best battle royale games</a>, so it's likely someone out there will get the same curious joy from flying around Caldera.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2D action adventure RPG landed right as the Dark Souls series was making its mark but carved its own identity before the word "soulslike" was ever uttered. Creator and Heart Machine founder Alx Preston envisioned an ancient and ruinous world with a hero whose body is struggling under the weight of a disease </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-haunting-real-life-disease-that-inspired-i-hyper-light-drifter-i-">not unlike</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the one Preston lives with. But it's not strictly a world of body horror—its dungeons and overworld mix light and dark colors inspired by a 16-bit color palette.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game seemed so inseparable from that SNES-era-style aesthetic, so it was something of a surprise when Heart Machine revealed the existence of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/">Hyper Light Breaker</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a third-person roguelike that can be played solo or cooperatively, which is on its way to an Early Access release. What does it mean to translate an aesthetic from 2D to 3D, especially in the world of the Hyper Light series?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to art director Danny Moll and principal character artist John DeRiggi, it's all about carefully defining what made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Drifter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> such a striking game, then recreating those concepts with 3D techniques.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which ones? Have a look.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hyper Light Breaker"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span> doesn't need your fancy textures</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To understand the aesthetic of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you should take a quick look at Heart Machine's previous game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Solar Ash</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That game was the studio's jump from 2D into 3D, and taught the team a lot about how to create vibrant locales in beautiful locations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moll explained that studying </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Solar Ash </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">taught him what Preston valued in 3D art direction; impressionistic environments and character models with bold colors and very simple textures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you move into a 3D space, you start having to restrict data and details more intentionally," he said. That led to the team using Blender's "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/decimate.html">Decimate Modifier</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" and embracing "polygonal qualities" to create that game's aesthetic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Preston told Moll that he wanted to "slightly" increase the intricacy on objects so that if players got close, they'd see some detail. This creates a space where Heart Machine can bring over the worldbuilding style of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Drifter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with its ancient ruins of a high-tech civilization sitting in the middle of a "post-post apocalyptic" world. The former is an environment defined by rigid and "blocky" geometry, moody purples and reds, and runic symbols, while the latter has softer, pastoral vibes and colors of green, orange, and pink.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the character design side (and characters are very important here, since players will have the option to select one of several "Breakers"), DeRiggi explained that the team took inspiration from 2D cell-based animation like the kind used in classic TV shows. Here, the detailing was dedicated on elements like the Breakers' costuming and drapery—but still kept in check, to contrast with the highly-detailed PBR rendering used in higher-fidelity games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We really wanted to push on selling the 'lower-frequency' hero, [focusing] on elements of the characters that made them pop and reach from a distance," said DeRiggi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breaker </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">introduces another new challenge for Heart Machine: the live service-adjacent nature of Early Access. Shipping the game won't be a one-and-done process, it'll be evolving in response to player feedback and design shifts throughout the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How does the art team intend to handle that challenge? "Flow charts," Moll said. He described a "big" flow chart that maps out the design process—how designers or artists block out a level, iterate, then shift it to the art side, then what to do if the level needs more feedback, etc. etc.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the fun things about working on this kind of game is that there's an indefinite amount of variety that we can add, so we're always brainstorming new ideas and queuing things," he said. "Then when it comes to Early Access, we have our our plans about what we want to make, but we are also preparing to be flexible to player feedback."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He credited lead producer Michael Clark, who has experience on live service games, with building internal processes that could keep content flowing smoothly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another self-imposed limitation that helps this process, DeRiggi added, is that when it comes to the visual design of the Breakers, they're not designed to be visually customizable, a feature found in other live service or roguelike games. "It's a personal world for [Preston]. So he wasn't looking for there to be this whole wide range of customization across the the board of characters," he said.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That means he and his colleagues can focus on improving the looks of the revealed characters (mostly through small tweaks, as their designs are pretty much locked-in), and spin up new ones inspired by community feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combine those strategies with some "highly modular" environment kits, and the Hyper Light series is now ready to roll into a new era of game development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Heart Machine is a benchmark of how indie developers survive and thrive">Heart Machine is a benchmark of how indie developers survive and thrive</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through hard work and creativity, Preston and his peers have kept one of the most eye-catching indie studios of the 2010s alive even as the game industry struggles through financial crisis and COVID-19. Its continued success tells us a lot about how studios are making the jump through different eras of development.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Drifter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was one major beneficiary of the Kickstarter era before games began to struggle on that platform. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Solar Ash</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brought it into a partnership with Annapurna Interactive, a publisher that's brought indie games to bigger audiences through a mix of patience and film industry experience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-bounty-hunters-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tabletop market is full of <em>Star&nbsp;</em><span><em>Wars-</em>themed</span>&nbsp;games, some of them incredible representations of the setting. From roleplaying and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-deckbuilding-game-review-force-is-strong-with-this-one">card games</a> to the fantastic miniatures games by <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/star-wars-shatterpoint-first-impressions">Atomic Mass Games</a>,&nbsp;players can easily recreate epic <em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;battles. It's easy to throw the Star Wars name on a product, but harder to embed the theme in the mechanics and make it feel like a <em>Star Wars</em> game. In this article, we're going to look at the all-new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, a fast-paced card drafting game. Does it feel like a <em>Star Wars</em> game, or is it just a skin over the mechanics?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-3.jpg?itok=PpY-LiBb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-3.jpg?itok=OYlEEb7I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> features some of the most famous bounty hunters across the <em>Star Wars</em> Universe.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does Star Wars Bounty Hunters Play?</h2>
<p>In<i> Star Wars Bounty Hunters,</i> players draw a hand of 5 cards, choose one to play, and then pass the rest to the player on their left, and receive 4 cards from the player on their right, they then draw another card, play a card, and pass again. Play continues this way until 4 contracts are won, and then scores from across a range of areas are totaled up and the winner is declared.</p>
<p>The cards that drive the game are drawn from 4 different decks:</p>
<ul><li>Target - Target cards are the core of <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, they're made up of famous characters from across the <em>Star Wars</em> Universe, and they contain 3 different shield values that must be beaten to collect the bounty, and the points they earn if scored.</li>
<li>Bounty Hunters&nbsp;- Bounty Hunters can be played for free against contracts (and you can also play them without a contract to prepare for one) and they have attack values that are used to defeat the shields on Target cards. Bounty Hunters also contain a negative score, which is deducted&nbsp;from the contract points scored.</li>
<li>Contract - Contract cards contain combinations of Target cards that can earn you bonuses if scored together.</li>
<li>Jawa Market - This deck contains droids, who work similarly to Bounty Hunters (they just need to be paid for rather than being free to play), and Crates, which earn points at the end of the game, and bonus points for the player with the most crates.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-2.jpg?itok=EloEAjB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-2.jpg?itok=JybnECTx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> features 4 types of cards, from left to right Targets, Contracts, Bounty Hunters and Droids (from the Jawa Deck).</figcaption></figure><p>Each turn in <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> happens simultaneously, with players receiving their cards, drawing, and then playing. This format keeps games fast-flowing but can be stalled if players start to analyze every single option. The four decks create a weird dynamic that if you see a card you want in the hand already, you don't want to draw a possibly great card from the Jawa Market or Target Deck, and would rather load the hand with Bounty Hunter cards (which although are free to play, tend to be worse than droids because of the negative points they have) or contract cards (which generally aren't worth the extra effort of trying to score until later in the game). But then if you do fill the hand with duff cards, you will still get that hand back eventually when it passes back to you.</p>
<p>To get around this, we tried a few variations of the rules. Passing the cards face down and drawing before seeing, which is too random as to which deck to draw from, and if you shuffle all the cards into a single deck, it also creates too random an element to be enjoyable. We also tried shuffling the contract and target cards into a single deck, and the bounty hunters and Jawa deck into a single deck, which created an element of randomness, but also meant that you weren't deliberately stuffing the hand you passed to your opponent.</p>
<p>A better way to fix it would have been to make the contract cards more worthwhile, the extra couple of points they give you are rarely worth the effort, and buffing the Bounty Hunters slightly (the stars of the game's title) to balance them better against the droids which even though they cost to play, are usually equal to or better than the Bounty Hunters, but without the negative points modifier.</p>

<p>Other than the art on the cards, and the rough power across the cards (Boba Fett has great stats and Grogu earns you very high points for capturing the target), the theme is a skin across the mechanics. It could be anything and it would still work.</p>
<p>If you're really into <em>Star Wars</em>, then there's something to be said about using famous bounty hunters and droids to chase down the good guys of the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, but if you want some depth to your theme, then <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> is very light.</p>
<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Star Wars Bounty Hunters?</h2>
<p>The theme for <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> is just a skin over the mechanics, which could be forgiven if it was an incredible drafting game, but the balance between the 4 card types feels off, which then throws off the drafting element of it. This also complicates it for younger players, which the artwork looks like it's aimed at, as not understanding the complexities of the different card types and playing tactically, mean that it can be a frustrating game for younger players.</p>
<p>I can't help thinking that if it was a single deck, with each card having a few options for use, that would have worked better, but in its current state it just felt strange to play. In the test games we played, we usually ended up with hands full of cards you didn't want, and just alternating between burning a card for credits, and hoping to draw a droid the next turn.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Star Wars Bounty Hunters?</h2>
<p>If you really really love <em>Star Wars</em>, then you will be able to get behind <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, but for the rest, it's neither a great tactical drafting game, nor a quick fun-filled easy game, and treads a weird line between the 2 types, while not having the great bits of either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/steamworld-heist-ii-review-underwhelming-haul-o-loot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's hard not to appreciate what <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/thunderful-publishing">Thunderful</a> is doing with their ever-expanding <em>SteamWorld</em> franchise. Spanning across multiple genres are titles that take risks and try something new, all featuring a unique world full of robots running on steam. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, then, is just as charming and polished as the rest, but it didn't click with me as well as it should.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is a game made with people like me in mind -- I'm a <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/turn-based-tactics">turn-based tactics</a> fiend, but this genre thrives on variation, and that is something <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>doesn't do well. The experience is well-crafted, no doubt, but its gameplay does little to evolve over the course of its 25+ hour adventure.</p>
<p>Players take the role of Captain Leeway, a one-armed Steambot living in the shadow of his much more famous mother. He's trying to carve a legend for himself and solidify his place in this world of steam. Trading the sci-fi aesthetic of the first <em>SteamWorld Heist</em> for a pirate adventure, you'll sail the high seas and fight against other factions of bots along the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-guns.jpg?itok=0aYurGTF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-guns.jpg?itok=8K9lR-Ph 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remember to ricochet.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> -- A Unique Take on Strategy Games</h2>
<p>As they say, variety is the spice of life. Up front, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> certainly appears to have a great deal of customization and depth, even more so than its predecessor. There are several classes with unique abilities, plenty of gear, different crew members, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, the core gameplay is itself still as fun as the original. The side-scrolling nature of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> helps it stand out among other turn-based tactics games. Crew members are, for the most part, armed with guns and the gimmick of making bullets ricochet all around is entertaining. You can pull some seriously cool shots here, but that's also no different than the original game.</p>
<p>At first glance, it does come off as a bit of a palate swap, and I can't lie, I do miss the sci-fi, spaceship theme of the original. Even still, <em>SteamWorld Heist</em> <em>II </em>tries to mix things up by adding a variety of different sea-based environments and forts to capture. But again, try as Thunderful might to innovate, after several hours of gameplay, I felt like I saw everything the game had to offer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-units.jpg?itok=lHVDmV0f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-units.jpg?itok=aLcHg4So 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Six classes isn't a lot, and there aren't all that many abilities that stand out, either.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Certain Lack of Depth in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></h2>
<p>Classes have linear skill trees and you can even combine two or more classes together. Characters level up as they complete missions and advance the skill tree. You can allocate a resource called cogs to activate certain talents on the tree.</p>
<p>You theoretically have the ability to create a very diverse character, but I never felt like I was able to achieve that. XP gain was pretty slow, so at best I combined two classes together. Now, classes are dictated by weapon type, but even with mix-and-matched talents and weapons, characters didn't feel all that different.</p>
<p>For a loose comparison, other tactics games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fire-emblem-engage-review"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a> have dozens of classes, but in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, you're only dealing with a handful. You can only have so much variation and, though I admire the game's attempt to create a flexible class system, it just didn't resonate with me. Perhaps the best way to put it is an overall lack of depth in a game that would benefit from more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-boss.jpg?itok=RB3grrBx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-boss.jpg?itok=qvMz6Xzh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss battles are few and far between in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>While you can equip weapons that behave slightly different from one another, it's still not enough. Abilities specific to certain crew members, like this powerful beam called Eldritch Blast on one particular bot, is all well and good, but have longer cooldowns so you're using the same class-based abilities much more often.</p>
<p>There are several factions in the game, each a bit different from the other, but they are used in so many missions it all feels quite samey after a while. Level objectives, too, try to add unique criteria so you can get a better score and earn extra loot, but again, they don't vary all that much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat-2_0.jpg?itok=xrUB8z20 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat-2_0.jpg?itok=uFCEuRlo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Those skeletons are robots, I assure you.</figcaption></figure><h2>RNG and Alarms, Oh Boy</h2>
<p>Most of the time, you're tasked with collecting a set amount of loot before a time limit expires, or eliminate an enemy in a super specific way. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> does get tiring with these time limits, <em>especially</em> with alarms. After a bit, reinforcements are called by these alarms and, like the first game, they do <em>not</em> end.</p>
<p>Wave after wave of enemy is thrown at you during these alarms, and it can get chaotic very fast. Getting overwhelmed is a real possibility, and this exacerbates the feeling of repetition. There's no real nuance to throwing droves of endless enemies at you, especially when they all behave the same.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat.jpg?itok=3pm-1TG7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat.jpg?itok=l6sfgeJV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, point-blank is the way to go.</figcaption></figure><p>More to that point, these spawns from alarms are also completely RNG-based. You're able to go back two turns in a given level at any time. This is often used to rectify mistakes you make. What ends up happening is these spawns from alarms are totally different when you go back two turns. You can end up with way less enemies and even less powerful ones, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The problems I had with <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>'s depth are more a matter of taste, but RNG is a real issue here. It's really quite baffling to go from a turn spawning several beefy, powerful enemies, only to use the reload option (that you're encouraged to use, by the way) and end up fighting one puny enemy instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-naval-combat.jpg?itok=WCv2VeXV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-naval-combat.jpg?itok=b2QI85He 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>David versus Goliath.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Choice of Controls</h2>
<p>Other than that, the other glaring issue here is using mouse and keyboard versus controller. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>'s weird keybinding for actions and abilities on mouse and keyboard are rectified when using a controller. But, as you have to manually aim characters' guns, it is much more efficient and precise to use mouse.</p>
<p>As a result, I ended up incorporating this hybrid type of play, using my controller for most abilities except when I needed to aim. Missing a shot can be a big deal, so it behooves you to be as precise as possible to land those headshots and ricochet bullets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-submarine.jpg?itok=6bR2wLOM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-submarine.jpg?itok=-C82TXwY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what's in the depths of this sea?</figcaption></figure><p>I touched on this in my preview from Summer Game Fest, but there's also an overworld component through which you control and navigate your own ship. It's secondary to actual tactical combat with your bots, but it adds a bit more variety to break up the monotony. You can position your ship and it shoots weapons automatically, so it's not the most "active" form of gameplay.</p>
<p>It's decently fun to use the ship and later on, it becomes a submarine, though it hardly changes the gameplay much. It's the means by which you travel mission to mission, but by the end of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, I would have much preferred fast travel or something to make it less of a bother to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-dialogue-2.jpg?itok=DCNgsHqA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-dialogue-2.jpg?itok=DUyAKJH7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's alright, this robbery is for the people.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>My thoughts on the story are brief because I couldn't get hooked by the narrative. I didn't care for any of the characters or their motivations, which is a shame. It's not that it isn't well-written -- it is perfectly fine as is -- but it's not particularly interesting, either. There's humor here and there, but it didn't click. Though, if you are a fan of <em>SteamWorld</em> lore, I'm sure it'll tickle you fancy.</p>
<p>It actually hurts to be critical towards<em> SteamWorld Heist II,</em> as this is a clear labor of love. And it's not a bad game either -- not by a long shot -- it just has noticeable flaws that hindered it from being great. Though it feels far too long for its own good and lacks much nuance in its gameplay, <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>might just tickle your fancy.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Despite SteamWorld Heist II's shortcomings, it's a fun and polished game. It does, however, suffer from repetition and lack of depth, so it feels like you've seen all it has to offer after a few hours. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

By June 2022, the greenlight for the second season was confirmed. And we now know it’ll air December 26, 2024.</p><p>The next run is likely to focus more on the mysterious Front Man and his police officer brother, while digging into the background of the so-called “salesman character.” In 2022 we also learned that Lee Jung-jae would reprise his lead role, alongside Lee Byung-hun, Gong Yoo and Wi Ha-joon, with the addition of superstar Park Sung-hoon (<em>The Glory</em>, <em>Queen of Tears</em>) among others. Skip forward two rather quiet years, and now we finally have a teaser trailer!</p><p>The teaser shows contestants running down a competition-size running track, while observed by familiar <em>Squid Game</em> guards, as players fall to the ground (and knowing this show, are probably dead). Then, right at the end, it reveals there will be a third and final season in 2025.</p><p>I’m guessing, but I’d assume these would have to be being made back-to-back, given the <em>enormous</em> lead time on premium shows like these for streaming networks.

It’d also seem odd to strike sets between filming seasons, given the timeframe.</p><p>So, we only need to wait for Christmas to enjoy another round of gruesome capitalistic horror. And then the next day, season two of <em>Squid Game </em>will stream.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-for-pc-playstation-5-gets-esrb-rating/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40047/until-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB site</a>, the anticipated new version of Until Dawn coming PC and PlayStation 5 now has a rating and corresponding summary.</p>



<p>Naturally, the survival horror classic Until Dawn earned another M rating, since its gameplay always featured “depictions of intense violence and/or gore.” </p>



<p>The ESRB rating reinforces that Until Dawn’s new release is still on track. It may even arrive sooner than expected, though that’s only speculation.</p>



<p>PlayStation most recently teased the rebuilt version from Ballistic Moon during its latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a> in May 2024. The current release window for the game is Fall 2024, but it still doesn’t have a concrete release date.</p>

<p>Developer Supermassive Games released the original Until Dawn in 2015. The cinematic, narrative-driven horror game emphasizes player decisions. It also featured some Hollywood actors, such as Hayden Panettiere and Rami Malek.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, the rebuilt version of Until Dawn coming to PC will include Unreal Engine visuals and new content. </p>



<p>That includes “collectibles, all-new environments to investigate, and re-cut narrative sequences.” There will also be a third-person camera and other quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>In January 2024, PlayStation Productions and Screen Gems also confirmed that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn movie adaptation</a> is also in the works. David F. Sandberg, known for Annabelle: Creation and the DCEU’s Shazam films, is attached to direct.</p>

                <p>August has arrived, and this month, Prime Gaming members can grab an impressive number of PC games. As part of the Prime subscription service, these games will be made available in several weekly waves, and subscribers can look forward to some Steampunk robot adventures, archeological adventures with Lara Croft, and more. Once you claim the free games from Prime Gaming, they are yours to keep forever--even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and score some great freebies.</p><p>Available now, you can add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/steamworld-heist-review/1900-6416338/" data-ref-id="1900-6416338">SteamWorld Heist</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review/1900-6416497/" data-ref-id="1900-6416497">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>, and a few Tomb Raider games to your collection. SteamWorld Heist has a sequel out this month, so if you're looking to experience the original capers of a steam-driven pirate crew as they engage in tactical shootouts, then this game has you covered. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided isn't as good as 2010's Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but it's still a solid stealth-action game where you uncover a global conspiracy and make strange alliances. Since this is a GOG version of the game, you're getting it DRM-free version and with an extra in-game mission to enjoy.</p><p>The week closes out with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation/" data-ref-id="5000-280">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider-chronicles/" data-ref-id="5000-2857">Chronicles</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness/" data-ref-id="5000-3292">The Angel of Darkness</a>--old-school Lara Croft games that were released in the early- and mid-2000s. These were the final mainline games developed by Core Design, as publisher Eidos Interactive handed the franchise over to Crystal Dynamics following the poor critical reception of The Angel of Darkness.</p><p>Starting August 8, there are some more great games to grab. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/loop-hero-review/1900-6417656/" data-ref-id="1900-6417656">Loop Hero</a> is a complicated but engaging deckbuilding game and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/trek-to-yomi-review-one-samurai/1900-6417874/" data-ref-id="1900-6417874">Trek to Yomi</a> is a fascinating samurai tale.

You play as a traveling salesman making his way through an exceedingly strange town as you navigate a variety of platforming challenges.</p><hr><h2 id="h3294"><a id=""></a><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> - August 1</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows</p><p>There are bounties that need huntin’ in the Galaxy. In this remaster of the 2002 action-adventure game, you’ll play as legendary <em>Star Wars</em> bounty hunter Jango Fett in his quest to hunt down a notorious Jedi.</p><hr><h2 id="h3295"><a id=""></a><em>The Mortuary Assistant: Definitive Edition </em>- August 2</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows</p><p>Disappointed you didn’t get to realize your teenage fantasy of becoming a mortician? No worries, <em>Mortuary Assistant: Definitive Edition </em>lets you live out your dreams of cataloging dead bodies and, uh, surviving untold horrors like bodies rising from tables and creepy shadow girls crawling out of mirrors. They teach you all about such things in mortuary school, I’m told. </p><hr><h2 id="h3296"><a id=""></a><em>World of Goo 2</em> - August 2</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch, Windows, macOS, Linux</p><p>2008’s gooey puzzle game <em>World of Goo</em> is finally getting a sequel! Arriving on Switch, Windows, macOS, and Linux, the follow-up to the acclaimed puzzler was developed by the same team as the original. </p><hr><h2 id="h3297"><a id=""></a>Creatures of Ava - August 7</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, Windows</p><p>11 bit studios’ <em>Creatures of Ava</em> tasks you with preserving life on an alien planet in the face of a rampant infection that’s destroying the local ecosystem. If you’ve been looking for a game that challenges you with saving wildlife instead of ravaging it, it might be worth checking this one out when it arrives on August 7, 2024.</p><hr><h2 id="h3298"><a id=""></a><em>Cat Quest 3</em> - August 8</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows</p><p>The Purribean calls! It’s once again time to assume the role of the cutest little pirate ever when <em>Cat Quest 3</em> arrives on August 8.</p><hr><h2 id="h3299"><a id=""></a><em>Steamworld Heist 2</em> - August 8</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows </p><p><em>Steamworld Heist 2</em> is a side-scrolling, turn-based strategy game in which you’re tasked with lining up the perfect shot on your foes both directly and via clever ricochet trick shots. It’s also got a whole “what if pirates but robots” vibe going on that’s pretty neat-looking.</p><hr><h2 id="h3300"><a id=""></a><em>The Crush House </em>- August 9</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Windows</p><p><em>The Crush House</em> has you producing a 1990s-style reality TV show. You’ll have to film couples doing all manner of…well, interesting if not disturbing things, like saying they wish someone could “glue our mouths together in our sleep.” This one certainly seems a little odd. Hopefully in a good way though? </p><hr><h2 id="h3301"><a id=""></a><em>Sam &amp; Max: The Devil’s Playhouse (Remastered) </em>- August 14</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Windows</p><p>If the sight of Sam and Max doesn’t fill you with joy…maybe you should get a new therapist. The loveable duo of freelance police return in a remaster of <em>The Devil’s Playhouse</em> available for PS5 and Windows.</p><hr><h2 id="h3302"><a id=""></a><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> - August 20</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows</p><p>How is <em>Black Myth</em> not out yet? Originally revealed in 2020, this action role-playing game looks set to deliver visceral combat against wild-looking (and sometimes gross) enemies.</p><hr><h2 id="h3303"><a id=""></a><em>Dustborn</em> - August 20</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows</p><p><em>Dustborn</em> imagines what it’s like to try and traverse against a dangerous landscape corrupted by erroneous misinformation that’s tearing people apart. A narrative-heavy single-player experience, characters fight by using literal words as their weapons in an effort to survive the brutal landscape of an alternate-history America.</p><hr><h2 id="h3304"><a id=""></a><em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em> - August 22</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Windows</p><p>One of the longest-running and most celebrated MMOs of all time grows larger still with <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>. This latest expansion kicks off a new narrative arc as the first of a trilogy of expansions. It arrives on August 22, 2024.</p><hr><h2 id="h3305"><a id=""></a><em>Concord</em> - August 23</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Windows</p><p><em>Concord</em> is a competitive hero shooter launching on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23. Neat!</p><hr><h2 id="h3306"><a id=""></a><em>Gundam Breaker 4 </em>- August 28</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Switch, Windows</p><p>Arriving on August 29, <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> lets you fight with and spec out your own Gunpla starting from more than 250 base kits, with the opportunity to mix and match parts across different models.</p><hr><h2 id="h3307"><a id=""></a><em>Visions of Mana</em> - August 29</h2><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows</p><p>Arriving on August 29, 2024, <em>Visions of Mana</em> is a gorgeous-looking action RPG and a brand new chapter in the beloved <em>Mana</em> series.

			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday reveals the PC games that will join NVIDIA's cloud streaming platform throughout August. Chief among them is, of course, Star Wars Outlaws. It's not much of a surprise, given that Ubisoft has supported GeForce NOW for years, but it's still great to get official confirmation.</p>
<p>GFN subscribers at the Ultimate tier will be able to take advantage of all the NVIDIA features implemented in the game, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction) and ray-traced effects such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Direct Illumination</a> and RTGI (Global Illumination). Ubisoft Massive has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the official PC system requirements for Star Wars Outlaws, which are predictably rather heavy, making GeForce NOW an enticing prospect.</p>
<p>The other big August release on NVIDIA's cloud streaming platform is Visions of Mana, the action RPG due later this month. You can already check out a free <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-demo-out-now-on-pc-playstation-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a> (although not via GFN).</p>

<p>As spotted by fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/">via Red</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">d</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/">it</a>, the updated <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-cabuco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn page</a> for veteran art director Daniel Cabuco reveals that Obsidian is apparently working on another unannounced title.</p>



<p>Cabuco’s profile now lists their new position as “Art Director on unannounced title” at Obsidian, dated for July 2024. However, there were no further details about the nature of the project itself.</p>



<p>Developer Obsidian previously worked on titles such as Fallout: New Vegas, Pentiment, Grounded, and the Outer Worlds series. The developer is also working on Avowed, expected later this year.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>







<p>Fans speculate that Obsidian’s unannounced title might be a sequel to Fallout: New Vegas, since that would be a timely project.</p>



<p>In Microsoft’s latest financial report, CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-impact-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed the impact</a> of Amazon’s live-action Fallout series. Just last month, creatives on the show mentioned that season 2 appears to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-reportedly-ahead-of-schedule-wont-have-anthology-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ahead of schedule</a> already.</p>



<p>However, many of Obsidian’s titles perform very well, so other IP could be sensible too. Pentiment still has a 7.5 user score on Metacritic, and it’s getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pentiment-physical-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical release soon</a>.</p>



<p>In June 2024, Obsidian Entertainment also offered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-deep-dive-video-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive showcase</a> for Avowed. Fans expect Avowed to launch on November 12, 2024. </p>



<p>At this time, Obsidian did not officially confirm anything about Cabuco’s role or the title they are apparently working on.</p>

And with Skyrim turning 13 years old this November, it’s safe to say that Elder Scrolls fans have endured – and will continue to endure – a long wait for Bethesda’s next fantasy RPG. But while the famed single-player studio has been focusing its efforts on nuclear wastelands and outer space, the beloved world of Tamriel hasn’t been neglected. The Elder Scrolls Online, once much-maligned and suffering sinking player counts, is now celebrating its tenth anniversary and the launch of its eighth major expansion. And while it may be an MMO by genre, by design it’s much closer to the classic Elder Scrolls RPG format than you might expect. If you’ve spent a decade desperately searching for more stories from Tamriel, then you need look no further than Elder Scrolls Online’s ongoing saga. </p><p>Rich Lambert, game director at ZeniMax Online Studios, explains that the Elder Scrolls Online team made a “big design call to move into a more Skyrim-adjacent lane” several years ago. When TESO first launched, it was derided by many for feeling like a traditional MMO (level grind and all) wearing Elder Scrolls pajamas. Nowadays, the developers don’t even consider the game to fit the ‘MMORPG’ label.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We decided that this was going to be more of an Elder Scrolls game and focus on Elder Scrolls things first, and be multiplayer second,” Lambert says. “Once we did that it started informing lots of things.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Lambert sees the core appeal of The Elder Scrolls Online as being one and the same as Skyrim and Oblivion: “One of our core pillars is freedom of exploration and freedom to be and live in the world,” he says. “That traditional Elder Scrolls feeling where you see something in the distance, you can just run to it and explore it.” </p><p>The game as it stands now straddles the divide between single-player and online RPG design, offering all the elements you’d expect of a mainline Elder Scrolls game (including a world that permanently changes based on your story decisions, via some smart instancing), but it took a couple of years to get there. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We decided to focus on Elder Scrolls things first, and be multiplayer second. Once we did that it started informing lots of things.</p></div><p>Lambert notes that 2015’s Orsinium DLC saw the game’s storytelling “shift away from traditional MMO style to a more Elder Scrolls narrative style, focused more on the character, their beliefs and how they experience the world.” Later, in early 2016, some more traditional Elder Scrolls elements were introduced, such as Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood quest-lines, which encouraged stealing from or assassinating NPCs in the shared world. But it wasn’t until late 2016 that the game truly turned itself around.</p><p>The One Tamriel update was the turning point for TESO, removing traditional level-based progression in favor of scaling player’s stats to match whatever region you’re in. Outside of dungeon matchmaking being unlocked gradually as you level up to ensure total newbies don’t frustrate more experienced players, there’s nothing stopping a new player from immediately skipping out on the main story and running straight into an ‘endgame’ dungeon. With a decent party, you might even win. Finally, you could treat the game like Skyrim, albeit with a shared world and dungeons geared for co-op.</p><p>As such, the much memed wait for a new Elder Scrolls game needn’t be as long and torturous as the seemingly endless journey towards Todd Howard’s next project. The sixth Elder Scrolls is (sort of) already here. Many fans are turning to TESO over replaying Skyrim yet again, partly because of that re-tooled gameplay, but also because of how much of the world’s previously-underexplored lore is elaborated on here. Each major expansion and piece of DLC brings a set of new environments, and the game has been around long enough to fill in many of the blanks of The Elder Scrolls’ world map. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/teso-elsweyr-1722346356441.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>TESO's Elsweyr expansion took us to the Khajiit homelands, a place never visisted by the single-player Elder Scrolls RPGs.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“We’ve taken places that are only vaguely touched on [in the mainline RPG series], like the Sister’s Isles, and turned them into our High Isle release from a couple years ago,” explains Bill Slavicsek, TESO’s narrative director. “All we knew about that was a couple dots on the map and a mention in a book, and we turned that into a whole chapter and DLC. Any place on the map you can think of, we wanna go there. And if it’s not on the map, we want to make it”.</p><p>It feels like The Elder Scrolls Online is well on track to fill out the complete world map. There’s more filled-in regions than empty space now, plus an assortment of interesting new extraplanar locations to dimension-hop around in. While the Morrowind expansion helped bring in nostalgic fans wanting to explore its strange volcanic environment and insect-and-fungus based ecosystem, the Elder Scrolls lore buffs were best served by the Elsweyr expansion, finally taking a deep dive into the much-mentioned but never-seen lands of the feline Khajiit.</p><p>Not only did Elsweyr give us our first real look at its lush savannas and a wider range of Khajiit body types (thanks to lunar magic, they can be born as anything from nearly human to literal talking housecats), but it was an opportunity for ZeniMax Online Studios to carve out its own corner of the lore. Despite the accepted text being that dragons had been unseen for millennia and only returned with the launch of Skyrim, TESO had them make an appearance during the Elsweyr chapter (set a thousand years before Skyrim). Such an event did, admittedly, require some narrative sleight-of-hand to explain why nobody cares to mention it all during later in-universe eras. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Any place on the map you can think of, we wanna go there. And if it’s not on the map, we want to make it.</p></div><p>“We take reference from a lot of different sources, internal and external,” explains TESO’s loremaster, Michael Zenke. “A lot of the stuff we do though isn’t in the lore bible because it’s new. Every release we’re adding to the canon. We’ve got a great tradition of unreliable narrators in the Elder Scrolls franchise, so unless you or your player character saw something in-game, ‘that’s just someone’s opinion, man’. So we have a lot of freedom to do interesting stuff.”</p><p>While armed with a reliable trick to handwave events that might throw later lore into chaos, ZeniMax’s writing team has grown ever bolder over time. It has been so many years since Skyrim (and likely several more until The Elder Scrolls 6 surfaces), effectively making TESO the one and only Elder Scrolls game of this generation. That, plus Todd Howard confirming that everything in TESO is canon, has allowed the team to expand into wholly new territories, like Fargrave, introduced in the Deadlands DLC. Fargrave is a ‘princeless’ plane of Oblivion, unaffiliated with any of the Daedric gods. A neutral border-world floating in the void, and a wholly new location that let the team cut loose in terms of both writing and environment design.</p><p>If this sounds like something a new player might want to jump straight into, then there’s nothing stopping you. Each of the major ‘Chapter’ expansions are designed to function as a self-contained adventure, letting players tackle story arcs as and when they see fit. The structure is yet another element of classic Elder Scrolls design that sets the game apart from its online peers. While the game has long-since dropped its mandatory subscription, the optional ‘ESO Plus’ subscription gives players access to all the minor DLC and most of the expansions to date, making it an especially easy game to pick up play.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/teso-companions-1722346931418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Companions system allows players to adventure through Tamriel with a party of NPCs.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Another aspect that has lowered the barrier to entry and further aligned TESO with its single-player siblings is the Companions system. Six customizable NPC partners (with another two due to be released soon) can be recruited to join you on your adventures, albeit one at a time. They were introduced to the game with the Blackwood expansion in 2021, but have become a ubiquitous sight, as they allow solo players to enjoy the game’s wider content more easily. Parties can also be a mixture of players and Companions, allowing tiny groups (just two, in many cases) to tackle some of the bigger, tougher dungeons and open-world challenge bosses with relative ease. Plus, the companions’ constant combat barks and interjections on what they see around them makes the world feel a little less lonely for those wanting to treat TESO as a single-player game. If you’ve fond memories of scaling mountains with Teldryn Sero or Aela the Huntress in Skyrim, Companions echoes that experience. </p><p>Obviously these systems have their limits, though. Player housing is instanced, set apart from the overworld, and there’s no chance of breaking the game over your knee with mods or console commands, but the core Elder Scrolls experience is replicated surprisingly well, right down to many quests having multiple possible endings. Your final decisions may not have world-shakingly obvious impact, but they often result in the death or a change of state for an NPC that will remain in their quest location, a reminder of your decisions for that character. Play long enough and complete enough quest arcs and the world will start to feel like you’ve made a real impact in it, so long as you go back to revisit some old haunts.</p><p>Now months into the game’s year-long anniversary celebrations, the future's looking bright for The Elder Scrolls Online. The team seems confident that if TESO keeps it up for another decade, it might well encompass the entire Elder Scrolls world (and yet more locations beyond) by the time the 20th anniversary begins. In the meantime, Lambert mentions that there are plans to improve the experience for new or returning players. “As a new player, or someone coming back after a year, it can be overwhelming,” he admits. “So we’re working on some systems to make that kind of experience better. Not necessarily hand-holdy, but more informational”. Beyond that, some big changes (details of which he refuses to divulge) are coming to player housing, and further refinements to the game’s balance to keep the meta in check.</p><p>I once wrote off The Elder Scrolls Online as a half-hearted cash-in. Now, it’s a game I’ve been playing on and off for around five years now, dipping back into and thoroughly enjoying when that Elder Scrolls itch needs scratching. While the incredible community keeps Skyrim alive through mods, that’s a very different experience to exploring brand new, official stories and regions of Tamriel. TESO may not be The Elder Scrolls 6, but it’s a continuing Elder Scrolls game that’s successfully shifted and changed to reflect the wants of a fanbase that grew up on acclaimed single-player RPGs. And that’s a fine place to be for a ten-year-old online game.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Elder Scrolls: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here's the entire Elder Scrolls series in one easy-to-track playlist, including major DLC chapters and rereleases. </p></div><p><em>The product of a wasted youth, wasted prime and getting into wasted middle age, Dominic Tarason is a freelance writer, occasional indie PR guy and professional techno-hermit seen in many strange corners of the internet and seldom in reality.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>'s upcoming addition of Dynamax mechanics has been something of an open secret - and now we're able to see how some elements will look in-game for the first time. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of Pokémon Go have peered inside the popular mobile game's files to find visual elements of the upcoming Dynamax system, which also offer clues as to how Dynamax Pokémon will be obtained. 
</p>
<p>
For the first time since Pokémon Go's launch all the way back in 2016, new locations look set to appear on the game's overworld map - currently labelled as "stations". These gym-like structures look like they'll host raids for Dynamax Pokémon.

<p>
A list of Dynamax moves has also been discovered, set to be added to Dynamax Pokémon, such as "Max Flare", "Max Knuckle", and "Max Ooze".

<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-looks-set-to-add-gen-8s-dynamax-mechanic">Pokémon Go developer Niantic signalled that it would add Gen 8's game-changing Dynamax mechanic</a> in the not-too-distant future.
</p>
<p>
This year's anniversary artwork for the game, which frequently hints at upcoming (and sometimes far-off) features shows a Dynamaxed Wartortle alongside the eight generation's trio of Starter Pokémon: Grooky, Scorbunny and Sobble.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go fans have been waiting patiently for the arrival of most Gen 8 Pokémon into the game, after the Sword and Shield generation was largely skipped over to focus on the timelier Gen 9.
</p>
<p>
"We've definitely been thinking a lot about Gen 8 for a while in Pokémon Go," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Pokémon Go director Michael Steranka told me</a> last month. "Nothing to share right now in terms of the timing or launch strategy there, but something we're always trying to do is play homage to the source material and do right by that source material.
</p>
<p>
"Know that as the team is thinking about Gen 8 Pokémon, they're thinking about Galar, they're thinking about what makes those Pokémon special, and when it's time for them to make their debut in Pokémon Go, it will make sense."

You can currently re-subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online and get an extra two months' worth of membership time for free. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo announced the offer today as a feature of its new Mega Multiplayer Festival, which runs from now until 8th September.
</p>
<p>
Purchase a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership option during this period from the eShop or My Nintendo Store and you'll be credited with 14 months of membership time.

<p>
The coming month will see other bonuses, including additional Gold Points available via the eShop and My Nintendo Store on game purchases made between 5th August at 9am UK time to 18th August. 
</p>
<p>
Additional Switch game trials of four full multiplayer titles will be available from 19th to 25th August, meanwhile - though the identity of these games will be announced at a later date.
</p>
<p>
After that, the Mega Multiplayer game sale will run from 26th August to 8th September, in case you liked any of the titles available for trial and want to pick them up at a discount. 
</p>
<p>
The next month is a quiet period for Nintendo, and it's currently a transitional time for the company in general as it gears up to announce <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> at some point before 1st April 2025.
</p>
<p>
There's still several Switch 1 games still to go, however - most notably including The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (26th September), Super Mario Party Jamboree (17th October), Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership (7th November), and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (16th January 2025).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lazlow-jones-reveals-the-phone-call-that-left-him-both-excited-and-scared-to-death-while-working-on-grand-theft-auto-at-rockstar<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Lazlow Jones, the host of the Chatterbox FM radio station in 2001’s seminal <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-iii">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>, has many stories to tell about his 19-year stretch at Rockstar. But this one is right up there with the very best.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/from-gta-to-the-internet-of-things-what-lazlow-jones-did-next">Speaking to IGN</a> as part of an interview discussing new development studio Absurd Ventures, which he co-founded with fellow Rockstar legend Dan Houser in 2020, Jones recalled the "weird moment" when one GTA fan took the blockbuster video game a little <em>too</em> seriously.</p><p>GTA fans will know <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/Epsilon">the Epsilon Program</a> well. It’s a religious cult whose followers are known as Epsilonists. In trademark Rockstar fashion, Houser and Jones designed the Epsilon Program to satirize the likes of Scientology, complete with a modern day messiah fronting a behind-the-scenes pyramid scheme.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/tep1-1722373813351.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Rockstar created a fake Epsilon Program website to market <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas">San Andreas</a> back in 2004, and it was in that game that the virtual religion made its debut as a cult founded by a con-man called Cris Formage. Lazlow Jones even interviews him on his in-game radio show.</p><p>Rockstar went on to add more and more to the Epsilon Program over the years, fleshing it out with the release of each GTA game. The Epsilon Program always was an on the nose satire, and, for most people, a clear parody. But not for <em>everyone</em>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We're dying to know more.</p></div><p>During the development of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, Jones received a disturbing phone call from a 'fan.' They had left a message on his work phone. Taking the call, Jones heard a woman introduce herself as representing the followers of the Epsilon Program. These were GTA players who had gone through all the games in the series looking for morsels of new information on the religion, and had formed a real-life group.</p><p>“We're dying to know more,” she said.</p><p>Was this person just an over-enthusiastic fan who wanted to know more about the Epsilon Program as part of a cool community Easter egg hunt? Apparently not.</p><p>“She was essentially saying that they were worshipers of this fake religion that we had come up with,” Lazlow Jones told IGN.</p><p>Jones headed straight into Dan Houser’s office in Rockstar’s New York headquarters to tell him about “this crazy voicemail I got.”</p><p>“My second thought was, we should actually just come up with a fake religion and get really, really rich on the backs of people searching for meaning in life!” he joked.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Jones and Houser weren’t put off by the mystery caller, though. They doubled down on the Epsilon Program for GTA 5, creating various missions and cutscenes that revolved around the fake religion. They even wrote a bible called <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/Epsilon_Tracts">the Epsilon Tract</a> and split it up into pieces that were scattered across the game world for players to find.</p><p>It’s hard to believe that GTA’s Epsilon Program actually fooled someone in real-life into thinking it was a real religion. Perhaps Jones got the wrong end of the stick from the phone call? Not so, he insisted.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It excited me and scared me to death simultaneously.</p></div><p>“She genuinely sounded like she was a follower of the Epsilon Program,” he said. “It's crazy when you make a satire of something... because we were very straightforward about it. We created a website for the Epsilon Program back in 2004, and all the copy on that, it's in my mind very clear that it's a money-grab, modern day fictional religion. But they sounded like proper followers of it. It excited me and scared me to death simultaneously.”</p><p>In disbelief at what Lazlow Jones had told me, I had a hunt around online to see if this was an isolated incident, or whether there was evidence that others believed GTA’s fake religion to be real. There are a few joke posts here and there from people pretending to be an Epsilonist, but there is little to suggest a widespread movement, at least in 2024.</p><p>Still, according to Lazlow Jones, real-life believers did once exist, and somehow managed to find his work phone number.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/from-gta-to-the-internet-of-things-what-lazlow-jones-did-next">IGN's interview in full with Lazlow Jones</a>, where he talks about audio series A Better Paradise and his new company, Absurd Ventures.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
