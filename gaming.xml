            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-local-legends-review-legendary-bar-stories<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For many TTRPG groups, the campaign opens with the phrase, “you all meet at a tavern.” It's a quick and easy way to establish tone and group dynamics while introducing players to low-stakes challenges. It's a cliché that is at the heart of <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em>. A series of products all about helping bring personality and style to various fantasy watering holes.</p>
<h2>What is in <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em>?</h2>
<p><em>Epic Encounter: Local Legends</em> is a spin-off product of Steamforged Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/epic-encounters-preview" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Epic Encounters</em></a> boxes. It is made up of two different sets, which use the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> Fifth Edition</em> ruleset.&nbsp; The main set is the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit. It contains three books detailing ten different fantasy taverns, 60 unique NPCs that make up both staff and clientele, ten tavern maps, ten playmats, and a deck of cards printed with quick references. The second set is the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Encounter boxes. These contain miniatures, stat blocks, and battle maps for encounters hinted at in the Tavern Kit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-kit-contents.jpg?itok=8Ae1AsvH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-kit-contents.jpg?itok=isqUuQ0U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GMs, the heavy lifting has been done for you.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Helpful is the GM material in the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit?</h2>
<p>When starting a fantasy TTRPG campaign, a tavern does a lot of atmospheric heavy lifting. It covers many important world-building details and can set the tone of an entire campaign. Are the patrons friendly or defensive? Is the atmosphere rustic, austere, luxurious, or seedy? What happens when patrons get rowdy?</p>
<p>For veteran players, these details can be taken for granted. After a while, cultural shorthand is developed and everyone at the table locks in. But for new players, making a compelling tavern experience can be bland and forgettable at best, or non-existent at worst.</p>
<p>The ten different establishments in the Tavern Kit do a fantastic job covering its bases. Warm, rural inns packed with ale, pipe smoke, and hearty stew. Shady suburban retreats where clients come to coordinate heists and fence stolen goods that also happen to serve excellent bread. Dens of vice packed with well-dressed temptations of flesh and chemical escapes. Bloodstained fight pits where patrons drink, fight, and place bets. The list goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-descriptions.jpg?itok=5KsNsqAE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-descriptions.jpg?itok=twaYh3Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sensory info helps set a scene at a table. And each tavern sets the scene masterfully.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, people provide personality to a place. Every tavern has six NPCs with distinct personalities and attitudes.&nbsp; Each entry also has rewards and punishments for conversing with them alongside modifiers to the persuasion DC. These aren't background extras, but they don't completely overshadow the players' antics; a perfect balancing act for a TTRPG supporting cast.</p>
<p>My favorite inclusion in the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit are various games that can be played at each tavern. Generally, the games are light variations on parlor games – one is effectively <em>Blackjack </em>with dice rolls. They work great for establishing a theme and give players something to spend their gold on.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Tavern Kit's Inncounters Book gives GMs the tools to set up conflict at these establishments. They include dealing with drunken patrons up to getting into a bar brawl. The rules presented lean more into light cinematic presentation than tactical play, swinging on chandeliers, setting things on fire, a giant bruiser showing up, etc., which keeps things light and breezy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-golden-griffon-club-menu-screenshot.jpg?itok=3QGUSfgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-golden-griffon-club-menu-screenshot.jpg?itok=GLR-GHbw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm already excited/terrified of how players will abuse these details.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Challenging are the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Encounters Boxes?</h2>
<p>Generally, the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Encounter boxes provide small, compact battles. Each encounter has about 4-5 miniatures and one battle map. In addition, the contained booklet includes adventure hooks and modifiers to keep things exciting.</p>
<p>On their own, these encounter boxes are packed with variety and delight. With the Tavern Kit, they become a wonderful jumping-off point for a new TTRPG campaign.</p>
<p>Because of this, expressing the quality of all eight boxes in the set in a single review is a major task. Thankfully fellow dice goblin,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/author/giaco-furino">Giaco Furino</a>, and I delved into that dungeon together as a team. Here are our thoughts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-owlbear-miniatures.jpg?itok=rcrGcZ_p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-owlbear-miniatures.jpg?itok=vmH8wYLs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>An Owlbear Was Sighted... Setting Traps?</h2>
<p><em>From Tyler:</em> Those who watched the <em>D&amp;D</em> movie,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em></a>,&nbsp;know just how powerful Owlbears can be and according to whispers in the Nodding Dragon tavern, one is actively hunting and terrorizing local hunters.</p>
<p>This is curious since Owlbears generally aren't intelligent. But this one has dug traps, set up ambushes, and has been seen using magic.</p>
<p>This encounter is a great mix of boss battle and mystery story. What is going on with this Owlbear? How can the player stop it? Throw in a river hazard and some unexpected bursts of magic to the arena and you have a memorable forest brawl.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-wraith-miniatures.jpg?itok=uxRbWT6k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-wraith-miniatures.jpg?itok=2KleHS7t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Descend Into A Wraith's Dungeon Lair</h2>
<p><em>From Tyler</em>: For fans of spooky ghosts, the Wraith Encounter has you covered. Patrons at The Silver Purse gambling parlor have reported seeing a mysterious ghost-like entity. Those who see it report sickness and memory loss. These coincide with rumors that The Silver Purse was built on a forgotten temple.</p>
<p>The central gimmick is a ghostly encounter combined with a dungeon maze. Enemies use the Frightened condition to push adventurers into the maze's traps and keep them away from potentially helpful items.</p>
<p>The Wraith encounter is my favorite encounter box in the set. It delivers an atmospheric setpiece, puts a novel spin on a classic <em>D&amp;D</em> concept, and presents it all as an elaborate combat puzzle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-ghost-pirate-miniatures.jpg?itok=R2H356Lu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-ghost-pirate-miniatures.jpg?itok=UaOUVXPA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Ghost Pirates Aren't Just After Your Gold, But Your Lives</h2>
<p><em>From Tyler:</em> For those who want a more nautical spin on a vengeful spirit, the Ghost Pirate Encounter is for you.</p>
<p>It is a familiar tale in the Salt &amp; Kraken tavern. A pirate captain seeks new crewmates. Except that captain has been dead for thirty years. Worse still, the people he recruits either show up years later barely alive at best, and dead at worst.</p>
<p>Generally, it is a solid swashbuckling encounter, if by the numbers. The arena is packed with environmental hazards and magical mist which can break caster's sightlines and keep martial classes on their toes. Not to mention the captain and his crew go after whoever has the most gold. Do with that what you will.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encountesr-local-legends-night-hag-miniatures.jpg?itok=RjN5amey 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encountesr-local-legends-night-hag-miniatures.jpg?itok=icF1XKiy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Night Hag Summonings Might Be More Than Your Party Can Take</h2>
<p><em>From Tyler:</em> The Night Hag encounter may be the most deceptively cosmic encounter in the set. It involves the titular hag setting up an elaborate ritual in the leyline-infused Adventurer's Rest tavern. If she is not stopped, she can tap into an infinite well of magic in its foundation and transcend to godhood.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious encounter against a CR 7 monster that low-level parties might not be prepared for. There is a clever environmental mechanic where characters can interrupt the ritual and buff casters, players can also take out the Hag's minions, permanently reducing her maximum HP.</p>
<p>It's an encounter that would be right at home in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/planescape-adventures-in-multiverse-review-player-options-still-disappoint" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Planescape</em></a> campaign and fits with the whimsical high-fantasy vibe of The Adventurer's Rest tavern. If you like your fantasy stories bold and bombastic, pick this up.</p>

<p><em>From Giaco</em>: Of the four Local Legends mini-encounters I received for review, this Green Dragon encounter might be one of my favorites (even if it is the “easiest” encounter of the group). Tied to the Huntsman’s Stag tavern as seen in the Tavern Kit, this adventure begins with food going missing from the inn’s larders, large footprints on the central table, and tales from exhausted hunters who can’t find “the green devil.”</p>
<p>That green devil is the titular Green Dragon of this encounter, a juvenile dragon who wants nothing more than to get a bite to eat and play innocent pranks on anyone who would hunt for it. As adventurers in this mini encounter, the goal is - first and foremost - to find the Green Dragon as it hides among Mangrove trees! And from there, it’ll swoosh and fly around the battle map, nipping at characters playfully and trying to knock them into the murky, cold, stagnant water of the Mangroves.</p>
<p>Fun and full of personality, this (potentially) combat light mini encounter delivers on the promise of these box sets - to surprise, delight, and inspire GM’s and players alike!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-hill-giant-miniature.jpg?itok=t5f7V1jV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-hill-giant-miniature.jpg?itok=E1ZumbHz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Party Running Up That Hill Giant</h2>
<p><em>From Giaco</em>: For this Local Legends mini encounter, much like the Green Dragon encounter, this one’s not an out-and-out fight. Banjo the Hill Giant (great name) has made a nice little life for himself harassing the miners working in the pioneer town and frequenting the Draughty Rabbit tavern.</p>
<p>The fun twist on this mini encounter is how the Hill Giant uses the natural world around him. Once players track him down and find him standing at the top of his hill, he’ll continually roll giant boulders down the hill at them - inflicting some serious damage if they collide. It’s not until the adventurers schlep their way up the hill that the true fight begins, with Banjo trying to smash them with a giant bag filled with treasures.</p>
<p>Evocative and inventive, this is another Local Legends mini-encounter that feels much more memorable than a simple fight. It’s not really about squaring off against Banjo, it’s about avoiding his boulders and traps!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-bat-demon-miniatures.jpg?itok=YyxotvFT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-bat-demon-miniatures.jpg?itok=_rqgWnf- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Bat Demon Out Of Hell</h2>
<p><em>From Giaco:</em> This Local Legends mini encounter centers around the Shady Nook tavern and the local thieves guild that frequents the town. Drawn out by grief and suffering, this mini encounter features a fiend known as the Diaemus and the giant bats it calls down to attack the adventurers once they lure it out.</p>
<p>Of all the adventures I received, this one is - for me - the least compelling. Though there’s a bit of story to be pulled from the fact that this creature feeds on fear and despair, overall this isn’t much more than a rooftop battle. The miniature is nice, but other than that this one doesn’t truly break the mold like the others we’ve checked out.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-efreet-miniatures.jpg?itok=7KmGVyQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-efreet-miniatures.jpg?itok=Lp_vuqh9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Efreet Encounter</h2>
<p><em>From Giaco:</em> With a challenge rating of 11, the Efreet at the center of this Local Legends mini-encounter is by far the most challenging of the four I’ve checked out and it has one of the most interesting, closed-space encounters as well!</p>
<p>Taking place in the illicit but well-heeled Velvet Dreams tavern, the Efreet was summoned long ago and is stuck here. One of my favorite moments in any of these guidebooks is the suggestion that this Efreet was perhaps summoned by an intoxicated magic user who eventually sobered up and… forgot to banish the Efreet!</p>
<p>What a great concept, and now this terribly powerful and terribly angry genie is out for blood! With an incredible miniature and a truly difficult combat encounter within, this could easily have been expanded into a larger Epic Encounters box set -- but I really appreciate that it’s been kept contained within this easy-to-run, approachable box.</p>

I know a place.</figcaption></figure><h2>Should I pick up <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em>?</h2>
<p>If you're brand new to GM'ing or dread creating interesting, bespoke taverns and inns, I highly recommend the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> products. The Tavern Kit is a great resource for those behind the GM screen, and the encounter boxes are fantastic for providing bite-sized excitement to players at the table.</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 publisher Activision has made it clear that you cannot simply toggle off its upcoming game's much-hyped new "omnimovement" feature, which lets you sprint and dive in any direction.
</p>
<p>
Speaking via the <a href="https://youtu.be/KMFDkQ_5m1U">official Call of Duty podcast</a>, Activision confirmed omnimovement was a permanent mechanic in the game and a "global system" across all of its modes - campaign, multiplayer and zombies. And no, there's no option to switch it off. 
</p>
<p>
"Can you toggle omnimovement on and off?" Activision senior director of studio communications Stephanie Snowden said. "The answer is no. Omnimovement is a core foundational mechanic of the game, you cannot turn it off. But I think where people maybe got that impression was, we have another new feature, a part of movement, called Intelligent Movement."

<p>
Intelligent Movement is described as a "suite of player settings" that can be turned on or off designed to "reduce button presses", Treyarch associate director of design Matt Scronce said, for example to automatically sprint or automatically mantle, as well as add in slight delays to fit their personal preferences. 
</p>
<p>"Pulling off these manoeuvres, chaining them together, I think that's one really big piece about omnimovement that people should be really excited for," Snowden said. "It's not just sprinting 360 but how do you turn that into a slide, turn that into a dive, ADS while sliding..."</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">Eurogamer got an extended look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> from Scronce and senior director of production Yale Miller last month, where our Chris Tapsell saw the game's Gulf War-set campaign mode and multiplayer for the first time. Sadly, we discovered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-you-cant-play-as-margaret-thatcher-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">you can't play as Margaret Thatcher</a>.

            <p>My love of the chilly, lightless heavens is equalled only by my love of free things, and right now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> ticks both boxes. Cloud Imperium are offering free access to the long-in-the-making space game until July 19th, as part of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen/play-now">the latest Foundation Festival</a>. During that fleeting window of opportunity, you can try out 10 ships and enjoy such astral pastimes as stripping wrecks, busting asteroids, or getting blown up by other pilots. If you're an existing citizen of the stars, there are also festival-themed discounts of various kinds.</p><!--more-->
<p>I have nothing to add about the promotion itself, so instead I will reiterate that Star Citizen has been gestating for longer than most actual stars [citation needed]. It went into preproduction in 2010, was announced in 2012, and was once fondly slated for release in 2014. It has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars in crowd-funding over the years, with players recently invited to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizens-ridiculous-ship-prices-hit-a-new-high-with-46000-dlc-bundle">splurge an entire housing deposit's worth of pocket money on starships</a> which, the attentive reader will notice, are not physically existing vessels you can live in when you're old and penniless. There are a few of those ships on offer as part of this year's Foundation Festival. For example, a snackable £120 nets you the C1 Spirit, a "versatile cargo hauler". If you dislike the colour of your C1 Spirit, you can buy a pack of paintjobs for a scandalously cheap £24 or so - 30% off the usual asking price. </p>
<p>Alec Meer (RPS in peace) wrote a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-101-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-controversial">Star Citizen explainer in 2015</a> which now reads like a sparking terminal diary looted from one of the aforesaid derelicts. "No-one outside of [CI founder Chris Roberts] and his team know what's really going on, or whether Star Citizen can possibly live up to the expectations, the money, the dreams," he wrote.

            <p>
Larian has detailed what Baldur's Gate 3 players can expect from the seventh patch, due out in September.
</p>
<p>
As previously reported, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">patch will include mod support</a> and, in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491">new post on Steam</a>, the studio has given a brief look at what some creators have achieved in the Closed Alpha.

</p>
<p>
But there are other additions coming too, including a much-needed tweak to split-screen play - dynamic split-screen mode - which allows players in multiplayer to split the screen and automatically merge it back into one when near each other.
</p>

<p>

Other improvements include a tweak to Honour Mode that provides more creatures with Legendary Actions, as well as the addition of new cinematics to evil playthroughs to offer a "grander finale".
</p>
<p>
Speaking of evil characters, a number of bug fixes will be implemented for Dark Urge players. Yet one thing looks set not to change - as the patch notes read:
</p>
<p>
"But will we be able to kiss Gortash?" we hear you plead. "We want to kiss Gortash!"
</p>
<p>
"Listen, he's a complicated guy who's busy contemplating the minutia of death cult office politics. Babygurl doesn't have time to kiss."
</p>
<p>
There are also various tweaks coming to specific characters, as well as party banter now supported for all players in multiplayer sessions.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, and despite previously dubbing this patch as a handover moment to the game's modding community, Larian has teased this patch won't in fact be the final update to Baldur's Gate 3.
</p>
<p>
"It's hard to believe it's almost been an entire year since we launched Baldur's Gate 3. But the journey isn't over yet," reads the patch notes.
</p>
<p>
"Patch 7 won't be the final update for Baldur's Gate 3. We still have a few things up our sleeve - including many community-requested features like crossplay and a photo mode to capture and share your unforgettable moments. And we're working on a host of other enhancements, from gameplay tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to bug fixes and performance optimisations."
</p>
<p>
Previously, Larian CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">Swen Vincke stated that mod support would be a handover moment to players</a>, but it's great to hear support won't end entirely at this point.

Highlights include split-screen updates, brand new cinematics for evil endings, plenty of bug fixes, and official modding tools.</p><p>In now trademark Larian fashion, it’s had fun with the patch notes, below. Here’s a snippet: “In the words of Michelangelo, no great work of art is ever finished, and so too is our approach to the art of snogging.”</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 is Larian's enormously successful Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game that blew critics and players alike away upon its release in August 2023. Since then, Larian has issued a number of updates that have improved and added to the game. But do not expect a Baldur's Gate 4 from the studio, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-team-had-to-collect-so-many-different-awards-that-game-development-was-affected">which recently admitted that it won so many awards it began to affect development</a>. Larian has walked away from Baldur's Gate 3 DLC, a potential sequel, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general to work on brand new games of its own. Indeed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-boss-swen-vincke-reckons-hes-figured-out-act-1-of-his-post-baldurs-gate-3-game">Larian boss Swen Vincke has already started to tease one of them</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><h2>Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 7 Patch Notes (Pre-Launch)</h2><p><strong>Split Screen Updates</strong></p><p>Dynamic split screen mode is incoming! With our next update, friends will no longer be eternally confined to their side of the screen - because the power of friendship transcends all obstacles, including screen partitions.</p><p>When playing in co-op, you’ll now have the option to have split screens merge into a single screen when you near one another. You can access this directly from the HUD and within the game settings, both in and out of combat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/splitscreen-1721126459932.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><strong>Honour Mode Improvements</strong></p><p>We’re continuing to make improvements to combat in Honour Mode too. With Patch 7, even more creatures have been bestowed additional Legendary Actions, including the bulette, everyone’s favorite neighborhood surgeon, Malus Thorm, and githyanki Ch'r'ai Tska'an, Ch'r'ai Har'rak, and Ptaris.</p><p>Dror Ragzlin will now also be able to use a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion to rally the spiders that reside in the nearby pit to fight the real enemy - you.</p><p><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 Modding Toolkit</strong></p><p>With this update also comes our official modding toolkit! Come September, you'll be able to load up your game with a range of new game mods, and even try your hand at making some yourself.</p><p>We recommend giving our Modding FAQ a look for more information on what modding support means for Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><p>We’re currently working with Baldur’s Gate 3 Mod Authors during our Closed Alpha, who have been busy testing out the toolkit. To find out what some of the Mod Authors have been working on during the Closed Alpha, keep reading!</p><p>The Toolkit itself will give you everything you need to edit or create entirely new content, including:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Items - Equipment like weapons and armours, consumables, and miscellaneous items.</li><li>Cosmetics - Including different hair, beards, and other textures.</li><li>Classes and Subclasses - Creating new variants or modifying existing ones to edit abilities, powers, and skills.</li><li>Races - These can be created and edited to determine overall appearance, as well as their individual powers and abilities.</li><li>Dice Skins - You’ll also have the ability to edit or redesign the appearance of your dice skins!</li><li>User Interface - Including extensions and restyling of the game UI.</li><li>Quality of Life Improvements - Such as mods that edit or improve gameplay that don’t rely on unsupported elements.</li></ul><p><strong>Evil Endings</strong></p><p>And, of course, Patch 7 will also be bringing several new cinematics that offer your more evil playthroughs a grander finale!</p><p>From avatar Origin characters, including the Dark Urge, to the multiple different pathways that you can take as your own player character, each new cinematic is yours to discover through nefarious means.</p><p>While we don’t want to give everything away just yet, you can feast your eyes on the teasers below - and be on the lookout for more heading your way soon!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/hopnor-mode-1721126503484.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/levitate-1721126544970.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><strong>Dark Urge Bug Fixes</strong></p><p>Along with the new evil ending cinematics coming this patch, we’ve introduced a number of improvements and bug fixes for our Dark Urge players - ironing out camera pops, missing inspiration, VFX, and a few other issues.</p><p>For instance, a bug has now been fixed where combat sometimes fails to trigger in the event that you decide to murder one of your companions as the Dark Urge and attack the party. This will now lead to combat with the rest of the gang. And Minthara will now respond accordingly if you’ve been stripped of Bhaal’s influence.</p><p>We may have also let a certain bard now join the party as a controllable character if there’s an empty slot, temporarily, of course.</p><p>“But will we be able to kiss Gortash?” we hear you plead. “We want to kiss Gortash!”</p><p>Listen, he’s a complicated guy who’s busy contemplating the minutia of death cult office politics. Babygurl doesn’t have time to kiss.</p><p><strong>Origin Character Bug Fixes</strong></p><p>This update will also see improvements made to some cinematics, endgame dialogues, and Origin characters - specifically things like clipping issues, a couple of broken triggers for quests, dialogues, and romances, the odd case of retrograde amnesia, and persistent exclamation marks.</p><p>Oh, and the Blade of Frontiers will no longer absent-mindedly swing his sword mere inches from the aorta of shorter races who try to recruit him.</p><p>Let’s look at some of the highlights!</p><p><strong>Wyll Highlights</strong></p><p>Patch 7 includes a heap of fixes for Wyll, ranging from improvements to his dialogue reactivity to fixes for romance scenes.</p><p>If you’ve experienced issues triggering the romance scene with Wyll, this update will fix that. Should your relationship be headed in that direction, the cutscene in question will now trigger when you speak to Wyll at camp before your Long Rest.</p><p>A bug that had been preventing his romance greeting from triggering has also been fixed, so players in Act III who have a stable, loving, and committed relationship with Wyll will now see his romance greeting triggering correctly.</p><p>We’ve fixed Wyll’s dialogue reactivity during the epilogue for partnered players who have either joined Karlach in the Hells or Lae'zel in the rebellion, and we also determined there simply weren’t enough opportunities to kiss Wyll during the epilogue. This update rectifies that with the option to ask for a kiss in more paths of Wyll’s epilogue dialogue.</p><p>And if you're in holographic form during the epilogue, he’ll no longer automatically assume he's talking to Lae'zel, which was weird.</p><p><strong>Astarion Highlights</strong></p><p>In Patch 7, we’ve made improvements to the facial animations of your character during some kissing cinematics, including with the ascended Astarion.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/astarion-1721126602101.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We’ve also made tweaks to how Origin characters react within certain cutscenes, to enhance their emotional impact. For example, companions will show Astarion more empathy when he loses his ability to withstand sunlight.</p><p><strong>Lae’zel Highlights</strong></p><p>Lae’zel will now wait a little longer at her recruitment site if you tell her you’ll be returning. And once she’s set up at camp, she will also cycle through more varied idle animations.</p><p>This update will also put an end to an annoying issue where resurrecting Lae'zel on the beach in Act I would cause her to appear in the Party Line but not in the world, blocking you from leaving Act I.</p><p><strong>Karlach Highlights</strong></p><p>Along with some more general fixes for Karlach, she will now react to Dammon if she finds him dead after he has told her that he can help her.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/karlach-1721126652108.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>That sketchy fade-to-black that follows her final scene in Avernus, which also unintentionally gave you a very brief glimpse of the region in gameplay mode, was a visual bug that has also been fixed.</p><p>The dialogue block caused by choosing to stay with a different companion the morning after your second romance scene with Karlach is no more.</p><p>Also, she’ll no longer brush the shaved side of her head during her camp idle animation.</p><p>Wrong side, Karlach.</p><p><strong>Gale Highlights</strong></p><p>With a few tweaks to camera angles and fixes to animation pops, repeated dialogue, and missing VFX, we’ve polished up Gale and his scenes and further refined his donation UI.</p><p>That panel that opens when donating magical items to Gale? This will now show all items eligible for donation - including those on your person, your party’s inventories, and your Traveller’s Chest.</p><p>This is part of the work that began with Hotfix #16 to improve the donation UI and update a player’s ability to access certain quest-related items, which has now been completed. We’re reinstating the intended behaviour that was removed in Hotfix #17 as a temporary bug fix to missing UI functionality. So if you now deny Gale a magic item three times in a row with magical items either on your person, your party's inventories, or now from your Traveller’s Chest, he will leave your party.</p><p>Alternatively, selecting “I’m not giving you anything. Not now, not ever” will still cause Gale to leave your party forever.</p><p>We’ve also patched up a bug that was preventing the final dialogue between Gale and Mystra from triggering, as well as a scene in the endgame that would cut off before you could kiss.</p><p><strong>Shadowheart Highlights</strong></p><p>In addition to fixing a few of her animation bugs, this update fixes a number of quest issues for Shadowheart.</p><p>A bug that saw the Spear of Night either not being received, or being spoken about as if it hadn’t already been acquired, is no more. Another bout of amnesia has also been fixed, in which Shadowheart occasionally thought Viconia was still alive after killing her. The 'Daughter of Darkness' quest should also now close properly if you choose to surrender Shadowheart to Viconia.</p><p>And yes, we’ve tweaked a few kissing scenes for her too, fixing a broken romance cutscene that should have triggered after giving Shadowheart the Idol of Shar, and a kissing animation that will no longer kick in before the dialogue option is chosen. We’ve also polished up the appearance of neck kissing. In the words of Michelangelo, no great work of art is ever finished, and so too is our approach to the art of snogging.</p><p><strong>Party Banter Improvements</strong></p><p>Prior to this update, party banter between companion characters was limited to the characters controlled by a single player. In Patch 7, multiplayer parties will support banter between characters assigned to different players.</p><p>This patch also resolves issues that had been rendering some romance party banters inaccessible while adventuring.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A closed beta for Patch 7 is set for July 22. “With all these bug fixes, updates to gameplay, and new features, we want to make sure we haven’t broken anything or introduced something that will make your computer explode,” Larian joked. Registration to test the patch is now open on Steam.</p><p>And finally, Larian teased there’s more to come from Baldur’s Gate 3, with Patch 7 now not the final update. Crossplay is still in the works, as is a photo mode.</p><p>“It’s hard to believe it’s almost been an entire year since we launched Baldur’s Gate 3. But the journey isn’t over yet,” Larian said.</p><p>“Patch 7 won’t be the final update for Baldur’s Gate 3. We still have a few things up our sleeve - including many community-requested features like crossplay and a photo mode to capture and share your unforgettable moments. And we’re working on a host of other enhancements, from gameplay tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to bug fixes and performance optimizations.</p><p>“We’ll keep you looped in on when those are likely to hit a little further down the line. In the meantime, stay in touch with us on our socials, stay tuned, and don’t forget to wear sunscreen.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Now, developer Nexon has asked its player base to please stop going AFK and please refrain from AFK farming.</p><p>Nexon’s free-to-play co-op focused looter shooter has enjoyed enormous popularity, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-is-a-massive-hit-despite-its-various-controversies">with over 10 million players in just 10 days</a>. But out on the battlefield there’s an increasingly troublesome issue that’s driving some players up the wall: AFK farming.</p><p>AFK farming isn't a problem unique to The First Descendant, but in this game it’s particularly bad. The idea is players join a mission with others and simply twiddle their thumbs while everyone else does the hard work, then reap the rewards such as experience at the end.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>I’ve seen AFK farmers first-hand while playing The First Descendant — they’ll sometimes be spinning around in a circle, clearly in a bid to avoid any AFK detection Nexon may have in place. As players progress through the mission the AFK farmer will be forcibly teleported to catch-up, even to the boss fight, where they’ll continue to run around in circles.</p><p>Nexon <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1813092221216039047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> in response on social media that covered AFK farming, as well as going AFK during co-op play generally. “If you need to step away, please do so in Albion only!” Nexon said, pointing to the game’s main town. But the statement also covers cheating, which is an increasing issue for The First Descendant.</p><p>Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Lately, there have been increasing reports of inappropriate behavior in our game. While the dev team is working on measures, we want to remind Descendants of the following guidelines:</blockquote><blockquote>1️⃣ The use, distribution, or creation of unauthorized programs is strictly prohibited. 🚫</blockquote><blockquote>2️⃣ Do not go AFK during co-op play. If you need to step away, please do so in Albion only! 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️</blockquote><blockquote>3️⃣ Please refrain from AFK farming during missions. 🤖🚫</blockquote><blockquote>We're always striving to create a fun and pleasant gaming environment for Descendants! 🎮✨</blockquote><blockquote>Please keep in mind these rules and help us build a greater community together! 🤝🌟</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This statement, which essentially amounts to a “play nice” warning, will only do so much, so players are calling on Nexon to add proper anti-cheat measures and anti-AFK farming mechanics. Some, however, are defending AFK farming because, they insist, they’re so sick of The First Descendant’s crushing grind that they’ve lost the will to play properly.</p><p>The First Descendant is a massive hit already, but Nexon will be mindful of growing its player count as the game evolves, and we've seen how difficult this has become for so many publishers and developers who have entered the ultra competitive live service market in recent years.</p><p>While The First Descendant is clearly a hit it is not without controversy, and sits on a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam. Players have heavily criticized <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-enjoys-big-player-numbers-on-steam-despite-microtransaction-hell"><u>The First Descendant's ultra aggressive monetization</u></a>, which includes $100 character bundles and premium customization items that expire after use. Nexon was also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story"><u>accused of copying Destiny 2 icons</u></a> for the icons used in The First Descendant, something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-nexon-promises-to-change-controversial-icons-after-destiny-plagiarism-accusations"><u>the company has now said it will address in-game</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Anti-afk measures would be great. You already have it in Albion if you idle for too long you’re booted back to menu. </p><p>So far, that’s one of the very few things I don’t like about the game.</p></div>— James Getty (@DigitalHitmann) <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalHitmann/status/1813105559593447493?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every game in god knows how long has auto kick, this game even has auto kick! I know because I've been kicked in Albion! This is kind of a toothless response to the problem, sadly</p>— NXN Gaming (@NXNStreams) <a href="https://twitter.com/NXNStreams/status/1813092773723316357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Generally speaking, The First Descendant is a mash-up of mechanics from various looter shooters already in the market. There’s more than a whiff of Destiny about The First Descendant’s design, systems, and mechanics, but then there’s also a lot of Warframe about it, too.</p><p>Last week, Nexon released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does"><u>a significant update for The First Descendant</u></a> that makes some big changes to the game, but leaves some aspects that had become a topic of discussion within the community well alone.</p><p>IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review"><u>The First Descendant review</u></a> returned a 5/10. We said: “The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>You've got some old consoles and you'd like them to <em>not </em>look terrible on your modern TV, and that's where this handy <a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_hg5fIqBUUjp7m7af2w?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07X6KDQ98" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mClassic Graphics Upscaler</a> arrives to save the day. There's a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a> special available for this plug-and-play device, but the catch here is that it'll only be on sale for 12 hours on July 16 and <strong>ends at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET</strong>. Usually $100, this deal bring the mClassic down to $80, a rare discount for this useful piece of tech. It's a great deal if you can grab it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332659-mclassic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332659" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332659-mclassic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332659"></a><figcaption>mClassic Graphics Upscaler</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332659-mclassic-2.jpg"></figure><p>This is a plug-and-play dongle that uses anti-aliasing to smooth jagged edges in games, sharpening and adjusting images to make them look better on your TV. This is particularly great for Nintendo Switch games, and to get the visual benefits, all you have to do is plug it into your console, plug in the supplied power cable, and then reconnect your HDMI cable from your TV into the mClassic dongle.</p><p>As mentioned above, it's great for Switch owners, but it also works just as well with even older consoles that have an HDMI port. Retro consoles that don't have that port--like the GameCube, N64, and Super Nintendo--can still make use of the mClassic Upscaler through an HDMI adapter. This is especially useful when you don't have a traditional CRT TV--or it has finally gone on to TV heaven. Of course, this isn't a foolproof solution, and results may vary depending on your TV or console.</p><p>While this mClassic deal is only around until 2 PM PT, it's also just one of the many deals happening today and tomorrow during Prime Day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amber-isle-release-date-promises-dino-shop-shenanigans-in-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Ambertail Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>release date, so get ready to open your prehistoric store and befriend a village of friendly dinos.</p>
<p><em>Amber Isle</em>'s official release date is October 10th on PC, and a Nintendo Switch version will follow "soon after", although the two studios haven't yet confirmed when we can expect that version to arrive.</p>
<p>The game sees you setting up shop on the titular Amber Isle, which a host of prehistoric animals call their home. You'll inherit a failing shop, and it's your job to turn it around and make it a profitable endeavor, all while getting to know the dinos around you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isle-release-date-haggling.jpg?itok=ShHCLYWD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isle-release-date-haggling.jpg?itok=9sDK-mEA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>sees you inheriting a failing shop in a dino-filled village.</figcaption></figure><p>First, you'll create what Ambertail and Team17 call a "Paleo-persona", and then you'll get stuck into stocking your shelves, haggling with customers, and looking for new things to craft and sell in your shop.</p>
<p>It's all being done with a view to convincing some of the folks who've left Amber Isle to come back again, bringing the island back from "the brink of fossilization". Luckily, this one doesn't have "extinction-level event" vibes.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer, which also shows off some of&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle</em>'s lovely cartoony visuals and its cozy setting, right here.</p>

<p>You'll be able to name your shop whatever you like, and you'll also have control over what it looks like, so you can decorate it however you please.</p>
<p><em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>has 48 different "Paleofolk" (that's the dinos and other animals that make up the community) to meet, and they're not all dinosaurs, either; some are Ice Age mammals, while others might be invertebrates or marine life.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, not to mention&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/paleo-pines"><em>Paleo Pines</em></a>, then you'll probably want to give this one a look.&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663040/Amber_Isle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for PC</a> on October 10th, with a Switch version to follow soon.</p>

It can be traded for cosmetic items like hats and scarves that will turn your bird-riding shepherd into a fashion icon. These are, as you can imagine, absolutely essential.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To collect wool, you'll need to find grazing spots where your hungry herd can munch the days away—and perhaps even reveal a few secrets. During a recent chat with creative director Ricky Haggett and programmer Mike Robinson, we learned that although sheep were always envisioned as part of the game, the mechanic morphed a lot during development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The pull of wool">The pull of wool</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, sheep were pitched as weird creatures called "ongles, gongles, and bongles." They were strange pink oddities that could be sheared for different resources, but it was a pitch that immediately felt too complex. At that stage, different variants of those sheep-like creatures would produce unique resources such as feathers or wool. Players could use those to craft different items, but it felt a lot like busywork. "There was more breadth [at that stage]," says Haggett, who concedes there was also more "guff."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For a long time, players also had to keep track of their herds. There were no markers on the map, and the singing mechanic that lets players locate their bleating friends hadn't been added. It was a system that, in Haggett's own words, created a lot of "oh fuck" moments when players realized they had lost their livestock and had no way of finding them without scouring the entire map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That complexity began to fall away when the Hollow Ponds team realized they had to create a "symbiosis" between exploring a huge sprawling world and finding a sense of purpose. It became clear that striking that balance didn't require a hugely complex crafting system or textile economy, but rather a mechanic that could anchor players without feeling overbearing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, at one point </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> featured a lost sheep system that would effectively punish players for misplacing their baa-rmy pals. "We got rid of it because it just felt [wrong]," says Haggett. "Over time we just streamlined the process of the sheep and became a lot more chill about it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the mechanic was fine-tuned, the team also acknowledged that obscuring the fact </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ongles and bongles were essentially sheep was somewhat ludicrous. "There was a point where we were just like 'these are sheep. Let's just make them sheep and have wool.' And wool is nice because you can knit things out of wool," says Haggett.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A final flourish of shear brilliance">A final flourish of shear brilliance</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The finishing touch eventually came in the form of meadows. These are designated spots where players can drop sheep so they can graze (generating wool in the process).&nbsp;You can't just plonk sheep anywhere, so pushing players to find meadows adds another layer to exploration. It also presented an opportunity for one last twist. "The other thing that massively changed with the meadow came quite late in development was the Burgling Bewl," explains Haggett.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the uninitiated, 'Burgling Bewls' are pesky creatures that hide in meadows and can only be yanked from their hidey hole once sheep have trimmed the grass. Apprehending Burgling Bewls unlocks new whistles, which teach songs that can be used to charm different species so they can be recruited to your flock.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was, for Haggett, a stroke of subtle genius that finally made the sheep make sense. "[Writer and narrative designer] Phillippa Warr was one of the people who spent ages trying to figure out how to better tie the sheep into the game," he says. "For a long time, the sheep were almost this separate thing—and a couple of times we were like 'should we just cut the sheep?' Because they were just this weird way of getting clothes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For a while, we had this convoluted system where you had to feed the sheep, get wool, then you could find song stones for different species, then you'd need to find a bird trainer to teach you songs, and you'd have to pay them in wool. It was this multi-tiered system where you needed the sheep so you could get wool, so you could pay the bird trainer to teach you the songs–but only after you'd found all the stones."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was an disjointed system that felt impossible to tutorialize, so hitting upon the idea of concealing Burgling Bewls into meadows was akin the striking gold. "Effectively what it is [now] is like finding a treasure chest in Zelda and getting a reward. [...] It's a bit of a skinner box where you wait for the bar to fill up and then get a prize," says Haggett. He admits to being concerned it might feel a bit "cheap," but says it solved so many design problems "so elegantly" that, ultimately, it stuck.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
Modders have been hard at work since the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, releasing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-most-popular-mods-make-shadow-of-the-erdtree-far-easier">plenty of mods to make it a little easier to complete</a>.

</p>
<p>
That's certainly true of this mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5264?tab=description">FlippantTunic22 over on Nexus Mods</a>, which replaces certain Spirit Ash summons with bosses from the DLC.
</p>
<p>
So far 11 bosses have been included. I won't list them all for spoiler reasons, but it does include the Divine Beast Dancing Lion and Messmer the Impaler you will have seen in the DLC's trailer - right up to the final boss.

<p>
As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24197346/elden-ring-mod-summon-bosses-as-allies">Polygon</a> shared, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S_9Kuy8faU&amp;t=885s">YouTuber KanesGrace</a> has posted a video of the mod in action and it's very amusing to watch bosses battle against each other.
</p>
<p>
One of the summons even includes a Furnace Golem, which towers over the player but does come in handy against a certain... sunflower.
</p>
<p>
At the least, don't tell anyone it's cheating to summon Spirit Ashes - though maybe with these it is, actually.
</p>
<p>More bosses will be added too, with a separate mod on the way for bosses from the base game.</p>
<p>
It reminds me of YouTuber BjornTheBear who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-pacifist-turtle-pope-wins-modded-battle-royale">pitted all the bosses from the base game against one another</a> - and the pacifist turtle pope came out on top.

</p>
<p>
Still, if you're struggling with the final boss, you'd do a lot worse than to summon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-legend-let-me-solo-her-changes-name-again-for-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-final-boss">Let Me Solo Her who's changed their name to help players tackle the DLC's finale</a>.

            <p>The ouroboros is a snake eating its own tail: an infinite thing, a never ending cycle. While I do think this is a rather metal logo, there's an argument to be made that it's not current or trendy enough. With this in mind, I think the words "Call Of Duty" should represent the endless, unstoppable nature of existence. And with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> revealing its multiplayer open beta and early access dates, we must further consume and be consumed by the circular march of COD. Let's dolphin dive in, shall we.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right, so. The dates according to COD's latest <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/07/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-mp-beta-dates-revealed">blog post</a>: if you pre-order the game or you're a Game Pass subscriber (you have an active subscription to Game Pass Ultimate or PC), you'll get access to the first beta weekend. This begins from Friday August 30th at 10am PT/ 13:00 ET/ 18:00 BST and ends on Wednesday September 4th at the same times.</p>
<p>The second weekend is the open beta, meaning anyone can get access. This begins on Friday September 6th at 10am PT/ 13:00 ET/ 18:00 BST and ends on Monday September 9th at the same times again. It's worth dropping in a reminder here that both of these beta periods are for the multiplayer mode only, so not zombies or the singleplayer. You'll get to build loadouts, shoot some guys, and scream at your monitor in frustration.</p>
<p>For those who've pre-ordered the super duper Vault Edition of the game, you'll get to play as four Operators (Park, Adler, Brutus or Klaus) during the betas. They are a variety of armoured lads, one of whom has a helmet that reminds me of the soldier from that old FPS Timeshift. And you'll also get to test out five weapons from the "Mastercraft" weapon collection, which look to be colourful and suitably powerful snipers and assault rifles and knives. I imagine they'll be powerful during the beta, and then like, fizzle into obscurity once people arrive at a meta on release.</p>
<p>As the resident Call Of Duty-liker (sorry), I'm mildly excited by the prospect of more FPSing. I'm particularly intrigued by the "omnimovement" they showed off during their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwYyRGGBzmU">Xbox Showcase segment</a>, which lets you sprint or dive in any direction for the first time. This means you can rotate 360 degrees while prone or shoot in the opposite direction to where you're moving, which suggests it could go one of two ways: 1) flexible fun for all the family; 2) sightlines are broadened and strategic positioning isn't as vital as it was before, meaning maps feel even more like a death blender. Let's hope it's the former, eh.</p>

            <p>
Former Speaker of the House John Bercow voices a character in the forthcoming Fallout: London mod.
</p>
<p>
Bercow was Speaker of the House in the UK Parliament, known for yelling "Order!" at rowdy MPs during his tenure. More recently, you may have spotted him in second season of The Traitors US.
</p>
<p>
Next he'll make an appearance in Fallout: London as, fittingly, a robot Speaker of the House. His inclusion means he will join the likes of Neil Newbon (Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3), Anna Demetriou (Sophia in A Plague Tale: Requiem), and two Doctor Who actors: Sylvester McCoy and Colin Baker.

<p>

The mod team made the announcement on its <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1262112282825986058">Discord</a>. "Imagine being Fallout: London and feeling so lucky having all the talented voice actors on the team. But then boosting it further with the fact that we have two Doctor Who actors as VAs... then Neil Newbon messages us and also wants a role," wrote project manager Dean "Prilladog" Carter.
</p>
<p>
"But the cherry on the top? Who better to represent our mod's version of the Speaker of the House, than a Robot version voiced by John Bercow himself."
</p>
<p>
The announcement includes a short clip of Bercow in action, although it seems his robot is having a bit of trouble - the clip quickly distorts into repeating "order!".

<p>
And, as <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-claims-john-bercow-voice-acting">VG247</a> pointed out, while some comments suggested this is an AI rather than Bercow himself, Carter replied shortly: "We don't use AI voices".

</p>
<p>
Yesterday, the mod's distributor GOG confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-will-work-with-fallout-4-on-gog-and-steam-but-not-epic">Fallout: London won't work with versions of the game bought on the Epic Games Store</a> due to its lack of rollback features.

</p>
<p>
The mod is based on Fallout 4, but set in an alternate London with all-new locations, weapons, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-update-details-new-weapons-iconic-locales-and-a-james-bond-twist">a James Bond twist</a>.

<p>A new update on the Rockstar Games website suggests that GTA+ might be coming to the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The update was first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1812959219680768485?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TezFunz2</a> on X (formerly Twitter). It shows that Rockstar Games has updated its platform list for “Games Included with GTA+” to include Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>GTA+ is the premium membership option for players. The membership grants access to several different Rockstar Games titles and bonus content for GTA Online.</p>



<p>As pointed out by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1812961670865821756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@videotechuk_</a>, GTA V doesn’t exist on the Nintendo Switch, so users will find it complicated or next to impossible to subscribe to the service on the platform. However, it could potentially be confusing for those wanting to subscribe.</p>



<p>As for when the potential change could come into effect, the change on the website suggests an announcement could be made soon.</p>



<p>GTA+ currently costs $7.99/£6.99 per month. This month’s rewards for GTA Online players included:</p>



<ul>
<li>Free Vehicle</li>



<li>Free Chameleon Paints</li>



<li>Free Clothes</li>



<li>Vinewood Car Club access</li>



<li>Gun Van Bonuses</li>

<li>Free Cash</li>



<li>Bonus GTA$ and RP</li>



<li>Vehicle Request benefits</li>



<li>CEO/VIP perks</li>



<li>Free Games included in GTA+</li>

That's $10 more than a stock Switch Lite, but that's more than justified by the fact that this edition includes a 12-month Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. </p><div id="203239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Preorder the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition</h3></p><div><p>Includes 12-month Switch Online membership + Expansion Pass</p></div></div><h2>Nintendo Switch Games on Sale - Prime Day 2024</h2><p>Alongside Nintendo Switch accessories, there are dozens of Nintendo Switch games on sale for Prime Day.

            <p>I know as much about programming video game monsters as I do the exact flavour and consistency of the sands on Mars, but I've always thought the chief advantage of the Slime monster archetype is its economy. A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes <em>do</em> take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.</p>
<p>The simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of "Splatoon mechanics in dungeons".</p><!--more-->

<p>As detailed on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vuth/recent-activity/all/">Linkedin</a>, Zhu became director of Duck Shake Games - which has two employees at the time of writing - in April 2024, after around five and a half years at Epic, where he was a technical artist working across R&amp;D projects involving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unreal-engine-5-now-available-in-full">the aforesaid Matrix demo</a>.</p>
<p>Fluid physics appears to have been a focus, and that expertise is certainly coming in handy with the slime game, which Zhu began fiddling around with during his time at the Unreal Engine manufacturer (I picture him prodding a drawerful of neon mucus between stints at the Fortnite coalface).</p>
<p>He's recently "restarted [the project] from scratch" with "a new fluid solver that enabled real(?) slime movement and slimeling spawning." Slimeling spawning! You can see it in the video: splash the slime against something and it bursts into multiple, adorable mini-slimes that hasten to rejoin the central mass - like chicks racing back to the mother hen, except that they are gelatinously absorbed on contact. From the looks of things, you can also forcefully jettison portions of slime tissue in order to double-jump. Unspeakable are the ways of slimes. Unspeakable, and marvellous.</p>
<p>The game surrounding the slime appears as fluid as the entity itself - I get the sense that Zhu is just having fun with a prototype at this stage. But older videos hint at a slice-of-life fantasy RPG in which you can manipulate the slime and other objects with a clawed hand cursor - showering it in a bathtub to restore its mass on summer days, firing it around like an elastic band, and "yeeting" it at elven mages using a frying pan. The agonising corrosive deaths of eleven mages aside, Zhu's WIP footage is awash with whimsical elements such as the slime carbonating itself by ingesting soda cans, and yep yep yep, more of this kind of thing, thanks.</p>

<p>Let me slop two concluding gobbets of contextual ooze atop the pert and glistening blob of unfiltered enthooziasm that is this nooze article. Firstly, real-life slime mould is all the rage among experimental artists, particularly those working across latter-day shades of posthumanism and eco-criticism with a stake in labour politics. Here's <a href="https://digicult.it/articles/modeling-communication-with-slime-mould-artistic-residency-with-sarah-grant/">a piece</a> on one particular artistic residency which looks at slime mould growth as a model for networked resilience within communities. Secondly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mushroom-11-review">Mushroom 11</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/earthtounge-vivarium-sim">Earthtongue</a> remain the slime sims to beat, IMO, though in a distressing lapse, neither of them lets you yeet anything from a frying pan. Do you have a favourite slime simulator, perhaps spawned by one of the many <a href="https://itch.io/jam/slime-studio-jam/entries">slime game jams</a>? I must hear about it, I must. </p>

In fact, we're now in the second half of 2024, and the game continues to win awards. At the recent Develop: Star Awards conference that took place in Brighton, UK, Baldur's Gate 3 won several awards including best overall game, as you can read from the full list of winners.</p>

</ul>
<p>The thing is, this all got a bit too much to handle for Larian. Speaking in an interview with EDGE magazine (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Faaa-fallout-crpg-was-larians-alternative-pick-if-they-didnt-get-the-baldurs-gate-license-from-wizards-of-the-coast%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Faz-magazines%2F6936449%2Fedge-magazine-subscription.thtml&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=-120&amp;xuuid=0ad38a56c8611bae7d8f9493083ecd87&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #400</a>), CEO Swen Vincke explained that the sheer amount of ceremonies they needed to attend caused a workflow disruption:</p>
<p><em>It affects development - there's a lot of them. This has been a real problem. We had to rotate teams so that different people went to different award shows. It would be cool if everybody could agree to do it all at the same time because it is surprisingly draining on the soul.</em></p>
<p>Nowadays, Larian has nearly moved on from Baldur's Gate 3 after <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refusing to create a sequel or even DLCs</a>. The team has decided to leave the Forgotten Realms behind and create something entirely new. They have two original projects on the way, and they've just <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> a new office in Warsaw, Poland, to grow even further.</p>
<p>However, they are still working on a final update to add the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-closed-alpha-starts-today-with-beta-in-july-and-release-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official modding tools</a> (the Alpha started last month, while the Beta is expected later this month) in September. As per the community's request, the evil endings will also be improved.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-arms-race-event-guide/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-%E2%80%98arms-race%E2%80%99-event-kicks-off-a-battle-between-traders.928224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-arms-race-event-guide/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games has just released a new event in Escape from Tarkov named ‘Arms Race’. At the heart of this new event is a battle between two of the game’s traders: Prapor and Peacekeeper. Multiple quests are wrapped up in the Arms Race event, with players first being tasked with killing Scavs in Factory and procuring their weapons. As highlighted by Mechanic, another trader, Prapor and Peacekeeper are gearing up for an epic fight, and being the opportunist he is, he wants players to grab the weapons these two traders have given to the AI-powered Scavs that roam the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-tarkov-s-arms-race-all-about">What’s Tarkov’s Arms Race All About?</h2>



<p>It begins with ‘Import Control’, which we’ve broken down above. To complete that, you’ll need to hand over five FIR ‘Western’ Scav weapons to Mechanic <strong>as well as </strong>eliminating 10 Scavs on Factory. That’s a relatively run-of-the-mill challenge.</p>



<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll get ‘What’s Your Evidence’ pop up. To complete this mission, simply obtain 10 ‘Western’ Scav weapons that have low durability, handing them to Peacekeeper to investigate. Here’s the list of calibers you’ll need to be looking out for:</p>



<ul>
<li>.300 Blackout</li>



<li>.357 Magnum</li>



<li>.338 Lapua Magum</li>



<li>.45 ACP</li>



<li>4.6x30mm HK</li>



<li>5.7x28mm FN</li>



<li>5.56x45mm NATO</li>



<li>6.8x51mm</li>



<li>7.62x51mm NATO</li>



<li>9x19mm Parabellum</li>
</ul>



<p>To best achieve this, head to a map that spawns plenty of Scavs, like Customs, and kill everything that moves. To hit the target, you’ll need weapons with less than 10 durability.</p>



<p>Then, ‘Caught Red-Handed’ will pop, inviting you to place cameras around Lighthouse for Peacekeeper as he attempts to figure out what’s happening with his weapon shipments. You can get the cameras from Mechanic at LL1.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got your cameras, you’ll need to head to the entrance to each water treatment plant building on Lighthouse, planting the cameras tactically to watch the area. Be warned: you’re almost guaranteed to clash with other players, Rogues, and perhaps even the Goons or Zryachiy as you make your way to these objective points.</p>



<p>Presently, this is as far as we’ve got with the challenges. There are a lot of rewards to be scooped up for completing these tasks, though – including a stack of XP that will boost lower-level players an immense amount. Furthermore, it seems as though there’s a ‘pick-a-side’ mechanic lined up, which will assumedly see players fight for either Prapor or Peacekeeper. BSG has confirmed that the ‘winning team’ will get an exclusive reward along with a one-time, limited-edition achievement.</p>



<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>



<p>There’s currently a bug – or what’s <em>believed to be a bug </em>– that’s causing players to lose rep with Prapor and Skier every time they enter a raid, even if they’re playing as a Scav character. This is hitting players across PvE and PvP platforms, and presently, it’s impactful enough that it’s causing players to lose trader levels. </p>



<p>This is a huge issue for PvE players, as one of the core mechanics of <strong>that </strong>mode is persistence – they’re not subjected to regular wipes like PvP players are. So, if they never wipe, these rep hits will have a longer lasting impact.</p>



<p>We’ll update this as more is learned about this event.</p>

Bewls. Pipers. Gleebs. These aren't the mutterings of a lunatic, but rather a mere handful of creatures you'll be able to charm and collect in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the next title from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> I Am Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Hollow Ponds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a chill adventure about exploring a wondrous world atop a giant bird (or maybe you're just very small?). On your travels, you'll have the chance to discover and nurture a flock of creatures that will trail in your wake, swirling and chirping in all the colors of the rainbow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, we spoke with the dev team to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/a-naturalistic-world-for-flying-sausages-the-evolving-design-of-flock">learn how they designed Flock's naturalistic world</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Now, to commemorate the title launching on July 16 (wait—that's today!), we caught up with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Ricky Haggett and programmer Mike Robinson to find out how the team implemented </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, well, flocks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="We'll all float on">We'll all float on</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett explains camera positioning was key to cultivating a certain feng shui. When players are careening across glades and weaving between ferns like a sentient Concorde, the flock will drop backwards so it doesn't obstruct the camera's line of sight. When they're engaging in more serene activities, such as attempting to woo another critter into their menagerie, they'll congregate nearby without a care in the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Early on, there was definitely a thing where the camera was always in amongst the flock," he says. "It felt cool but also broke that feeling of zipping around. I think we have a sweet spot now where you still get these nice moments of being amongst them, but only for a fleeting moment before they drop back."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Robinson notes flocks generally follow a few key rules that determine how they congeal. He says each gaggle of creatures follows a spline that trails the player-controlled bird. When they stop, that spline "meanders off" and creates a metaphorical holding pen before latching back onto players when they decide it's time to hit the proverbial gas. The code and logic that determines how creatures position themselves was designed to ensure performance wouldn't be "too much of a worry."</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-rXtCyX-NA?si=3eKg35dZOrIjjsZP" height="450px" width="100%" data-testid="iframe"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He notes it all started by implementing a point cloud of base positions that was stretched out around the spline trailing the bird. "The beasts aren't really aware of what's going on and what's nearby, but then we do things like when you're flying close to stuff that can contract in, or when you swing out and do a big curve, the points that are travelling past that curve get pushed to the side slightly," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"None of the creatures are aware of the speeds they're travelling at or any of that other stuff. It's just kind of mapping them to this spline than pushing them out based on the extremities of curves and other values."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As players explore the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, they'll be able to unearth new creatures and win their affections—hopefully convincing them to join their giddy gaggle of gliders. That collect-em-up mechanic required Hollow Ponds to not just consider how each flock should move, but how new creatures should slot into established herds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the moment, [newer] creatures will travel to the front," says Robinson. "Some of the key creatures will want to head to the front of the flock to get more exposure. But we also ended up going through and checking all the sizes of each beast in the flock, and we asked whether it was worth ensuring each [creature type] had specific area?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The trouble with flying sausages">The trouble with flying sausages</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer was 'no.' The team felt positioning had already reached a "nice point" that didn't demand an extra layer of complexity on top. Haggett acknowledges that creatures (which come in all shapes and sizes) can still sometimes clip into each other, but the nature of player movement means it goes largely unnoticed. In fact, the biggest challenge Hollow Ponds encountered when fine-tuning flocks was sorting out the long bois (not their official name).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Most of the creatures bend using material stuff," says Robinson. "It's just a fairly cheap material solution that doesn't involve updating skeletons. Haggett quickly chips in here to explain bending largely involved moving the vertices at render time based on curve values. The issue is that solution looked awful when applied to the longer, more sausage-like creatures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We ended up using the spline mesh tech, and then bolting on a skeletal mesh for the head at the front [of longer creatures," says Robinson. "It was about making sure those curves come out nice and mapped to where you want them to be, basically. It's just a two-point spline, and we didn't want to split them into multiples because that could be a higher CPU cost."</span></p><p>Flock concept art showing an array of creatures</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, those longer creatures—which are actually called Pipers—had separate head meshes and two or three body meshes. Robinson, however, put a lot of work into mapping a two-point spline to ensure pipers only needed one body mesh. "I just put a lot of time into working out how to map this two-point spline so I could get it to travel through four points by adjusting the tangents," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says that was a pretty big win because it's not "phenomenally expensive" in terms of performance. "You could make a skeleton with a bunch of points, and then you can deform the mesh around that skeleton. But that's so expensive—especially if you imagine the nature of this game," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can have 30 of those things [flocking around you]. You can have four players, and so then you can have 120 of those things all flying around together on a low spec console. It's just not going to work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Preventing players from welcoming more than 30 creatures into their flock was partly in service of stability, but Haggett says it was also something of a goldilocks number that looked *just right* on-screen. "There was an optimization thing happening, but as you start playing the game for real and start collecting things and putting them in a flock, there's a meaningful number of things you can put in your flock and actually care about," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's your shelf of cool stuff, is what your flock is—and there's a reason why as you make that number bigger it doesn't necessarily feel better. Also, just visually, the feeling of flying around with 30 creatures wasn't that different to the feeling of flying around with 50 creatures. Weirdly, especially as we finessed the variety of creatures and started having lots of different sizes and colors, you get the impression of a big flock of creatures with 30."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of the magic of making games, of course, is having the ability to experiment in ways that players never will. So, just to see how far he could push the boundaries of flocking, Haggett did some tinkering to see how a flock of 3,000 creatures might manifest. The result, as shown below, is beautiful, boisterous, bedlam.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>I’m calling it now. When, in <a href="https://x.com/LordsManor/status/1812908811222413585">a “few weeks”</a> according to the developer, fishing ponds come to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a>, it will take approximately 45 minutes for some enterprising medieval fintech tinkerer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-dev-wants-you-to-decide-whether-the-game-should-allow-egg-monopolies">utterly bork the entire economy</a>, and it will be glorious. What will begin as brave new world of lean protein and previously unseen Omega 3 levels will soon devolve into hordes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">beleaguered oxen</a> hauling overburdened carts full of rotting fish carcasses, as hyperinflation looms.</p>

<p>I have beheld the idyllic lake, as shared by Greg ‘Slavic Magic’ Styczeń on Twizzler, and I see only financial ruin rippling upon its tranquil surface, like a really fucked up lillypad.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Ok, so it’ll probably be fine. As you may have heard recently, updating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> for the sake of it goes against both Styczeń and publisher Hooded Horse’s vision for the game. Not every game needs to be "some live-service boom or bust," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/long-dark-dev-criticises-manor-lords-for-lack-of-updates-hooded-horse-ceo-replies-that-not-every-game-needs-to-be-some-live-service-boom-or-bust">said Hoody Horsey’s CEO Tim Bender recently</a>, after the game was criticised by Long Dark studio Hinterlands CEO Raphael van Lierop for a lack of updates. We can safely surmise that Styczeń has deeply considered the impact of throwing fish at his game’s serfs, then.</p>
<p>You may have also noticed how shiny the above lake looks, too, which is likely down to the upcoming engine change slated to also arrive in the upcoming patch. The migration to Unreal Engine 5, hopes Styczeń, will sort out some lingering memory corruption issues, like flickering roads and crashes, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/manor-lords-creator-is-sorry-about-bugs-leftover-from-the-city-builders-latest-patch-but-promises-the-move-to-unreal-engine-5-will-sort-out-other-annoying-issues/">Games Radar</a>.</p>
<p>The initial hype around Manor Lords - that wot led it to sell 2 million copies - has understandably leveled out a bit, but it’s undeniably heartening to hear that Slavic Magic aren’t under pressure to crank out new mecha-ox or hay-based battle passes. “Dev uses early access to work on game at their own pace and player base plays a bit here and there, then and moves on to other games when they’ve had their fill” shouldn’t be an unusual state of affairs in anything but a profoundly sick industry, but them's the no-brakes, I guess.</p>
<p>"Sustainability is something we think about a lot," Bender <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-manor-lords-publisher-thinks-we-should-all-reject-the-opportunistic-and-predatory-quest-for-a-viral-hit">told our Edwin</a> a few months back, "but usually we think about it in relation to developers. So we're in an interesting situation - we never took money from, like, venture capitalists, or private equity, or international conglomerates, or anything that would put pressure on us. In fact, we even wrote into our bylaws that we can prioritise other things over profits, like artistic integrity and fair treatment.”</p>
