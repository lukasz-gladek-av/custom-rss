			<p>Today, the official nominations for the Game of the Year category at The Game Awards 2024 have been <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1858558285995241601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1858558285995241601%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a>, and the biggest news is that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was included. This is surprising because Shadow of the Erdtree is not a standalone game but a DLC that requires Elden Ring to be played.</p>
<p>Since this is unprecedented, The Game Awards organization clarified its stance on the topic with a newly added FAQ on the event's official <a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration.</em></p>
<p>It's fair game for everyone, then, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is the obvious favorite in an otherwise less-than-outstanding year. FromSoftware's admittedly large DLC (according to HowLongToBeat, it takes 25.5 hours for the main quest but over 50 hours for a completionist run) will have to beat Atlus's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Square Enix's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, Team Asobi's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>, and PlayStack's Balatro to repeat the 2022 win of the base game. It shouldn't be too hard, although on paper, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is tied with Astro Bot and Metaphor: ReFantazio when it comes to Metacritic score (94 for all three). However, FromSoftware's latest masterpiece is far more popular, as evidenced by the larger sales.</p>
<p>The DLC got a perfect score here on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo. Here's the summarized take from his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>It did not take long to get back into the engaging adventuring loop of the Elden Ring experience, searching for map fragments to get a better look at the map, placing markers where points of interest are seemingly located, and getting amazed by beautiful vistas, immense castles, and sprawling haunting forests, unaware of the dangers that lurked inside of them. With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>
<p>You can vote for your favorite game on the official The Game Awards website. The ceremony will go live on December 12 at 5 PM Pacific.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-2-appears-to-be-a-thing-which-is-a-shame-because-id-rather-play-a-new-evolve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>Turtle Rock "Gobi 2" project surfaces on stuntman resume</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It takes a special kind of entitled bellyacher to complain that you wanted a different game from a game that hasn't even been announced yet, and which may simply be an internet rumour. It's like the "glass half empty" mindset, but the bartender hasn't even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you've wandered into the local antique shop. Well <em>I</em>, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the "bar", gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> homage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a>. Rumour has it that they're making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don't <em>want</em> a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a>, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. "A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please," I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman's travelling suitcase from the 1920s.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I guess we should talk about the Back 4 Blood 2 rumour first. It's a short, thrilling tale with only one character, Jesse Hutch, a man with very large arms who did motion capture work for Back 4 Blood. On his <a href="https://www.istunt.com/jesse-hutch-4776">iStunt page</a>, Hutch mentions that he's "lead performer" on "Gobi 2". The original Back 4 Blood <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/633807/depots/">is listed as "Gobi" on SteamDB</a>. I learned about all this via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-back-4-blood-2-in-development-with-codename-gobi-2">MP1st</a>, who note that somebody <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/back4blood2.com">registered</a> a domain for back4blood2.com back in May 2023. Tangential observation: stuntpeople resumes make colourful reading. Hutch's feats include "Misery Style Kidnap Escape" in the movie House Of Terror. He also did "Frat Guy/Massive Puking/Backflips" in Scary Movie 3. Did... did he have to puke and backflip simultaneously? I guess I'll have to watch Scary Movie 3.</p>
<p>Colour all this speculation for the moment, but it seems reasonably solid. Now, let me re-commence whinging. The words "Left 4 Dead spiritual successor" will always rouse a hunger in me, but I found Back 4 Blood quite disappointing. Usefully, Graham did too, so I can just copy-paste the relevant section from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-wont-get-new-content-as-its-developers-focus-on-making-next-game">his February 2023 news story about Turtle Rock beginning work on an untitled new game</a>.</p><p>"It seemed to replace the immaculate pacing and tension of its spiritual predecessors with empty spectacle and bulletsponge boss fights," Graham wrote. I will only add that I really hated the very non-L4D-ish emphasis on hoarding and customising weapons. It felt like they'd ripped Left 4 Dead's face off and grafted it to a bog-standard zombie shlooter.</p>
<p>Evolve had its share of gun-massaging. It was also nakedly DLC-driven and had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evolve-wot-i-think-in-progress-conclusion">a very grindy unlocks system</a>. But I'll forgive all that because it was somehow both a multiplayer stealth experience and a game in which one player is a giant monster, who must roam the map eating other wildlife until they have enough biomass to cocoon themselves and evolve. Meanwhile, the human hunters flit about with their silly jetpacks and tracking tools, trying to trap the monster inside an energy dome so that they can make proper inroads on its enormous healthbar.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun as the Goliath, Evolve's starting beastie. I used to hide in bushes and throw rocks at people, a tactic that has also served me well at company training events. I was also pretty good as the Kraken, an aerial lightning caster who can seed the map with electro-mines. Other multiplayer have done the many-versus-one bossrush format - the standout is probably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> - but few have done so on such a scale, with maps even Godzilla can get lost in. Sadly, Evolve is no longer officially available on PC. I'd love them to make a sequel that strips away some of the unlocks cruft and gives the fundamentals more chance to breathe. Come on, Turtle Rock. You could get Jesse Hutch to play the new Goliath. He's got the biceps for it. Perhaps the backflip puke could be one of his special attacks.</p>
<p>In the absence of such a prospect, I <em>guess</em> I'll keep an eye out for Back 4 Blood 2. If you're looking for the "glass half full" mentality here, Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-is-peak-00s-action-cheese-and-i-am-here-for-it">did quite like the original Back 4 Blood</a>. "This game is peak early-00s cheese," she wrote. "Not just because many of the enemies have the same texture as a fully loaded pizza."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I can't believe I let them do it to me again. A lost season, fine. That means I can check out, focus on hanging out with family and friends, and not let the scoreboard dictate my feelings. And yet. And yet. AND YET.

<p>Rebirth Island is arguably Warzone’s most classic, smaller battle-royale map. If you’re keen to be reunited and engage in heated Alcatraz action, the simultaneous nature of Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season One is ready to bring back Rebirth Island.</p>



<p>If you say “Rebirth Island” to any Warzone player from the last few years, chances are their eyes light up. Whereas Verdansk was—and is still is to many—peak performance where large-scale battle-royale contests are concerned, Rebirth Island is a necessary home away from home. Alcatraz isn’t the friendliest place on Earth, but it’s nice enough to let 40 or so players run amuck in rampant Resurgence fashion.</p>



<p>It’s a tighter map, but has just as many crawl spaces, and hideaway holes, and is a constant source of fun. Let’s find out when you can drop into Rebirth Island in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-rebirth-island-back-in-warzone-amp-black-ops-6">When is Rebirth Island Back in Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Where are we dropping? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rebirth Island makes its debut in the Black Ops 6 and Warzone integration on <strong>Nov. 18</strong>.</p>



<p>The small-scale map didn’t launch with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One</a>, but it was outlined in the roadmap that it would arrive in the “Launch Window.” This means barely a week after Season One starts, players are getting stuck into Urzikstan and the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/area-99-revealed-as-new-resurgence-map-in-warzone-at-codnext-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Area 99</a> map, and Rebirth Island is also making its way into regular playlist rotation.</p>



<p>Nostalgia is a unique feeling. Area 99’s legacy is yet to be determined, but for the time being, you can guarantee most Warzone players are licking their lips at the thought of dropping into Rebirth Island. With the addition of Omndirectional Movement and other Black Ops 6 features, this is going to be one of the most surreal Rebirth Island inclusions ever seen in Warzone.</p>



<p>Like in previous years, if you’re a fan of Rebirth Island, get your games in while you can. The playlists for Warzone change regularly: Meaning there are times when Rebirth Island misses a week, and it might be removed altogether in favor of another Resurgence map—I’m looking at you Fortune’s Keep.</p>

                <p>Nine years after release, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Rainbow Six Siege</a> will soon feature cross-play between PC and console. The feature will launch with the Year 9 Season 4 update on December 3, alongside anticheat updates to try and contend with PC cheaters.</p><p>Starting December 3, console players can join the PC player pool freely. That being said, PC players won't be able to join the console matchmaking pool. If you're in a party with at least one PC player, the group will be moved to the PC pool. For console users who play ranked playlists with cross-play active, they'll maintain a PC rank separate from the console rank.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1858231174130196758" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">💥 The full crossplay experience is coming to Siege in Operation Collision Point!<br>🎮 Console players, get ready to squad up with your PC pals. <br>Starting in Y9S4, you'll be able to choose to matchmake into PC lobbies as a console player. <br>🖥️ Will you be playing in the PC pool? <a href="https://t.co/0m0Do4WsFU" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/0m0Do4WsFU</a></p>  — Rainbow Six Siege (@Rainbow6Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1858231174130196758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Adding cross-play to a game that's almost a decade old demands some considerations, and the matchmaking quirks aren't the only ones. Developer Ubisoft is implementing anticheat updates to improve cheater detection to "ensure fairness" once cross-play comes in. As such, players with a Mousetrap Penalty, which is aimed at preventing console players from using mouse and keyboard, will be forced into the PC matchmaking pool for 90 days.</p><p>If said players turn off cross-play, they'll be unable to join matchmaking until they toggle the option back on. Moreover, any matches with a detected cheater will be automatically canceled with no impact on matchmaking rating. The Reputation Center is being overhauled to best reflect the actions that can lead to warnings or penalties. According to Ubisoft, details such as reputation, rank, and match replays will be concentrated in a new hub with account stats coming soon.</p><p>The Rainbow Six Siege Year 9 Season 4 update adds a new operator called Blackbeard, who carries a H.U.L.L. adaptable shield, balance changes for R.O.U. Projectors, Thunderbird's Kona Station, and ballistic shields, and a number of general tweaks. You can read the full details in the official season <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/seasons/collisionpoint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement post</a>.</p>

In the meantime, the jury made of global press outlets and content creators that selects the winners in each TGA category will cast their final votes from among the current lists of nominees. An online community vote from the general public will also take place, with the results contributing to 10 percent of the overall tallies.</p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thegameawards.com/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thegameawards.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new FAQ for the Game Awards</a></span> also recently revealed that expansions will be eligible for the top GOTY prize for the first time at the show. That obviously coincides with the release of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC this year, but also several other big expansions, including <em>Destiny 2</em>'s <em>The Final Shape</em>. With 2024 lacking clear frontrunners the likes of last year’s <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, and <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, maybe there’s room for FromSoftware’s update to 2022's GOTY to actually take home the gold in that category. </p><p>While ostensibly a time to celebrate some of the year’s biggest creative achievements in gaming, the event also doubles as a showcase for recent and upcoming releases, with viewers eagerly awaiting new game announcements, trailers, and world premiers in-between all of the heartfelt acceptance speech speedrunning. In recent years, not every winner has even had an opportunity to speak at the event, as the organizers make room for celebrity cameos and musical performances. One thing you can always count on at the Game Awards is that <em>Metal Gear</em> creator and Keighley pal Hideo Kojima will show up at some point and chat on stage for what seems like an eternity.</p><p> Here’s the full list of Game Awards 2024 nominees:</p><h2 id="h7467"><a id=""></a>Game of the Year</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Balatro </li><li>Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li></ul><h2 id="h7468"><a id=""></a>Best Game Direction</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Balatro</li><li>Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li><li>Metapahor: ReFantazio</li></ul><h2 id="h7469"><a id=""></a>Best Narrative</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </li><li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantanzio</li><li>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</li><li>Silent Hill 2 </li></ul><h2 id="h7470"><a id=""></a>Best Art Direction</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li><li>Neva</li></ul><h2 id="h7471"><a id=""></a>Best Score and Music</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li><li>Silent Hill 2</li><li>Stellar Blade</li></ul><h2 id="h7472"><a id=""></a>Best Audio Design</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li><li>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</li><li>Silent Hill 2</li></ul><h2 id="h7473"><a id=""></a>Best Adaptation</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Arcane</li><li>Fallout </li><li>Knuckles</li><li>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</li><li>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</li></ul><h2 id="h7474"><a id=""></a>Best Performance</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Briana White (Final Fantasy VII Rebirth)</li><li>Hannah Telle (Life is Strange: Double Exposure)</li><li>Humberly Gonzalez (Star Wars Outlaws)</li><li>Like Roberts (Silent Hill 2)</li><li>Melina Juergens (Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2)</li></ul><h2 id="h7475"><a id=""></a>Best Independent Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Animal Well</li><li>Balatro</li><li>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</li><li>Neva</li><li>UFO 50</li></ul><h2 id="h7476"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Debut Indie Game</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Animal Well </li><li>Balatro </li><li>Manor Lords </li><li>Pacific Drive </li><li>The Plucky Squire</li></ul><h2 id="h7477"><a id=""></a>Games for Impact</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Closer the Distance</li><li>Indika </li><li>Neva </li><li>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</li><li>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II </li><li>Tales of Kenzera: Zau </li></ul><h2 id="h7478"><a id=""></a>Best Role-Playing Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Dragon’s Dogma 2</li><li>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</li><li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li><li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li></ul><h2 id="h7479"><a id=""></a>Best Action/Adventure Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</li><li>Silent Hill 2</li><li>Star Wars Outlaws</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</li></ul><h2 id="h7480"><a id=""></a>Best Action Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Helldivers 2</li><li>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</li><li>Stellar Blade</li></ul><h2 id="h7481"><a id=""></a>Best Strategy Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Age of Mythology: Retold</li><li>Frostpunk 2 </li><li>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess </li><li>Manor Lords </li><li>Unicorn Overlord </li></ul><h2 id="h7482"><a id=""></a>Best Sports/Racing Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>F1 24 </li><li>EA Sports FC 25 </li><li>NBA 2K25 </li><li>Top Spin 2K25</li><li>WWE 2K24 </li></ul><h2 id="h7483"><a id=""></a>Best Multiplayer Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </li><li>Helldivers 2</li><li>Super Mario Party Jamboree </li><li>Tekken 8</li><li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</li></ul><h2 id="h7484"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Fighting Game</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/say-nothing-tells-a-complex-story-about-politics-and-violence.1038669/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/say-nothing-fx-hulu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As teens in the 90s, a high school history teacher introduced my sister and me to Irish politics. Names like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Pearse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Pearse</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Sands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bobby Sands</a> became common in our house, the music of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90539KQzPCE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black 47</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_nuOyxMrMQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfe Tones</a> blasting from our bumper sticker-covered car. FX’s new show <em>Say Nothing</em> has me thinking a bit more complexly about that time and what it means to idolize a cause.</p><p>The show, based on a 2018 non-fiction book, released its full nine episodes on November 14 on FX and Hulu. At first it seems like it tells two different stories, though it’s quickly obvious that they’ll converge: the 1972 kidnapping of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27234413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jean McConville</a>, a mother of 10 who was “<a href="https://www.iclvr.ie/en/iclvr/pages/thedisappeared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disappeared</a>” by the IRA; and the story of how sisters Dolours and Marian Price came to join the IRA, involvement that included a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Old_Bailey_bombing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London bombing</a> that saw the sisters go on hunger strike in prison. The narrative is structured around Dolours recording tapes for Boston College’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Belfast Project</a>, interviews with IRA members and others started after the <a href="https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/role-policies/northern-ireland/about-the-good-friday-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Friday Agreement</a> that the researchers promised would be kept secret until after participants’ deaths, giving them the freedom to say who had done what for an organization that <em>Say Nothing</em> drives home thrived on secrecy and silence.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Say Nothing | Official Trailer 2 | FX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FhxvEJV9xos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Besides teaching me a ton of history I knew nothing about (and a real “hey, did you know” fact in the form of: did you know actor Stephen Rea was married to an IRA member?), the show’s semi-dual narrative and long time frame lets it move beyond just telling a story of how Dolours and Marian become radicalized and what they do with that passion. While the action sort of peaks with the London bombings and their aftermath, the show keeps going: we see the interpersonal and political conflicts that arise as <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a62764745/say-nothing-hulu-gerry-adams-ira-disclaimer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged IRA leader</a> Gerry Adams becomes a politician (each episode ends with the note that Adams has always denied his involvement), and we see Dolours and Marian try to figure out how to live out their later years after their youthful fervor and its consequences. They struggle with the trauma of what they did for the cause and who they are if not front-line fighters, as well as anger over the Good Friday Agreement and whether it constituted a “win” for the IRA (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/07/how-did-the-good-friday-agreement-come-about-and-why-is-it-so-significant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> describes the Agreement as “a masterclass in constructive ambiguity, allowing all sides to agree to disagree and maintain their opposing goals.”).&nbsp;</p><p>If your parents, like mine, told me you’d get less radical as you got older, <em>Say Nothing</em> presents a nuanced if not sometimes depressing vision of how untrue that is. Dolours and Marian never waver in their commitment to the cause of Irish independence, but they do come to question their methods, especially regarding actions like McConville’s kidnapping, which seemed to go against the idea that the IRA was fighting for the Irish people. While the trailer above makes the show seem like it will be a romanticized action romp about girls in short skirts robbing banks, Dolours becomes a tragic figure in her later years: bitter and struggling with addiction, trying to find peace and figure out what was and wasn’t worth the harm and sacrifices. As someone who spends a lot of time wondering what it means to <a href="https://aftermath.site/lego-fortnite-cat-enters-his-queer-elder-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">age </a>as an activist, I found this moving and hard to watch, though also, in an odd way, inspiring, especially in regards to the Boston College tapes.</p><p>The whole <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/06/boston-college-tapes-fiasco-northern-ireland-troubles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">messy story</a> of the tapes is a bit of an afterthought to the show’s narrative, but is absolutely fascinating to me as a journalist. What is present comes back to this idea of silence from which the show takes its name, and which is what brings the McConville kidnapping into things. We see McConville’s daughter Helen spend years living with the neighbors she knows kidnapped her mother, living her daily life with the sense that everyone knows what happened but no one will tell her. This pain of the “civilian” side of the Troubles filters into the lives of the IRA members, and we see them come to question their commitment to closed ranks silence, especially as comrades and causes change. The tapes, then, represent both a betrayal of the values that caused them to commit the actions they confess to on the tapes, and a commitment <em>to</em> those values, in the form of seeing truth-telling as a way to get their cause back on track and be honest about what they did and why.</p><p><em>Say Nothing</em> does an excellent job of leaning into nuance without becoming wishy-washy. By following its characters through so much of their lives, it tells a story I don’t think we often hear about the entire life of radicals. It’s a story that felt particularly urgent to me personally, especially these days in America, and it also made me reflect differently on what I knew and believed about the IRA as a young person without pushing me toward a simplistic conclusion about non-violence or right and wrong. I came out of it with a whole list of books to read, maybe the highest praise I can give a piece of historical semi-fiction. Even if you don’t know much about Irish history, it’s well worth checking out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You were probably elated to see your leftover MW3 Double XP Tokens reactivated in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 fans, and equally as dismayed to see them vanish again. There is a reason why Activision has done this, but there is good news on the horizon.</p>



<p>Many Modern Warfare 3 players held onto their Double XP Tokens toward the end of the shooter’s lifecycle. This was to use them at the beginning of Black Ops 6 and get a big boost toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faster leveling up</a>. However, Activision and Treyarch decided to not carry legacy tokens over, leaving everyone to start from scratch.</p>



<p>It seemed the companies reneged on the decision with the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season One</a>. All Double XP legacy tokens suddenly became active—and I can’t express my joy at seeing hours of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double XP</a> in my grasp. In the blink of an eye, they were gone again—but don’t worry, all is not as bad as it seems.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Don’t tease me. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Black Ops 6 Double XP Tokens have gone because <strong>Treyarch has disabled them to due “potential risk to game stability.”</strong></p>



<p>It turns out you were not supposed to be able to access your Double XP legacy tokens in Black Ops 6, and this was an accident caused by a Season One launch “UI bug.” </p>



<p>Treyarch informed everyone of the situation via an <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1857856770804429277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X message on social media</a>, “With the start of Season 01, a UI bug allowed players to activate legacy XP tokens in Black Ops 6. Unfortunately, it also introduced some potential risk to game stability, which is why it was patched yesterday.”</p>



<p>In more positive news, the developer has acknowledged how important legacy Double XP Tokens are to the community: “We realize how much players appreciate being able to redeem legacy XP tokens in both BO6 and Warzone, so <strong>we are currently testing a way to implement this change correctly in a future update</strong>.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, like the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-prop-hunt-coming-to-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prop Hunt</a>, we don’t have an exact date this is scheduled to drop. All we can do is monitor Activision and Treyarch socials for the latest news on Double XP Tokens being usable in BLOPS 6 again.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-legacy-double-xp-tokens-in-black-ops-6">How to Use Legacy Double XP Tokens in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 legacy Double XP Tokens are usable if you <strong>activate them through the Warzone interface, and head on back over to the BLOPS 6</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, per Treyarch, “Players can activate any legacy XP tokens in Warzone. <strong>Any tokens applied in Warzone also apply to Black Ops 6</strong> should you switch titles or modes.”</p>



<p>So, if you’re looking to use carried-over Double XP Tokens, you need to have Warzone installed. It’s a cumbersome workaround—but a workaround nonetheless.</p>

This is the first part of a three-part series on combat-focused game balance design, exploring its evolution and showcasing successful case studies to illustrate key concepts and techniques.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As multiplayer gaming revenues continue to grow, recent research reveals that 47% of studios struggle to analyze and respond to the overwhelming volume of player feedback. In mobile games, nearly half of in-app purchases consist of currencies, which are deeply integrated into both the in-game economy and core gameplay. This raises a crucial question: how can developers effectively balance these increasingly complex multiplayer ecosystems to deliver the best possible player experience? Let’s shed some light on this topic, often seen as either black magic reserved for the initiated or the end product of years of brute force and trial-and-error — something we've witnessed even in well-funded triple-A games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Until 2010, while working as a contract-based Game Balance Designer for EA Los Angeles' RTS (real-time strategy) games division, I had the opportunity to lead balance patch development for some of their most renowned titles, like Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth I &amp; II, and in the pre-production phases of Command and Conquer 3 and 4. Those were exciting times, where I introduced what I called the 'Battletest system'. The system has two stages, first it focuses on on gathering feedback from controlled tests involving top players across the game's various factions. Then the balance designer combines statistical analysis with the good old 'gut feeling' to rapidly iterate patches and fine-tune these complex games to a fine state of perceived balance.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="How it started">How it started</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I began working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battle for Middle Earth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (BfME1) patch 1.03 as a collaborator, with no guarantee it would ever see an official release. EA’s strict review and approval process made patching expensive — around $50k per patch. Not a small investment for a game that had already launched, especially with another title in development, burning through its own budget. There were also concerns within the studio that relying on top players' feedback might lead to a gameplay style that could alienate lower-skilled players, who formed the basis of the player pyramid. I argued that top players were the ones being followed, setting trends and actually creating the optimal strategies, which would naturally trickle down to the broader player population over time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On gamereplays.org and other public forums, top players began openly praising and promoting the private "battletest" modded versions they had been testing in pre-arranged sessions, and were later released publicly as mods. To our team's surprise, EA embraced the project and decided to turn it into an official patch — something unprecedented at the time. After a month of rigorous back-and-forth with their internal and external QA teams, BfME patch 1.03 was officially released in February 25, 2006 to widespread acclaim. As anticipated, the strategies developed by the top players during the patch's creation took months for the general player base to master, leading to an unusually long period of balance stability. And let's be honest — high-skill players tend to be the most vocal and influential in the community, for good reason. When they praise a game’s balance, it's hard to argue against.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The second step is not always easier">The second step is not always easier</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next came </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battle for Middle Earth II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (BfME2), which posed an extreme challenge in terms of balance. With its six unique factions and over 1,600 unique data entries, balancing the game manually was practically impossible. To do it on time and within budget, I developed a specialized tool—the Battle Stats Reference (BSR) automated spreadsheet. Bear in mind, this was during an era when Excel reigned supreme, and there were no cloud-based alternatives. So I taught myself VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and, within two months, completed version two of BSR just in time for the actual battletest game sessions. While opening the spreadsheet on a modern (2021) version of Excel “kinda works,” some features — like the original floating control bar — no longer function properly. You can, however, see a screenshot of it in its full original glory below:</span></p><p>[[ BSR v2 Screenshot ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BSR managed the multiple "ini" data files used by EA's proprietary SAGE engine through separate, cross-referenced sheets. It could seamlessly import and export game data to and from these sheets without breaking internal data connections. This capability enabled rapid comparison and bulk editing of game parameters, leading to a tenfold increase in productivity.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding efficiency is not very efficient">Finding efficiency is not very efficient</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Simply editing and inputting numbers into the game wasn’t enough to achieve an initial raw-balanced version. I needed a solid (guess what?) strategy. My approach involved running a series of synthetic tests with two networked machines, each using different sets of units with roughly the same total cost, battling it out. I also defined a "base" or reference unit for each class, like the Rohan Rohirrim for cavalry and the Elven Lorien Archer for ranged units. By balancing these base units against each other, I could extend the results to other units within the same class, provided they were "internally balanced". Internal balance is accomplished among different units within the same class, and it requires a separate, later balancing pass. The real challenge was crafting an "efficiency" formula to distill a unit's battlefield effectiveness into a single number. Not only is there no standard formula for this somewhat subjective parameter, but RTS games also feature a wide variety of classes from swordsmen to pikemen and heroes, with tens or even hundreds of attributes for each unit type. Last but not least, factors like build time, movement speed, and weapon range each have different weights for efficiency, depending on the game's economy, map scale, and pace. At the end of the day, as with most complex systems, the key was to observe the synthetic game tests and back-fit an equation to match reality. And this led to the creation of this monstrous formula:</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">0.001 * [ DPS * (Range/160+(1/Range+1)) * Sqrt(60 / buildtime) * ((health*hordesize*(100/armor))/100) * (Arctan((speed/12)-4)+1.4)+speed/40)^2) ] / [ (cost^0.3)/10 ]</span></pre><p>[[ Efficiency Calculation for BfME 2 ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The formula didn’t start out that complex, of course. Initially, drawing from my own in-game experience, I prioritized range and speed as the key parameters for efficiency. Gradually, I compiled results from the synthetic tests into a separate chart and refined the formula to match those results as closely as possible, much like creating a trendline in a spreadsheet. Once the formula was reasonably aligned with the ninety-or-so base unit test results, I compiled the first patch version and shared it with our VIP testers. The formula continued to evolve based on feedback from those incredibly high-skill matches. Remember, tournaments weren’t as common back then, so top players rarely faced each other; their main goal was climbing the quickmatch ranks and avoiding tough matches that could hurt their ratings. Still, after venting out for so long about the weaknesses and imbalances in their favorite factions, these players were eager to give their all with a new, improved, and (temporarily) exclusive patch. I even created the "Palantir" series of videos to showcase some of the best moments from those intense, close games. You can watch one of them here:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBUrBjYg8og" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">[[ BFME Patch 1.03 - "Palantir" Episode III ]]</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Great success!">Great success!</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BfME 1.03 and BfME2 1.05 were met with an enormously positive reception and marked the last official patches released for those games. The community was so pleased that many players advocated that no further balance patches were needed. That's a testament to the incredible work done with the help of a dedicated group of players from around the world — many of whom leveraged their well-deserved recognition to kickstart their careers in the games industry, such as HERO (Larry King), prepare (Jan Richter), and James Fielding. I also want to give a special shoutout to Aaron Kaufman, "the" community manager, who championed the community leads within the studio and made all of this possible. And yes, he even flew us out to Los Angeles for some unforgettable "in-person battletests"! Amazing times.</span></p><p>[[ One of the many in-person battletest teams, that one for C&amp;C4 ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the next article, we’ll explore how real-time combat game balance design evolved throughout the late 2010s and how cloud-based solutions literally changed the game.

            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has announced a delay for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>'s release on PlayStation VR2.</p>
<p>The upcoming VR release, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-sonys-playstation-state-of-play">first announced back in September</a>, was initially slated for this December. It will now be released in March of next year.</p>
<p>IO's global marketing director Jonathan Lacaille said the decision to delay was "not made lightly", adding the studio understood there was "a lot of demand" for Hitman World of Assassination on PSVR2. However, the team wants to make sure it gets it right.</p>

<p>"Our priority will always remain to deliver an amazing experience that meets the high standards our players expect," Lacaille wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/hitman-world-of-assassination-launches-on-ps-vr2-march-27-2025/">PlayStation blog post</a>.</p>
<p>"The additional time will not only allow our team to polish the game, ensuring that every aspect is refined, immersive, and seamless, but also to add a few extras that we really wanted to include in this PS VR2 version, such as active reloading."</p><p>Hitman World of Assassination - which comprises the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-to-become-world-of-assassination-will-include-hitman-1-and-2">rebooted Hitman 1, 2 and 3 games</a> - will now release on 27th March. On its debut, it will feature all main levels from the trilogy, with dual-weilding support and other new controls and gameplay mechanics, such as "positional interactions". This, IO said, will transform how players experience the World of Assassination.</p>
<p>"Rather than simply pressing a button to trigger events, players are required to physically mimic actions, such as toggling a TV on or off by touching the screen, hacking CCTV footage by tapping on a keyboard, or poisoning a glass by holding and dropping a vial over it," Lacaille explained.</p>
<p>"This feature extends to opening doors, creating smoother and more natural interactions. Furthermore, quest items now remain physical and can be inspected in hand, allowing players to utilise them directly within set pieces - swiping a keycard or turning a lock in a door, for example."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-review.1038615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Continuing the theme of <em>Warhammer</em> entry-level board games to mass-market stores in the USA, we now have <em>Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack</em>. Aimed at beginner wargames, rather than veteran <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> players, this set sees a squad of Space Marines enter an abandoned space hulk to root out the Tyranid infestation there. In this article, we'll have a look at what's in the box, how it plays, and who the product is aimed at.</p>

<p>I feel that it's worth noting that I began my wargaming journey after playing some early edition roleplaying games in 1990, and then got a copy of <em>Space Crusade</em> and <em>Heroquest</em> and their expansions. A few years later I found myself inside a Games Workshop store in the North East of England for the first time, to buy some Space Marines with money I had saved up. A product had just been released that was perfect for me, I was told, and I left the store with <em>Tyranid Attack</em>, an incredible boxed set filled with Space Marine terminators, the lightly armored Space Marine scouts, and a mix of their alien opponents, the Tyranids. I was hooked. And now over 30 years later, I'm again playing what could be Tyranid Attack for a whole new generation of wargamers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-3.jpg?itok=4tJ_SgRQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-3.jpg?itok=tikcJBPY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>

<p><em>Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack</em> is an entry-level board game, that could lead to players exploring further into the wargaming world with full games of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, or <em>Kill Team</em>. This set contains 5 push-fit Space Marine miniatures, that push straight out of the sprues they come attached to, and slot together without glue, making them perfect for someone with no miniatures hobby experience. The miniatures themselves are 5 of the 7 that come from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-heroes-strike-force-justian-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Heroes set</a>&nbsp;and also feature in the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Starter Set</a>.</p>

<p>The game itself uses boards to represent the inside of the space hulk the Space Marines are exploring, along with tokens for the Tyranids and a whole host of cards that help run the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-2.jpg?itok=czix_TVS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-2.jpg?itok=TZjJhN8n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Do You Play Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack?</h2>

<p>I won't go into too much detail about how to play <em>Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack</em>, because the rules can be found in full on the games's <a href="https://start-warhammer.com/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack/" rel="nofollow">official webpage</a>, and Games Workshop has had a very thorough <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXGAqCw0Sm4" rel="nofollow">How To Play</a> video produced. The gameplay is extremely straightforward, with each turn's activations randomly determined by the activation deck. When Space Marines activate, they can move or attack, where they can move 1 square, or roll a single dice and try to equal or beat the target's resilience value. During the Tyranid's turn, they don't move and attack, but they spawn and slowly fill the corridors. If they have to spawn on a square containing a Space Marine, that marine is wounded (which flips their stat card over), and then the next time they are wounded they are removed. This focuses the gameplay on removing the Tyranid tokens, pushing them away from the marines, advancing on the mission objective, and then searching for an exit.</p>

<p>The game has 3 levels to play through, along with a linked campaign (of the same 3 levels), in which you use the campaign cards rather than the mission briefing cards for each level. There is also an advanced rules pack that includes Advanced Infestation, Challenge, and extra Tyranid Activiation cards to make games harder once you've got the hang of the core rules. To keep games interesting, even in repeat play, there are 28 special cards that contain equipment and special abilities for the marines. In each game, 2 are drawn for each marine, with one being kept and the other discarded.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-4.jpg?itok=ih-DYSRK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-4.jpg?itok=fLTfPeIr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Which Space Marines Can I Play In Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack?</h2>

<p><em>Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack</em> includes 5 different Space Marines that can be used, each with their own special rules and stats. In each game, 4 marines can be deployed, which adds variety to games as you work out which marines work well together, and suit different aspects of the missions.</p>

<ul><li>Sergeant Maximus - Maximus, with a high range and 4 actions, allows you to look at the top card of the Infestation deck, which lets you plan your turn with knowledge of what the enemy will do next.</li>
	<li>Brother Adrix -&nbsp; Adrix&nbsp;has a low range and 4 actions, gets to perform a free attack each turn&nbsp;against a non-adjacent enemy, effectively boosting their action stat.</li>
	<li>Brother Raphael - Raphael&nbsp;also with a low range and 4 actions adds 1 to the dice when attacking a Tyranid adjacent to him.</li>
	<li>Brother Lukas - Lukas&nbsp;with a high range and 3 actions gets a bonus frag or krak grenade every mission, after choosing their initial special card.</li>
	<li>Brother Vorne - Vorne has the highest range in the game and 3 actions, and adds 1 to his dice when attacking, except when the target is adjacent to him.</li>
</ul><p>For customers buying their copy of <em>Space Marine Adventure Tyranid Attack</em> from Target, they also get a bonus Lieutenant Titus card (from the <em>Space Marine 2 </em>video game). This is a card only, with the miniature being available exclusively in copies of the Target-only <em>Space Marine the Board Game</em>.</p>

<ul><li>Lieutenant Titus - Titus has the same stats as Brother Adrix, and has the same ability, but gets a free attack only against those adjacent to him.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-5.jpg?itok=NXLDAPN7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-adventures-tyranid-attack-5.jpg?itok=vNthi6DC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack?</h2>

<p><em>Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack</em> is a great entry-level game, with players playing solo or cooperatively to solve the ever-expanding puzzle of the Tyranid infestation. It felt weird as a wargamer that the Tyranids don't move or attack and players looking for that kind of interaction may also find this disappointing. For young gamers though, you do get to feel like a Space Marine wading gloriously through the slain Xenos enemies. The miniatures and gameplay make it perfect for a young gamer and whilst it's not <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, it does introduce some of the concepts like movement, range, and activations, whilst using the board to keep the concepts easy.</p>

<p>I would also like to have seen, even if it was just a couple, of push-fit Tyranid miniatures in this set, something to help add to the immersion. The tokens help keep the focus on the Marines, but with the lack of interaction, other than them spreading across the board, it would be nice to have seen some physical Tyranids. Games Workshop does produce miniatures for all the tokens represented xenos, so that could be the first hobby step for an aspiring gamer. It's also a minor point, but something I love about the design is that the compartment in the plastic inner storage that the miniature sprues originally come in, there are circular indents around the outside that the Space Marine miniatures slot into so they don't crash around during transport.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Space Marine Adventures Tyranid Attack?</h2>

<p>If you're looking for something to start yourself, or someone else as a gift, on a wargaming path, or simply as an easy-to-set-up and-play board game, then this is a solid game. If you're looking for something a little more advanced, then I would suggest the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set (which has the same push-fit miniatures for both factions in the game, with more advanced rules).</p>

I'm still bumbling, tumbling and blundering through the cavernous labyrinths of first-person spelunking sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>, in which you are an android exploring a series of enormous machines and sunken artificial habitats. I hope one day to level up from "bumbling, tumbling and blundering" to "running and jumping". Perhaps I'll even get as far as "speedrunning". But in the likely event that I plateau at "blundering", it's a relief to know that developer Rubeki Games has updated the game with an Explore Mode that makes certain sections dramatically easier.

Explore Mode "aims to smooth out very difficult spots for players that were expecting an atmospheric exploration game throughout". I have to confess, I wasn't expecting quite this much death myself - Lorn's Lure looks like a footloose open world gadabout in trailers, but in practice, there are quite specific ways of navigating its levels, and falling too fast kills you instantly. So it's nice that Rubeki has thrown in a few lifelines for butter-fingered parkourbots. The game is still plenty hard even with the aids - you'll need to keep your eyes peeled for the tiniest of ledges. The reward for doing so is that you get to explore a world that feels like cyberpunk Gormenghast.
</p>
<p>
Explore Mode is activated by ticking a box in the settings - Rubeki cautions that you shouldn't try to resume a chapter after turning Explore Mode off, as it may screw up your progress. Here's what it changes according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1417930/view/7285229827084255290?l=english">the Steam announcement post</a>, with spoiler tags:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
- <span tabindex="0">No more chases</span> (Chapter 3, Chapter 8)
- <span tabindex="0">More platforms in</span> Chapter 5 intro descent
- Chapter 6 <span tabindex="0">wind tower has more platforms to help with some of the difficult wind sliding parts</span>.
</p>
<p>
The highlight is Chapter 8, <span tabindex="0">since it's basically completely different, and even has a different ending so that it makes sense lore-wise</span>!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Rubeki adds that they're "open to expanding on this mode, so if you have other places that could use smoothing, just let me know."</p>
<p>I called Lorn's Lure the "anti-yellow paint game" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lorns-lure-is-the-anti-yellow-paint-game-a-joyful-and-maddening-exploration-of-sunken-megastructures">a recent journomusing</a>, commenting that it's been a while that I've played something that obliges me to pay such careful attention to the textures. There's still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1417930/Lorns_Lure/">a demo on Steam</a> if you're hovering on the edge of a purchase. Best not hover on the edge of things for too long in Lorn's Lure.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And that’s definitely the case across a host of first-party blockbusters like <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>, as well as third-party exclusives like <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>. Unfortunately, not every game is benefitting from its PS5 Pro update. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.co/4OjBayoOei&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.co/4OjBayoOei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry’s breakdown</a></span> of <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>’s visuals on the new hardware found “problematic image quality issues” in the 60fps performance mode in particular. Part of the issue appears to be how foliage and the new ray-tracing feature interact to create a “strobing” effect that makes it look like bushes are shimmering. <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em> was infamous for some launch-day visual issues as well, and many of its current problems on Pro appear to be related to a dynamic resolution that can dip as low as 720p. </p><p>When it comes to the <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake, the issue is that the PS5 Pro update still isn’t out and the game has weird shimmering problems in the meantime. Even without an official enhancement, the game should still look the same or slightly more stable thanks to the general boost from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-specs-list-enhanced-upgraded-games-elden-ring-1851688507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-specs-list-enhanced-upgraded-games-elden-ring-1851688507">console’s better specs</a></span>. Instead, players have been complaining for a week now in hopes that a fix will get announced by Bloober Team. “I absolutely adore this game and I cannot stop playing it even though I want to,” wrote one player. “A PS5 Pro enhancement is absolutely necessary in this case. The game feels great but it looks like crap.”</p><p>So what’s the hang-up? While there’s no official word yet on what’s causing these problems and if it’s on the games’ end or related to something with the PS5 Pro itself, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nib95_/status/1858256784114467053?t=Hd3TCehlc7dobmApMnzV0A&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nib95_/status/1858256784114467053?t=Hd3TCehlc7dobmApMnzV0A&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a current theory</a></span> among some owners is that the problems are caused by games with base resolutions below 1080p that are being upscaled by the Pro’s PSSR technology. Games that have higher base resolutions seem to have less trouble with the upscaling. </p><p>“I think it maybe shows that devs...should not just blindly add PSSR to a game unless they really look at the subjective output and say ‘this is a great win,’” <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s Alex Battaglia <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said during a recent video</a></span>. “Because if the current model cannot scale from a resolution this low and make it look good, they shouldn’t add it, right?” Currently,<em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> and <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which both run below 1080, also seem to have sub-optimal performance on PS5 Pro. </p><p>While there are dozens of games that are currently enhanced for PS5 Pro and not encountering these issues, as well as thousands more benefiting from the overall boost mode from the better hardware, it’s still a notable flaw for the console at launch, especially considering its hefty $700 price tag. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler isn't perfect in all titles due to some games reportedly using an older version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>Commenting on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/df-star-wars-jedi-survivor-ps5-pro-severe-image-quality-problems-but-rt-in-performance-mode-is-nice.1038024/page-4#post-131783178"> ResetERA forums</a> in a thread discussing the disappointing Star Wars Jedi: Survivor PS5 Pro update, a developer going by the name of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/koralsky.22833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koralsky</a> commented on the poor image quality produced by PSSR in certain titles, revealing that the difference in image quality between different games is caused by the different versions of the upscaler used. In regard to the latest entry in the Respawn series, the developer confirmed the game is using SDK 9, being an Unreal Engine 4 game, so the team couldn't implement the latest up-to-date version of the upscaler that requires SDK 10 or higher, and has possibly used the very first version, hence the bad image quality.</p>
<p>While Koralsky couldn't provide more details on how many iterations of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler are already available and how each version improves on the previous, they could confirm that users should expect IQ improvements in the second and third batches of PS5 Pro-supported games using PSSR. In a game the developer is currently working on, for example, one of the later versions of PSSR, but not the latest, is giving much better results in comparison to TSR and FSR, and, as such, they expect the upscaler to get in a much better state in six, twelve months, compared to the state it is in the first batch of PS5 Pro supported titles.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro console is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the recently released mid-generation system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

The Cloudflare Workers tech lead has spent more than three years and at least a million dollars to <a href="https://lanparty.house/">transform his Austin house</a> into the ultimate local PC gaming pad, complete with 22 machines and a dedicated hardware room. It’s dubbed the LAN Party House, and you’re probably not invited.</p><p>LAN (short for local area network, as many readers likely know) parties were the best option for “online” gaming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/just-a-bunch-of-idiots-having-fun-a-photo-history-of-the-lan-party/">in the era of dial-up internet</a>. While some are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/1/2603289/dreamhack-winter-2011-120-gbps-connection-lan-party">large-scale events</a>, Varda’s house is aimed at having groups of friends drop by, pull a gaming station out of a hidden wall or table panel, and start playing.</p><p>Much of the house was specifically designed to hold PCs. There’s a basement room with 12 gaming stations built into folding wall cabinets, two call rooms equipped with their own gaming stations for private meetings, and an office space used for board games. A large table in the latter also unfolds to reveal an additional six gaming PCs plus two personal workstations. (In case you’re wondering, each PC contains an Intel Core i5-13600 CPU, a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, and 32GB of RAM.)<em> </em></p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>Each gaming station is housed in folding cabinets that convert into individual desk setups.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Kenton Varda</cite></p></div></div><p>Some of these machines are discrete desktops, but most are monitors that connect to a central room that holds and cools the towers. Varda says the 22 PC stations collectively cost about $75,000, but the full-house project was “a 7-digit number.”</p><p>Varda — who’s apparently hosted LAN parties as frequently as every other weekend —&nbsp;says most of the people who drop by are “not actually hardcore gamers.” They focus on team-based games like <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>or the non-deathmatch modes of <em>Unreal Tournament 2004. </em>One room also includes four built-in <em>Dance Dance Revolution </em>(DDR) pads. These aren’t public events — “sorry, you must be invited,” Varda says. “I’m sure you understand: For security reasons, we can’t just let random people on the internet into our house.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Four DDR stations are also embedded into the floor for any emergency dance-offs.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: <a href="https://lanparty.house/">Kenton Varda</a></cite></p></div><p>This is actually the second LAN party house that Varda has created, having <a href="https://newatlas.com/google-engineer-builds-ultimate-lan-party-house/20833/">completed a previous property in Palo Alto, California in 2011</a> that went similarly viral. That 1400 square-foot house was smaller than his latest property according to Varda, who says it “made for a pretty awesome bachelor pad, but would have been a bit cramped for raising a family.” He lives in this house with his two children and his wife, entrepreneur Jade Wang — who’s apparently a <em>DDR</em> fan. The new place was funded with money from the pair’s long career in tech, as well as the $1 million in profit he apparently got when selling the old house. It’s far from the worst thing you can spend a tech industry windfall on.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption><em>The actual PCs remotely wired and housed in this dedicated engine room that requires its own A/C intake.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Kenton Varda</cite></p></div></div><p>Varda acknowledges that this setup isn’t exactly the classic LAN party model. And in fact, his first house was built to let people bring their own machines. “Nobody ever did,” he notes. “Not once.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After nine years, Rainbow Six Siege is finally getting crossplay between PC and Console players. The news was announced as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4tB2kOgWqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Collision Point</a> reveal on Sunday.</p>



<p>When playing online, players on console will have three different pools to choose from when looking for a match. There will be platform-specific pools to keep you against those on the same system, a consoles-only pool to allow crossplay between PlayStation and Xbox, and a PC crossplay pool. The pool can be set in the general settings under “Crossplay Matchmaking”.</p>



<p>As far as the players are concerned, they’ll be able to invite anyone to a match through Ubisoft Connect. Those on console who decide they want to play with PC players will have a separate PC rank from their traditional console rank for ranked playlists.</p>







<p>With the addition of crossplay between the platforms, the team knows that cheating is a concern. It’s something that the developers have been working on handling before the feature became available.</p>



<p>“We are excited to confirm that MouseTrap V2 will be a part of this feature to keep things balanced,” UX Designer Abhishek Agarwal said. </p>



<p>Creative Director Alexander Karpazis added that the system will allow detection if someone is trying to play with a mouse and keyboard against just console players that will move players to the PC pool if they are detected. Regarding cheating, there is a new “Cheater Match Cancellation” system that will remove a cheater from the game and cancel the entire match if one is detected.</p>



<p>What do you think of Rainbow Six Siege getting full crossplay support? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
