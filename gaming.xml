            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The new Horizon 20 lineup of 4K Google TV projectors from Xgimi targets gamers who want to play day and night on the biggest screen possible. In addition to promising an incredibly bright image from the flagship model, Xgimi is at IFA 2025 saying the entire lineup supports low-latency gaming with an input lag of just 1ms — that’s very responsive for a projector that will likely be able to produce a large image in rooms where you can’t control the ambient lighting.</p><p>The Horizon 20 lineup — compromised of the base Horizon 20 model, the 20 Pro, and 20 Max — is built around an RGB triple laser architecture. The flagship Horizon 20 Max projector can produce an astounding 5700 ISO lumens of brightness, according to Xgimi, which is “perfect for viewers who want immersive visuals even in daylight or high-ambient light environments.” That puts it just behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767898/dangei-6200-lumen-projector-specs-date">Dangbei’s 6200 ISO lumen claim</a> for its S7 Ultra Max projector. The Horizon 20 Pro model can still produce a very respectable 4200 ISO lumens while the base model drops it down to 3100 ISO lumens, according to Xgimi.</p><p>Chinese projector makers have <a href="https://www.projectorcentral.com/xgimi-downgrades-lumens-following-epson-complaint.htm">gotten into trouble for misleading customers</a> on brightness in the past, but that was before they started measuring brightness in ISO lumens — a legitimate measurement that often yields a number slightly smaller than tests conducted using the ANSI standard. 5,700 ISO lumens is so high that it’s in the range associated with projectors meant for large spaces that cost well over $10,000. Nevertheless, Xgimi tells me that it’s confident that reviewers and users will see this performance reflected in practice.</p><p>Xgimi’s projectors also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and IMAX Enhanced modes, with the inclusion of optical zoom and lens shifting tech. Lens shift works by physically adjusting the position of the lens relative to the DMD chip, allowing the image to move up, down, left, or right without distorting or scaling it digitally.</p><p>These projectors support a 240Hz refresh and VRR to match the output of a gaming console or PC. However, that 1ms response is only at 1080/240fps — lag increases to 2.2ms at 1080p/120Hz or 3ms at 4K/60Hz. Xgimi also claims a 10,000:1 contrast ratio when a dynamic black level enhancement mode is turned on. Netflix works out of the box which isn’t guaranteed with all-in-one projectors, and you get 24W of built-in Harman Kardon Speakers for 360-degree sound.</p><p>The Horizon 20 lineup can be preordered in the UK and US starting on September 5th with shipments expected in October. Retail pricing will range between $1,699 for the base model and $2,999 for the Horizon 20 Max. However, temporary early bird pricing at launch drops that range down to $1,189 to $2,399, and you also get a floor stand and an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game code.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/766515/xgimi-bright-4k-projector-targets-daytime-gamers#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTEy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Thomas Ricker</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/766515/xgimi-bright-4k-projector-targets-daytime-gamers]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> developers Firaxis have undergone a "staff reduction" affecting an unspecified number of workers today, publishers 2K have confirmed to RPS.</p>
<p>News of the cuts broke via a series of posts from now former Firaxis writer Emma Kidwell. "I was affected by the layoffs at Firaxis, and am open to full time writing work at your studio," she wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369382797020463105/">LinkedIn</a>. "I'm an incredibly adaptable writer who wrote on Civilization VII and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-midnight-suns">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a> during my (nearly) 5 years at the studio, and I encourage you to keep an eye out for my former colleagues who were also laid off."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Responding to RPS' outreach about the post, a 2K spokesperson provided the following statement: "We can confirm there was a staff reduction today at Firaxis Games, as the studio restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that 2K's policy is not to disclose specifically how many staff are affected by layoffs. The timing of the layoffs seems worth noting, with Kidwell posting not long after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release arrived and sucked up a lot of attention.</p><p>Firaxis have previously laid off staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xcom-and-civilization-studio-firaxis-games-suffers-a-round-of-layoffs">back in 2023</a>, when 30 employees were let go as part of a wider cost-reduction programme at 2K parent company Take-Two. Since then, Firaxis have released Civilization 7, which garnered mixed reception out of the gate, with players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/improving-civilization-7s-ui-is-the-top-priority-say-firaxis">criticising the user interface</a> among other features. Firaxis have worked to release a bunch of updates and patches since, both tweaking areas of the game folks haven't meshed with, and adding some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mighty-civilization-7-update-adds-huge-maps-but-beware-your-pc-might-struggle-to-run-them">huge maps</a>.</p>
<p>Greg Costikyan wrote the following in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Civ 7 review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Civilization 7, as currently constituted, has some real flaws – and though I expect they may be fixed in future updates (and there are workarounds), some of this is a little sloppy. The most basic issue is: combat sucks. Before we get to why, let's first talk about some of Civilization 7's big new ideas. It’s pretty clear that the main design concern this time is to address two criticisms of the earlier iterations. In fact, the game is successful on that score.</blockquote>
<p>Our best to the Firaxis staff affected by these layoffs.</p>

              <p><em>Puzzle Quest</em>, the match-3 RPG that invented and defined the genre to this day, is finally receiving the love and care it deserves. For the first time, the game—and its many additions—is getting a remaster, boosted to HD, and released to run properly on your personal favorite gaming platform. Even better, it’s out as soon as September 18!</p> <p>In 2007, when Steam was just a tiny baby, a match-3 RPG sprang out of nowhere.&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, by developers Infinite Interactive, casually invented an entire new genre, and immediately did it better than anyone else ever would. It was an early smash hit on Steam, before even the launch of&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em> on the digital platform made the rest of the world take notice of Valve’s store, walking through the door PopCap had opened just months earlier with&nbsp;<em>Peggle</em>. And wow it was great.</p> <p>Of course match-3 games were already a big deal. PopCap’s&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em> had taken care of that years earlier, following of course the path from&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em> to&nbsp;<em>Dr. Mario</em> to&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Bobble</em>. 1994 Russian DOS game <em>Shariki</em> takes the title of the first true match-3 game, but it was 2001’s&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em> that brought the concept into the mainstream, followed by the likes of the blissfully wonderful&nbsp;<em>Zoo Keeper</em> on DS in 2003. So by 2007, while it was still long before King’s&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-to-play-instead-of-candy-crush-saga">would ruin&nbsp;<em>everything</em></a> with its free-to-play shenanigans, a billion&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled&nbsp;</em>clones meant match-3 was everywhere. It only took a genius to say, “Yes, but what if it were an RPG?”</p>

 <p>That’s&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, where the matching of the three becomes an aggressive act, used to attack your computer opponent in battles with spells and wallops, while collecting treasure and just generally feeling a zen marvelousness. In between each match, you moved around a properly RPG-like map, talked to D&amp;D-like characters, and were told a story that gave meaning and purpose to your puzzling. This was largely thanks to the&nbsp;<em>Warlords</em> setting created by <em>Puzzle Quest </em>lead Steve Fawkner, an RPG gaming series that began in 1990 with the eponymous <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6845/warlords/"><em>Warlords</em></a>. It was just splendid, and best of all, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12500/PuzzleQuest_Challenge_of_the_Warlords/">can still be bought and played today</a>. (Should Steam ever recover from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, anyway.) But man, it looks like a stray dog some 18 years later, which is why I’m so damned delighted about the reveal of&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Immortal Edition</em>.</p>  <p>This new revision includes the game’s 2008 expansion <em>Revenge of the Plague Lords</em>, as well as the new content that was created for the 2019 Switch port,&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: The Legend Returns</em>. On top of that, there’s a new class being added, and the mysterious addition of “much more.” And gosh, it looks so shiny and new, and yet as wonderfully cluttered as it always was. This is being developed by Infinity Plus Two, the rebrand of the original Infinity Interactive that appeared in 2019, presumably with Steve Fawkner still at the helm.</p>

 <p>Best of all, this is proper old-fashioned match-3 gaming, without all the microtransaction bullshit and ad-fueled misery that dominates the genre today. Infinity also created the extraordinary&nbsp;<em>Gems of War</em>, a live-service re-imagining of the same format that’s still receiving huge updates and new content ten years after its launch. (My 10-year-old recently became astonishingly obsessed with it, and plays at a level I cannot fathom, but that comes with the constant disappointment of my refusing to pay for all three of its simultaneous battle passes every month, let alone the eight trillion “offers” it pops up with as you’re playing. (I pay for one battle pass, I’m not a monster.))</p> <p>Of course&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em> went on to receive its own sequels, including numbered follow-ups&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3 </em>and&nbsp;a sci-fi version called <em>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</em>, as well as F2P-riddled <em>Marvel Puzzle Quest</em> developed by Demiurge Studios. There was even a&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering – Puzzle Quest</em>, although I admit I’d never heard of that one until researching for this article. It’d be lovely to see&nbsp;<em>PQ 2 </em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, and perhaps even&nbsp;<em>Galactrix</em> getting the same treatment soon. Let’s hope this first game’s rebirth is enough of a success. It’s coming out on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and X/S, Switch and PC (no word on a mobile version yet), so there are plenty of ways to play it come September 18.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-star-lego-set-big-1000-expensive-leak-images-star-wars-2000616943">After rumors and leaks</a>, Lego has officially released all the information on its upcoming Death Star diorama set. And yes, the rumors are true, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Lego’s next big<em> Star Wars</em></a> set will cost an eye-watering $1,000, making it the most expensive set in the company’s history when it goes on sale in October.</p> <p>Officially known as (<em>deep breath</em>)&nbsp;the<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/death-star-75419?cmp=REF-202509-Death_Star_Laun"> LEGO® <em>Star Wars</em>™ Death Star™ – Ultimate Collector Series (75419)</a>, this new Death Star set is nearly 2 feet tall and over a foot wide. The big diorama contains over 9,000 Lego pieces and an astonishing 38 <em>Star Wars</em> minifigs. Yowza, that’s a lot of characters! Lego even tossed in a Stormtrooper wearing swimtrunks <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2025/september/lego-star-wars-unveils-the-ultimate-death-star-set#:~:text=As%20a%20playful%20nod%20to%20the%20LEGO%20Star%20Wars%20video%20games%2C%20the%20set%20also%20includes%20a%20stormtrooper%20minifigure%20in%20a%20hot%20tub.">as a nod to the <em>Lego Star Wars</em> games</a> and the famous hot tub Easter Egg. Other characters include Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Wulf Yularen, The Emperor, and various versions of Luke Skywalker.</p> <figure><figcaption>Lego / Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p>The large set contains multiple rooms that are each based on moments from the movies. It is a bit weird to see the famous trash compactor scene from <em>A New Hope</em> recreated in the same Death Star build that features Luke and Darth Vader fighting in the throne room from<em> Return of the Jedi</em>. I’ll just ignore these discrepancies and enjoy the massive set for what it is: A cool assortment of famous <em>Star Wars</em> moments contained inside a very expensive collection of plastic bricks.</p>

 <p>If you want to buy the Lego Death Star set, well first off, you’ll need $1,000. Once you have that, congrats. If you are a Lego Insider member, you’ll be able to order the Death Star set starting on October 1. Everyone else has to wait until October 4. And if you buy the set before October 8, you’ll get a Lego <em>Star Wars</em> TIE Fighter set as an additional gift with purchase. The TIE Fighter can be built and slotted into the Death Star set.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-tie-bomber-2023-review-75347-minifigs-1849950293">I’m a big<em> Star Wars</em> nerd and Lego sicko</a>, but I won’t be buying the Death Star set because I can’t in good conscience spend that much money on a single Lego set. I have too many other problems and things in my life that I could use that money on instead. Still, I’ll be curious to see how well this Death Star set sells in October. $1,000 is a hefty price tag and this set seems like Lego testing just how much money they can squeeze from collectors and fans using the power of nostalgia and exclusive minifigs. If it succeeds, I expect a few more $1,000 sets in the future.</p>

            <p>
Two years on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2025">FM25</a>'s initial announce, we finally have our first proper look at actual gameplay from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a>, the game that supplanted it after FM25's troubled and ultimately cancelled development.
</p>
<p>
It's only a brief tease for now: a one minute, 12 second trailer focusing on footage from the new match engine, developed in Unity for the first time. Here's that trailer for you to have a look:

</p>
<figcaption>Here's the FM26 teaser reveal trailer in full.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cDQi5kwuHQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>
An immediate stand-out is the level of visual detail. Stadiums and crowds are significantly improved, looking a bit like a FIFA game from the mid-00s. That might sound like an insult, or back-handed compliment at best, but the differences in what these two types of game are doing under the hood are stark - and Football Manager has to run on significantly less powerful hardware at the same time.
</p><p>
As for other changes, you can read much more in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-football-manager-interview-series-boss-miles-jacobson-on-what-went-wrong-with-fm25-and-what-to-expect-from-fm26">our massive Football Manager 25 and 26 interview</a> with series boss and Sports Interactive studio head Miles Jacobson from just a few days ago, where he details the anatomy of an annualised game cancellation in full - from exactly what happened with FM25, to telling Sega about the need to pull the plug, and then what to expect from FM26 itself. We've a little extra from that interview to come too, so keep your eyes on the site for more Football Manager goodness.

<p>"When adventurer Lara Croft discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam to retrieve the precious artifacts," reads the season two description. "Lara's thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodging the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine."</p>
<p>Hayley Atwell returns for the second season as the voice of Lara Croft, as does Earl Baylon as Jonah. Joining the cast this season is Karen Fukuhara, who is known for The Boys and Suicide Squad. Fukuhara will voice Sam, a character first introduced in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ea-sports-college-basketball-game-is-no-more-as-ea-loses-out-to-2k.1288995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This past June, EA teased that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-return/">it would be bringing back its series of College Basketball games</a>, nearly two decades since the last NCAA basketball game. Now, as first reported by <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/ea-sports-college-basketball-may-be-in-big-big-trouble">Extra Points</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-walks-away-from-developing-college-basketball/">Insider-Gaming</a>), EA Sports College Basketball is no more, with the schools EA was in talks with choosing to take a deal with 2K Sports to be included in its NBA 2K games, and EA rescinding its offer.</p>



<p>With the success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/">EA's College Football games,</a> it wasn't a surprise that the company would try to expand that to other sports, especially since it already had a history of NCAA basketball games. It also isn't a surprise that other major publishers, like Take-Two and its subsidiary 2K, weren't blind to the success EA was seeing and would try to move in on collegiate sports-based games in its own way.</p>



<p>In a memo from EA Sports' vice president of commercial partnerships and licensing, Sean O'Brien, obtained by Extra Points, O'Brien confirms that EA is pulling out of its talks with the US colleges and universities that would have participated in an EA Sports College Basketball game.</p>



<p>"<em>Given there are some schools choosing to accept the 2K Sports proposal for inclusion in NBA 2K, the offer to be included in a college basketball video game will unfortunately have to be rescinded,</em>" the memo reads.</p>



<p>"<em>Everyone at EA Sports is disappointed that we all couldn't find an acceptable path forward, but we appreciate your support in trying to bring a standalone college basketball game with an all men's and women's Division 1 institutions and student athletes, conferences as well as the NCAA, in a way that fans have told us they want. We really appreciate your support. Good luck with back to school and an exciting start to the football season. Thanks, Sean O'Brien."</em></p>



<p>It's unfortunate news for fans of EA's NCAA games, but just like in sports, EA can't win them all. O'Brien's comment on football season instead of basketball season also doesn't seem misplaced, as EA can at least hold on to the fact that its College Football games continue to sell well.</p>

<p>Fans waiting for crossplay in Rematch will have to wait a bit longer. With Rematch patch 3 set to release on Thursday, September 4, developer Sloclap has announced that they had to delay its launch in order to investigate a new issue that appeared.</p>



<p>The third major patch for Rematch was originally planned for September 3 but was delayed to September 4 at the last minute to fix two bugs that were found during final testing. With the new date set, another major issue was found causing yet another delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-rematch-patch-3-be-released">When Will Rematch Patch 3 Be Released?</h2>



<p>In a message on the game’s official Discord, Sloclap said that during final testing, <strong>“a significant number of testers were stuck in matchmaking, unable to cancel or restart the process”</strong> when crossplay was enabled in Rematch. This issue, they said, has led to the decision to delay the update again due to crossplay being <strong>“at the core of this update”</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>“We know this is very disappointing news and we share your frustration,” </strong>Sloclap said. <strong>“Our recent track record with patch stability hasn’t been up to standards, and we don’t want to release a patch that will introduce new issues.”</strong></p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Our focus right now is on resolving this matchmaking issue as quickly as possible. At the same time, we’re actively working on improving our production pipeline so that future updates are delivered with the quality and reliability you deserve – and more importantly, we will refrain from announcing release dates until we are absolutely certain that we can deliver the updates on time.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no new date has been set for Rematch Patch 3. When that is announced, it will be posted here on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>What do you think of Sloclap delayed Rematch Patch 3 with crossplay?  Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In Unlocking the Vault, Game Developer editor-in-chief Danielle Riendeau dives into the rich archives of the GDC Vault in order to uncover timeless game development advice, anecdotes, and hard-learned lessons tucked away within the hundreds of talks from decades of GDC shows preserved within the Vault. Every other week, this curated overview will feature key takeaways from a vintage or classic GDC Talk with the goal of helping today's developers unearth new lessons from the past.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Welcome to our first edition of Unlocking the Vault, a new series here at Game Developer where we'll take a look at classic (or modern classic) talk from the Game Developers Conference archives through a modern game development lens and share lessons developers can learn from and apply to their current projects. Think of it as an enthusiastic trip to GDC's massive library, so we can pull a book off the shelf and jot down some inspiration and practical advice from devs who solved development problems successfully in the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wanted to start this column off with a bang, indeed, with one of my favorite "classic" GDC talks on embracing limitations and the power of gestural prototyping! This is Chair entertainment group creative director </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1012225/Designing-Shadow">Donald Mustard's GDC 2010 talk on Designing Shadow Complex</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and like a well-loved VHS tape, I feel like I learn something new with each viewing. I've been teaching a Principles of Game Design course at the Berklee College of Music for just over ten years now, and I show this talk to my students on the regular. The principles showcased are so universal, and applicable to devs of various experience levels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the presentation contains some (often charming) signs of the times—especially the use of Adobe Illustrator for "paper" mapping and constant references to extreme file size limitations in the Xbox Live Arcade era—it has great evergreen design advice, particularly for the prototyping process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Get everyone on the team to play the game—on paper">Get everyone on the team to play the game—on paper</h2><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnRT2R0yt6c?si=0J4KAZEn6z5gzH31" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the talk, Mustard compares early paper mapping to the filmic technic of creating animatics, and notes the team's process was to "gesture it all in" and get moving on world and level design as early as possible, to find the core game loop. Instead of busting out the cardboard and markers, the team used good old Adobe Illustrator for the early mapping. He pulls up the raster-based document that shows the entire game, as envisioned in the first couple of weeks of the process.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team spent those weeks constructing the full map on the Illustrator grid, with every room in the game represented, and designed a little guide (showing specific limits for each ability, such as the double and triple jump height), that they would take through and "playtest" the map. Importantly, Mustard notes that every team member would take the map for a spin, and that the process was absolutely integral in determining the core gameplay loop for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow Complex</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Essentially, everyone was playtesting before they were even dreaming of a playable build, and that made all the difference.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also enormously entertaining: watching Mustard joyously describe the rather "imaginative" playthroughs of his colleagues in meetings, he runs through the map, swooping the stick figure guide around with the practiced flow of a speedrunner:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So, this is like... the funnest game that will never get released!" he laughs, bringing the "guide" through a narrow tunnel onscreen. "We'd sit there in meetings and be like 'yeah I went through and I shot that guy in the head! Then I jumped up here, and then I went back!'" He laughed, noting the paper "playthroughs" were "ridiculous," and a lot of fun, and more than anything, extremely useful: "But we learned a lot by going through this process because it really helped us to define what our core gameplay loop was."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Paper playtesting and grayboxing show the power of &quot;gesture it all in&quot;&nbsp;">Paper playtesting and grayboxing show the power of "gesture it all in"&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He then shows the same narrow passageway in-engine, in a very early graybox stage. The team worked hard to "throw everything in" in-engine and again, the whole team played the earliest graybox levels, which Mustard noted was key for finding the game's pacing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are other lessons for modern teams in this condensed 30 minute nugget of mid-naughts development advice, including tenets for running a lean operation (constantly cutting!), keeping constraints in mind at all times, and integrating systems for more emergent, satisfying gameplay (Mustard notes he wishes the team was able to take this even further, in hindsight).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But if there's one thing every developer can take from the talk, it's this: embrace the call to "gesture it all in!" Make ugly, simple maps (heck, maybe even in raster drawing program of choice) and have the time of your life playing them alongside every colleague, no matter their role, finding the fun at every possible corner.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unlocking the key takeaways">Unlocking the key takeaways</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you want the sparknotes version of the talk—or you're just outlining some of the major lessons in your notes—don't worry, I've got you!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key takeaways here are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #1: Make Ugly Simple Maps </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(and have the whole team play them like they are real), lending to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #2: Play Paper Prototypes Promptly.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC Vault are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trucker">Star Trucker</a>, Raw Fury's answer to what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2%3EEuro%20Truck%20Simulator">Euro Truck Simulator</a> might look like in the year 3000, is now a year old, and has celebrated that fact with an update that finally lets you whip out your wheel and pedals.</p>
<p>Ever since I gave it a go with a controller prior to letting my Game Pass subscription crumble into dust, this is a day I've yearned for. After all, what good are truck sims, be they Euro, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American</a> or something more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">Snowrunner</a>y, if you're not operating the controls of your great metal haulage beast by flicking flappy gearbox paddles, or sawing away at a circle clearly designed for something a bit sportier?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's what this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2380050/view/497205194887528952?l=english">anniversary update</a> for the interstellar hauler delivers, with wheels like the Thrustmaster T128 and flight sticks like VKB's Gladiator NXT EVO being early additions to the devs' handy <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z_f-lbxQgzQ87M4tpjXOjAFcS3kEX27alN8surU7fM/edit?gid=0#gid=0">tracking sheet</a> of tested peripherals. There's also a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3560846829&amp;snr=1_5_9_">guide</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2380050/discussions/0/596285020004455725/?snr=1_5_9_">FAQ rundown</a> from Raw Fury to help folks get their hardware up, running, and fully bound to all the inputs space trucking requires.</p>
<p>Gear recognised by the game should set itself up with default bindings automatically, but I usually find creating my own basic set of essential buttons not that time-consuming, as long as the game wants to acknowledge your wheel exists. Just remember to bind a pause button, and stick the handbrake somewhere your finger can easily hold it when you want to see if your rig can finish a delivery with a 10/10 skid.</p><p>As a counterweight to all the wheel and pedal lorry mischief I planned the minute I clocked this update, it also comes with new speed checks. Yep, cameras, fines, the works. These camera checkpoints along the trails of the galaxy will even show you what speed you're doing as you pass them, though the notes don't mention if you get shown a little smiley face for not blasting through a Jupiter school zone at 120mph. You can also disable these checks via the settings, if the threat of having to attend a speeding course with the crowd from the Mos Eisley cantina is just too much.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there are a couple of updates to trailers, and a couple of optional truck goodies to commemorate the game's first birthday. The latter includes a hologrammatic image of a cake you can display in your cab. Just remember to eat plenty before your next long haul.</p>
<p>If you've not given Star Trucker a go, our Nic dubbed it "a game that's much more about the 'trucker' of it all than the stars, but the trucker of it all really does shine" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-trucker-review">his review</a>, writing:</p>
<blockquote>When you exit the airlock to patch up hull breaches, little white spanner icons mark the offending damage. The symbol that marks the airlock to return to your truck is a home. I noticed it early, and then I kept noticing it. The more I did, the more perfect it felt.</blockquote>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to oversteer that home into an asteroid belt.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose Yourself in Super Wide Worlds</h2>
<p>This ultra-wide 49-inch display is essentially two monitors glued together side by side. It’s maximum display resolution clocks in at 5120 by 1440 pixels. The screen is curved at 1800R which better reflects our vision of the world around us. The super fast refresh rate of 240Hz will help you achieve fast framerates speeds.

It can detect when you’ve plugged in a new source or turned on a connected device, automatically switching inputs over to it so you can get into things right away. Heck, you can even choose to display video from two different sources side-by-side. Two different PCS can each take up half the screen with picture-in-picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">For a limited time, Amazon has this absolute behemoth of a gaming monitor on sale for nearly half off.</a> The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 49-inch display normally goes for $1,600. Right now, that’s down to just $900, saving your a whole $700.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-how-long-completionist-achievement-2000623157</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-achievement-hints-at-a-much-bigger-game.1288953/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite all of the hype, little is known about what’s actually in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Developer Team Cherry has been confidently tight-lipped about all of the secrets hiding inside it’s latest Metroidvania Soulslike. But a list of achievements and trophies for the sequel hints at just how much bigger than the original game it might be. The short answer: a lot.</p> <p>Before even playing the game you can look at a list of <em>Silksong</em>‘s achievements (or trophies on PlayStation 5). One in particular provides an interesting clue about the larger scope. As <em>Game File</em>‘s Stephen Totilo <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3lxzeygtav22i?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fkotaku.com%252Fwp%252Fwp-admin%252Fpost-new.php">pointed out</a> on Bluesky, the “speed completion” achievement requires players to hit 100 percent completion in under 30 hours. A similar achievement in the first Hollow Knight only gave players 20 hours.<em> Does that mean Silksong</em> is roughly 33 percent bigger than its predecessor?</p> <p>Maybe!</p>    <p>Mind you, the above achievement is effectively for a 100 percent speedrun, not an average playthrough. Most players have taken <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/26286">around 27 hours</a> to beat <em>Hollow Knight</em>‘s main campaign and up to 64 hours to defeat every boss and find last secret. Assuming Team Cherry is keeping the completionist achievement in <em>Silksong</em> just as difficult to get, we might expect it to take, on average, 10-30 hours longer to do everything there is to do in the game.</p>

 <p>While just a speculative guesstimate, the assumption aligns with some of what Team Cherry hinted at <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">in their first and only pre-release interview</a>. When explaining why the sequel took seven years to make, the developers said part of the reason was that they just couldn’t stop themselves from continuing to add new things to <em>Silksong</em>: more towns, NPCs, boss fights, and seemingly many more secrets.</p> <p>Of course, if you’re a world record <em>Hollow Knight</em> speedrunner like Kyle “LoLNebula” Dodson, you still might be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NSvKncZbMM">100-percent <em>Silksong</em> in just a few hours</a>. That includes collecting all of the upgrades, charms, and improvements, and fighting lots of bosses multiple times. In fairness Dodson, like lots of other <em>Hollow Knight</em> superfans, has had over eight years to practice.</p>

          <p>An influx of players <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/explaining-the-internets-obsession-with-silksong-which-finally-comes-out-sept-4/">excited for this morning's launch of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> are encountering widespread errors purchasing and downloading the game from Steam this morning. Ars Technica writers have encountered errors getting store pages to load, adding the game to an online shopping cart, and checking out once the game is part of the cart.</p>
<p>That aligns with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madelynrogers.bsky.social/post/3lxzdj7sbxk2x">widespread</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesseferguson.bsky.social/post/3lxzdja5s4s2g">social media</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lunallian.bsky.social/post/3lxzdjh7fu22i">complaints</a> and <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/steam/">data from DownDetector</a>, which saw a sudden spike of over 11,000 reports of problems with Steam in the minutes following <em>Silksong</em>'s 10 am Eastern time release on Steam. The server problems don't seem to be completely stopping everyone, though, as SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">currently reports over 100,000 concurrent players</a> for <em>Silksong</em> as of this writing.</p>
<p>Ars also encountered some significant delays and/or outright errors when downloading other games and updates and syncing cloud saves on Steam during this morning's server problems. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hollow-knight-silksong">The Humble Store page for <em>Silksong</em></a> currently warns North American purchasers that "We have run out of Steam keys for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> in your region, but more are on their way! As soon as we receive more Steam keys, we will add them to your download page. Sorry about the delay!"</p>
<p>The PC version of&nbsp;<em>Silksong currently </em>seems to be available for purchase and download without issue. Ars was also able to purchase and download the Switch 2 version of <em>Silksong</em> from the Nintendo eShop without encountering any errors, though <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/nintendo-switch-online/">others have reported problems</a> with that online storefront [Update: As of 11:18 am, Nintendo is <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_US/index.html">reporting</a>, "The [Nintendo eShop] network service is unavailable at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause]." The game is still listed as merely "Announced" and not available for purchase <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005908">on its PlayStation Store page</a> as of this writing.</p>

                <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally available, and it's putting up huge numbers on Steam. The game blasted off today with 5,000 concurrent players in the first five minutes, growing to 50,000 within 30 minutes and 100,000 after the first 45 minutes of availability. It's now exceeded 350,000 concurrent players.</p><p>Silksong is currently the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 most-played game on Steam right now.</a> The game is putting up these massive figures despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">numerous and serious issues on Steam</a> that are preventing people from accessing the store, let alone buying and playing the game.</p><p>The 2017 original Hollow Knight, meanwhile, capped out at a peak concurrent-player record of 72,916--a record that was, in fact, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">achieved just recently on September 3</a>. The game's player numbers no doubt spiked due to interest in the sequel.</p><p>Silksong's Steam numbers are expected to keep climbing. Historical data shows that Steam games tend to spike on weekends in terms of popularity when people generally have more free time.</p><p>Silksong is also available for console, but the same kind of player data is not available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or Switch 2. On Xbox and PC, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">game is also available via Game Pass</a>, so any sales data for those platforms wouldn't necessarily tell the whole story. For what it's worth, Silksong's rollout on console platforms also ran into a number of issues.</p><p>The original Hollow Knight sold more than 15 million copies.</p><p>In other Silksong news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-twitch-drops-how-to-get-the-hornet-badge/1100-6534483/" data-ref-id="1100-6534483">has Twitch Drops available</a> for a Hornet badge. Hornet is the playable character in Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel.</p><p>Silksong took years to come out, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-silksong-take-so-long-its-not-what-you-might-think/1100-6534218/" data-ref-id="1100-6534218">wasn't because the game was stuck in development hell or anything like that</a>, the developers said. Simply put, the enormous success of the first game gave the small team the time to develop the sequel at their own pace. Also adding to the lengthy development schedule was how Silksong actually began as an expansion to Hollow Knight before shifting to a standalone release.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

The same can be said for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_robot_wars_y">Super Robot Wars Y</a> too, which managed a total of 91,500 across Switch and PS5.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is easily going to become one of the most successful video game releases of the year, if not of the entire console generation, judging from how popular the game already is minutes after its release.</p>



<p>Following the game's release less than an hour ago at the time of writing, the second entry in the series by Team Cherry destroyed the original's concurrent user record of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/">72,916 users</a>, which was only reached yesterday within minutes with a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">103,994 concurrent users </a>record that is only going to increase in the coming hours, possibly setting a new record for an indie game on the platform. The game's launch has proven to be so popular that multiple storefronts like Steam and the Xbox store went down as fans rushed to download the highly anticipated Metroidvania.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong being so successful should surprise no one, as fans of the original have been waiting for the game for years. After being in development for a long time with little to no communication, it seemed like the game would not be out for another good while, but developer Team Cherry surprised fans worldwide by revealing the game's early September release with a surprise announcement only <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-special-presentation-team-cherry/">two weeks ago</a>. While it's too early to say for certain, it seems like the long wait was very worth it, as Hollow Knight: Silksong takes everything that made the original so engaging and brings it up to eleven with more powerful bosses, a full-fledged quest system and a new story featuring Hornet journey through the Kingdom of Pharloom to learn more about secrets tied to her past.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. The game is also available as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-to-be-available-on-day-one-on-xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass library.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been in the works for a long time, but the wait was well worth it, as the new version of the third entry in the JRPG series by Square Enix, which serves as the beginning of the Erdrick trilogy, is undoubtedly the best rendition of the adventure, which, chronologically, started it all. Everything considered, it was also the easiest game of the trilogy to remake in the HD-2D style, as the gameplay, while definitely a little dated, still held up well, allowing the development team to focus on the new visuals and some choice changes to improve an experience that is still considered among the best in the series.</p>



<p>To make the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake as compelling as its predecessor, however, the development team needed to do much more. The original Dragon Quest is terribly dated, with a single party member who can only face a single enemy, and a vague semblance of a story that is barely there. Dragon Quest II, on the other hand, fares a little better, with a set party and a slightly more developed narrative, but not by much. Both games required a lot more to be enticing for a modern audience who did not experience the original or any of their previous faithful remakes than a new coat of paint and some additional content, but sfter trying both games during last month's Gamescom, I can safely say that the two games are being properly updated with new tweaks and improvements that modernize them without impacting the classic feel the two games still firmly retain.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Having only around one hour to try out both games, I couldn't delve too deep into the many tweaks and changes featured in the upcoming remakes, but the little I experienced was fully convincing. In Dragon Quest I, for example, the Hero continues to fight his way to the Dragonlord alone, but no longer fights single enemies, but groups like in the rest of the series. As such, the experience has been completely rebalanced with this in mind, and the Hero's skillset has been greatly expanded with a Scrolls system that allows players to teach their character a variety of skills. In addition, the game features a lot more story in the vein of the rest of the series, which promises to make the classic game more entertaining than ever before, and even longer, as the development team confirmed it will take around 15 hours to get to the ending, as opposed to around 10 hours required for the original.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest II has been similarly expanded, with the Princess of Cannock joining the party and an increased focus on story to make it feel like more than a fancier way of guiding the player to the next objective. Character customization has also been enhanced with the introduction of a Sigils system that grants special effects in battle, bringing the gameplay closer to that of more recent entries in the series. With the new content added in, the developer expects it will take 35 hours to get to the ending, which is a considerable increase over the around 18 hours needed to complete the original.</p>



<p>For the rest, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake played as one would expect, with the classic top-down view, intricate dungeon design with some simple puzzles to solve, random encounters, classic turn-based combat system, and the iconic music that has always defined the series since its beginnings. With familiar elements and well-thought-out additions meshing together to deliver renewed experiences, I expect Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake to be as successful as last year's release amid newcomers and veterans alike when the game launches on October 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Well, who could have seen this coming: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has taken Steam offline, or at least, laid waste to large swathes of it. Within seconds of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">its release this afternoon</a>, Team Cherry’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel brought Valve's servers to a halt, cue endlessly loading pages when trying to access the checkout, browse the store or do much of anything.
</p><!--more-->
<p>I can’t even sign in. I’m currently staring into the void of an infinite “loading user data” loop. I can’t get the “Most Played” chart to load in a web browser, either, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 101,828 people playing already. Smash cut to live footage of Gabe Newell ejected screaming from his exploding yacht, hotly pursued by a cloud of burning hornets. 
</p>
<p>If you’re hoping to play on Steam in the next hour or so, you may encounter the following dread message: "Error Code: 2811-7429. Couldn't connect to the server. The network may be busy, or there may be a problem with the server. Please try again later." There are already thousands of reports of a Steam outage on <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/steam/">Downdetector</a>. Valve have yet to comment. The game is also available on GOG, who have a much smaller audience, but I hear <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://bsky.app/profile/khonziel.bsky.social/post/3lxzdkzrccs26%E2%80%9D">they’re having similar difficulties</a>. 
</p>
<p>May the good gods save our engineers in this time of Silksinging. May the good gods save them, at least, from wrathful emails. Having to wait an hour or two for demand to die back so you can play Silksong is no great burden. Still, as ever with Steam overloads, you do have to wonder whether Valve as a whole could have prepared better for this. 
</p><p>Silksong has been Steam’s most-wishlisted game since forever. I’m not clear on what Valve do when they know something is going to be mega-popular - I assume it involves buying more servers, but perhaps they just pour energy drinks over the existing ones while uttering the Optimiser’s Prayer. Perhaps they just stick a bike pump in the outer wall of the server farm and have an intern crank the handle for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>If you’re trying to play, best of luck. James claims he’s already got it downloading, but then he’s always trying to be the popular one.

              <p>Good morning! I’m not sure why I’m even writing today’s Morning Checkpoint, as nobody is going to read today’s edition. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-steam-eshop-crashing-twitch-game-pass-hollow-knight-2000623137">Instead, you’ll all be out there playing your fancy new <em>Silksong</em>.</a> Congrats to all of you. For the few of you <em>actually</em> here, today’s Checkpoint includes news about another long-awaited indie game, an update on <em>Wolverine</em>, some info on the development of the Switch 2, and our thoughts on Bloober’s next big horror game.</p> <h2><em>The Binding of Isaac</em> creator’s next game finally gets a release date</h2> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-creators-mewgenics-finally-gets-a-release-date-almost-13-years-after-it-was-announced">After first being announced in 2012, <em>Mewgenics</em> finally has a launch date.</a> And you thought the wait for <em>Silksong</em> was bad! <em>Mewgenics</em>, which is an RPG built around breeding many cats, is being developed by Edmund McMillen, the creator behind<em> The Binding of Isaac</em>, and will launch on February 10, 2026, which is about 13 years after it was first revealed. Not only did McMillen reveal the game’s release date, but he also uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/cAiIiju7lCo">a 50-minute-long gameplay demo</a> showing off how the game actually plays.</p>  <h2>Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em> game is reportedly showing up in a State of Play soon</h2> <p>We’ve not seen much of <em>Wolverine</em>, the next game from<em> Spider-Man</em> makers Insomniac, since it was revealed in 2021. Well, unless you count all the leaked gameplay floating around out there after the studio was hacked. But it seems like the wait for a new official look at the upcoming superhero game might be coming to an end. <em>Insider Gaming </em>reports that sources have told the outlet a trailer for <em>Wolverine</em> is ready, and many expect it to appear in a Sony State of Play later this month. Will he say “Bub?” One can hope.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo delayed the Switch 2 a few times to make sure it had good games ready</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-repeatedly-delayed-switch-2-at-designers-request-report/1100-6534465/">A new report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-nintendo-switch2/">about Nintendo and how it makes games</a> says that the Switch 2’s launch was held back because the people working on launch games requested extra time to “perfect” their titles. Nintendo apparently made this their number one priority and delayed the Switch 2 a few times to make sure the games it launched with were as good as could be.</p> <h2><em>Shinobi: The Art of Vengeance</em> on Switch is getting a resolution boost</h2> <p>People like that new <em>Shinobi</em> game a lot! But on Switch, the 2D action-platformer is a bit fuzzier than it should be. <a href="https://x.com/SEGA_OFFICIAL/status/1963129469373407429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Sega knows and is patching the Switch port</a> to “improve” <em>Shinobi</em>‘s resolution. Here’s their full statement:</p>

 <blockquote><p><span>In response to feedback from all players, we are currently developing an update patch to improve the screen resolution in the Nintendo Switch version of this title. Please wait a little longer until the patch is released.</span></p></blockquote> <h2>Someone added a Nintendo Cease and Desist into <em>Smash Bros.</em> as a fighter</h2> <p>Truly the greatest enemy in Nintendo history: A legal cease and desist issued by one of the company’s many lawyers. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-cease-desist-letter-is-now-a-playable-character-in-smash-bros-mod/1100-6534471/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">Now someone</a> has brought this iconic and terrible creature, which has stopped many a great mod and fan game, into <em>Smash Bros.</em> as a playable character.

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally up and running and is available to buy and download from the PlayStation Store!</p>



<p>The release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is a glorious day, but not if you’re a PS5 gamer. Whereas every other available platform got the launch of Silksong bang on the projected start time, PlayStation 5 users have been left out in the cold, wondering why they can’t download Silksong.</p>



<p>I’m a PS5 player, and I can’t download <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. I waited as patiently as all of you for the launch date and time. Once the hour struck, I dove onto the PS Store to buy and download the game—that’s a lie, I was on and tried <em>before </em>this, but still. PlayStation 5 players have been unable to pre-purchase and download Silksong, ready for its inevitable launch.</p>



<p>This didn’t seem too bad, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-file-sizes-playstation-xbox-switch-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong file sizes</a> suggest it’s not the heftiest game to download. However, the community can’t download Silksong on PS5, so let’s dive into the latest.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-buy-hollow-knight-silksong">Why Can’t I Buy Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We just want to play. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Neither PlayStation nor Team Cherry has explained why PS5 is the only storefront where you can’t purchase Hollow Knight: Silksong right now, and the best guess is due to an error on the store or the server being backed up with customers.</strong></p>



<p>Let me be clear, I’m doing some digging and trying to find out why this is happening as we speak. There hasn’t been a single word from PlayStation or the developer about any miscommunication regarding Silksong’s launch on PS5. However, the fact remains that no one can buy and download Silksong on PS5.</p>



<p>There’s also a chance this could be due to the influx of traffic with hundreds of thousands of players presumably trying to buy the anticipated indie game—myself included.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-hollow-knight-silksong-will-work-on-ps5">Do We Know When Hollow Knight: Silksong Will Work On PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>There seems to be no workaround for Hollow Knight: Silksong not working on PS5<strong> at the moment, </strong>and it’s up in the air as to when it will be available to buy on PS5.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Consider this guide a live page you should keep refreshing,</strong> as I’m monitoring the situation intensely. You can take my word for it, as I also want to download Silksong. So keep checking back. Fingers crossed we get an update from <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a> or PlayStation, or the store page suddenly works.</p>

<p>Drop us a comment or a message on the <a href="https://x.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming X page</a> if you find Hollow Knight: Silksong is working, or if you find an update elsewhere on the ongoing issue.</p>

                <p>Ahead of its launch in October, Square Enix has revealed more details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D</a> Remake, focusing on how combat has been enhanced and new items that players can take advantage of. Just like the original JRPGs, players will once again encounter monsters as they explore an overworld and several dungeons, with combat revolving around turn-based battles.</p><p>All the staples of the classic Dragon Quest gameplay are here--like spells and skills--but if you're having a tough time, the game will suggest the optimal actions you can take to exploit the weaknesses of monsters. This is an optional setting found in the game menu, and once enabled, it will show text above the enemy that indicates which of your moves will be effective against it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEsHUslhTQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rxEsHUslhTQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another new feature being introduced are Scrolls, which will allow characters to learn additional spells and skills. These can be obtained from treasure chests throughout the games, but they can only be used on specific characters. The five sigils--Sun, Star, Moon, Water, and Soul--that originally appeared in Dragon Quest 2 return in Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake, and these will activate various effects in battle once they have been collected.</p><p>In Dragon Quest 1 HD, sigils can be acquired through a quest to assist the fairies, and in Dragon Quest 2 HD, sigils are collected as part of a mission to defeat Hargon, the evil high priest who leads an army of monsters. Each sigil offers unique bonuses, like guaranteed critical hit damage for special abilities and other abilities will be upgraded if certain conditions are met.</p><p>Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake launches on October 30 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and Switch. if you're planning to play the game on Nintendo hardware, it's worth noting that there will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-dragon-quest-remakes-wont-upgrade-from-switch-to-switch-2/1100-6533168/">no upgrade path between the different Switch console releases</a>.</p><p>"The games are a stunning marriage of classic pixel art and modern touches. I hadn't realized how much better Square Enix's 'HD-2D' aesthetic had become in recent years," Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-12-hd-2d-remake-gives-the-classics-a-deserved-glow-up/1100-6531817/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake preview</a>. "The color palette and saturation feels reminiscent of 8-bit classics, which makes the beautiful sprite artwork pop."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

<p>This time around, you can earn the Hollow Knight: Silksong Hornet badge, which depicts the sequel's protagonist, by subscribing to<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/hollow-knight-silksong?filter=drops" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a participating channel</a>. The campaign is live now and will run until September 13. After that time, it won't be possible to earn the badge via any other method, so if you're a fan of the series and want a fun way to show it on Twitch, you've only got a short while.</p><p>Silksong's release proved so popular that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">crashed several storefronts</a> hosting the game, including Xbox where the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september-headlined-by-hollow-knight-silksong-and-i-am-your-beast/2900-6974/" data-ref-id="2900-6974">Day One release for Game Pass</a> is hosted. Despite the release time being widely publicized, it seems nobody was expecting just how sought-after the game would be. Part of that is likely due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Silksong's modest price point</a>.</p>

            <p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">Ubisoft announced it would shut down The Crew's servers on 31st March, 2024</a>, which would make the game unplayable due to its always online requirements - even those with physical copies of the game were to be locked out. Needless to say, many were unhappy with Ubisoft's decision.</p>
<p>Some, though, decided not to just leave it there, and set about reviving the game on their own time and dime. Now a little over a year later, the fan lead Crew revival project - known as The Crew Unlimited - is gearing up for its release on 15th September. </p>
<p>But, what has it taken to get to this point?</p>

<p>"We started working on the server emulator project (to revive the game) a bit before the official server shutdown," project lead whammy4 told Eurogamer. "Ever since then it's been a non-stop technical uphill battle: network data analysis, reversing, implementation, rinse and repeat."</p><p>This was all to "implement the networking and communications between the game client (the game that the players play) and the server (what we're working on)", they explain. "Then there's a whole other side of it where we have to re-implement and rewrite entire parts of The Crew's game/data design, functionality and logic, entirely from scratch."</p>
<p>Think that all sounds difficult? Well, it was. The rest of The Crew Unlimited's team is made up of r00t0, ChemicalFlood, mono24 and Guki. It was r00t0 who started and carried out the actual server emulator project, with whammy4 calling them an "absolute godsend". Whammy4, then, is "mainly responsible for programming the actual game functionality and logic, and all the MMO stuff on the server", while ChemicalFlood is "helping and assisting us with the networking and IT side of things (also archiving everything)". Guki, meanwhile, is the expert on The Crew's data and file systems, and mono24 provides "invaluable advice on how to run and manage the project correctly". The entire team have their own jobs, families and lives outside of The Crew Unlimited. </p>
<p>So, what does this all actually mean in practice, though? "The game's economy, prices, items, rewards, databases, MMO systems and logic; we have to manage things down to each individual part you install on your car in the game," whammy4 explained. "Oftentimes working on this project feels like an unpredictable rollercoaster ride, one day we're feeling like we're making huge progress and got everything sorted, next day we're bashing our heads on the wall failing to figure out how some minor gamemode's reward formula works... sometimes for months."</p>
<p>Whammy4 added there would be times when the team would have to deal with issues in their personal lives, and this would halt any progress for a not insignificant period of time. "But you know what really warms our heart and keeps us going? It's the amount of support we get from fans of the game," whammy4 said, adding the entire team is very grateful for this.</p><p>"It just shows how many people love and care for this game. We get kind words and support from people from all across the world, both young and old. Very few video games can boast such dedicated fanbases with such a large variety in age. This warms my heart to no end and just shows how special this game is, and to so many people."</p>

<p>While it is clear The Crew Unlimited has had a huge amount of passion and care poured into it, there is one elephant in the room - Ubisoft. What does it have to say about this community project to revive The Crew?</p>
<p>"We often get asked if Ubisoft has commented or acknowledged our project in any way. They have not, but as for The Crew's developers Ivory Tower, one (alleged) developer has anonymously come out and expressed their and the studio's gratitude and appreciation for our project," whammy4 told me when I asked. While the developer chose to stay anonymous, whammy4 said The Crew Unlimited's team "know for a fact we got supporters over at Ivory Tower", adding "shoutouts to them all!".</p><p>Whammy4 admitted Ubisoft could shut down the project, but said "causing trouble for anyone is not something we're looking to do". They said that "each player has to have their own The Crew game installation, then they install TCU over it to make it playable again". They added The Crew Unlimited team doesn't provide any game files. "TCU itself is 100 percent free of charge and always will be, including anything else we may release," they said.</p>

<p>As for what will come next once The Crew Unlimited releases, whammy4 said the community is excited about the modding potential that they will be able to explore. "Now that the game is free from the publisher's servers and control, we can practically do whatever we want (and can) with the game. Only problem is that this is one hell of a difficult game to work with and modify, but there already are people in the community that are making modding tools, software and documentation in preparation for the game's revival," they furthered.</p>
<p>"With a game as rich in its content and features as The Crew, lots of mods could be possible: New cars, new car customisations, map modifications, or entire new areas and parts of the map. Maybe even new races and gamemodes!</p><p>
"Part of the TCU Project is the 'TCU Mod', which aims to restore a lot of the visuals and ambient content that was removed from the game post-launch. It's still in development, but already features plenty of visual improvements, along with car handling and physics improvements. It's all just a matter of time and effort."</p>
<p>Whammy4 said the team ultimately still doesn't "know where the winds will take us", but believes the modding "could be incredible" in the future. 

"The game already has so much to offer as is, and such a solid base for modding, it's practically screaming to be modded," they said. "I personally believe modding is the future of The Crew, that's how it will live on and be relevant for decades more." </p>
<p>I asked whammy4 why this Crew project is so important. "Let's begin with the fact that... we're basically giving... millions of players their beloved game back," they replied.
</p>
<p>But, it is more than just that. It is also about preservation, something that has been a big topic in recent years. "Sometimes we get dads thanking us for bringing the game back, because they wanted their kids to play it, or continue playing it," whammy4 said. "I consider video games the ultimate form of art, they are a unison of a variety of different arts - visual arts, music, sound, writing, acting, etc. The Crew is a game that definitely took all of these elements very seriously, and each was done by talented, caring artists."</p><p>They continued: "The original version and vision of the game had a visual direction never seen before or after in gaming, it was designed to look like a moving/dynamic painting, going as far as to have entire visual elements like skies and clouds be hand-painted."</p>
<p>"This game also has a ton of educational value, about American geography, history (the game features several hundred landmark points with descriptions), even down to geographical and meteorological quirks of the different places of North US, expressed with the mappers' careful and deliberate work, featuring a large variety of biomes and ecosystems (including lots of different animal types), and a staggering 40+ unique artistic regional weather conditions available in the game (cut down to... two weathers total, in later updates).</p>
<p>"All of this on a huge digital map of the North US, scaled down to 1900 square miles. And to lose all this? Destroy all this work? Take it away from everyone, and bury this game and experience forever? That should be a crime."</p>
<p>Closing, whammy4 said they believe that thanks to The Crew Unlimited, Ubisoft's game "<em>will</em> get the recognition and love it deserves".</p>
