            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-members-who-work-on-video-games-to-begin-strike-at-midnight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today a statement was released by SAG-AFTRA for members that work on Video Games to begin a strike after more than a year and a half of negotiations surrounding the Interactive Media Agreement has reached no deal. The strike will begin effective July 26th at 12:01am.</p>
<p>The statement explains that negotiations began with a number of companies including Activision Productions Inc., Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., and Insomniac Games Inc. among many others. It is explained that while agreements have been reached on a number of topics that "the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their A.I. language.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher released the following quote alongside the statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies ger serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SAG-AFTRA members approved a video game strike authorization with a 98.32% yes vote. You can read the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">full Press Release on the SAG-AFTRA Website</a>.</p>
<h2>What Does A SAG-AFTRA Strike Mean For Video Games?</h2>
<p>As the Video Game Strike begins all members of SAG-AFTRA will not be able to work for any 'Struck' Video Game productions. Working could include active production such as acting (whether it be voice acting, performance, or stunts), background or stand-in work, or performing camera tests. This also includes participating in auditions, authorizing your voice or likeness, or promoting any struck games you've been working on as a SAG-AFTRA performer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members">full list of rules for the SAG-AFTRA video game strike can be found here</a>. It's also important to note that not all Video Game productions are within the scope of the Strike Order, SAG-AFTRA has created a resource for looking up a game via it's Full Code Name or Production ID so it can be verified whether it's within the Strike Order. Looking up a game will either return to you a "Game Over!" message, or a "Let's Play!" if it is not struck.</p>
<p>Fans of TV and Movies will be familiar with the idea of a SAG-AFTRA strike after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike">almost four months of striking</a> that occurred last year.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Can I As A Fan Of Video Games Do To Support SAG-AFTRA?</h2>
<p>As with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes last year the first thing for everyone to understand is that depending on the length of time there may be delays to known or unknown Video Games on the horizon. It's important to remember that it's not the fault of those on strike, but of the companies that can't come to an agreement to protect the livelihood of those working in video games.</p>

<p>As part of their Strike FAQ page SAG-AFTRA has put together a list of ways that Creators/Streamers, Developers, Fans, and Podcasters can support the strike. This doesn't ask people to not play games that are within the Strike, but instead asks that you share the message of the strike and promote the importance of the strike.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA also asks that if you're sharing the message that you use the hashtags&nbsp;#LevelUpTheContract, #VideoGameStrike and #SagAftraStrong when sharing on socials. For more information on how you can engage you can explore their<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/interactive/video-game-strike/take-action"> "Take Action" page</a>, and for more information overall for members, non-members, or just as a fan you can <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike-faq">check out their FAQ page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SAG-AFTRA At San Diego Comic-Con</h2>
<p>For those looking to attend San Diego Comic-Con next week SAG-AFTRA has explained that they understand that due to the proximity it could cause complications so is granting an exception to the strike rules related to promotion and publicity services specifically for SDCC 2024.</p>

The strike goes into effect July 26th at 12:01AM and impacts all SAG-AFTRA actors, voice actors, and motion capture actors and involves companies like Activision Blizzard, EA, Insomniac Games, WB Games, and more. According to SAG-AFTRA’s press release, the union and video game companies could not come to an agreement regarding AI protections.</p><p>“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members,” said SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher in the press release. “When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.”</p><p>In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Audrey Cooling, spokesperson for the video game producers&nbsp;involved in the negotiations, wrote:<em> </em></p><div><blockquote><p>We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we&nbsp;remain&nbsp;prepared to resume negotiations.

            <title><![CDATA[EA and Paradox Aren’t Showing Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 at Gamescom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-and-paradox-aren%E2%80%99t-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom.937053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite both being slated to launch this Fall, neither Dragon Age: The Veilguard nor Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be shown at Gamescom 2024 by EA and Paradox Interactive, the respective publishers.</p>
<p>With less than a month left before the beginning of the big European convention, the exhibitors list has been <a href="https://exhibitors.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-exhibitors/list-of-exhibitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finalized</a>. Since Wccftech is attending with media accreditations, we are looking into which games will be shown there, and we can confirm that neither of two of the most anticipated games scheduled in the latter half of 2024 will appear.</p>
<p>EA does actually have a presence at Gamescom 2024. However, we confirmed with the publisher's PR department that the only game shown there will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports FC 25</a>, which means Dragon Age: The Veilguard is sorely missing. It feels like a weird repeat of what <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-is-at-gamescom-but-only-for-the-yu-gi-oh-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KONAMI</a> is doing with the Silent Hill 2 remake, which is also skipping Gamescom 2024 for some reason despite only being a few weeks away from its October debut.</p>
<p>It's enough to make one wonder if a delay is coming, although Electronic Arts has actually shared a lot of Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">info</a> lately, which pointed to the Fall release window being respected.</p>
<p>Another game in a similar situation is Paradox Interactive's Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The troubled sequel is still formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinned</a> for a Q4 2024 launch, but Paradox is skipping Gamescom altogether, Wccftech was able to confirm via the publisher's PR, meaning Bloodlines 2 will be nowhere to be seen at the Koelnmesse. A delay in this case would be less than surprising, as what's been shown so far isn't quite as polished as we would have liked to see. It is far from unlikely that the developers will require more time before launch.</p>
<p>Even if both games missed their Fall 2024 launch windows, Western RPG fans would still have two high-profile games pretty much assured to debut this year: Warhorse's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>&nbsp;and Obsidian's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, both of which will be shown at Gamescom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Video game voice over and performance actors are going on strike over the use of AI in video game development, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SAG-AFTRA has announced</a>.</p>



<p>As of 12:01 AM on July 26, members of the union will strike after more than 18 months of negotiations between the union and game studios under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA).  It was just on July 22 that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-can-call-for-an-immediate-strike-against-game-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">union national director was given authorization</a> to call for an immediate strike after negotiations continued to stall.</p>



<p>The sticking point of the current negotiations that ultimately led to this strike were AI protections for voice over and performance actors. According to members of the negotiating committee on behalf of the actors, they believe that game studios don’t want to protect their actors against the possible exploitation that exists with AI.</p>



<p>“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,” stated SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher via release.</p>



<p>“Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year – that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,” SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director &amp; Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said.</p>



<p>In response to the call for a strike by SAG-AFTRA, the video game producers involved in the IMA negotiations released the following statement via spokesperson Audrey Cooling to Insider Gaming. </p>



<p><em>“We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we&nbsp;remain&nbsp;prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and&nbsp;additional&nbsp;safety provisions.&nbsp;Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;consent and fair compensation to all performers&nbsp;working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-really-wants-to-make-a-new-vs-series-game-shuhei-matsumoto-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>One of the biggest surprise announcements this year happened during the June Nintendo Direct, when   from out of nowhere, Capcom dropped a trailer for Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. A collection that bundles together six of the games that make up the foundation of the beloved vs series, including one of the most highly regarded fighting games of all time, Marvel vs Capcom 2. </p><p>At Evo 2024, I got a chance to talk with Capcom producer Shuhei Matsumoto to ask some questions about how this collection finally came to be, the significance of its release in relation to the future of the Versus series as a whole, and also got to hear about the origins of the SNK crossover that's happening with Terry and Mai joining the cast of Street Fighter 6 as part of the year 2 character pass. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>How long has this collection been in the works?</strong></p><p><strong>Shuhei Matsumoto, Producer Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics: </strong></p><p>So we've been planning for about three, four years to make this project a reality. We've been talking with Marvel for quite a while. And back then, we just didn't have the opportunities to release this game. But now after those discussions with them, we were finally able to do so.</p><p><strong>Speaking of talking with Marvel, can you describe what Capcom's relationship is with Marvel right now?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>Yeah, it's very positive. As we mentioned, we've been in talks with them for a few years now and they've really been excited and motivated to release these classic games. So overall, it's been really good and positive.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We've been in talks with [Marvel] for a few years now, and they've really been excited and motivated to release these classic games.</p></div><p><strong>You mentioned in </strong><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/exclusive-capcoms-dream-is-to-make-more-marvel-crossover-games-2831616/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another interview</a><strong> that Capcom has big dreams for the Versus series. Can you talk a little bit about what those dreams are and what the Versus series means to you as a whole?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So yeah, this doesn't just apply to the Versus series. We have a lot of other legacy fighting games that we know fans out there really want them to be re-released again on modern platforms. And the feeling is mutual on the development side. We want people to get to know all these other classic games. So hopefully what we can do right now is to try to re-release them and so that people who may have never had the chance to play those games to get familiarized with them. And from there, hopefully we can go into bigger and better things.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Speaking of some of those classic Capcom fighting game series, Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike just had an incredible top six at Evo. That's a game that's been re-released several times over the years. Is that something that still you're looking at also kind of giving a "definitive edition" in the future? </strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So definitely. We want all our classic games to be available for modern consoles because we just want to be able to reach as many people who may have never had the opportunity to play these games back in the day. So we constantly think forward and we want to make sure that it's as accessible as possible for all audiences.</p><p><strong>So going back to Marvel vs. Capcom for a second. This is a game that means so much to fans across the world, especially popular streamers [and pro players] like Maximilian Dood and Justin Wong. I was wondering, have you seen any of those reactions and what's your reaction to how people have received the announcement of this collection?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>Yes, we definitely saw all the reactions and the comments and the positive feedback when we were able to make the announcement. And the feeling is mutual. Once we realized that we were able to re-release these games and it became green-lit and official, our reaction matched that same energy. So yeah, we're definitely excited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>It feels like a door has been opened with regards to the Marvel vs. Capcom series because we've heard nothing about it for so long. Is this the kind of thing where if this game does well, the future of the Versus series is wide open and there could be more collaborations between Marvel and Capcom or other franchises out there?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So to answer your question about whether or not we want to make a brand new Versus series title, the answer to that is yes. And the best thing that we can do right now is to re-release these classic titles that some of our fans may not be fully aware of. And of course, there's constraints, there's different schedules, it's going to require collaboration with other non-Capcom parties in order to make this happen. And that could take some time, but we feel that the best that we can do right now is to re-release these games to energize the community.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>To answer your question about whether or not we want to make a brand new Versus series title, the answer to that is yes. </p></div><p><strong>Switching gears for a second to Street Fighter 6, you guys announced recently that Terry and Mai from Fatal Fury are going to make their appearance in Street Fighter 6. How did that collaboration come about?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So Capcom has had a long relationship with SNK and we've been discussing with them for quite a while now. And actually during COVID, there was a period of time where we couldn't have any offline tournaments. But then once restrictions started to become a little looser and once Evo was able to start up again, we were talking with them to see is there anything that we can do to celebrate this moment now that we're all back together. And the idea that came out of those conversations was to do these collaborative posters where both SNK artists and Capcom artists draw each other's characters in their own style. And at that time, we were also working on actively developing Street Fighter 6, so we really wanted to see if there's any opportunity to introduce some of their characters. So we asked if it's possible to get Terry and Mai in Street Fighter 6 and they were very open about it and positive. And yeah, it started small to see what we can do in the short-term. But then through conversations, we tried to see what else, what's something that's even bigger that we can do. And we're finally to the point where both Terry and Mai are going to be coming out shortly. So hope everyone's excited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Terry is a character that fits obviously very well in the SNK style of fighting game. How has it been translating his move set and his play style over to Street Fighter? If you can talk a little bit about how he's going to play in Street Fighter 6.</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So this doesn't just apply to the SNK characters, but during our selection process for any characters that join the game's roster, we always try to think about whether or not they're a good fit in terms of the game system, game mechanics. And Terry and Mai passed that test and they felt that they would be a great add-on to this lineup. So yeah, we're very excited for them to come out.</p><p><strong>The mainline Street Fighter series has historically not included any guest characters. So I was just wondering what changed to finally open the door for guest characters to come in? And is that door open so much to the way that other fighting game properties might find their way into Street Fighter?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So Terry and Mai are joining the roster starting from the year two lineup, which is relatively early in the lifetime of the game. However, we were all very excited about the positivity that we saw online once we made the announcement. We're very much looking forward to actually seeing people play with these characters. And based on that reaction and based on how people are engaging with these characters, we would like to consider other options maybe in the future. So this was quite a big challenge for us to even incorporate these guest characters. As you mentioned, this is the first time. But hopefully things move forward in a positive way and there's more opportunities that open up for us.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Final question, this is something that I've been asking pretty much everyone that I've talked to here at Evo. But what do you think is the next kind of evolution for the fighting game genre? To give you an example, netcode was something that a lot of fighting games struggled with, and then rollback netcode came along and it kind of pushed the genre forward and has become largely standard among new fighting games. What do you think is the next thing that will push the fighting game genre forward? </strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So to speak on Street Fighter 6, we took on a lot of different challenges and our goal was to get people as interested in fighting games as much as possible. And we feel that because of our efforts, we were able to reach an audience that might've never wanted to play a fighting game. We're seeing a lot of engaged players, especially in Japan, and people who this may be their first time playing a fighting game actually enjoying it. So whether it's technical improvements or just constantly servicing the game to provide new content, we feel that us and companies in general need to think about all these things in order to reach this audience and explain to them and get them to realize that, hey, fighting games are a lot of fun and they're worth checking out. So there's probably a lot of different things that we need to continue to think about and yeah, we hope to be able to reach more people in the future.</p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an Senior Producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-feels-like-it-shouldnt-exist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>They don’t make a lot of games like <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> any more. It is a game unstuck in time, a polished, action strategy hybrid that feels more at home on the PS2 or PS3. It feels like it should not exist, and yet here it is.</p><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess </em>is an action strategy game set against the backdrop of Japanese folklore. You play Soh, a warrior tasked with protecting a priestess named Yoshiro, who is tasked with purging a mountain and the villages on it of evil spirits known as Seethe. To do this you’re going to need to do an elaborate purification ritual based on the Shinto ceremonial dance of Kagura. Gameplay-wise, this means reversing the creeping spread of evil from areas and villagers, assigning jobs to those villagers and placing them, tower defense style, down various lanes between the source of the corruption and Yoshiro.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Undoing the corruption.

They’re Orbs</a>!) to push Yoshiro forward, undo corruption, unlock collectibles and items, prepare fortifications, and strategize for night time. Every night a new wave of Seethe emerges from the Tori gates, and you must survive the onslaught. Soh acts as both a commander and a soldier, and in addition to the regular stages there are also boss battles, which switch the dynamic from linear, lane-based tower defense mode to big area fights.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Most stages will have you pushing the lane forward during the day, and defending your maiden at night. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>On top of all this, the cleared stages themselves can be visited and rebuilt by the rescued townsfolk. The base building mini game allows you to unlock materials to upgrade the individual classes of villagers, yielding potential equipment for your quest. I am a sucker for any time a game asks me to rebuild a town, and this game is no exception.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Oh you know exactly who this is for (ride or die Okami fans) Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>Playing <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>brought to mind so many games I treasure:&nbsp; <em>Pikmin</em>, <em>Odama</em>, <em>Actraiser 1 &amp; 2</em>,<em> Giants: Citizen Kabuto, Dark Cloud 1 &amp; 2</em>, <em>Brütal Legend</em>, <em>Overlord</em>. The presence of Capcom’s own <em>Ōkami </em>looms heavily over this game, not simply in its shared themes, look, and gameplay but also the fact that it includes unlockable costumes and music from that game itself. In my mind’s eye I can see a younger version of myself picking up a battered copy of this for Gamecube from an EB Games, only to find out it’s worth either $5 or $300 dollars on eBay a few decades later.</p><figure><figcaption>Look at how good this food looks. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>To the extent that there are games like <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> still being made, bizarre idiosyncratic genre hybrids, they are usually the province of either indies (like the recently released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422440/Cataclismo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cataclismo</em></a>, which rules) or Nintendo (they’re still making good Pikmin games), and they are rarely allowed to have this level of sheer detail, polish and care. Every inch in the game, from the grotesque movements of the Yokai-coded Seethe to the elaborate dances of the villagers, pops in the RE Engine. One of the game’s collectibles is sweet treats, which are painstakingly rendered at a fidelity akin to food in <em>Final Fantasy XV, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ387Ozb4B0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that one burger </a>from <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>or the more recent <em>Monster Hunter </em>games. This is to say nothing of the soundtrack by Chikara Aoshima, which goes alarmingly hard and includes one track with a freakish John Zorn style sax solo.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami : Path of the Goddess - Batsu Theme/Soundtrack/Ost" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8y2L1LEpdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Perhaps a minor spoiler but this track is so sick.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This would be enough to cement the game into cult status for me, but luckily it’s also a blast to play. The hybrid fusion of tactics and action feels legitimately tight, and the game is fairly good at drip feeding you new mechanics to ramp up complexity. It keeps adding new weapon types and quirks, and many of the bosses can get tremendously challenging. You think you’ve seen what the game has to offer early on, and then suddenly it makes you do a battle entirely on boats. You are often forced to consider your army composition to react to enemy behavior and stage layout, so you can’t just use the same strategy over and over again. The lone thing I have found frustrating in my playtime is that repeating stages for challenges to unlock upgrade materials and equipment takes a while, but that’s a consequence of how long the stages take generally, and many of the challenges add new restrictions and interesting angles to previously mastered levels.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I was struck by how every level adds a new mechanic, class, or complication. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>Also, if you play the demo, be aware that progression doesn’t transfer over to the full game. So if you do play the demo, don’t spend too much time dawdling.&nbsp;</p><p>When you play something like <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>, it feels closer spiritually to something like <em>Fat Princess</em>, <em>Tokyo Jungle</em> or the games that Clover and then Platinum <em>used</em> to make. It is a mutant that escaped containment, a game that feels like it should be trapped on PS3 (or the <a href="https://x.com/Kalyoshika/status/1816024266162487375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox 360</a>). It does not feel like new software, but a title you need a particularly glitchy and experimental emulator to run.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Boss battles are disgusting, and beautiful. This one drops phallus-like worms on you. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>There is a poverty of possibility in the current game space. The people who make decisions involving money love a sure, reliable, easily repeatable release. <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> should not be a rarity, but we live in the wasteland that this over-financialized system has created. While the indies can do a lot, there needs to be space made for this type of vintage single A release. I would say that Game Pass is the perfect venue, but I also thought that about <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> and<a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> look what that got them</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>Download <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>if you can. It’s on Game Pass, or it's like fifty bucks on Steam and PS5/Xbox. The demo is also fairly robust if you are on the fence. I hope it’s a success, and that it ushers in not only a resurgence of <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-used-to-have-more-orbs-what-happened-soul-orb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orb-based gaming</a> but also of daring, weird, less than AAA games that are still, against all odds, being made.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is available on PS4/PS5, current Xbox consoles and Steam. As of this writing, it is included on Microsoft's Game Pass. </em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Of all the changes made in the transition from Overwatch 1 to 2, the move from 6v6 battles to 5v5 was undoubtedly one of its most controversial. And now developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has confirmed its's revisiting that decision, exploring if and how 6v6 matches could be re-introduced to Overwatch 2 in a series of upcoming tests.
</p>
<p>
All this is detailed in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/">blog</a> from Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller, who begins by explaining exactly why the move to 5v5 was made in the first place. "The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs," he writes, "but reaaaally low, lows. One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments."
</p>
<p>
As such, 5v5 was chosen to increase individual agency, to better balance the impact each class can have in a match, to make the experience more "cognitively manageable, and - perhaps most significantly of all - to alleviate extremely long queue times. "Players generally queue Tank less," continues Keller, "leading to longer wait times for all while we wait for a Tank to free up to find a proper match." And with Overwatch 2 requiring one rather than two tanks in competitive play, average wait times for damage and support characters are now "much shorter".

<p>
Despite these improvements, Keller acknowledges that some of the changes made to Overwatch over the years have come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom", and that the team gets feedback from players saying the experience can feel "the same" from game to game. Which brings us to Blizzard's future plans. Keller says that, based on player feedback, the studio is now looking to run a series of events that'll enable it to "try out different core team composition formats".
</p>
<p>
"Because we operate as a service to our players," he continues, "we always remain open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback, to give you the best game experience we can. Rather than introduce a disruptive, permanent change to the game, we'd prefer to explore the space further and make changes based on that exploration."
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
One reason for this cautiousness is technical performance. Keller says Blizzard has taken advantage of the reduced technical overheads in 5v5 matches to introduce upgrades and additions - ranging from allied outlines to more technically demanding hero kits - that will likely result in lower performance on older machines if 6v6 is re-introduced. Remedying this is expected to take "at least several seasons". Additionally, the studio needs to be "openly mindful not to frustrate" those players who've only ever experienced - and like - 5v5, and that's even before considering the queue issues that might resurface if 6v6 proves popular.
</p>
<p>
"We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run," Keller adds, "and explore how to best give players what's being asked for. Whether that's a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out."
</p>
<p>
Keller also believes at least some of Overwatch's perceived sameyness isn't actually to do with team sizes, but rather the composition of those teams - and so it'll also be re-examining "the ways we tried solving previous problems... We think there could be other ways of putting a team together that aren't quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue." To that end, Season 13 will feature "at least one Quick Play: Hacked based on this idea".
</p>
<p>
"This isn't the last time we’re going to be getting into 5v5 or 6v6, and we can't wait to share more about our plans in the future," Keller concludes. "In closing, we appreciate you so much, and we love seeing your passion and dedication."
</p>
<p>
Overwatch 2's 13th season is expected to get underway in October, but first there's Season 12, which'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-new-hero-is-space-ranger-juno-and-shes-available-to-play-today">introduce new space ranger hero Juno</a> when it arrives on 20th August.

In defense of the former, it <em>does</em> feature some of the tougher boss fights I’ve ever encountered. On the other hand, I’ve always felt like <em>Elden Ring </em>was a pretty malleable experience, and that it provided <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-summons-multiplayer-1851573539&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-summons-multiplayer-1851573539">a lot of tools</a></span> to allow you to power through the game and ultimately come out the other side. To that end, I’ve maintained that this game isn’t <em>that </em>selective about who can enjoy it, and the years since have often proven me right.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You see, plenty of people who play FromSoftware’s famously difficult games love to make things even harder for themselves.

With <em>Elden Ring</em>’s immense popularity, that scene kind of exploded and moved beyond straightforward challenges like level-1 runs, where the player isn’t allowed to level up for the entirety of the game. Instead, these challenges got exponentially weirder.</p><p>I’m talking about completely alternative ways of playing <em>Elden Ring</em>. Instead of playing the game with a controller or mouse and keyboard, some have taken to modding the game to support input from musical instruments. Others have used dance pads, and some have even used their brain to just look at the game and communicate inputs via brain waves. The <em>Elden Ring </em>community has proven how consistently inventive it is, and has managed to rise to utterly ridiculous challenges in bizarre and even byzantine ways, so I thought it might be fun to rattle off some of the most impressive methods players have used to beat <em>Elden Ring </em>bosses over the years. </p><h2 id="h5323"><a id=""></a>Dance pad</h2><p>Arguably the most popular of the alternatives, dance pads have been a staple of Soulslike challenge runs for a long while, but they’ve never been bigger. That’s largely due to MissMikkaa, a streamer who’s taken it upon herself to try and beat <em>Elden Ring </em>via too many alternate methods. Her most famous runs have been ones where she’s aided (or hampered, depending on how you see it) by a dance pad. In the years since the release of <em>Elden Ring</em>, her runs have only grown increasingly more unhinged. At one point, she even took on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-twitch-ps5-pc-dancepad-missmikkaa-malenia-1850032182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-twitch-ps5-pc-dancepad-missmikkaa-malenia-1850032182">hardest boss fight twice simultaneously</a></span>, controlling one character with her dance pad and another with a standard PS5 controller.

Talk about putting those bosses in their place.</p><h2 id="h5327"><a id=""></a>Morse code</h2><p>Though I’d heard of most of the other challenge runs featured here, this is the most surprising one I hadn’t heard about until I started doing research for this piece. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527">Spanish streamer Silithur</a></span> managed to beat <em>Elden Ring </em>a few months ago with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyImportantFriesAMPEnergy-qoSlWKhAB3tPMsSW&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyImportantFriesAMPEnergy-qoSlWKhAB3tPMsSW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morse code</a></span>! That’s right, a single button and way too many dashes and dots to count, but the guy fucking did it. He even snuck in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527">dunk on Elon Musk</a></span> in the process. How do you tap out, “Holy shit, you’re a legend” in Morse?</p><h2 id="h5328"><a id=""></a>A fish</h2><p>I’m not sure what I could write that properly captures what a feat this is. This goldfish is just built different. Better than most of us, even. We could all stand to learn a thing or two from them.</p><h2 id="h5329"><a id=""></a>Full-body motion controller</h2><p>Sometimes you play a game so good you just want to live in it, perils and all. Well that’s what the streamer Luality kind of accomplished by turning her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoxUZr061XE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoxUZr061XE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole body into her <em>Elden Ring </em>controller</a></span>. With the help of some motion controls, the streamer turned <em>Elden Ring </em>into a full-body experience. If she wanted to dodge, she would bob in that direction and if she wanted to attack she would make a swiping motion with her hand, as if she was actually armed. She even bound the healing flask to her making a drinking motion with one of her hands. The results are as chaotic, frustrating, and funny as you might expect.</p><h2 id="h5330"><a id=""></a>Ring Fit Wheel (and all the other wild ways this guy modded the game)</h2><p>While doing some research for this list, I came across one YouTube channel that has, over the years, put a lot of effort into playing <em>Elden Ring </em>with increasingly bizarre controllers. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@SuperLouis64&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@SuperLouis64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Louis 64</a></span>’s whole thing is actually that he seems to love gimmicky controls and makes a bunch of unique ones from scratch. Boy, has he found a lot of different ways in which to play <em>Elden Ring</em>, folks.</p><p>I am most familiar with his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cC-T3a-Y0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cC-T3a-Y0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>set up</a></span>, where he uses that game’s unique wheel-like controller to exercise while also dodge-rolling and plugging away at bosses in <em>Elden Ring</em>. His contraptions don’t end there, though. Just a month ago, the guy figured out how to make a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_sgWVA7us&amp;t=657s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_sgWVA7us&amp;t=657s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully functional bow and arrow controller</a></span> from a kids’ toy. Before that, he literally built a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIfpdHdOoLU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIfpdHdOoLU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatsword from <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em> </em>and turned it into a controller. He’s also famously played the game with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-super-louis-64-banana-controller-emulator-bo-1848657617&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-super-louis-64-banana-controller-emulator-bo-1848657617">controller fashioned from bananas</a></span>. I don’t understand how or why he does these things, but the point is that there’s someone out there doing it, and that’s pretty neat.</p><h2 id="h5331"><a id=""></a>A mouth controller</h2><p>While most of these entries are cool optional challenge runs that folks have opted into, my favorite is this one from a disabled player who can’t use standard controllers. A tetraplegic player—meaning they’re paralyzed from the neck down— shared a video of themselves overcoming <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s motherfucker of a final boss <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ebrjwr/i_finally_beat_the_dlc_endboss_with_my_mouth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ebrjwr/i_finally_beat_the_dlc_endboss_with_my_mouth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a mouth controller</a></span>. I don’t know about you, but it’s maybe one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen.</p><p>I’ve yet to get to the end of the expansion, but I’m sure that fight’s going to take me hundreds of tries to beat unless I use a very busted build. Some of the most seasoned <em>Elden Ring </em>players are fully abled and struggle against it. It literally either takes grit, complete mastery of the game, or an intense exploitation to do this fight with both hands, but here’s someone who can clear it without the use of any. That’s a goddamn hero right there. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Roughly 2,600 voice actors and motion capture artists, including talents like Troy Baker from <em>The Last of Us</em>, Jennifer Hale from <em>Mass Effect</em>, and Matt Mercer from<em> The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, have been working without an Interactive Media Agreement since November 2022. The strike starts on July 26 at 12:01 a.m.</p><p> “The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games,” chief negotiator  Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement. “That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.”</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117">Video Game Voice Actors Are Ready To Strike Over AI.

Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA.

<p>After nearly two years of the community voicing frustrations, Blizzard has announced that Overwatch 2 6v6 will be coming back. This return comes in the form of new tests to decide if the game will permanently go back to 6v6 or stick with 5v5.</p>



<p>“The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test,” game director Aaron Keller said in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on the Overwatch website</a>. “Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-why-hasn-t-overwatch-2-returned-to-6v6-gameplay">Why Hasn’t Overwatch 2 Returned To 6v6 Gameplay?</h2>



<p>As far as why they will run tests of the mode instead of a full scale return, Keller says there are a few reasons for the decision. The first, he says, is to make sure the game can be optimized for 12-player matches.</p>



<p>“There have been quite a few upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 that have an impact on the performance of the game,” he said. “These range from new features like allied outlines and enabling healer vision by default, the addition of more technically demanding hero kits, as well as visual upgrades to UI, heroes and maps.”</p>



<p>He added that in 6v6 play, the updates can cause performance issues on older systems.</p>



<p>The second big reason, which he says gives him “anxiety about opening this Pandora’s Box”, involves match queue times if 6v6 becomes a permanent addition to the game.</p>



<p>“The team was not able to solve this issue previously,” he said. “While we have some ideas now, there’s no guarantee that they will work. Is there a world where people are willing to live with long queue times to play this format? Maybe, but that’s a pretty risky move to make.”</p>



<p>He closed by saying that the Overwatch team’s goal is to continue to build a game “that you want to play season after season”, even if that means the return of 6v6.</p>

<p>What do you think of Overwatch 2 bringing back 6v6, at least with test matches for now?

                <p>CPU manufacturer AMD has announced it's delaying the release of its new Zen 5 Ryzen 9000 CPUs after discovering that some of the first chips to come off the assembly line were lacking in quality. Previously scheduled to arrive in late July, the processors will now become available for purchase in August.</p><p dir="ltr">"We appreciate the excitement around Ryzen 9000 series processor," AMD senior VP and GM of computing and graphics Jack Huynh <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1816210711254639031" rel="nofollow ">said on Twitter</a>. "During final checks, we found the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/matteo-menapace-co-designer-of-daybreak-has-been-banned-from-spiel-des-jahres<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, Germany held its annual Spiel des Jahres event. It is one of the biggest award shows in the tabletop industry, rewarding sharp game design and excellent quality. And one of its winners, Matteo Menapace, has been permanently banned from all future events. This was due to a sticker he chose to wear, and the message it sent.</p>

<p>The banning of Matteo Menapace from Spiel des Jahres was announced via post on their <a href="https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/preisverleihung-kennerspiel-des-jahres-2024/">official website</a>. The post explains the reason for Menapace's ban. While attending the event, Menapace wore a sticker on stage in the Palestinian national colors represented as a watermelon.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/matteo-menapace-daybreak-spiel-des-jahres-award-photo.jpg?itok=iScPIyM0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/matteo-menapace-daybreak-spiel-des-jahres-award-photo.jpg?itok=Bd8z8PR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The small sticker was attached to Menapace's t-shirt during the event. During the event, the sticker was not noticed. However, shortly after, chairman Harald Schrapers and deputy chairman Christoph Schlewinski asked Menapace to hand over the sticker, forbade him to show it during photographs, and said he would no longer be welcome at future award events.</p>
<p>According to the Spiel des Jahres association, the intended message of this sticker, that of a "Great Palestine" denies the existence of the State of Israel. In context, this is an expression of antisemitism, which exceeded the limits of legitimate political expression at the event.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it goes against the organization's "Playing For Tolerance" initiative, which is against any form of racism and antisemitism. This initiative has been in place for years.</p>
<p>Matteo Menapace and Matt Leacock won this year's Kennerspiel des Jahres award for complex games at Spiel des Jahres. The award was for their climate action-focused board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/334986/daybreak"><em>Daybreak</em></a> (aka <em>e-mission</em> in Germany).</p>

Today’s <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/">blog post from the developers</a> at Blizzard says that, finally, “we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.” </p><p>Game director Aaron Keller also notes that issues like hero balancing, game performance, and what might happen to queue times if players have a choice between the two formats are questions the team needs to answer but is at least ready to start considering.</p><p>Other than making a full-priced game free to play and laying out promises about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725808/overwatch-2-hero-mode-canceled-2023-roadmap">player-vs-environment content</a> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/19/23730369/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-cancellation">weren’t exactly fulfilled</a>, the shift to <em>Overwatch 2</em> also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446374/overwatch-2-preview-five-player-multiplayer-new-maps-changes">removed one tank player</a> from each team. Removing one of the largest characters who dealt and received the most punishment made things much simpler but also made it seem like the outcome of the game depended a little too much on that one role. </p><p>If your tank is getting countered or outplayed — there’s often not a lot left to do.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Activision Blizzard</cite></p></div><p>So, should they bring the old style back? It’s not really that simple. I’ve played the game in all roles throughout all of these iterations, and I see arguments on both sides of the issue. There’s no question that the new game has better queue times, which the post attributes to the fact that the actual number of players queueing for each role has always more closely fit a ratio of one tank per team.</p><p>But even in the old system, I agree that the games were chaotic, and now there’s a playerbase full of people who’ve never experienced it. Good luck explaining ultimate combos to someone who might have never heard most of the voice lines from tank teammates talking to each other.</p><p>While it’s unclear when the 6v6 playtests will happen, Keller says that at least one “Hacked” event this season will try out “other ways of putting a team together that aren’t quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue,” to see how the developers can address some issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>If you can't betray your friends in the middle of an arcade or party game, are you even having fun?</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'll always have a soft spot for the games I'd play with my friends for hours at a time while we jostled each other on the couch and screamed at each other for any perceived betrayal. You know the ones: your Mario Karts and Mario Parties. Games where forging flimsy alliances against the one player who is perceived as the greatest threat, or being a filthy scumbag of a traitor who delights in chaos, are things that are not actually a part of the core gameplay loop in these games, but we as a society have decided that they should be. They are the video game Unos of the world. Racing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deathsprint-66/" data-ref-id="5000-623102">DeathSprint 66</a> is shaping up to be that kind of experience. I've played DeathSprint 66 twice now--once at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">Summer Game Fest</a> and again recently at a preview event--and both times, the game tickled the lizard part of my brain that enjoys snatching away a victory from a friend at the last minute and offering up nothing more than a coy smile.</p><p dir="ltr">DeathSprint 66 sees you and seven other players (or bots!) race around tracks at breakneck speeds, utilizing augmented suits to sprint at high speeds, drift around corners, grind along rails, wall-run, and make incredible acrobatic leaps. All the while, the track and the other players pose as constant dangers--shifting laser grids and massive buzzsaws dot each track and items like heat-seeking drones and landmines can be picked up and used by you and your competitors. It's a dangerous competition, but thankfully you're only racing as your character's clone--and you bring a handful of backups with you to each race, so every blood splatter or eviscerated limb is only a few seconds of delay in your day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340527" data-ratio="0.546875" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340527"></a><figcaption>Don't worry about losing your legs--your character has several backup clones who can jump into the race.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Nearly every aspect of DeathSprint 66 is geared around the mayhem and the process of taking advantage of others to improve your own chances of success (running directly behind a competitor and in the draft they create, for example, grants you a quick burst of speed to pass them by). DeathSprint 66 is ripe for friendly betrayal, and I felt nostalgic for Sonic Riders while playing it (the first one, obviously; not its weird sequels). It's also very approachable--though the tougher tracks are trickier to get around, DeathSprint 66 is a mechanically simple game, and a few runs around each track will give you a pretty good idea of where you can go. Once you grasp that understanding, it's just a question of practice. If you've played an arcade racer like Mario Kart or Sonic Riders, you already have an understanding of the type of game DeathSprint 66 is.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, there are a few ways in which DeathSprint 66 falls short of what's come before. The most blatant is the aesthetic variety of the tracks, which is to say there isn't any. Though each track offers a unique challenge in terms of its layout--you've got your traditional figure-eight, for instance, and then your more dastardly setups like one track that sees you needing to regularly get over huge pits of saw blades--they all take place in the same city and largely look the same. That's not a dealbreaker for me when it comes to wanting to grab DeathSprint 66, but it does interfere with any of the tracks developing any sort of personality.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340528" data-ratio="0.5627931214174" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340528"></a><figcaption>I'd like to see a little bit more variety when it comes to character customization.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This issue extends to character creation, too. You can customize your character somewhat, fitting them with different racing suits and picking from a collection of different color schemes, but it's not enough--you can't easily distinguish between different racers once everyone is in motion. If someone is going to throw a buzzsaw at me, I want to know exactly who to blame before they have a chance to fake how they don't know what I'm talking about. And if I see someone wallrunning behind me, I want to be able to know exactly which of my friends I should be making a deal with before betraying said sucker.</p><p dir="ltr">These aspects of competitive arcade racers--knowing the track and being able to identify your competitors at a glance--aren't crucial to the genre, but they do make them more fun, and it's disappointing to see DeathSprint 66 not running out of the gate with that already locked down. As a live-service game, it's entirely possible new tracks will be added post-launch that are aesthetically distinct from what the game starts with, and that additional character customization options could be implemented that are more wacky and visually clear-cut than the generic choices the game is starting with. But the structure of the game is already a great time, and I can't wait to trick my friends into picking it up on the promise that it will be a chill time for all.</p><p dir="ltr">DeathSprint 66 is set to launch on PC in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/subliners-brand-cdl-shutting-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>NYXL – the parent company of the New York Subliners – has just revealed that the NYSL brand is closing down. This news comes mere weeks after the announcement that the Subliners and Cloud9 had partnered ahead of the Esports World Cup. It wasn’t made clear how this new partnership would impact the CDL team’s branding, but now the epic change has been unveiled – the New York Subliners (by brand, at least) are no more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-line">End of the Line</h2>



<p>The New York Subliners have been a hugely impactful force in the Call of Duty League for years. From being an underdog squad in the Cold War season to dominating an entire year of gameplay and winning COD Champs in 2023, the squad has come up <strong>fast</strong>. For the longest time, fans have followed the ins and outs of this team, learning transparently what goes on behind the doors of the Subliners.</p>



<p>It was announced today that the New York Subliners is being shut down from a branding perspective. Here’s the message (and the emotional montage) that was posted online:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>1 💍, 6 🥇, 3 🥈 , the first New York homestand, and countless other memories. To all our fans, thank you for your love and support over the past 5 years. It has been an incredible journey, and we’re grateful to have experienced it with all of you.</p><p>Signing out. </p><p>-NYXL… <a href="https://t.co/57z1fdnTFB">pic.twitter.com/57z1fdnTFB</a></p></div>— Subliners (@Subliners) <a href="https://twitter.com/Subliners/status/1816519252137881962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Cloud9 responded to this post by stressing: ‘This isn’t the end, just a new beginning’. It’s a direct indication that C9 will make a grand re-entry to the Call of Duty scene next season. It was always a guaranteed thing that the Subliners squad would represent C9’s brand at the Esports World Cup, but nobody thought that the CDL-focused brand would dissipate.</p>



<p>Days ago, the New York Subliners came in second place at COD Champs, with OpTic Texas securing a massive win – the organisation’s first world championship victory since 2017.</p>



<p>I’ve since reached out to sources close to the Subliners to see if there’s more information about what’s coming next.</p>



<p>Are you sad to see the back of the Subliners, or excited about what might come from C9 during the 2025 CDL season?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blizzard Entertainment has laid out plans to begin testing for the potential return of 6v6 matchups in Overwatch 2…eventually.</p><p>The update on the controversy plaguing the Overwatch community comes from game director Aaron Keller, who posted a 3600-word <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Director’s Take blog post</a> on the subject today. It’s a lengthy statement on the history of 6v6, why <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pvp-will-now-be-5v5-not-6v6"><u>it was removed with the launch of Overwatch 2</u></a>, and how Blizzard plans to experiment with the mode once again. That’s right – the team is interested in bringing back the 12-player option nearly two years after it was swapped out for the faster-paced 5v5 mode.</p><p>“The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test,” Keller says. “Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/ow2-f2p-trailerthumbnail-1920x1080-1721888065622.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is re-examining the possibility of 6v6 in Overwatch 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Keller says that while the team remains focused on ironing out 5v5, it is also “looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in Overwatch 2.” Even the smallest sign of 6v6 is enough to reignite interest in players who have begged for its return, but implementing these tests is not as simple as just flipping a switch. Technological challenges presented by 12-player lobbies is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome. The game director explains that, while the team is investigating a permanent performance increase across all platforms, it’s a “large effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish.” There’s also the issue of queue times, which could be potentially inflated across the entire Overwatch 2 experience should something like 6v6 stick around.</p><p>No matter how badly some players want 6v6 back, alterations to the Overwatch 2 formula present new challenges to overcome. Though Keller says a new iteration of Quick Play: Hacked will experiment with team assembly at some point during Season 13, it’s not exactly clear when official testing will begin. He cautions that this proposed reintroduction of 6v6 will be a long process and that today’s post is only the “start of this conversation.”</p><p>“We’d run the test for a few weeks and gauge interest from the community,” Keller explains when speaking on the benefit of the tests. “Then we’d measure the impact it had on the other experiences in Overwatch 2, like 5v5, Arcade, etc. We’d take the lessons from this playtest to see what we can learn about the mode within the current game ecosystem and for the future of Overwatch. We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for. Whether that’s a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out.”</p><h2>Let’s break it down</h2><p>Overwatch launched in 2016 and has since slowly evolved into an entirely different beast. As Blizzard has worked to establish fair and fun game environments, it has added, gutted, and altered a wide variety of game modes. As noted by Keller, these changes include stricter Hero limits in Quick Play, the addition of the more rigid mode known as Role Queue, and of course, the switch to 5v5.</p><p>The original Overwatch used the 6v6 format as its go-to structure until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-will-replace-the-original-game-at-launch">the entire experience was replaced with Overwatch 2 in 2022</a>. This free-to-play sequel swapped in 5v5 matches, with Blizzard’s reasoning at the time being that it would reduce battlefield clutter and lead to a cleaner, more enjoyable experience for all three roles – Tank, Damage, and Support. Keller stands by the decision, saying that 5v5 is “more cognitively manageable” than the 6v6 matchups. It also led to drastically shorter queue times in Role Queue, especially for those who queued up to play Damage Heroes.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/overwatch-2-queue-time-chart-1721931042820.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A chart shared by Aaron Keller highlighting 5v5 and 6v6 Ranked Play queue times per role.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Keller acknowledges that 6v6 still has its upsides, and the decision to remove it was not made lightly. Still, there are those who prefer the original format to this day and have even campaigned for its return. Calls for Blizzard to include a 6v6 option reached a boiling point the last few months, with many players complaining that 5v5 is more punishing on an individual level, especially when queueing up to play Tank. With tensions in the Overwatch community rising, Blizzard has finally stepped in.</p><p>Keller has been <a href="https://x.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1806793128537637183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teasing plans to offer more insight into Blizzard's point of view for several weeks</u></a>, and today’s post likely goes into more detail than many were expecting. However, as the director mentioned, the studio has a lot of work and listening to do before team composition tests begin, and even then, it’s unclear if these experiments will yield the results its community desires.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Overwatch 2 Season 11 Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, Overwatch 2 is barreling toward the end of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-teases-transformers-collab-in-season-11-trailer">Season 11</a> of its post-launch roadmap. While details on how Season 12 will up the ante mostly remain a mystery, the studio did just wrap up a weekend playtest for its new Support Hero, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-reveals-newest-support-hero-and-shell-be-playable-this-weekend">Juno</a>, an agile space-themed competitor with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-voice-line-debunks-long-running-fan-theory-in-the-funniest-way-possible">interesting ties to the Overwatch universe</a>.

                <p>Less than two years after the release of Overwatch 2, game director Aaron Keller has announced that Blizzard is now open to reversing one of the series' biggest--and most contentious--decisions: its shift to 5v5 gameplay.</p><p>Keller shared the news in his latest <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Director's Take</a>, a regular blog he publishes to help keep fans up to date on key decisions. In it, Keller explained the reasons why the studio pivoted away from Overwatch's 6v6 gameplay, as well as laid out a rough plan to implement 6v6 battles back into the game through a "series of events" most likely taking place "several seasons" down the road.</p><p>"The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test. 'Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results?' We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results," Keller wrote.</p><p>If all these plans sounds a bit loose, it's because they are. As for why we don't have concrete dates or event names yet, Keller was quick to explain that the transition back to 6v6 is somewhat of a logistical nightmare for "reasons that may not be readily apparent." To attempt to explain these reasons, he offered up a "Historical Overview" of Overwatch as well as several paragraphs outlining why he believes 5v5 best suits Overwatch 2.</p><p>According to Keller, the introduction of Hero Limits--and subsequently Role Queues--in the original Overwatch played a large role in the team's decision to make Overwatch 2 5v5. Data collected by the team revealed that queue times were dramatically shorter when only ten players were needed to start a game--particularly for those playing the game's most popular role, Damage. Keller also explained that the switch was made to offer "greater individual agency" to players.</p><p>"Many times, fights in 6v6 couldn’t resolve until ultimate abilities came online. Correct that, until ultimate combos could be executed to break through two tanks worth of mitigation supported by high, uncontested healing output," Keller wrote. "The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs, but reaaaally low, lows. One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments."</p><p>Keller went on to explain that "tank synergy wasn't always fun," and that the inclusion of two tanks on a team could "absolutely grind [a game] to a halt." Seeing as Overwatch 2 is more focused on being a fast-paced FPS now, 5v5--and the elimination of one of the game's two tank roles--felt vital to executing that idea. He also noted that it was simply harder to follow 6v6 combat, as "tracking nine other players is easier than 11." Keller called the switch to 5v5 "a bit more cognitively manageable."</p><p>Despite all of this, however, Keller admits there were plenty of things he enjoyed about 6v6, such as its charmingly chaotic energy. He also stated that the stakes perhaps felt a bit lower in 6v6, as an extra player mitigated the damage caused by someone "performing poorly." Naturally, lower stakes can lead to players experiencing more fun.</p><p>And yet, pivoting back to 6v6 doesn't seem entirely simple. The largest reason for this, Keller wrote, is that they need to implement the 6v6 tests in a way that "allows the game to have optimized technical performance (I'm referring to framerate and memory constraints) with 12 players in a match."</p><p>"There have been quite a few upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 that have an impact on the performance of the game. These range from new features like allied outlines and enabling healer vision by default, the addition of more technically demanding hero kits, as well as visual upgrades to UI, heroes and maps," Keller explained. "In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can have significant impacts for our players, causing the game to underperform on older systems. Overwatch is a fast-paced game, and maintaining a game that runs smoothly across all our platforms is important for the player’s experience. While a limited time test could arrive sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently increase performance across the game. This would be a large effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish."</p><p>Keller also noted that another issue "that still gives [him] anxiety about opening this Pandora's Box" is queue times. Keller concluded that gathering data from these tests--particularly data regarding queue times, overall performance, and player feedback--will be incredibly valuable.</p><p>"We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for," Keller said. "Whether that’s a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out."</p>

            <p>
Maybe you've heard of Kamala Harris; she's the current US vice president and very likely the Democratic party's official presidential nominee for November's US election. But now she's firmly back in the spotlight, the mildly curious case of her secret life in developer Remedy's 2019 action-adventure Control has resurfaced online.
</p>
<p>
You see, pinned to a whiteboard in an unassuming corner of The Oldest House - the transdimensional Brutalist office block at the heart of Control's story - is a picture of a missing 40-year-old Bureau employee, Jane Farland, lost during one of the House's shifts. Only, Photoshopped eyes aside, Jane Farland is the spitting image of Vice President Harris.
</p>
<p>
Harris' surprise secret life as a fictitious video game character has been noted before - in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/controlgame/comments/d0rhzv/kamala_harris_apparently_exists_as_a_different/">five-year-old Reddit thread</a>, for instance - but the picture has started gaining traction again as Harris once again makes headlines thanks to her likely US presidential bid.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the story behind the image is a little harder to uncover. Journalist Stephen Totilo tried to get to the bottom of it as part of his latest <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, first pinpointing the image's location to a whiteboard near an elevator in Control's Central Executive hub.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Unfortunately, Totilo's attempts to get a comment from Remedy on Harris' appearance in Control have so far been met with silence (I've reached out to the developer, just in case it's feeling chattier today), but the real answer is likely to be a fairly boring one.
</p>
<p>
The image appears to be an only lightly doctored official photo from Harris' time as a US Senator. And given US government materials are generally in the public domain, Remedy would be free to use Harris' headshot if it was Googling "US federal employee in a business suit" for its missing person whiteboard (notably, Harris isn't the only real-life US senator who appears there). One eye-tweak later and - ta da! - another in-game asset is complete.
</p>
<p>
Still, if Jane Farland suddenly finds her way back to The Oldest House in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-2-still-in-proof-of-concept-stage-as-max-payne-remake-enters-production-readiness">Control 2</a> and she's <em>still</em> got Kamala Harris' face, then Remedy might have some explaining to do.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-is-exploring-how-to-test-6v6-in-the-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the biggest changes made by Blizzard to Overwatch 2 is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-pvp-5v5-maps-hero-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch</a> from 6v6 matches to 5v5. However, a sizable amount of fans of the original game remained vocal about reintroducing 6v6 in some form, and the developers are taking that feedback seriously.</p>
<p>Today, Game Director Aaron Keller explained the hurdles it'll have to overcome first. The first and biggest reason is the need to do this in a way that allows the game to have optimized technical performance with 12 players in a match: a number of upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 impact the game's performance. In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can significantly impact players using older systems.</p>
<p>While a time-limited Overwatch 2 test could come sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently improve performance across the entire game. This endeavor will likely take at least several seasons, said Blizzard.</p>
<p>Another issue is what to do with queue times, which was the main reason for switching from 6v6 to 5v5 in the first place. They have some ideas, but there's no guarantee they'll work. Moreover, Blizzard understandably wishes to make sure that those who enjoy the game as it is today are not frustrated by these attempts to reintroduce 6v6.</p>
<p>The current objective is to run a test for a few weeks and gauge the community's interest. Then, the developers would measure its impact on the other experiences in Overwatch 2, like 5v5, arcade, etc. They'd use the lessons from that playtest to see what could be learned about the mode within the current game ecosystem and for the future of the franchise. They would carefully ponder on the learnings from each test and how they can best give players what they want. Whether that's a 5v5 world, a 6v6 world, or both will be figured out in the future.</p>
<p>In other Overwatch 2 news, the first Mythic weapon skin was <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> earlier this week, giving Reinhardt fans a cool new cosmetic to purchase.</p>

But by the end of the nearly 4,000-word blog post, it’s clear that the team is still struggling to define <em>Overwatch 2</em>, which once again leads us back to the question: Why does it exist in the first place?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,196049" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> was originally meant to exist alongside the original game, bringing new PvE elements and a shared multiplayer ecosystem across both titles.

All of those changes have led to where we are today, a spot that many feel is stagnant and unenjoyable.<br></p><p>Role Queue ensures you’re not playing competitive matches with no healers (which was incredibly frustrating in the original game), but Keller acknowledges that this consistency made <em>Overwatch </em>“start to feel samey.” I’ve played hundreds of hours of competitive <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and so many of my matches have blurred together into a streak of sameness. “Could there be an in-between version that softens the original problems without completely solving them and also isn’t quite as reactive as our current Role Queue system?” Keller wonders.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, the shift to 5v5 also somewhat flattened <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s gameplay. “The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs but reaaaaally low, lows,” Keller wrote. “One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of those high moments.” The 5v5 change removed the secondary tank role, which helps prevent matches from getting stunlocked and drastically reduces queue times, but also fundamentally alters the way every single role is played.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-recommend-id="image://bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-recommend-id="image://bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Support players, no longer tasked with keeping two massive tanks afloat, have to be more aggressive, adding their damage to an already high-damage pool thanks to the dual DPS characters. And the tank, rather than having a secondary, or off-tank, to support them, is now the biggest hero on the field and the most likely to bear the brunt of every enemy player’s damage and utilities. Tanks now play to exist, to stay alive, rather than playmake.<br></p><p>“Having two [tanks] allowed one to focus on protecting their backline while the other held ground or pushed into the enemy team,” Keller writes about 6v6. “The tank role had a lot of depth in understanding how to work with the other tank on the team.” And as <em>Overwatch</em> players have pointed out, so many of the tanks’ existing kits are tailored for 6v6 play, which too-often renders off-tank choices like Wrecking Ball completely unviable, especially in competitive matches.<br></p><p>The struggle to balance tanks for 5v5 play has persisted for nearly two years. In June, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-tank-heroes-reinhardt-buffs-rework-nerf-1851567261&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-tank-heroes-reinhardt-buffs-rework-nerf-1851567261">Blizzard admitted that</a></span> tanks were miserable to play after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801">damage hero passive</a></span> weakened healing and made them feel like they were made of glass, and a subsequent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-11-midseason-worst-patch-mauga-tanks-1851584869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-11-midseason-worst-patch-mauga-tanks-1851584869">tank-focused patch wildly overcorrected</a></span>, making them far too powerful.<br></p><p>“The past year and a half has shown us that there are issues with balancing tanks for 5v5, as well [as 6v6],” the blog post reads. No shit.<br></p><h2 id="h22843"><a id=""></a><strong>Five versus six</strong></h2><p>The crux of what many players believe is the issue with the 5v5 swap is that the majority of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s characters, maps, and modes were built for 6v6 play. Some suggest that Blizzard, rather than making major changes like nerfing shields (which would render problematic <em>Overwatch 1</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWbegqdb2o8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWbegqdb2o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metas like pirate ship</a></span> useless), the team just pulled the second tank. Pulling that second tank removes freedom of choice for tank players and robs us of the variety of gameplay styles and approaches that comes from finding the perfect balance between two tanks.<br></p><p>It also puts more pressure on the supports to keep that singular tank afloat, while ensuring that DPS players have to choose specific heroes to counter the singular, beefed-up enemy tank. Not to mention the burden the singular tank player has to bear—if they can’t keep up with the enemy tank, matches are wildly unfun for them and their squad.<br></p><p>Warring team composition factions within the <em>Overwatch </em>community are nearly split right down the middle, as evidenced by a March poll from former OWL esports player Jake Lyon, in which 51.9% of players said they preferred 5v5 to the original 6v6 supporters’ 48.1%. That almost-even split tells me one thing: this is more about personal preference than what is objectively better, as there are downsides to both formats. As Keller writes in the blog, “Our players have different opinions and preferences about the ideal number of players in an <em>Overwatch</em> match, and so does our team.”</p><p>For more flexible, top-down players, 5v5 is a perfectly fine experience, as they can easily swap between any character in their role’s roster to ensure the match is a success. For people like myself, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-moira-hero-tips-guide-tricks-1851392060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-moira-hero-tips-guide-tricks-1851392060">former Moira one-trick</a></span> who expanded her support roster to five or so solid picks, 5v5 can feel incredibly limiting—and therefore frustrating. As Keller and others have made clear, there are pros and cons to both versions of <em>Overwatch</em>’s core multiplayer mode. There’s no singular, simplistic solution to this problem that Blizzard has inadvertently created.</p><figure id="" data-id="79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-recommend-id="image://79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-format="png" data-width="1427" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-recommend-id="image://79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-format="png" data-width="1427" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h22844"><a id=""></a><strong>Now what?</strong></h2><p>Keller’s blog post is clear: Blizzard is “focused on making 5v5 the best experience that it can be.” But, the team is also “open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback.” As we’ve seen in the last year or so, Blizzard has experimented with gameplay changes in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-quick-play-hacked-hero-limits-season-9-1851319812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-quick-play-hacked-hero-limits-season-9-1851319812">Quick Play: Hacked mode</a></span>, including increasing the speed of objective captures and payload movement (a change it ultimately kept in the game). An upcoming Quick Play: Hacked will experiment with team comps in ways “that aren’t quite as rigid as set composition but not as loose as Open Queue.” But what about 6v6?<br></p><p>“We’re looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in <em>Overwatch 2</em>,” Keller promises. He doesn’t outline what those events will be or what they’ll entail, but I don’t envy the work Blizzard will have to do if it plans on implementing 6v6 in any form. As much as myself and other disgruntled <em>Overwatch</em> players would like to think it’s as simple as offering both 6v6 and 5v5 Quickplay and Competitive modes, there is a lot going on under the hood that could break.<br></p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em>’s updated UI and improved graphics could creak and strain with the addition of two more heroes in each match, and changes made to hero’s kits could feel either perfectly balanced or wildly off depending on whether you’re in a 5v5 or 6v6 match. And Keller voices concerns with “opening Pandora’s box” when it comes to queue times, which will likely increase with the inclusion of an extra player on your squad. “The team was not able to solve this problem previously,” he admits. But would 6v6 loyalists even care that they have to wait longer to get their preferred game mode back?<br></p><p>This latest Director’s Take promises that “this isn’t the last time [Blizzard will] be getting into 5v5 or 6v6,” so I’m sure the debate will continue on for many more months. I just want to get out of gold in support, please. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
