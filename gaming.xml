                <p>The Communications Workers of America, the union representing QA testers at ZeniMax, announced today that it has reached a tentative agreement on a labor contract with Microsoft. If implemented, this contract will be one of the first to go into effect at one of the big AAA game publishers.</p><p>Last month, the union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-and-zenimax-union-votes-to-authorize-a-strike/1100-6530524/" data-ref-id="1100-6530524">voted to authorize a strike</a> in response to challenges to the contract negotiation process; this agreement would avoid a strike from being carried out. In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, CWA shared that the agreed contract would grant ZeniMax employees significantly increased protections and would raise pay across the board. It would also implement guidelines on the use of AI, restrict "arbitrary dismissal," and create processes to ensure that QA testers adequately receive credit in video games that they contribute to.</p><p>QA testing has been a hotspot of unionization efforts in the games industry, some of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/" data-ref-id="1100-6524209">have been targeted with union-busting efforts</a>. At ZeniMax, the QA testers' union represents around 300 employees and has been fighting for several years for this contract. In response to the agreement, Jessee Leese, a QA tester and union representative at ZeniMax, stated, "Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve."</p><p>In early 2023, ZeniMax employees created ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, a coalition of CWA units embedded in the company that was made possible under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-formally-agrees-to-recognize-activision-blizzard-union/1100-6504549/" data-ref-id="1100-6504549">Microsoft's neutrality agreement with union activism.</a> Since then, unionization has expanded at Microsoft to include more teams; earlier in May, for instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/" data-ref-id="1100-6531438">the Overwatch 2 team at Blizzard announced that it has fully unionized</a>. There are now over 2,000 unionized employees at Microsoft.</p><p>This contract still needs to complete several hurdles before it can be fully implemented. Now that both parties have tentatively agreed, the union will hold a series of explanation sessions for its members to learn about its provisions. Then, in late June, CWA expects to hold a ratification vote among its members.</p><p><i>Disclosure: The author of this article is a member of CWA by way of a graduate student union. </i></p>

			<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-is-an-unreal-engine-5-action-adventure-game-due-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hell Is Us</a> developer Rogue Factor has <a href="https://x.com/HELLisUSgame/status/1928466441373716850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the full PC system requirements for their intriguing action/adventure roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but its requirements are even higher than what we've seen in most cases. According to the developers, you'll need a GeForce RTX 4090 to play at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second on Ultra settings. This is already with upscaling enabled, too.</p>

<p>The good news is that everyone can test Hell Is Us for themselves very soon. Rogue Factor also announced that a demo will be released on Steam, where it will be playable between June 2 and 16. Console users won't get any demo due to 'technical constraints'.</p>
<p>The demo starts right at the beginning of the game. This introduction is designed to ease players into Hell is Us and its core gameplay systems. It won't reveal everything that the full game has to offer; Rogue Factor said that some of the key elements, such as exploration and the evolving player experience, are best appreciated as the world opens up and the layers unfold.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, the studio also discussed the game's difficulty settings. It's meant to be a challenging experience, but there will be tweakable settings. There are three preset levels, and players can also choose a more granular control, customizing things like enemy health, enemy damage, enemy aggressiveness, and death penalty.</p>
<p>Hell Is Us will be released on September 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

		<p>In desperation, the extraordinary becomes possible.</p><p>It’s how I felt when <em>VICE</em> told me that seven years was, well, long enough. Many of my colleagues had started their own businesses, but I was not a business person. I can write, I can podcast, I can stream. Numbers? That’s what a calculator is for. Many times, I’ve stayed at a bad job because a bad job was better than hustling for a new one. </p><p><em>Own</em> my own company? No.</p><p>Except, over time, no became “maybe” and then with some nudging, maybe became “yes.” Two years later, one of the best things that ever happened to me was losing my job, striking out on my own, and owning fate. It’s weird to think that failure on your own terms is less of an existential threat than failure because some random executive decided they weren’t interested in your contributions anymore.</p><p>These moments go in cycles, and now, it’s <em>Polygon</em>’s turn.&nbsp;</p><p>In early May, the popular video game (and over time, like many others, entertainment) publication <em>Polygon</em> was acquired by a company of vultures known as Valnet. Nothing good comes from Valnet. Nothing good was going to come by Valnet buying <em>Polygon</em>. Naturally, Valnet’s first move as <em>Polygon</em>’s owner <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/polygon-sale-valnet/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was to enact mass layoffs</u></a>. <em>Polygon</em> hasn’t been shut down, but it’s a fundamentally different place.</p><p>The thing about working at a big company is you often become more than colleagues with the people you work with but <em>friends</em>, folks you share interests and values with. It’s why we continued <em>Waypoint</em> as <em>Remap</em>, and why some from <em>Polygon</em> are headed down a similar path.</p><p>Just recently, former <em>Polygon</em> EIC Chris Plante launched (to much personal jealousy, as it’s long been an idea I’ve had, as well) <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an <em>NPR</em>-style podcast called <em>Post Games</em>.</u></a> But today, I’m chatting with the folks behind another spin-off, and it’s an idea I haven’t seen tried before.</p><p>Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin were, until recently, guides producers at <em>Polygon</em>. For years now, guides have been the financial underbelly of many websites, a mashup of tasty SEO bait that search engines like Google love <em>and</em> beloved by people who just want to know how to find that weird collectible in a game that they’ve spent an hour looking for.</p><p>Now, Gilliam and Parkin are launching<em> Big Friendly.Guide</em>, a publication <em>focused</em> on guides and trying to foster a community <em>around</em> guides. </p><p>Can it work? That’s what I decided to ask Gilliam.</p><p>Before we get to that conversation, though, here’s how to find and support <em>Big Friendly.Guide</em>, which obviously I'd recommend you do:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/bigfriendlyguide?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Patreon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Website</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=SYGY9ZEMZ5LBN&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>PayPal Donation</u></a></li><li><a href="http://ko-fi.com/bigfriendlyguide?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Ko-fi Donation</u></a></li></ul><p>Now, onto the interview.</p><p><em>The conversation below has been lightly edited.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@gpthree?ref=remapradio.com"><span>George Pagan III</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Remap: Talk me through that final day at <em>Polygon</em>. When did you realize things were going wrong, and when did you realize it was one of the worst case scenarios?</strong></p><p>Ryan Gilliam: I actually found out that the website was being sold first, through my other Union co-workers. I was scrolling through our Union Slack when I saw everyone saying their jobs were eliminated. Then I saw people from my team saying they were eliminated. And then looked at my DMs to see Jeff—my co-founder of <em>BigFriendly.Guide</em>, who was also a Guides Producer— telling me to check my email. And that's where I saw that I was also being eliminated. I was in the middle of getting footage for a Destiny guide I was about to write that morning.</p><p>The second I saw the sale, I was worried, because we had fought so long and hard for our Union contract, and I couldn't imagine a <em>Polygon</em> without it. And then the dread of seeing that it didn't matter ... it hit twice for me. The industry sucks, and I've survived more layoffs than I can count—we were up to like two a year there for a while—but <em>Polygon</em> was usually safe. And then inside that bubble, in guides, I felt as safe as possible. In all the bad ways I saw it going down, this wasn't even on the radar for me. It was shocking.</p><p><strong>Remap: I remember what it felt like when the <em>VICE</em> layoff happened: ah, well, it finally came for me. I felt numb. There have been so many layoffs at so many places that while it seemed inevitable I’d also get laid off, all that mental preparation made it difficult to process the reality of it. Where was your head at? Was there a moment that it all sunk in?</strong></p><p>Gilliam: I finally felt pretty safe. After a long, long time of worrying about making myself essential and all that, I had developed skills with the guides team that made me valuable. And I saw how important the guides engine was to the success of the site. There was no reality for me where <em>Polygon</em> would exist with fewer guides people than we had, as it was already a pretty lean team. And, somehow, we had all missed this possibility of a bloodbath sale. Nobody I talked to was prepared or thought this was how it would go down. We thought, if anything, we'd eventually get cut down to a small staff site and guides would churn in the background.</p><p>I used to say that guides would be like the <em>Polygon</em> cockroach, and that they'd move us to some obscure team on another website before they'd give up traffic for the next Persona, Animal Crossing, or GTA, but didn't exactly nail that one.</p>

Given just 30 minutes’ notice before the news was announced by EA in an internal meeting, the studio had apparently just recently successfully passed one of its development milestones and was working toward a vertical slice that would show a chunk of the game in action. </p><p>The story reportedly revolved around playing as T’Challa, Killmonger, or Shuri as each vied for the mantle of Black Panther which would grant them superhuman powers. The game would also feature fights with the shapeshifting Skrull showcased in Marvel’s popular <em>Secret Invasion</em> comic-book crossover event. The gameplay was also aiming to incorporate elements of the Nemesis system from <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> such that enemies might remember past encounters with the player and relationships with aspiring Black Panther rivals might evolve. </p><p>It appears the most likely reason EA may have decided to walk away from the project was the lack of progress after several years of prototyping, even as some of those laid off in Cliffhanger Games’ closure had only just arrived at the studio earlier this year as it scaled up its development capabilities.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ZeniMax Workers United union, representing more than 300 quality assurance developers working at ZeniMax Media under Microsoft, has reached a tentative deal after two years of negotiating.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the Communications Workers of America (CWA) calls it a "<em>historic</em>" agreement. The ZeniMax Workers United-CWA is the first union formed after <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">Microsoft agreed</a> to take a neutral stance on its employees' unionizing when it was trying to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, to have a deal, even a tentative one, in place.</p>
<p>This deal also comes almost two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/">ZeniMax Workers United-CWA voted to authorize strike powers</a> for its negotiating committee. When the ZWU-CWA voted to authorize strike powers, representatives of the union voiced their displeasure with Microsoft dragging its feet at the bargaining table, with union member Zachary Armstrong saying "<em>None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is</em>."</p>
<p>The ZWU-CWA did just that and, according to the press release, negotiated a tentative deal that includes "<em>substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers.</em> " It also includes "<em>protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change,</em>" said ZWU-CWA bargaining committee member and senior QA tester Page Branson. "<em>Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn't a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after</em>."</p>
<p>Fellow ZWU-CWA bargaining committee member and QA tester Jessee Leese added, "<em>Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we deserve. Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We're the ones who make these games, and we'll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment</em>."</p>
<p>Now that a tentative deal has been reached, it is expected to be ratified by June 20, according to the ZWU-CWA. Once that's done, it'll officially be the beginning of a new era for QA workers at ZeniMax. After that, the other unions that have formed under Microsoft since it signed a union neutrality agreement that do not have a deal in place are the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA</a>, <a href="https://code-cwa.org/news/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">One BGS USA</a>, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">One BGS Montreal</a>, <a href="https://x.com/WeAreGWA">Game Workers Alliance at Raven Software</a>, and the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild-CWA</a>.</p>

It is the first contract agreement at Microsoft since the concerted effort to unionize the video game industry began roughly four years ago.</p><p>“This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after,” said Page Branson, a Senior QA Tester at ZeniMax <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">in the press release announcing the agreement</a>. A ratification vote for the contract will take place in late June.</p><p>The union, organized by the Communication Workers of America (CWA), was formed in 2023 and was voluntarily recognized by Microsoft as a part of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/6/23543005/microsoft-washington-post-ad-cwa-unions">labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</a>. In the two years since, the union and Microsoft engaged in contract negotiations that precipitated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft">a one day strike</a> to protest return to office and outsourcing policies and, in April, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote">strike authorization vote</a>.</p><p>The contract details offer up a glimpse of what workers across the industry are fighting for and what they can win. According to CWA’s press release, the contract guarantees wage increases – a big deal considering QA are some of the lowest paid workers in the industry. The contract will also include protections against arbitrary dismissal, as well as crediting guidelines – another big deal as there are numerous ways a person who worked on a video game <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129">can get left off its credits</a>. </p><p>While the industry’s organization efforts are ongoing, there’s been a surge in activity over the last four years. Workers at Raven Software, which was then a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard before its acquisition by Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894964/activision-blizzard-raven-software-employees-create-game-workers-alliance-union">organized the first video game union at a AAA publisher in 2022</a>. That win kicked off a series of other high profile unionization efforts across the industry but concentrated primarily within Microsoft – ostensibly to take advantage of the labor neutrality agreement that states that Microsoft will voluntarily recognize union efforts within the company. With ZeniMax workers finally winning a contract agreement at Microsoft, the industry has another first – one that will set a precedent for other, future negotiations.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Zenimax Workers United, made up of over 300 people, has been bargaining its first contract for nearly two years.</p><p>According to CWA, the tentative contract includes wage increases and new salary minimums, as well as "a crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers’ contributions to the video games they help create." It also includes grievance procedures, protections around dismissals, and agreements about <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/zenimax-workers-reach-agreement-microsoft-contractors-and-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> that Microsoft made in December 2023. Workers will vote on whether to ratify the contract by late June.</p><p>“Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve,”&nbsp;Jessee Leese, a QA tester and bargaining committee member, said in CWA's press release.&nbsp;“Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We’re the ones who make these games, and we’ll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment.”</p><p>Zenimax Workers United formed in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23495140/microsoft-zenimax-media-union-vote-qa-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a> and was recognized by Microsoft in accordance with a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/10/13/microsoft-affirms-commitment-to-labor-principles-cwa-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neutrality agreement</a> the company agreed to ahead of its purchase of Activision Blizzard.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of <em>Polygon</em>’s staff was laid off following Vox Media’s sale of the publication to Valnet, but two of its former guides writers are launching their own guides-focused website: <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, which you can find at <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/">bigfriendly.guide</a>. Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin founded and are co-owners of the site.</p><p>Guides make Gilliam “feel like I’m helping someone enjoy something that’s very important to me and I know is important to them,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “And so when I lost the opportunity to do that at my usual 9-to-5, I wanted to continue it.”</p><p>“I hate sounding immodest or bragging, but what Ryan and I got really good at was helping people play video games,” Parkin says. Their work on guides helps people have fun with games, he adds — and assists with things like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/23728443/giant-white-stallion-horse-god-find-tame">getting a giant horse in <em>Zelda</em></a>.</p><p><em>Big Friendly Guide</em> will make most of its content available for free, and the guides themselves won’t be paywalled. But Gilliam and Parkin will also be opening a Patreon for the site as a way for people to support the work, which will also give people access to a Discord. There will be a weekly podcast that’s free for everyone and a monthly subscriber-only podcast where Gilliam and Parkin will discuss their coverage plans.</p><p>There will be ads on the site to start. “For now, at least, we’ll run ads to keep the lights on,” according to the site’s <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/about-us/">About Us page</a>.) But the focus is more on building a community that trusts Gilliam and Parkin’s work and pays to support it. In addition to working on guides for games that interest them, Gilliam and Parkin want the community to make suggestions for guides that they can consider and respond to.</p><p>The release of <em>Big Friendly Guide</em> is just the latest outlet from <em>Polygon</em> staffers: former editor-in-chief Chris Plante launched <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-award-that-changes-the-lives">the <em>Post Games</em> podcast</a> and former curation editor Pete Volk launched <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petevolk.bsky.social/post/3lootykftkk2v">the <em>PV Guide</em> newsletter</a>. The new outlets follow the rise of other indie gaming publications like <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicole-carpenter"><em>Aftermath</em></a> and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview"><em>Game File</em></a>.</p><p>With <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, Gilliam and Parkin have modest expectations. “We’re not looking to build a brand and sell it or anything,” Parkin says. “I don’t think either of us want to get particularly rich. We want to keep doing this. That’s really what it comes down to.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’ll sometimes have an Abductor Virgin enemy on the base level, but will more often have a quick and simple fight against a knight boss at the top. Behind the boss will be a chest that you can open, which has a good chance of containing a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Medium Castles</strong>: You’ll also sometimes find medium-sized castles that are gated off and require you to enter via the sewers at the very bottom of the structure. Here, you can make your way up the wooden stairs inside to find a room halfway up containing a group of enemies. A side room here has a chest that may contain a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Ruined Cathedrals</strong>: Not to be confused with the small cathedrals where you find flask upgrades, ruined cathedrals are large, broken structures that are hard to miss. You’ll encounter basic enemies here, as well as a boss located either near the altar or by dropping down a hole in the center. Bosses aside, just defeat any nearby foes and check behind the altar in the center of the cathedral for a chest that has a solid chance of dropping a Stonesword Key for you.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to track down some extra Stonesword Keys, get out there and beat some ass at the gaols. Just don’t be surprised if one day you open up a gaol and get a whole lot more than you bargained for…ut that’s a discussion for another day!</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From the stunning Cynthia’s Roserade to the menacing Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex, prices on chase cards have been crashing faster than you can say “preorder regret.”. Let's not even start on the folks who shelled out over a grand for an ETB.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Destined Rivals, the Pokémon TCG scene is a minefield. Prismatic Evolutions and Pokémon Trading Card Game Classic are still absurdly overpriced at big-box stores, while TCGPlayer remains the go-to for cheaper singles and sealed products. Meanwhile, the MTG Marvel’s Spider-Man and Final Fantasy sets are prepped to drain wallets, and SteelSeries gear is still on sale for anyone wanting to upgrade their gaming setup. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need a killer Borderlands collectible? That Psycho and Claptrap Diorama from the IGN Store is calling your name. And let’s not forget about the Elebase USB-C Adapters (a must-have for your messy cable life) or the Anker USB-C Cables for fast charging. Oh, and if you’re up for some gaming on the cheap, the Xbox Game Studios Bundle on Humble is stacked with hits like Wasteland 3 and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Let’s get into it.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Launches Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you'd like to pay for sealed product in this climate to rip open boosters and find your chase card, go mad and have a blast. But if you'd like to save some money long term and guarantee that chase card, TCG Player has Destined Rivals single cards available right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">. It's insane how much this set has already crashed on release day, with some chase cards crashing beyond 50% since yesterday. Looking for the best market values on Destined Rivals sealed products instead? I've got you covered with crashing prices on sealed product. Imagine being the one person in the world who paid over $1000 for a Pokémon Center Elite Trainer box? Madness:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG Stock Update</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Long story short; things are looking bleak at retail for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> right now. Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it, but you might want to check out the sections below to save money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCG Player Has The Same Products For Less</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing. This will likely be the case unless you can secure preorders on new sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing#:~:text=Destined%20Rivals%20is%20the%20kind,building%20it%20around%20a%20character.">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>. Make no mistake products are still over MSRP, but If small businesses can undercut large retailers on TCG Player, there's something fundamentally broken in the supplier-distributor-retail chain.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Pokémon TCG Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Single <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing">Pokémon TCG</a> market on the other hand is going through a grand reset right now, which is down to a few factors. The crypto bro mentally to reselling products is dying down a little and more product is becoming available thanks to reprints. We're not out of the woods yet by any means, but this weeks <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-19">Crashers and Climbers</a> show recent cards going down in price and cards from the X and Y era shooting up in value. We're 100% moving in the right direction.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Marvel's Spider-Man Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst there's only the Play Booster Box and Scene Bundle for MTG: Marvel's Spider-Man live on Amazon right now, TCG Player has every sealed product that will hit the market on launch day. I've even found some pricing on cases of sealed product for those looking to rip open a tonne of boosters, so get on it before the market value on these products shoot up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Spider-Man Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunatley there's no listings for Spider-Man single cards right now considering we're a few months out from release, but I've managed to round up the listings for cards currently sitting on TCG Player waiting for presale allocations, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p id="mtg-final-fantasy-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle">MTG Final Fantasy Bundle Walmart Preorder</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221751"><div id="221751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the only preorder I can find from a big box retailer this morning, and it's actually cheaper than the market value over on TCG Player right now. Imagine that? If you're planning on picking up Final Fantasy at launch, this is a no-brainer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy TCG Player Preorders</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> is set to be the biggest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">Magic: The Gathering</a> set ever, which is a shock to absolutley no-one. Preorders are drying up at retail, but there's plenty of choice available on TCG Player right now. I've found all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon">preorders</a> listed so far (including prerelease boxes) alongside massive cases on booster displays. Don't sleep on these preorders, MTG FF is going to fly off the shelves on release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda">MTG Final Fantasy</a> is flying right now, so I've included over 40 of (in my opinion) the most popular Final Fantasy cards collectors and players will be chasing once packs start getting ripped.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/two-more-persona-4-actors-have-said-theyre-not-returning-for-an-unannounced-persona-4-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, we don't know if there's going to be a remake of Persona 4. But if there <em>was</em> such a thing, we know now at least three of the original voice actors aren't coming back for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Yosuke Hanamura voice actor Yuri Lowenthal took to BlueSky to say he would not be reprising his role for "the Persona 4 remake." You know, the one that no one's officially announced yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," said Lowenthal in a since-deleted post. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, two more actors from the original game have spoken up, saying they won't reprise their roles. Two days ago, Erin Fitzgerald, the English voice of Chie Satonaka, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erinfitzgerald.bsky.social/post/3lqbi6257w22d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said she hadn't been asked to come back</a>. And then just yesterday, Amanda Winn Lee chimed in to say she wasn't coming back as Yukiko Amagi:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Since, I've had several people ask me: No, I wasn't asked to voice Yukiko in the P4 remake</p>— Amanda Winn Lee (@amandawinnlee) <a href="https://twitter.com/amandawinnlee/status/1928242559685472293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">All these comments are leading Persona fans to suspect that maybe there <em>is</em> actually a Persona 4 remake coming imminently. There have been rumors to this tune bubbling up over the last year, with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake">recent domain registration</a> fueling hope that its announcement might be coming soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, assuming a Persona 4 remake is real, it's unclear why the beloved actors who originated the voices of these characters haven't been asked back. One possibility is that it's related to the ongoing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-publishers-ai-measures-are-dangerously-incomplete-as-video-game-members-go-on-strike">SAG-AFTRA voice actor strike</a>. Another is that this is simply what developer Atlus does, for cost or other reasons. After all, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-trailer-reveals-party-members-new-english-voices">recast the English voices for Persona 3: Reload, including Lowenthal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some fans have another, zanier theory: that this is all a marketing stunt. As one fan noted on Twitter/X, the voice actors announcing they're not in the remake have made these statements in the exact order you recruit them to your party in Persona 4: Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is definitely a marketing stunt</p><p>First Yosuke<br>Then Chie<br>Now Yukiko</p><p>They're talking in order of who joins the party in p4. They're definitely in P4 remake. <a href="https://t.co/GesYoNva4O" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GesYoNva4O</a></p></div>— Re (@Reismyname2) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reismyname2/status/1928278638480290199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">A few people on social media have taken it further, suggesting that if either Troy Baker or Matt Mercer (both of whom have played Kanji Tatsumi at different times) announces they're not in the remake next, that all but confirms that all four actors actually<em> are</em> in the remake. It sounds nuts, but given that Persona 4 deals with themes of rejection and acceptance of one's true self, it's not totally off-base. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1kyve8t/comment/mv1e5wa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One suggestion</a> is that the original actors will actually be voicing the Shadow versions of their original characters, effectively making their original statements true... if misleading. All that said, most fans seem to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1kyve8t/interesting_theory_surrounding_the_p4g_vas/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find this theory a bit too wild</a>. It's more likely that Atlus simply recast everyone for whatever reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With so much smoke around a Persona 4 remake, hopefully we'll get an official announcement soon that will clear it all up. Perhaps at Summer Game Fest or the Xbox showcase next week?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr"><span>First revealed at </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-new-game-from-the-creators-of-bioshock-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509890/">2022's The Game Awards</a><span>, BioShock writer-director Ken Levine's upcoming narrative-driven RPG, </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/">Judas</a><span>, is still shrouded in mystery. Developed by Levine's new studio, Ghost Story Games, Judas was almost immediately labeled as "BioShock in space" by fans. But as the game's launch draws closer, it's become clear that although Judas certainly draws inspiration from the series that made Levine a household name, it's not just BioShock with a futuristic coat of paint. Judas has its own identity.</span></p><p dir="ltr">While the details are still relatively sparse, trailers, preview events, and developer interviews have painted a much clearer picture of what players can expect from Levine's latest creation. If you're interested in decoding this enigmatic RPG, keep scrolling for a breakdown of everything we know about Judas, from plot details to gameplay features and everything in between.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Judas_launch_">When does Judas launch?</h2><p dir="ltr">Judas was originally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creators-new-game-will-release-by-march-2025/1100-6511235/">slated for a March 2025 launch</a>, but March came and went without a peep from Levine and the developers at Ghost Story Games.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, there is no official release date for Judas. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388860/Judas/" rel="nofollow ">game's Steam page</a> lists its release date as "coming soon." In a recent earnings report, <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9a22a038-45bc-48df-8391-07705b355877" rel="nofollow ">Take-Two listed the game's launch date</a> as "to be announced."</p><h2 id="What_platforms_is_Judas_releasing_on_">What platforms is Judas releasing on?</h2><p dir="ltr">Judas will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><h2 id="What_is_Judas_about_">What is Judas about?</h2><p dir="ltr">The game's description on Steam reads, "A disintegrating starship. A desperate escape plan. You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke--or will you leave it to burn?"</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be stepping into the shoes of the aforementioned troubled protagonist, Judas. Judas is a woman who appears to live and work on a spaceship called The Mayflower. The Mayflower has recently suffered some sort of disaster, one that--based on the game's description--Judas herself is at least partially responsible for. Many areas of the ship have broken off, depressurized, or caught on fire, and the goal is clear: Survive, no matter the cost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504185"></a><figcaption>It seems that most (if not all) of the Mayflower's inhabitants are robotically augmented.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Based on the protagonist's biblical name, it's likely that betrayal is a major theme in the game's narrative, though it's not entirely clear if Judas herself is the betrayer or the one who has been betrayed. Interestingly, the game's trailers feature several shots of injured androids who look identical to humans with the exception of a glowing green circle on the back of their hands.</p><p dir="ltr">"The ship is… dying," a visibly injured Judas declares in the game's announcement trailer. "And my only way out of here is with one of <em>them."</em></p><p dir="ltr">Judas herself may, in fact, be an android, as gameplay footage shows her sporting the glowing green circle on the back of one hand and shooting Plasmid-like powers out of it. It's also possible Judas is actually a human who has been robotically augmented, a la Cyberpunk 2077's protagonist, V. But if that's the case, Judas has been <em>very</em> heavily augmented--another trailer clip shows her finishing off an enemy while floating around outside the damaged Mayflower … without any sort of suit to protect her body from the vacuum of open space.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504186"></a><figcaption>A calendar reveals the year is 1979, while text on the left side of the screen suggests Judas herself may be an AI-controlled robot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Time travel may also be a theme in the game's narrative, as another trailer features a quick jump-cut in which Judas can be seen near a wall calendar indicating that the year is 1979. This could also be an illusion, however, as some of Judas's statements in the trailer suggest that the game takes place in a world where thoughts are recorded by a Big Brother-esque entity, and false memories can be implanted into the station's robotically augmented inhabitants, Westworld-style.</p><p dir="ltr">Other shots in the game's trailers reference "The Big Three," a trio of characters who once controlled The Mayflower. The Big Three is made up of Hope, a young woman with pink hair and a childlike aesthetic; Nefertiti, a woman with strange mechanical abilities and an affinity for fashion; and Tom, a middle-aged man in a cowboy hat. It appears that these three characters are Judas's enemies, and players may have to choose which one Judas escapes the ship with.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm here to set you free," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-judas-trailer-at-state-of-play-shows-off-bioshock-like-combat/1100-6520723/">Judas states in one trailer</a> as she presses a button, ignoring the computer terminal's warnings that doing so will cause a catastrophic failure. "Whether you like it or not."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504183" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504183"></a><figcaption>Prior to the disaster, The Big Three seemed to be quite popular with The Mayflower's inhabitants.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game's trailers indicate it's expected to receive an M rating. According to the ESRB, M-rated games are "generally suitable for ages 17 and up," but "may contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language."</p><h2 id="Judas_gameplay_details">Judas gameplay details</h2><p dir="ltr">While "BioShock in space" is a great elevator pitch, what we've seen from the game so far suggests that Judas is far from a BioShock clone. Yes, it's a narrative-driven first-person shooter RPG from the guy who made BioShock, and thus bears some resemblance to the BioShock series. But Judas also differs from Levine's previous work in many ways.</p><p dir="ltr">One notable difference between Judas and the BioShock series is the fact that Judas is a procedurally generated roguelite.</p><p dir="ltr">"We call it pseudo-procedural because it's not like Minecraft where everything's being generated off a set of pure mathematical heuristics," Levine <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-successor-judas-is-a-procedurally-generated-roguelite/1100-6522180/">explained in an interview</a>. "You build all these smaller piece elements in the game and then you teach the game how to make good levels essentially, and [a] good story, and most importantly, [make it] reactive to what you do."</p><p dir="ltr">The Big Three appear to Judas as holograms, and her relationship with each of them will play a major role in the game's narrative. Doing a favor for one member of The Big Three will increase their affinity for Judas, but is likely to displease at least one of the other two members, and anger comes with consequences. If Judas upsets one member, they may get back at her by ratting her out to another member by revealing her plans or current location. It's clear that Judas' story design--especially when it comes to player choices--goes much deeper than BioShock's <em>very</em> binary "Will you save the Little Sisters, or are you a complete sociopath?" narrative choice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504184"></a><figcaption>Judas can open the strange implant on her left hand to swap out abilities. When the hatch closes, it glows green.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for the game's "roguelite" elements, Levine says that death is an integral part of the game. Items that allow Judas to regain health are scarce, and enemies are everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">"You do have the opportunity when you die to go change yourself," Levine says. "Improve yourself, change your tool chest--which is a pretty broad and variable tool chest--and change the Mayflower itself."</p><p dir="ltr">For more information on Judas's gameplay, check out GameSpot senior producer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/what-exactly-is-judas-spot-on/2300-6463749/">Lucy James' breakdown of the game</a>, which she played for five hours at a preview event in 2024.</p><h2 id="Judas_trailers">Judas trailers</h2><p dir="ltr">Check out all the trailers for Judas below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Judas reveal trailer:</strong></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSrgezyVfF4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSrgezyVfF4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Judas story trailer:</strong></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_r-un--bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Though Judas is far from a BioShock clone, it still proudly bears the hallmarks of Levine's previous work: a dystopian setting, Plasmid-esque powers, and off-the-wall set pieces like a gigantic robotic dog that Judas boards like a Bathysphere.</p><p dir="ltr">What do you think of Judas's gameplay elements and narrative premise?

The engine upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 is part of a number of new changes coming to the shooter over the coming months, including a replay system in September.</p><p><em>Valorant </em>has been running on Unreal Engine 4 since a beta of the game originally released in 2020, and Riot Games has been using Unreal 4 for more than 10 years to build the game. The upgrade to Unreal 5 will arrive with patch 11.02 at the end of July, and Riot is promising it shouldn’t disrupt gameplay.</p><p>The game’s overall look and feel should be similar, and Riot says the engine upgrade will improve framerate performance and make patch downloads faster in the future. It’ll be interesting to see what else this engine upgrade unlocks, particularly whether Riot will improve character models and animations in the future. <em>Valorant </em>players that log in while patch 11.02 is live will get a special gun buddy to commemorate the upgrade.</p><p>The second big upgrade coming to <em>Valorant </em>later this year is the long-requested replay system. It will arrive on PC first with patch 11.06 in September, followed by a release on console later this year. The replay system will let you analyze recently played competitive games at launch, and Riot is looking at adding more modes later.</p><p>The replay system should help players report cheating or bad player behavior in <em>Valorant</em>, and Riot is also adding multi-factor authentication to the game to help with smurfing in the competitive modes — where higher ranked players log into accounts to boost them. You’ll also soon be able to report accounts that are abusing rank or matchmaking.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s upcoming 11.0 patch later this month will also add a new map to the game, and it will be available in the competitive mode on day one. During the initial patch cycle of two weeks, rank rating (RR) losses on this new map will be cut by 50 percent while <em>Valorant </em>players get used to playing this new map.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A third is that <em>MindsEye</em> will feature its own spin on Roblox-style user-generated content, which Benzies hopes will be a big part of the game’s decade-spanning growth plan. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197559,195922" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“[The studio] will support the game through Play.MindsEye, with continuous new content,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told<em> GamesIndustry.biz</em></a></span>, referring to the space where a stream of studio-made add-ons for the game will be hosted, not to be confused with Build.MindsEye, the toolset with which players will make their own new worlds and experiences. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This big interview</a></span> comes less than two weeks out from <em>MindsEye</em>’s June 10 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. “Some of the content, like races, are made just for fun. But [with] most of the content, we’ll try and incorporate it into the story. So once you’ve played the big overarching ten-year plan, you’ll have a very good idea of what this universe looks like.”</p><p><em>MindsEye</em> was originally revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everywhere-mindseye-ex-gta-devs-fortnite-dreams-roblox-1850258651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everywhere-mindseye-ex-gta-devs-fortnite-dreams-roblox-1850258651">as a spin-off to <em>Everywhere</em></a></span>, a mysterious MMO that aimed to be its own open-world metaverse of sorts with multiple biomes and multiplayer modes.

It’s not clear how exactly, and Benzies is cagey about the details in his<em> GamesIndustry.biz </em>interview, but it sounds an awful lot like Roblox-style exploitation is part of the model.</p><p>“We have plans to add multiplayer, [and] we have plans to make a full open world,” he said. “And of course, we’ve also got to look at what players are creating, and incorporate that into our plans. Given the ease of the tools, we think there’s going to be a high percentage of players who will jump in and give it a pop, see how it feels. Hopefully some will create compelling content we can then promote and make that part of our plans to push to other players.”</p><p>I, too, hope “some will create compelling content,” and by “some” I mean the team at Build A Rocket Boy, which is selling a $60 game and a paid premium pass required to access some of the additional post-launch content. Elsewhere in the interview, Benzies talks about the spectrum of crafting in games, saying he hopes the building tools will be somewhere in the middle between <em>Roblox </em>(hard but expansive) and <em>Minecraft</em> (easy but simple). Epic recently announced it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/epic-games-fortnite-based-roblox-killer-still-has-a-way-to-go&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/epic-games-fortnite-based-roblox-killer-still-has-a-way-to-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paid out over $300 million</a></span> to people making stuff in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>“The dream from the building side is to allow players the opportunity to create their own multiplayer open world games with ease,” Benzies told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. “So anyone could pick up the game, jump in, drive around, stop at a point where they see something of interest, build a little mission, jump back in the car, drive again, build another mission. Once you’ve built a couple of hundred of these, you’ve built your own open world game. So, that’s the build side.”</p><p>Those are lofty goals for a brand-new game from a first-time studio. If the underlying game can deliver something solid, maybe there’s a chance, but if not, I don’t think the promise of user-generated content will be enough to bail <em>MindsEye</em> out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Mario sports and racing games bring out the weirdest behaviors from the Mushroom Kingdom's zany characters, and Waluigi is a prime example of this. The animation team for Mario Kart World must have had a field day with Luigi's lanky nemesis, as displayed by video footage of a Mario Kart World demo capturing something that might be easy to miss during gameplay.</p><p>In a video on X posted by user <a href="https://x.com/misterduby/status/1928107524735025376" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mr. Duby</a>, Waluigi gets a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-items/2900-6483/" data-ref-id="2900-6483">Coin Block item</a>, which grants the player coins upon hitting it. But as seen in the video, Waluigi makes the unconventional decision to kick the Coin Block upwards.</p><p>It's a rather impractical, yet impressively flexible move. Say anything you want about Waluigi, but he's anything but boring. Traditionally, Mario and friends hit coin blocks with their fists, but Waluigi seems to want to go out of his way to showcase his impressive limberness.</p><p>And it's not just Waluigi who mines coins from blocks using an unexpected body part -- his buddy <a href="https://x.com/b0ssguy3000/status/1928142301911519454" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario straight up uses his derrière</a> to hit blocks. One has to wonder how Wario and Waluigi would approach the fairly standard action of hitting blocks if they were in a traditional Super Mario platformer.</p><p>Waluigi has always been characterized by quirky and expressive animations in the Mario spin-off games, from his romantic rose pose in Mario Party 8 to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGZaf-eb_yI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his shockingly crude celebration</a> in the Mario Strikers series. He might have missed the cut for Super Smash Bros., but at least the Mario sports games are blessed with his chaotic unpredictability.</p><p>Mario Kart World, poised as the killer app <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch game for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/" data-ref-id="1100-6531712">wild cast that features background characters</a>, like Penguin from Super Mario 64, and limbless enemies that have no business of driving karts, such as Pokey. We'll have to see how they approach the challenge of hitting a coin block, and the internet will surely get a lot of fun GIFs out of those.</p>
