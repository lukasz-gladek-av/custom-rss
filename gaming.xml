            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In front of thousands of fans in Times Square, with most of the sprawling screens displaying his face, Snoop Dogg provided a twist on one of hip-hop’s iconic lines. “It ain’t nothin’ but a gangsta party,” he chanted. “It ain’t nothin’ but a <em>Fortnite </em>gangsta party.”&nbsp;The moment was part of a concert that also featured Ice Spice, all performed live in New York while being broadcast as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285464/fortnite-remix-the-prelude-event-how-to-watch">an in-game event for anyone logged in to the game</a>. The battle royale has had plenty of concerts and events in recent years, but the Snoop collaboration is part of a plan to more deeply integrate music into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24065901/fortnite-metaverse-disney-epic-partnership">the budding metaverse</a>.</p><p>“This is a partnership,” Snoop said during an interview after the show. “Most games just want one song and you don’t even see the artist. So for them to let us be a part of the game, and that community, it’s deep.”</p><p>In the past, <em>Fortnite</em>’s big musical moments have largely been singular virtual concerts from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>. But over the years, music has steadily permeated the game to the point that Snoop’s Times Square performance was just a kickoff point for a monthlong event.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s current season, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">dubbed Chapter 2 Remix</a>, debuted this weekend, rewinding the clock with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole">a version of the battle royale map from several years ago</a>. But there’s a twist — hence the “remix” in the title. Each week, the game will change slightly, themed around a different artist. Snoop is up first. You can enlist him as a companion, visit a heavily guarded Dogg Pound compound, or rock out as his tracks play on the radio as you drive around the island.</p><p>If you boot up <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, the rhythm game developed by <em>Rock Band</em> studio Harmonix, he’s the new headlining act, which means you can buy his songs to play along to, unlock Snoop-themed guitars and drum sets, and buy a crip walk emote that plays “Drop It Like It’s Hot.” Snoop will be followed by Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD, with future updates introducing elements like <a href="https://x.com/andredotuasset/status/1853219859741475322?t=EH9BlSHw3u3Xp4yw0XECiA">a gun that spits Eminem lyrics</a>.</p><p>According to Nate Nanzer, head of global partnerships at <em>Fortnite</em> developer Epic, there have been two key points in the evolution of music in the game that led to this point. The first was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott’s “Astronomical” concert</a>, which showed the scale possible with these kinds of virtual events, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count">an audience topping 12 million</a>. “After we did Travis Scott we had everybody coming to us saying ‘Hey, I want to do that,’” says Nanzer.</p><p>The second was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">the launch of <em>Fortnite Festival</em> last year</a>. Like the battle royale mode, <em>Festival</em> has seasons, each “headlined” by a different artist, which, to date, has included stars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079009/lady-gaga-comes-to-fortnite-tomorrow">Lady Gaga</a>. “If you look at all of the things we did prior, they tended to be more one-off,” says Nanzer. “We’d do an event, and then months or even years would go by before we did something else. What <em>Festival</em> did was give us this venue to be able to celebrate music more regularly.</p><p>For Snoop’s son Cordell Broadus, there was one particular moment that convinced him Snoop should be in <em>Fortnite</em>. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/21/23034095/fortnite-wu-tang-clan-gear">a collaboration with the Wu-Tang Clan</a> featured an in-game glider that would play the chorus to “C.R.E.A.M” as players flew down to the battle royale island. “I kept saying: ‘I gotta put his music in there,’” he explains. “Because every time I play<em> Fortnite</em> that’s what I hear. So a lot of the inspiration came from seeing them doing it, and seeing that <em>Fortnite</em>’s not afraid to really deal with hardcore hip-hop.”</p><p>That feeling grew stronger as the more ambitious virtual concerts continued to make waves. “We’re real competitive,” says Broadus. “So we’re competing with Travis Scott. What he did with <em>Fortnite </em>was huge, and I feel like we topped that tonight. But we’ll let the people decide.” (Snoop was quick to clarify that “I didn’t say that, he said that.”)</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> collaborations that get headlines — and a prime Friday night spot in Times Square — feature huge artists. But part of turning the game into a viable venue for music, according to Nanzer, is integrating it in multiple ways so that all kinds of artists can be featured. In addition to virtual concerts and headlining <em>Festival</em>, there are the emotes, in-game radio stations, and individual tracks you can buy to play in <em>Festival</em>.</p><div><p>Not all of these ideas have worked out. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike">Epic tried to create a virtual tour stop for artists in 2020</a>, going so far as to build out a studio space in Los Angeles, and the effort has largely fizzled out. But as the company continues to try to push <em>Fortnite</em> beyond its battle royale roots, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">games like <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">a concentrated focus on community-made games and experiences</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">a still-mysterious virtual world built with Disney</a>, music is another important tool to make the game more than just another live-service shooter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">an increasingly difficult space to compete in</a>. That’s true at various scales, from Snoop in New York to an indie band getting its first airtime on a <em>Fortnite</em> radio station.</p></div><p>“We want to work with the biggest artists in the world,” says Nanzer, “but we also want to figure out if we can break artists in <em>Fortnite</em>.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Then there are the more nitty gritty details like how magic is getting brought in or what exactly happened in the final scene of season one. Well we have all the info you need to go into season two.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-recommend-id="image://5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="950" data-height="535" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-recommend-id="image://5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="950" data-height="535" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Great question! We have no idea! Season one didn’t really wrap up any of the larger conflicts at play in the world of <em>Arcane</em>. Instead, it left things on the precipice of all out war. To that end, Jinx launched a rocket directly into the chambers of Piltover’s ruling council. That leaves a lot of major players from season one with a big question mark over their heads. Jayce, Mel, and Caitlyn’s mother Cassandra are all within the council at the time. Trailers for season two have kept the fallout of this attack underwraps but Caitlyn appears on the warpath, so it is likely her mom was a casualty of the attack. Whatever the death toll is revealed to be, you can be sure this battle will be the match that lights the powder keg of season two.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central conflict around which all of <em>Arcane </em>revolves is the growing tension between the cities of Piltover and Zaun. The former is a thriving city full of wealth and technology and home to people like Caitlyn and Jayce. The latter is an undercity beneath it that is a relative slum in comparison to the grandeur of Piltover. Due to the constant pollution of Zaun it has become the home of the poor and disenfranchised, which also means crime runs rampant. As a result, Piltover heavily polices the area and has created a major class divide. This is where Vi and Jinx grew up.</p><p>Season one saw these class tensions come to a head in a huge skirmish on the streets of Zaun that ended with the death of de facto leader and crime lord Silco. Season two teasers tell us that the production of the drug Shimmer is still occuring in Zaun, even without Silco, so Caitlyn and a group of Enforcers are coming in to put an end to it all. I’m sure nothing bad will happen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While <em>Arcane </em>is a tale of two cities, it is even more a tale of two sisters. Vi and Powder (who grows up to be Jinx during the events of season one) are the heart of the show. Act one of season one focused on the pair’s upbringing in Zaun, which ended in their separation with Vi thinking Powder was dead and Powder being taken under the wing of Silco. The rest of the season revolved around Vi’s attempt to save her sister (now going by the name Jinx) from the influence of Silco.</p><p>That didn’t end up working out and by season one’s end Vi had come to terms with the idea that Jinx is no longer her sister. Season two positions their final confrontation as the main event, with Vi even admitting her sister is gone and that only Jinx remains. Along with Caitlyn, she’s ready to take down Jinx no matter what. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At the start of season one Caitlyn is shown to be a Piltover citizen whose heart is in the right place, even if she doesn’t understand the realities of the world. As a rookie enforcer she wants to uphold justice and the law, but quickly finds after teaming up with Vi and falling into the city’s larger conflict that no side is without blood on its hands. Vi opens her up to the humanity of Zaun’s inhabitants, while betrayals from crooked enforcers above her show her that maybe this isn’t all black and white. Even after the final skirmish of season one, Caitlyn seems like a person who truly wants to change the relationship between Zaun and Piltover to change for the betterment of both sides.</p><p>Of course if her mom is dead that changes things. Season two already looks to put Caitlyn on the warpath, but grief may be blinding her temporarily. With the council attacked, Caitlyn seems to be something of a leader for the city now, and Jinx has fallen into a similar role in Zaun. Maybe the two will still find a way to overcome the cycles of violence their cities have been stuck in for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mel’s mother played a relatively small part in <em>Arcane </em>season one, but that will likely change in the final season. When she arrived in Piltover, Ambessa quickly showed herself to be a cunning political and military mind who is very interested in guiding the city in a way that benefits her. Specifically she wants in on weaponized Hextech, the technology Jayce invented. With the council potentially out of the way, Ambessa is in a great position to grab control of Piltover, which would only mean bad things for the relationship between it and Zaun.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>League of Legends</em> is full of magic wielders, but <em>Arcane </em>has almost none in its first season. The closest thing we have is a mysterious mage saving Jayce in his youth as well as the understanding that Hextech is essentially using science to harness magical potential. Throughout season one, Viktor’s experiments with Hexteach leaned closer and closer to unlocking the mysteries of the arcane. With the promise that <em>Arcane</em>’s end will open the path for more<em> LoL</em> adaptations in the future, it’s a pretty sure bet that these loose ends will be tied up soon. This show is called <em>Arcane </em>after all.</p><hr><p>The final season of <em>Arcane </em>will air on Netflix in three acts.

<p>There was a lot about Star Wars Outlaws that I thoroughly enjoyed, but its combat wasn’t one of them. I cheesed the system whenever possible, using stealth or outright taking a long route around enemies to avoid combat. It felt awkward, clunky, and barebones. Apparently, that will all change with Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4, which aims to improve the game’s feel and approach, specifically combat, and embrace player-choice-driven gameplay, allowing you to tackle encounters and missions more freely. It’s a welcome change that we hope will entice returning players.</p>



<p>This reveal stems from a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent official blog post</a> by the Star Wars Outlaws team, which also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-full-release-star-wars-outlaws-get-new-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner</a>, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty. For now, let’s focus on the gameplay enhancements coming in title update 1.4, namely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.</em></p>



<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long—Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4 launches alongside the game on Steam on <strong>November 21</strong>.</p>

<p>The popular video game, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, which was released back in 2019, just had images leaked online of it being tested on PSN (PlayStation Network). Since its release, the game has been a staple within the PC and Xbox community but has never seen the light of day on a PlayStation console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-being-tested-on-psn">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition Being Tested on PSN</h2>



<p>The original Age of Empires II was first released back in 1999. For its 20th anniversary, the game got the Definitive Edition just back in 2019. Xbox and PC gamers were lucky enough to indulge in this classic, but it was never brought over to PlayStation. In fact, no Age of Empires game has ever been released on a PlayStation console.</p>



<p>However, leaked images online show that PSN subscribers could soon be getting the title brought over to their respective consoles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak first surfaced when Reddit user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/draconis90/">u/draconis90</a>, posted the image above on Reddit, which shows two players playing the game on PlayStation. </p>



<p>However, the user also states that this could just be a graphics bug.</p>



<p>Still, not too long ago, Tom Warren, a Senior Editor at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, leaked that the game could be getting a PlayStation release in the early months of 2025. Still, no known information has been released since except for the leaked image above.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-this-all-mean">What Does This All Mean?</h2>



<p>So, what does all of this mean? Will Age of Empires fans finally be getting a title on PlayStation? Or is it simply just a bug that appeared? </p>



<p>While many are speculating on whether or not this image is real, there have been zero other gamers to emerge and claim they have seen the same glitch happen in their game.</p>



<p>Tell us your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>I wasn’t among the countless who positively despised Star Wars Outlaws upon its release. Sure, it wasn’t the best open-world game, but it certainly wasn’t the worst. It was missing something, and apparently, Ubisoft feels the same, as its latest blog post for the game announces not only Title Update 1.4 but also the fact that Star Wars Outlaws has a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official blog post</a> on the Star Wars Outlaws site, Ubisoft said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Outlaws,</em></p>



<p><em>I’m very excited to be stepping into the role of Creative Director on Star Wars Outlaws and to be working with the incredibly passionate team here at Massive Entertainment along with our talented co-development studios around the world and Lucasfilm Games. I would like to personally thank you, our community, for your positive response to the game. We see and love all the fan arts, comments, and videos you’ve created around the game, and it continues to provide joy and inspiration to the team. We truly hope you’re enjoying your journey across the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix thus far.</em></p>



<p><em>I also want to take the time to say that we hear not only your positive feedback, but your constructive feedback as well. Thank you for sharing with us and helping us make the game even better. Today, I want to share with you the next priority areas we are looking to address to ensure that Star Wars Outlaws is the best experience possible for you.</em></p>



<p><em>From before launch and continuing into post-launch, we have been gathering data from and listening to you. This takes place not only formally through our analytics, user tests, reviews and media feedback, our Star Wars Outlaws Bug Reporter, crash reports, and other mechanisms, but also informally when we see your YouTube videos and Reddit, Discord or other social media posts. We deeply care about your experience with the game, and use all the data and feedback possible to see the friction points you are encountering, what you’re enjoying, and where we can further improve certain elements that matter the most to you.</em></p>



<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.</em></p>



<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>



<p><em>To our players, thank you again for your support and feedback, and we hope you will enjoy continuing exploring the galaxy with us. And if you’re new to the game, there’s never been a better time to experience the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix!</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’re unsure what’s coming in the next Star Wars Outlaws update. According to the post, the community has highly requested fixes and features, and there are likely plenty of quality-of-life tweaks, but there’s no telling just yet. The team promises to share more about Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.4 on social media later, but it’s scheduled to hit on November 21st, so we expect to hear more soon!</p>

<p>By now, you’ve undoubtedly heard about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-says-star-wars-outlaws-performance-contributed-to-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did you know Star Wars Outlaws’ performance directly contributed to Ubisoft’s decision</a>? It’s true, and Insider Gaming reported on the matter recently!</p>

Although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>players quickly took to this year’s Call of Duty</u></a> when its release date arrived a few weeks back, many have made it clear that there are more than a few kinks left to deal with. Today’s update is one of the beefiest yet, as it tackles common issues and more while promising to provide even more specific fixes in the future.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/wccfcallofdutyblackops63-1724866203623.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Update Address Flashbang and Spawn Complaints</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One tool that players of every skill level can’t seem to stand is the flashbang, which has been called out for the lengthy affect it has on players’ screens. On smaller maps like Nuketown, of which there are a few of in Black Ops 6, the flashbang leaves Operators unable to see their screen for long portions of each match. Post update, players will notice that the duration of the effect has been reduced by 20%. Whether it calms complaints remains to be seen, but it’s clear Treyarch is at least listening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other common talking points the team sought to address with today’s patch include the spawn system and Recon Combat Specialty. The former is often a point of contention in any Call of Duty entry, so it should be nice to hear that spawn logic has been tuned across “several” Multiplayer maps in Black Ops 6.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Spawn tuning will be an ongoing process of taking in data, reviewing gameplay and making measured adjustments in the live environment," a developer note says. "Our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recon, meanwhile, has left many concerned thanks to its ability to allow players to see through walls for a short time after respawning. The Perk combination bonus has now had its duration reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5, with Treyarch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>promising to reduce it even further</u></a> ahead of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the highlights for those looking for a less frustrating Multiplayer experience, but a number of weapon balance adjustments found their way into the November 4 Black Ops 6 update, too. Assault rifles like the XM4 and Model L received nerfs to their long-range damage, while more than a few SMGs had their range buffed. Most of the new Black Ops 6 patch focuses on tweaking Multiplayer, but Zombies players will notice that GobbleGum names should now properly update when players switch between tier tabs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s update follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-1-patch-fixes-troublesome-black-screen-glitch-and-other-issues"><u>a November 1 patch</u></a> that squashed a number of bugs and exploits across the Multiplayer and Zombies modes. Although today’s fix fleshes out the experience even more, the team will surely polish the FPS further in the coming days and weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched October 25 and will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-nuketown-this-week-as-activision-reveals-season-1-plans"><u>begin its first season of content on November 14</u></a>.

We gave Multiplayer an 8/10, saying, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 plays it safe but is otherwise exactly what Call of Duty multiplayer should be: fast, fun, and a little on the ridiculous side.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything else revealed in today’s patch, you can see the list of all the changes below.

Stardew Valley developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone paused all work on his next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, to focus on getting Stardew Valley's final major update out on all platforms, and months later, the 1.6.9 update is now available for all players.</p><p>The 1.6.9 update includes a number of useful features, like the ability to put legendary-tier fish in ponds and a couple of new ways for players to to rescue items they've accidentally lost. The update also includes bug fixes, balance tweaks, and new gameplay features.</p><p>As far as the new stuff goes, the Stardew Valley 1.6.9 update adds the following features to the game:</p><ul><li>If you lose an item that can’t be found again, check the Secret Woods for a new NPC who can get it back... for a price. </li><li>Players can now put legendary fish in fish ponds. Only one fish can fit in each pond. Ponds with legendary fish will produce legendary fish roe. Each legendary fish turns the pond's water a different color.</li><li>Players can now place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture.</li><li>Items dropped in water will now float for a brief time, so players can collect them if they're quick (or if they have a magnet ring).</li><li>Sam and Shane's work portraits will now appear inside JojaMartas long as they're working there.</li><li>Some dialogue has been slightly tweaked.</li><li>New Easter eggs have been added to the game.</li><li>Hidden cheat commands have been added (on platforms where a save edit is possible).</li></ul><p>Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-dev-finally-finishes-playing-the-game-says-1-6-update-is-coming-to-console-next-week/1100-6527481/" data-ref-id="1100-6527481">confirmed the update's release date</a> in a post on the Stardew Valley forums back in September. The 1.6.9 update contains content than the original 1.6 update lacked, including quality-of-life changes like pine trees providing extra lumber, weeds no longer preventing fruit trees from growing, and the addition of new items to certain in-game shops.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that the update <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853506548250869801" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">isn't yet working for PlayStation users in Europe</a>. Additionally, it seems to have caused a bug resulting in <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">disappearing chickens</a> for new players using the Meadowlands farm. Barone acknowledged both issues on Twitter, and confirmed that he's currently working to fix them.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look at the full 1.6.9 patch notes, or check them out via <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official website</a>.</p><h2>Stardew Valley 1.6.9 patch notes</h2><h3>New content &amp; features</h3><ul><li>If you lost an item that can’t be found again, a <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods#Lost_Items_Shop" rel="nofollow ">new friend appears in the secret woods</a> who can get it back (for a price).</li><li>You can now put legendary fish in fish ponds.

                <p dir="ltr">A new update arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on November 4, and the patch notes include several major changes. This includes nerfs to the overpowered flashbangs and the Recon Combat Speciality bonus. The game's snaking movement has also been reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the patch notes, Treyarch says there's been "enough snaking," and the movement is now nerfed. Snaking is an exploit where a player rapidly switches between the prone and crouch positions while stationed behind a cover, making themselves harder to hit. However, that movement will be slower and less impactful with the update adjusting the stance-change cooldowns to reduce effectiveness of repeated snaking motion.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also adjusts the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/controversial-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-x-ray-vision-perk-is-in-treyarch-crosshairs/1100-6527561/">frustrating Recon Combat Speciality</a> bonus, which previously gave players too much information. Now, the Recon bonus will only provide users with limited-time wall hacks for 1.5 seconds instead of 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update has nerfed the game's powerful flashbangs, reducing the equipment's screen effect duration by 20%. The update only changes how powerful flashbangs are, but it doesn't mention the current XP exploit that lets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xp-farming-trick-turns-you-into-a-terrible-teammate/1100-6527534/">players toss flashbangs for extra points</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A few weapons received tuning with the new update. This includes slight nerfs to damage and the range of popular assault rifles, such as the XM4, Ames 85, and Model L. All weapons in the submachine class were buffed with higher damage ranges, which Treyarch says is meant to make the guns more effective during mid-range fights.</p><p dir="ltr">The popular Nuketown map was added to the game in a 24/7 playlist on November 1, but now the new update makes the map available to play in private matches.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes can be found below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov4" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/">Call of Duty Season 1</a> arrives on November 14.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the first-ever dev update released by the Star Wars Outlaws team, they decided to use it to bring in these dev updates to provide insights from the developers while they continue adding new content to Star Wars Outlaws to improve the game further. The first major announcement made in this dev update was that Drew Rechner is now the Creative Director for Star Wars Outlaws. On the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft website</a>, he wrote a big announcement, talking about the team's plans to fix up Star Wars Outlaws and what they can do to continue to improve it.</p>
<p>"Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we've focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns, such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-update-1-3-improves-stealth-and-enemy-ai/">particularly around stealth</a>, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game even further," says Rachner.</p>
<p>They plan to continue to improve the combat, where they want to add "more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision." They also want to focus more on the stealth aspect of the game, something that has been highly controversial for those who have been getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws. Since the beginning, the stealth has been a huge issue for gamers, as it started off with the stealth missions being too challenging, with players getting caught immediately. Since then, they have worked to update the stealth mechanic and try to make it a smoother experience for those playing Star Wars Outlaws. They are now continuing to improve it by working on the readability and consistency of enemy detection.</p>
<p>Their third key area of focus is working on the character controls to make finding cover and utilizing it more reliable, as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. While these are just three key areas they're planning on focusing on, they have said that there will be more added in the next Title Update 1.4, which will be released on November 21. Along with this update, Star Wars Outlaws will finally be on Steam, as well as the first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</p>
<p>It's said by both Rachner and the team that the Title Update 1.4 will be the "biggest update yet," so players can only hope that this update doesn't break things further and actually improves the experience of this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">controversial title</a>.</p>

In the last few weeks, Nia Jax and WWE World Champion Liv Morgan have been trading insults on the mic and Money In The Bank briefcase shots in the ring, trying to get fans to care about their Crown Jewel match the WWE has been promoting as history-making. Did it make history? Technically, yes. Did fans really care? Hardly.</p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Jax retaining the 10th spot on our rankings list is a clear indication that her matches have walked the tightrope between terrible and exciting, often taking a bump somewhere in between. Jax looked dominant throughout her Crown Jewel fight, at one point crushing Morgan with a Samoan Drop from the second rope that’ll make any spectator instinctively grab their chest. However, some of the moves looked sluggish and relied too much on her raw power as opposed to any in-ring finesse. Jax was pinned after Liv Morgan’s walking insurance policy Raquel Rodriguez caused an interference by hitting Nia in the head while the ref was distracted by Dominick “Dirty Dom” Mysterio, which ultimately allowed Morgan to hit her Oblivion finishing move. Decent effort by Jax in this contest; nonetheless, things need to progress for her if the WWE Women’s Champion looks to remain on our list.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c727ba149f80452ecf120ae45c42066b" data-recommend-id="image://c727ba149f80452ecf120ae45c42066b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3903" data-height="2602" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bianca Belair and Chelsea Green in action during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Belair and Cargill were in a multi-story feud with former champions Chelsea Green and Piper Niven, Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane, both of who were also former tag champions, and main roster newcomers, Jakara Jackson and Lash Legend. They have been booked and busy, and the television matches and angles in the previous weeks were compelling enough to convince some fanatical onlookers that Belair and Cargill could actually lose the titles. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Belair never disappoints when she’s given an opportunity, and this was no different. She clearly was the “ring general” in the Fatal Four Way match against Meta-Four, Chelsea Green &amp; Piper Niven, and Damage CTRL where chaos, top rope assaults, and suplex surprises reigned supreme. She’s a star that often shines brighter than her competition, thanks to her unique blend of agility, speed, strength, and irresistible style. Cargill and Belair used the Road Warriors’ legendary “Doomsday Device” finisher on Niven to retain their titles in a fun match that will likely continue the story, with Jackson and Legend being Cargill and Belair’s next opponents. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-recommend-id="image://0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="3980" data-height="2653" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-recommend-id="image://0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="3980" data-height="2653" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 5</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Sikoa has been the focal point of major WWE storylines for the last seven months. In just the last three months, he’s been involved in two title changes. After his own older brother Jey Uso came to Smackdown and got in his face, “The Street Champion” invaded Monday Night Raw to cost his brother the Intercontinental Championship. His Bloodline stablemates Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa then lost the WWE Tag Team titles to TNA Wrestling mainstays the Motor City Machine Guns, due to interference from the “OG Bloodline.” Some may have grown tired of the Bloodline story, but for me, things are starting to heat up again, and Sikoa is a major reason why. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Sikoa continues to be solid in the ring. His offense is believable enough to dazzle, and he continued to show that growth in the OG Bloodline vs New Bloodline standoff. Sikoa sells Reigns’s Superman punch spectacularly. While his cousin started the match off hot, it didn’t take long for the new tribal chief to assert his will. Personally, I much prefer Sikoa’s version of a “Uranage” that he calls the “Spinning Solo” over his Samoan Spike, but I respect him wanting to honor the memory of the late, great wrestling legend Umaga. The spike is also what allowed the leader of the Bloodline to vanquish Reigns and later declare himself the true Original Tribal Chief, undoubtedly setting up more drama we can’t wait to watch.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="84549931b34dd6934805daf0910cc35e" data-recommend-id="image://84549931b34dd6934805daf0910cc35e" data-format="jpg" data-width="4078" data-height="2719" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Women's Championship to Liv Morgan during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

More recently, it has been the Women’s World Champion trying to escape from the Australian-born superstar, often hiding behind Raquel Rodriguez. Due to the WWE’s prioritizing Crown Jewel’s ascension to one of the company’s tentpole annual events, WWE was tasked with advancing the Ripley-Morgan feud, while also promoting Morgan’s Crown Jewel match with Nia Jax to determine the first-ever Crown Jewel Women’s Champion. Ripley got a legitimate eye injury in the build-up to this match, causing a halt in original plans. There is still interest in Morgan vs Ripley; however, they should wrap this story up as soon as Ripley is healthy. As for the Crown Jewel match, the lead-up was underwhelming, and the match mirrored it. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance:</strong> Morgan has figured out how to be an underdog while also ensuring it’s believable when she picks up a win. At first glance, this is a heel vs heel match, with all parties involved technically being bad guys. However, the crowd response to Morgan made her a babyface—the hero, in wrestling terms—by default. I truly enjoy Morgan’s work in the ring, but she could benefit from either having a different finisher or a second one Oblivion. That doesn’t discredit her work or her huge win against Jax.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="197ec76fc86d82b5c1e92743952e249f" data-recommend-id="image://197ec76fc86d82b5c1e92743952e249f" data-format="jpg" data-width="4149" data-height="2766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bronson Reed and Seth Rollins in action during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

A few months ago, Reed put Seth Rollins on the shelf. Once “The Architect” returned, his goal was to destroy Reed. The giant performer has looked dominant over a number of wrestlers the last few weeks, and he aimed to end Seth for good. Most weeks, they were brawling all over the arena, with the week going into their Crown Jewel match showing us Reed couldn’t be stopped </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>For someone of Reed’s size, the 330-pound behemoth<strong> </strong>can accomplish some truly incredible feats. He takes bumps well, and he’s also good at selling. Reed knows how to wrestle “big man style,” but he’s not unbeatable. He worked really well with Rollins at Crown Jewel, even taking a nasty “Curb Stomp” on steel steps. That ultimately was the cause for the loss, but even in defeat, Reed rose up to show Rollins he’s here to stay. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-recommend-id="image://3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-format="jpg" data-width="4132" data-height="2755" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-recommend-id="image://3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-format="jpg" data-width="4132" data-height="2755" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 3</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> In a somewhat predictable turn of events, Reigns found himself needing help. After his cousin Jimmy Uso made his return at Bad Blood, the OG Bloodline found themselves outnumbered by the New Bloodline. As a result, Reigns and Uso were being decimated week after week on Smackdown. Eventually, Jimmy was able to convince his brother Jey Uso to settle his previous issues with Reigns and help them out. The Bloodline story remains one of the most layered and intriguing stories the WWE has to offer. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Roman Reigns losing to Sikoa by pinfall may be shocking to us all, but was certainly the right decision. This was another match where Reigns, being the intelligent man that he is, let his teammates work most of the match and made the tag when it mattered the most. The multi-time Wrestlemania headliner did not do much from a “wrestling” performance perspective; however, Reigns commanded the attention of not only the fans but his opponents. </p><p>Once the former champion did get his hands on Sikoa, the crowd erupted. At one point, the New Tribal Chief hit the Original Tribal Chief with the Samoan Spike, and Reigns did not kick out. Either Jimmy was late breaking it up, or Reigns forgot. Nevertheless, the bad guys walked away winners. The post-match saw The New Bloodline beating down the OG Bloodline when Sami Zayn attempted to make the save for the good guys. The match was fine, but it’s really the story that maintains its position on this ranking. Things are heating up leading into next month’s Survivor Series, and Reigns is performing near his peak.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-recommend-id="image://9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-format="jpg" data-width="3977" data-height="2651" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-recommend-id="image://9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-format="jpg" data-width="3977" data-height="2651" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A.</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>After a much-needed break from the action, “The Visionary” was back to regain some momentum. Rollins took a break from focusing on future opponent CM Punk to forge a battle with a superstar on the rise, Bronson Reed. Week after week, the two were separated after brawling throughout every building they were in. Rollins remains top-level with his promos alone. With the first-ever NXT champion laid out on the go-home edition of Monday Night Raw, we all anticipated watching Rollins attempt to overcome the monster. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>You’d be hard-pressed to find a bad Seth Rollins match<strong>. </strong>There’s a reason the grand slam champion is always a main attraction. From the very start of the match, Rollins and Reed had the audience in their sweaty, grappling palms. At first, it appeared Reed was going over on Rollins after a “Tsunami” from Bronson in the first few minutes of the match. However, that wasn’t the case, and Rollins was able to hit a “Curb Stomp” for an implacable false finish. After a back-and-forth exhibition, Rollins found a way to win with a super “Curb Stop,” adding to his collection of top-tier performances. Although this feud with Reed hasn’t concluded, I wouldn’t object to Rollins moving on to his story with the aforementioned CM Punk.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-recommend-id="image://414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5221" data-height="3481" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-recommend-id="image://414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5221" data-height="3481" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A. </p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Knight hasn’t been featured as much as many are clamoring for, but he’s still “MAXimized” his minutes on television. The United States Champion found himself in the middle of the issues between his two Crown Jewel opponents, Andrade and Carmelo Hayes. Hayes and Andrade competed in a series of matches that were due to culminate in a Game 7-style match at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center to determine a number one contender for Knight’s title. The U.S. Champion was the special guest referee and ensured there was no decisive winner, therefore sealing his fate. Good build-up to this triple-threat match. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Based on entrance and crowd reaction alone, LA Knight was most certainly over with the live crowd. Andrade and Hayes had some creative high spots in the match, whereas Knight focused more on the ground and pound. The champion did show some athleticism when both his challengers were on the turnbuckles; he leaped up and superplexed Andrade off the top. The finish of the match was equally as clever: Knight caught Hayes while he was holding Andrade and hit the “Blunt Force Trauma,” effectively knocking them both out. Impressive showing from all three wrestlers.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8e0cf1dfe8e1d68ff25a6d22e2bba909" data-recommend-id="image://8e0cf1dfe8e1d68ff25a6d22e2bba909" data-format="jpg" data-width="3833" data-height="2555" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="GUNTHER returns with a submission hold on Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

With Cody Rhodes having another story occurring simultaneously, Gunther was reduced to just cutting promos. The two champions did fight on a Smackdown live event in Brooklyn. But, other than that, it’s been relatively lax for Gunther.</p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>When I think of an old-school heel WWE Champion, Gunther is the perfect personification. This match between the two world champions was technically sound and hard-hitting. Gunther laid in all of his offensive moves, and Rhodes took it. Despite the loss, Gunther wasn’t hurt by this at all. Cody needed this win more in order to cement his title run. In what some may see as an uncharacteristic move, Gunther shook hands with Rhodes and gave him the Crown Jewel ring. Where does this leave the self-proclaimed “ring general?” Well, we’re just going to have to wait and see. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-recommend-id="image://8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="5808" data-height="3872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-recommend-id="image://8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="5808" data-height="3872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 4</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>In the build to Crown Jewel, Rhodes has been trying to get his lick back from Kevin Owens. Following the Bad Blood event in Atlanta, the prizefighter attacked Cody in the parking lot. Rhodes has been seeking revenge ever since the altercation. Mutual friend Randy Orton has been trying to end this problem between Owens and Rhodes. That only angered Owens, leading him to believe the third-generation superstar was picking sides. Rhodes dealing with the RKO drama, while handling his issues with World Champion Gunther, gave viewers more than enough entertainment to continue supporting the WWE Champion. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>The highly acclaimed WWE Champion was slated to make history. In a match that would crown the first-ever Crown Jewel champion, Rhodes and Gunther went out and had a standard WWE main event title match. At times, it felt more physiologically based than a knock-down, all-out blood feud, which it was not. There was nothing bad about the match. It did start off slow, but that’s expected of two wrestlers without an actual story leading into the match. Rhodes showed his resilience by reversing Gunther’s sleeper and getting the pinfall on the man who has ruled over Raw. Nothing outstanding throughout the match, just a solid effort. The significance of the results lies solely upon Rhodes winning another championship for the first time.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I won’t sit here and tell you that I’m a totally stoic horror fan. I don’t miss the big ones, but I’m still a total wuss and trudge through the latest shockingly horrific games at night, which is the only time I get to play anything these days. As we all know, playing horror games in the dark is, like, ten times worse. But when you add more action into the experience, well, I’m all for that. Slitterhead promises action combined with horror, and I’m here for it. But how are the Slitterhead reviews panning out before release? Let’s take a look!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-slitterhead">What is Slitterhead?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, for those who stumbled upon this upcoming horror game, or Insider Gaming in general, let’s go over the nitty-gritty of Slitterhead. It’s certainly a unique name and immediately evokes images of horrific scenery and, in my eyes, body horror. Well, that’s apt, considering the game is primarily about body horror with brain-devouring parasite-like creatures that hunt and consume humans. But you, you’re unique. You’re a Hyoki, which means you can possess humans, too, but for good. You’ll use various blood-based abilities and possessed forms to defeat Slitterheads in all shapes and sizes as they wreak havoc on the city of Kowlong.</p>



<p>Slitterhead is out <span>on <strong>November 8</strong> on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</span>!</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-play-the-horror-game-a-look-at-early-critic-reviews-of-slitterhead">Should You Play the Horror Game? A Look at Early Critic Reviews of Slitterhead</h2>



<p>Now, before you whip out your wallet, especially considering Slitterhead stems from one of the deranged minds behind the original Silent Hill, let’s take a look at a few early critic reviews of the horror game:</p>



<p><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/slitterhead-review-wonderfully-bizarre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingBolt</a>:</p>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;say this as a compliment-&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>is one of the weirdest games I’ve played this entire console generation, and definitely the weirdest game I’ve played this year. Coming from Bokeh Game Studio – a new indie team formed by Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill, Siren,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gravity Rush&nbsp;</em>– it has certain expectations to live up to, but rather than being a slave to those expectations, it carves out a unique identity for itself. It’s not without its issues, and it certainly isn’t a game that I’d recommend to anyone without any caveats- but if you&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>look past its issues, there’s a very different and interesting gaming experience on offer here.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/slitterhead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s horrific, but the crux of Slitterhead is its moment-to-moment action. You’re not a helpless dad stumbling through the snowy town of&nbsp;Silent Hill&nbsp;with a lead pipe in hand, but a small militia of civilians armed with razor-sharp clubs conjured up from their own blood. It’s an incredibly ambitious game that reminds me of a time when this industry was far bolder.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slitterhead-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is something of a honeymoon phase to Slitterhead’s early moments, as you admire Kowlown’s murkiness and the general grossness of the yoghurt monsters. Sadly, this haze also quickly starts to dissipate, replaced by a thick fog of jank. Like its namesake enemies bursting forth from an unfortunate meat puppet, Slitterhead eventually reveals its true nature, and reader, it isn’t good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/slitterhead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Part sci-fi body horror, part thrilling detective yarn, Slitterhead is a story of humanity versus monstrosity in a city where both are plentiful. Bokeh’s debut release bravely takes strides to manipulate, challenge, and evolve how we play horror games, and while some of these risks do not pay off as well as others, Slitterhead’s sheer creative ambition is impossible to ignore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/slitterhead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PushSquare</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s quite a lot going on here, and sometimes the information is buried in tutorial menus. But it makes for a unique combat system unlike anything else you’ve ever played. One character can drop a blood vortex onto the stage, for example, sucking foes in; you can then switch to an unimportant human, prime them for detonation, run into the middle of aforementioned maelstrom, and possess a different body before they explode.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/slitterhead-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Slitterhead won’t be for everyone due to its quirks, it’s a bit clunky and reuses content frequently. But behind its issues lies one of the most unique titles of the past few years. With a great mystery story, impressive world-building for a debut, and a possession mechanic that adds an extra strategic layer to combat. Slitterhead lives up to its pedigree.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has detailed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' "biggest update yet" ahead of its arrival later this month, sharing the news in its first developer blog since former creative director Julian Gerighty's departure to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quietly-confirms-its-working-on-the-division-3">focus on The Division brand</a>, including The Division 3.
</p>
<p>
Gerighty confirmed he'd soon be handing over the Star Wars Outlaws reigns in an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/star-wars-outlaws-massive-entertainment-interview-creative-director-julian-gerighty-and-game-director-mathias-karlson-exclusive/">interview with GamesRadar</a> last month, explaining, "It's been announced that I'm executive producer on The Division, so these are my last weeks [on Outlaws]". And now, new creative director Drew Rechner has provided a look ahead at Star Wars Outlaws' future.
</p>
<p>
Rechner highlighted "three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game" in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive">new developer post</a>, starting with combat, where he sees a "real opportunity to add more depth and excitement... further rewarding your tactics and precision." Stealth, meanwhile, will see improvements to "readability and consistency of enemy detection" while also "providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter."

<p>
Developer Massive Entertainment's final focus is character controls, with the studio looking to improve "the reliability of cover... the responsiveness of climbing and crouching [and] the consistency of the controls overall." All this is set to be addressed in Star Wars Outlaws' Title Update 1.4 release on 21st November, and Rechner says specific details on the planned changes will be shared in the "upcoming weeks" .
</p><p>
21st November is also the day Star Wars Outlaws comes to Steam (Ubisoft will, of course, be bringing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">all its new titles to Valve's platform on launch day</a> starting February next year), and the same day the game's first story expansion, Wild Card, releases.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws' 1.4 update marks the latest in a series of patches designed to "polish and improve the player experience" following Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">admission earlier this year</a> that sales had been "softer than expected". At the time, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said the development team was "fully mobilised" to update the game "in order to engage a large audience during the holiday season [and] position [the game] as a strong long-term performer".

<p>Black Ops 6 has been on the market for more than a week, and players are busying themselves contending with everything from SBMM to the annual camo grind. It’s being mostly well received by the community, but there are a few niggling issues that are being steadily addressed by Treyarch and Co.</p>



<p>The latest Black Ops 6 patch has applied a few tweaks that will help to fix some of these issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-early-changes">Early Changes</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 might only be a week old, but it’s already being adjusted left, right, and centre by Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>The most recent update has made it tougher for users to <strong>snake</strong>, which is where they adjust their stance rapidly to ‘bob up and down’ in a way that makes them hard to hit. Typically, they’ll do that behind cover, and for anyone trying to engage them, it becomes near impossible to land consecutive shots.</p>



<p>Treyarch has also adjusted flashbangs, reducing the amount of time you remain flashed by up to 20%, which is a huge win. Being ‘spam-flashed’ has become a common occurrence on smaller maps like Nuketown, especially with users running Tactical Expert.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the team has tweaked the effective damage range of SMGs to make them tougher at longer distances. Conversely, they’ve reduced the range of ARs and made their headshots less effective at close range, which… Doesn’t make much sense.</p>



<p>They’ve also adjusted spawn logic on several maps and added Nuketown to private matches, which means you can now hunt for easter eggs in earnest. Shotgun slugs have been nerfed, and Recon has been dramatically tuned down to be much less effective, which eradicates many of the ‘wallhack’ comments.</p>



<p>For those concerned about the XP earn rates during this Double XP weekend, Treyarch has adjusted Player XP and Weapon XP earn rates between various modes. </p>



<p>Basically, nothing was done to change Zombies because it’s already kind of perfect.</p>

This adds all previous 1.6 content to PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, alongside some new stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been holding out for the 1.6 release on console and mobile, we've got plenty of Stardew Valley 1.6 guides to help you through the new content, such as an explainer on the new Mastery Points system and new crops like Carrots and Broccoli.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Essential Stardew Valley 1.6 Guides</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, you'll find IGN guides that we recommend checking out to aid you in your farming adventure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mastery Points</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/stardew-valley-1-6-mastery-points-1730744017673.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mastery Points system is a new feature that rewards those who have leveled all five Stardew Valley skills (Fishing, Farming, Combat, Foraging, and Mining) to level 10. Now, when you use a maxed-out skill, you'll gain EXP in the new Mastery Gauge. Once the Mastery Gauge is full, you'll get a Mastery Point that can be spent at Mastery Cave in Cindersap Forest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information on Mastery Points and the rewards you can spend them on, head to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Mastery_Points">our Mastery Points guide</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Raccoon Family Quests</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/stardew-valley-1-6-raccoon-quests-1730744095325.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Stardew Valley 1.6, you'll receive an announcement randomly telling you that a strong windstorm occurred overnight and if you head to Cindersap Forest, you'll find that there's now a giant treestump where a tree was. Once you repair the stump, a raccoon will be standing by it the next day, and he'll have a quest for you. This is actually a chain of quests known as the Raccoon Family Quests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you complete the quests, the raccoon's family will grow. You can accept a new quest from him every seven in-game days, and you'll get rewards for doing so, as well as new Shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Raccoon_Family_Quests">our Raccoon Family Quests guide</a> for walkthroughs on all the quests, as well as checkmarks to track your exact progress! </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Golden Joja Parrot</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/stardew-valley-1-6-golden-joja-parrot-1730744197074.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Struggling to track down all 130 Golden Walnuts on Ginger Island?

It's a pricy service, but if you can afford it, it's very useful. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, we would recommend NOT spending 10,000g (sorry, birdy!) and instead using <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/All_Golden_Walnuts">our All Golden Walnuts guide</a> to track down the 130 Golden Walnuts scattered around Ginger Island.

The associate director on last year’s <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora </em>is taking the reigns over from <em>The Division 2</em>'s Julian Gerighty,</p><p>Alongside existing title updates that have already gone out focused on improving certain mission mechanics and various bugs, the new director outlined three areas for future updates: stealth, combat, and responsiveness. Here’s how he described what that means:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.﻿</p></blockquote><p>While <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is scheduled to get a third major title update on November 21 when the game comes to Steam and gets its first story pack DLC, the new job title and talk about “more depth and excitement” certainly make it sound like Ubisoft is working on even more improvements over the long haul. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931">The game has a lot of flaws but also a lot to offer</a></span>, even if its sales were so bad, the publisher decided to delay<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>by four months. </p><p>Time will tell if these final polish passes and quality-of-life adjustments are enough to turn <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>from a good game to a great one or if some of the problems ultimately run deeper than that.  </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2's</a> iconic E3 2003 demo, much of which did not appear in the final game when it launched a year later, will finally be playable next week via a Steam Workshop mod for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> on PC, just in time for Halo 2's 20th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod will be available for free and will release November 9, the same day Halo 2 released in 2004. In the demo, Master Chief rides in a Pelican to the Earth city of New Mombasa, where he meets up with embattled UNSC Marines and battles his way through the city streets. After boarding and hijacking an enemy Ghost (a new gameplay feature added in Halo 2), Chief escapes from a pursuing Phantom dropship, only to find himself surrounded by Covenant drop pods filled with Energy Sword-wielding Elites. As he pulls out a plasma grenade, Cortana tells Chief "Bet you can't stick it," to which Chief replies, "You're on" before throwing himself at the Elites as the screen fades to white. All the while Martin O'Donnell's instantly recognizable score plays.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqZcZk1wOuk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BqZcZk1wOuk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It made a powerful impression back in the day. In an Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/04/20-years-of-halo-2-new-maps-e3-demo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Halo community director Brian Jarrard, who previously worked at Halo 2 developer Bungie, said the stakes and energy going into E3 2003 were off the charts.</p><p dir="ltr">"The response to the demo at E3 was electric, and nearly every Halo fan remembers that demo and where they were when they were first blinded by its majesty," Jarrard said. "Best of all, none of us ever would have expected that 20 plus years later, a group of passionate community modders would bring this demo to life as a full-fledged mission."</p><p dir="ltr">But making the demo fully playable wasn't easy. As noted in the blog, the original demo was built on a version of the Halo engine that no longer exists and isn't compatible with other versions of Halo 2. Halo senior franchise writer Kenneth Peters said the original build of the demo required an original Xbox developer kit to boot, something "in increasingly short supply even within the studio."</p><p dir="ltr">The work to bring the demo back to life was previously announced in a Halo Waypoint <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/cutting-room-floor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a> from 2022, where first details on how developer 343 Industries (now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">rebranded to Halo Studios</a>) and a group of community modders referred to as the Digsite team were working on restoring old cut content from Halo and Halo 2, including the E3 2003 demo. At the time, 343 made no promises the demo would ever become fully playable.</p><p dir="ltr">One Digsite member said some aspects of the demo were just smoke and mirrors, with the team having to make some aspects of the demo "real" by using assets from the shipped version of Halo 2. The demo, Peters said, was never made to be played off-script without breaking. That presented a unique challenge, including having to make sense of "barely documented" code "originally written under an insane time crunch" 20 years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">"This was NOT a trivial process, and we should probably layer on a whole page of caveats that come with taking a demo map for an engine that no longer exists and getting it to not blow up the current lightmapper (among other issues that come from letting people go into areas that were never intended to be seen)."</p><p dir="ltr">The Halo 2 E3 2003 demo isn't the only way Halo Studios is celebrating Halo 2's 20th anniversary. A special Halo 2 playlist in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a>, featuring Halo 2 maps remade in Forge and gameplay changes made to mimic the 2004 shooter, will go live November 5.</p>

" This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players."</p><p>Verdu, a founding member of Netflix Games, continued and touted the technology as ushering in a defining time for gamers and said he hadn't felt this excited since the 1990s. "It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months.”</p><p>Buzzwords aside, it's interesting for Verdu to dive into games given that Team Blue, a Netflix-owned gaming studio, closed up shop just last month. The result was the laying off of 35 people, whose past credits include big-name, big-budget franchises like Halo, God of War, and Call of Duty. Verdu explains that was all part of the plan.</p><p>"Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games," he added. "What you've seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition."</p><p>Verdu mentioned no plans or goals were in place since he took the position over the weekend, but insists that he's focused on a "creator-first" vision. While Team Blue has closed its doors, Netflix still owns Night School, Next Games, Spry Fox, and Boss Fight Entertainment, with over 80 games across its library with huge titles on the horizon like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a>. </p>

To be clear, I’ve seen both variations before writing this ranking, and still would probably put him at the bottom of this list. Lucanis is a web of fascinating contradictions. On the surface, he seems like a character ripe for tiresome edgy nonsense with his brooding demeanor, magic crow wings that he uses to fly around and strike his targets from above, and the fact that the demon embodiment of Spite lives within him. But he’s also kind of a golden retriever.</p><p>Lucanis drinks more coffee than any writer you’ve met, just to stay awake and maintain control of his body, cooks for the team and remembers all their favorite foods, and he is protective of those he cares about. His story is a <em>Game of Thrones</em>-esque political drama with family ties and blood magic in the mix, and unfortunately, it can feel a bit truncated on certain playthroughs. Still, Lucanis’ inner struggle with his literal and figurative demons shines through.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-recommend-id="image://2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-recommend-id="image://2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The lone qunari on the team is an interesting one. Taash joins The Veilguard initially to help the team fight the dragons they’ll face when fighting the elven gods. Though their foes are the size of buildings, their biggest fight is the one they deal with internally as they navigate the intersection of gender and culture. Taash is standing between two worlds: the Qunari one they were born in, and the Rivain one they have grown into. They feel pulled in different directions, whether that be in the way they dress, the food they eat, or the gender they identify as.</p><p>Though Taash can initially come off as bullheaded and deadpan, it’s clear they are an introspective, thoughtful person who wants to be themself, but also seeks the approval of those who have cared for them. Finding yourself when you have so many forces telling you who you’re supposed to be is a pretty universal concept, but watching <em>The Veilguard</em> wrestle with these ideas within its own world remains one of the series’ strengths, and Taash is one of the most endearing and entertaining examples under its belt.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-recommend-id="image://a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-recommend-id="image://a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At first, Bellara felt primed to slip through the cracks for me. The elven mage, introduced as an expert on ancient elf technology and magic, seems scatterbrained if she’s not fixated on one of her interests. But as her story unfolds, it becomes clear that Bellara’s preoccupation with elven artifacts, lost history, and hobbies like fiction writing are all born out of a need to distract herself from her grief, and possibly make up for her failures.</p><p>When you meet her, Bellara has been hunting for a way to make the world make sense again, only for the elven gods she had known her whole life to return, and everything she knew is repeatedly flipped on its head. What does someone who seeks to restore history do when it’s constantly changing? What decisions do you make when the answers you’ve found can hurt those who have already gone through so much? Bellara is the kind of character a story like <em>The Veilguard </em>needs: as the world changes, she’s the most well-equipped to understand its significance and ponder the effects it will have on everyone when the dust settles. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-recommend-id="image://3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-recommend-id="image://3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Veilguard</em>’s Grey Warden companion is a man-and-a-half. Davrin is a monster hunter who carves each of the beasts he faces into wooden statues from logs he cuts himself. He’s also a great bird-cat father to Assan, one of the last griffons who was once thought extinct in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe. How could I not fall for the lumberjack bird-cat dad who is doomed by the narrative because he’s part of a faction that will one day go underground to die when they start to go mad from the darkspawn taint inside him?</p><p>But I digress. Davrin is one of the best examples <em>The Veilguard </em>has of a character whose very personal story has long standing ramifications for the world of <em>Dragon Age</em>. As a Warden, Davrin knows his time is relatively limited, and feels a great deal of responsibility to protect those around him. He wants to ensure that he leaves the world better than he found it. The revelations he finds in his quest fundamentally shift how the Wardens will be viewed in the annals of history, but he doesn’t lose sight of the good those still living under the banner can do. All of this is delivered with a heartfelt story of a man and his bird-cat son learning to love and live with each other. Davrin’s story has some of the greatest range in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it’s all elevated by the dashing man in the center (I’m sorry, I’m gonna thirst for my video game boyfriends). </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-recommend-id="image://9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-recommend-id="image://9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Lace Harding could have easily been a throwaway party member in <em>The Veilguard</em>. The dwarven rogue started as a supporting character in 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and that’s a long time for fans to project an idealized vision of the mostly jovial scout in their minds. But Harding is so much more complex in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and a lot of it has to do with its willingness to examine the cracks in the happy-go-lucky attitude she’s been known for.</p><p>Harding becomes a centerpiece for some of the biggest reveals in dwarven lore <em>Dragon Age </em>has ever dropped, and as she uncovers truths about her people, her anger for what the dwarves have lost becomes central to her world. Things are changing for everyone in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it often feels like Harding has no one to relate to as she carries heavy dwarven baggage on her back. Rage for what she and her people have lost doesn’t have to consume her, as justified as it might be. But one way or another, someone who once played the support role for the Inquisition becomes a pillar for the dwarven people to build upon. It’s inspiring to see.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-recommend-id="image://acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-recommend-id="image://acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every friend group needs a silly guy. Emmrich, a necromancer with a skeleton assistant named Manfred, fills that role. Though raising the dead sounds like dirty, scary work (and not everyone on the team is thrilled by the notion), this mage is an eccentric, kind hearted, and often goofy old man who is a joy to be around. Though death and grief are universal concepts that could be part of any universe, Emmrich spends much of his time studying and celebrating death as a cultural concept within Thedas.</p><p>Some of the most memorable scenes in <em>The Veilguard </em>are the quiet moments when he regales you with stories about his fascination with death, how we face it, and how he maintains respect for those who are gone as he brings them back. But what does a person who deals in life and death feel about his own oncoming end? What do they think when the death in question is no longer something abstract and related to people they’ve never known? Emmrich explores those ideas in his work, but once <em>The Veilguard</em> makes him confront his relationship with death, he is catapulted to one of the most memorable mages we’ve ever met in Thedas. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-recommend-id="image://961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-recommend-id="image://961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like Lucanis, your opinion on Neve might vary depending on whether you help her save her home of Minrathous in the early hours of <em>The Veilguard</em>. But in both routes, there’s something compelling about watching the mage detective in her element. Neve knows the name of a lot of the people you meet on the streets of Minrathous. Even as the elven gods are blighting cities and some of the biggest revelations of the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe are raining down upon Rook and their team, Neve doesn’t lose sight of the people on the ground who will still be struggling if and when the Veilguard accomplishes their mission to stop the gods. The question is whether she wants to fight for them from the shadows, or become a beacon of hope to pave a new path in the city.</p><p>Neve is perhaps the most concise example of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s broader thesis. Where often the series shaves down conflict and progress into factions and choices nudged by the player, <em>The Veilguard </em>feels like the series finally believes in something, rather than just showing you a nuanced ideological battle and letting you choose which one deserves to be wiped from the face of Thedas.</p><p>Neve believes that the world can be better, and is willing to do whatever it takes to find that path forward. Oppression and the structures that allow it are not choices or debates in her mind; she is here to fight for the people of Minrathous, it’s just a matter of how. This world is changing, and there are people who will be written in the history books as those who charted the course. Neve may choose to omit herself from the official stories if she can, but she won’t sit idly by while those who benefit from the way things have always been try to direct how things will be.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition was supported with no less than eight DLC packs but you will not be getting a single one for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The news was confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone who say Bioware have now moved all their staff on to working on the next Mass Effect game.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/06/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-single-player/">previously known as Dragon Age 4 and then as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> – is the long-awaited return of one of BioWare’s most popular RPG series. The game is currently sitting at ratings of 70 for the PC version, 84 for the PS5 version, and 93 for the Xbox version over on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Metacritic,</a> our review is still in progress.</p>


<p>The next Mass Effect title was teased back on N7 Day, 7th November 2022, when Bioware said “Pre-production development has been proceeding very well. The team, comprised of Mass Effect franchise veterans as well as some amazing new additions to BioWare™, has grown steadily! They’ve been hard at work crafting new characters and locations that you’ll love, as well as revisiting many that you’ll remember.”</p>
<p>The game is set to follow on the from the original trilogy and will be a single player game.&nbsp; In the interview with Rolling Stone veteran Bioware creative director John Epler notes that while he likes multiplayer games, they are very hard to make.</p>
<p>“It’s possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game.<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV </em>does an excellent job,” he said. “Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world, and the world changes.” For games like <em>Dragon Age</em>, the consequences of a player’s choice are intended to impact the narrative moving forward, but for a multiplayer game, it isn’t quite as simple. For example, one player could choose to save a certain person from their fate while another could do the opposite.”</p>


<p>“It’s funny, because the games I play the most on my personal time are actually multiplayer games,” he says. “But when it comes to crafting these worlds and crafting the experiences, I love the focus that single-player can give you.”</p>
<p>With N7 day just round the corner, maybe we will get an update then.</p>
