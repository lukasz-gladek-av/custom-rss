                <p>While getting review-bombed likely felt terrible at the time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has apparently reached the point where it can laugh about the situation. After a long wait, it has finally sent all players a free in-game cape to commemorate the time when the community turned <em>hard</em> against the otherwise very popular game.</p><p>In what might be a first, the cape literally depicts a frequency graph of postive vs. negative reviews during the review-bombing campaign. If you squint at the image in the embed below, you can see that there are small light blue bars at the top of the cape; these are the bars for positive reviews, which are clearly and massively outweighed by the red bars representing the negative reviews. While it was announced <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801636341362393548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">over a year ago</a>, the cape is finally out and available for free for all Helldivers 2 players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1938573095230390728" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">COMMEMORATIVE CAPE ISSUED<br>In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the Helldivers have been awarded a commemorative cape.

In essence, not long after the game launched in early 2024, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">attempted to require that PC players create or link a PlayStation Network account</a> to keep playing. As the PC gaming culture tends to look unfavorably on efforts to mandate new accounts or launchers, players were outraged and eventually managed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">to convince Sony and Arrowhead to reverse course</a>.</p><p>This decision caused an intense, albeit short-lived, downturn in Helldivers 2's otherwise stellar reviews, driven by coordinated review-bombing. Following the reversal, players banded together to try to do a review-boosting campaign, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's recent Steam reviews have fully recovered</a>. But the outrage and temporary cratering of the game's reputation seem to have left a strong impression on the developer.</p><p>Arrowhead has had to work hard to build back toward the heady heights of its early days, though. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-sees-players-returning-in-droves/1100-6531700/" data-ref-id="1100-6531700">Recent content updates have been received quite well</a>, with peak concurrent players reaching close to 200,000 last month. Having <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hit a low point back in April</a>, Helldivers 2 has been reinvigorated by the Heart of Democracy update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dinosaurs captivate all ages. The creatures that dominated Earth ages ago, populating our world for 165 million years, will always be fascinating. And, on screen, as part of movie history, dinosaurs have always been a go-to genre for incredible spectacle and chilling thrills - whether you're into t-rexes, pterodactyls, raptors, or gentle giant brontosauruses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dinosaur movies transport us back in time to the era of these wondrous reptiles, while other instances show dinosaurs living among us, either on a secluded island lost to history or as cloned beings brought back by science for our amusement (and dismemberment). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Jurassic Park/World franchise has raked in over $6 billion in box office bucks over the past 30 years, proving that these glorious beasts can bring home the bacon. But which dinosaur films are the best?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are our picks of the 10 best dinosaur movies, from trampled theme parks to warring prehistoric titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Looking for more movies featuring giant lizards?</strong> </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dragon-movies">The best dragon movies</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/godzilla-movies-in-order">Godzilla movies in order</a></li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Dinosaur Movies</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Jurassic Park (1993)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/nllhr4ja4wstlcbfb2bbwu-1681955831135.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Um, duh. Yup, not only is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park">Spielberg's Jurassic Park</a> one of the best "dinosaur movies ever," it easily doubles as one of the "best movies ever." Adapted from Michael Crichton's novel (and <em>second</em> story about a futuristic amusement park gone lethally haywire), Jurassic Park is endlessly entertaining and infinitely quotable, providing equal parts laughter and horror. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum star in this tyrannosaurus-sized tale about scientists evaluating a - er - unique family attraction before it opens to the public. Hold onto your butts, because this appraisal winds up with a body count.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">See our guide on how to watch the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-park-movies-in-order">Jurassic Park movies in order</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Jurassic World (2015)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/chris-pratt-bryce-dallas-howard-jurassic-world-1681955850181.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More than 20 years after the original Jurassic Park (which wound up becoming a trilogy), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park-iv">Jurassic World</a> kicked off a new segment of the franchise, with greedy corporations and opportunistic scientists learning nothing from previous tragedies and opening "Jurassic World" to patrons everywhere. Naturally, things go horribly awry and carnage ensues and Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard anchor a budding dino-apocalypse. The films would eventually bring back the original three stars but the first World installment stands tall as a formulaic but fun feast for the senses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Land Before Time (1988)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/we-1681955967848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, this Don Bluth animated classic blossomed into a decades-spanning franchise featuring 13 sequels, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-land-before-time">several video games</a>, and a TV series. The story of a young orphaned dinosaur named Littlefoot, who embarks on a great journey to find a paradise called the Great Valley, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-land-before-time">The Land Before Time</a> is a beautifully animated '80s staple. The saga teaches kids about the importance of friendship, the dangers of prejudice, and the power of hope. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dinosaur (2000)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/s-1681956084110.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Buena Vista Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/dinosaur">Disney's Dinosaur</a>, the company's 39th animated feature, finds a lot in common with The Land Before Time as it also follows a young orphaned dino, this time on a trek to discover to the idyllic Nesting Grounds after a meteor shower devastates their island. A mix of live-action, many of the backgrounds were filmed on location while the dinos themselves were computer-generated, making it the most expensive computer-animated film at the time. Voiced by D.B. Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, and Hayden Panettiere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Good Dinosaur (2015)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/nycu8byhvifswllfwdyd-1681956104324.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Walt Disney Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it's technically the first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ranking-pixar-movies">Pixar film</a> to not quite meet profitable expectations, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-good-dinosaur">The Good Dinosaur</a> is wacky, charming family entertainment, supplemented by the voices of Sam Elliott, Anna Paquin, Jeffrey Wright, and three-time Oscar-winner Frances McDormand. Like most animated dino films, the story involves a thrilling, meaningful journey, though this time it's within an alternate history where reptilian dinosaurs never went extinct. In The Good Dinosaur, a shy Apatosaurus, Arlo, meets an unlikely human friend while traveling through a dangerous and mysterious landscape in order to return home.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>King Kong (1933)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/movie-king-kong-1933-wallpaper-preview-1681956195912.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: RKO Radio Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most King Kong films are good for a ravenous dino or two, so why not revisit the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/king-kong-1933">1933 original</a> and watch humans discover Skull Island, home of not only Kong but prehistoric life of all kinds: including the Tyrannosaurus-rex, the Stegosaurus, the Pteranodon, and more. King Kong is a classic, famous for being a true spectacle at the time with game-changing special effects, from stop-motion pioneer Willis O'Brien. Kong is still thriving today, as part of Legendary's MonsterVerse, with the latest entry, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire">Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</a>, worth checking out too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Kong: Skull Island (2017)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/21/ymvm3eiygs303nvwjl0n-1682103563791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">King Kong's MonsterVerse reboot began with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/kong-skull-island">Kong: Skull Island</a>, a rollicking Vietnam War-era adventure starring Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Goodman as a part of a mix of scientists, soldiers, and scholars trapped on Kong's dreaded isle of terrifying creatures. In a twist though, the island's usual dinosaurs have been beaten and eaten by new giant monsters, unique to the film and the MonsterVerse itself. And it totally works. Separating itself from the Jurassic Park/World franchise, Kong: Skull Island gave viewers a fresh batch of nightmare fuel to fawn over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>One Million Years BC (1966)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/one-million-archelon-1681956482588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner-Pathé Distributors</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This '60s British fantasy-adventure, from Hammer Films, starred Raquel Welch as a cavewoman struggling to survive in a fictional past where humans and dinosaurs coexisted. A remake of a film from 1940, One Million Years BC is a largely enjoyable, kitschy featuring dinosaurs (and giant sea-turtles) roaming a scortched Earth, brought to life by stop-motion genius, and Willis H. O'Brien apprentice, Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans).</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Valley Of Gwangi (1969)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/ew-1681956529069.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner Bros.-Seven Arts</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Harryhausen home run was cult dino-Western, The Valley Of Gwangi, as the stop-motion pro took over the project from mentor Willis O'Brien after O'Brien passed away before production. The story itself was conceived by O'Brien and combined cowboys and dinosaurs as a rodeo horse is revealed to be a fifty million-year-old, prompting members of a Wild West show to venture into Mexico's Forbidden Valley in search of fame and untold wealth. There, however, they confront prehistoric monsters, including "Gwangi," a giant dinosaur that decimates their ranks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Land of the Lost (2009)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/90-1681956714215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Ferrell and Danny McBride turn a 1970s Sid and Marty Krofft TV series (which itself got a short-lived '90s revival) into a comedic romp in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/land-of-the-lost">Land of the Lost</a>, where a mysterious vortex sucks a disgraced scientist (Ferrell), his assistant (Anna Friel), and a survivalist Will (McBride) into a world populated by marauding dinosaurs and fantastically bizarre creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's it for our pick of the best dinosaur movies of all time.

The rumors and speculation have grown so large that Halo Studios has directly addressed them in a new blog post. </p><p>On June 30, Halo Studios Esports Lead Tahir “Tashi” Hasandjekic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a blog post</a></span> about the <em>Halo </em>World Championship happening in October and how people can buy tickets for the event. But the blog post also addressed all the speculation about <em>Halo</em>. </p><p>“Over the past few weeks, there’s been a fair amount of speculation about when and where more details might emerge about any of the multiple projects Halo Studios is actively working on,” said Tashi. “We don’t usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for <em>Halo </em>fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year’s event.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611?_gl=1*ot29lu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTEzMTQ0NzAkbzE2MSRnMCR0MTc1MTMxNDY0NCRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611?_gl=1*ot29lu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTEzMTQ0NzAkbzE2MSRnMCR0MTc1MTMxNDY0NCRqNTckbDAkaDA.">Tashi explained that last October</a></span>, during <em>Halo </em>WC, the studio unveiled “A New Dawn,” a short video revealing the news that 343 was becoming Halo Studios and shifting to Unreal Engine. He further explained that “A New Dawn” was “just the beginning” and that at this year’s <em>Halo </em>WC, the team “look(s) forward to continuing the conversation.”</p><p>“Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won’t want to miss this year’s<em> Halo </em>World Championship,” said Tashi. “We really hope you’ll join us in Seattle this October!”</p><p>So <em>Halo </em>might be coming to PS5. There might be a remake of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> happening. There might be more to share beyond that. But we have to wait until October to find out. Ironically Tashi’s post, meant to address speculation, will likely lead to even <em>more </em>speculation<em> </em>and rumors appearing online. October can’t come soon enough. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384]]></content:encoded>

Now, a fan has released a new Oblivion Remastered mod that gives players a Glock they use to shoot up Cyrodiil's creatures. You can see it in action in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9CRpe6UlEE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b9CRpe6UlEE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A user going by CosmicBoogaloo posted the Oblivion Remastered Glock mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4681" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, and humorously added, "Mehrunes Dagon owes me some money and I'm gonna get it one way or another."</p><p>CosmicBoogaloo went on to explain that the mod was created by making changes to the game's archery system to mold the shape of the weapon. But it took a second mod--Dicene's <a href="https://github.com/dicene/OblivionMods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SlickArchery</a>--to reproduce the rapid fire of a gun. From there, bullets were swapped in for arrows, gun sound effects were added, and there's even a holster for the gun.</p><p>To use the Glock mod, players will have to download a few additional mods including <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UE4SS for ObRem</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UE4SS TesSyncMapInjector</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1331" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Runtime EditorIDs</a>. CosmicBoogaloo also recommends adding <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NL_Tag Remover</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3098" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Auto-Hide Gear</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dicene/OblivionMods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Returning Arrows</a> for a smoother experience. For the future, CosmicBoogaloo notes that "more NPC gun replacements are planned," which presumably means they'll be packing heat as well.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-first-update-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes/1100-6532121/" data-ref-id="1100-6532121">first update for Oblivion Remastered</a> arrived earlier this month, and fixed a number of issues with the game. So far, Oblivion Remastered is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">the third-highest-selling game in the US</a> of 2025, with only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> ahead of it as the No. 1 and No. 2 games, respectively. The response to Oblivion Remastered has been so positive that even Skyrim Grandma, aka Shirley Curry, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-grandma-ends-streaming-retirement-to-play-oblivion-remastered/1100-6531994/" data-ref-id="1100-6531994">came out of her streaming retirement</a> to play the game.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Studios co-founder Dan Houser is branching out into the world of books this fall.

Houser is best known for his work as head writer and creative director on the Grand Theft Auto and Red Redemption franchises. Houser's debut novel is an expanded adaptation of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-from-former-gta-boss-will-be-introduced-via-an-upcoming-audio-series/1100-6523557/" data-ref-id="1100-6523557">2024 audio fiction series</a> produced by Absurdist Ventures, the company he founded in 2021 after leaving Rockstar the year prior.</p><div title="[Various] Dan Houser - A Better Paradise Novel" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3791" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Dan Houser - A Better Paradise Novel" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath\/dp\/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Dan Houser - A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath\/dp\/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$29 for Hardcover | Releases October 14</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Simon &amp; Schuster, one of the Big Four publishing houses, will distribute the physical edition of A Better Paradise. With Amazon's preorder price guarantee, you will be eligible for any discounts offered between the time you order and when the book ships.</p><p>A Better Paradise takes place in the near future and revolves around Daisy's Ark, an advanced video game world developed by tech startup Tyburn Industria. Conceived by visionary psychologist Mark Tyburn, Daisy's Ark was eventually canceled following a pattern of "unexpected and disturbing results." A decade later, the project is unearthed and development resumes.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, the book is adapted from the narrative audio series of the same name. The series debuted last June and ran for 12 episodes. Each episode features an ensemble cast of performers, including The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln, Shamier Anderson, and Paterson Joseph. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/A-Better-Paradise/dp/B0D487TCVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listen to the audio series for free</a> on podcast services.</p><p>The novel version of A Better Paradise expands the narrative by providing more background on the early days of Tyburn Industria's video game project and the people who made it.</p><p>As the title suggests, this is the first novel in a series by Houser. It's unclear how many volumes are planned, but we do know A Better Paradise will eventually be home to a real video game. The first game set in A Better Paradise's universe is in development at Absurd Ventures.</p><hr><h3>Novels about video games and game studios:</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4523489" data-ratio="0.50909090909091" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4523489"></a><figcaption>Novels about video games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png"></figure><p>If you're interested in reading more fiction centered around games and the people who make them, check out the list of novels below.

                <p>We finally know what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a> looks like. On the heels of several extensive written overviews of the game's changes and additions, EA Sports has published a first look at CFB 26's gameplay.</p><p>In a new 17-minute video, EA gives an overview of some of the core mechanics updates that are coming to CFB 26. Among the highlights is a discussion of dynamic substitution, which allows you to substitute players on the fly, providing more flexibility in between plays and reducing the need to go into main menus. On defense, you can also now adjust safety alignments right before the snap, providing the ability to temporarily change to more of a "prevent" defense (to take away deep passes) or play more aggressively, closer to the line of scrimmage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua9AZ66C1tQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ua9AZ66C1tQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>EA also provides more depth about how it is overhauling quarterback play from last year's game. The developer is emphasizing more realism and accuracy in how it represents different throwing motions; as many quarterbacks have quite distinctive mechanics in the real world, EA explains that enhancing the accuracy was crucial in improving the game's presentation. Additionally, quarterback height is now taken into account; shorter quarterbacks will need to more carefully throw through lanes, while taller quarterbacks can more safely throw over the top of linemen.</p><p>Players who enjoy taking control of defense backs and playing in pass protection will notice some changes, as well. EA explains that there are refinements coming to the hit-stick options and animations for when defensive players are contesting catches in mid-air. In addition, defensive players will get worn down and lose effectiveness when they fail to successfully execute a hit-stick pass breakup.</p><p>There's a lot more detail contained in the video, which you can check out in the embed above. In addition to these gameplay mechanics, EA is also significantly expanding features related to school spirit and traditions. More schools will have their unique run-outs and band formations featured, there'll be a larger roster of mascots, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cfb-26-adds-the-internets-favorite-mascot-the-pop-tart/1100-6532658/" data-ref-id="1100-6532658">the Pop-Tart Bowl's edible mascot will even be included</a>.</p><p>CFB 26's release date is rapidly approaching; it comes out on July 10, but people who preorder special editions of the game can get access three days early. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorder-bonus-ps5-xbox-series-x-releases-july-10/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">Check out our preorder guide</a> for all the info on the different versions you can buy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>, Sloclap's new football game, is already a huge hit for the independent French developer, with more than 1 million copies sold and over 3 million unique players jumping in to try the game days after it launched.</p>
<p>Part of its success comes down to how accessible it is, whether you're a football veteran or a newcomer to the pitch. With no fouls, offsides, or practically any of the regular rules of football that exist in professional play, it's easy for anyone to pick up the game and start running the ball to the net.</p>
<p>If you are a newcomer though, you might want a few tips to help you score a goal or two so you can secure the win before the game's clock winds down.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through five beginner-focused tips that will help lead you to the winner's circle practically every time.</p>
<h2>Rematch - A Beginner's Guide To Winning</h2>
<h3>Pass the ball.</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Realistically, based on how I see the Rematch community playing when I jump into a game, whether it's a ranked match or not, this whole guide could just be the words 'pass the ball' repeated again and again.</p>
<p>It's become <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lhwe8s/please_just_pass_the_damn_ball/">a meme within the game's community</a> that players try to rainbow kick around every opposing player, and are seemingly shocked when it doesn't work out two or three times in a row, leading to a scoring chance for the other team.</p>
<p>Passing is a fundamental element of team sports, football being absolutely no exception to that fact. Even in an arcade version of the game, where the ball bounces off a holographic wall and lightning bolts shoot out of your feet when you hit that 'extra-effort' button to run a little faster, passing is still paramount to how you play the game.</p>
<p>Passing can help you move the ball forward by sending the ball towards your teammate who is open ahead of you on the pitch. It can give you a wide-open net to shoot at by forcing the keeper out of position. It can help you maintain possession and control the pace of the game by passing to a teammate behind you.</p>
<p>You can do more with your teammates than without them. Pulling off a solo-effort where you make the other team look foolish and cap it off with an acrobatic goal via rainbow flick or other means can make for a nice clip, but you'll be unsuccessful more often than not. And it'll never look as smooth as a great passing play where multiple players touch the ball before it hits the mesh.</p>
<p>If you're not able to see where your teammates are because of where your camera is pointing, try to glance at the mini-map in the bottom corner of your screen to get a sense of where they could be. Hogging the ball is more likely to lead to a turnover, with the opposing team heading the other way. At least if you try to pass, even if it misses, you'll have an opportunity to keep possession and direct the flow of the game.</p>
<h3>Crank your FOV to the max</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>A simple way to give yourself a better chance at winning on the pitch is being able to see more of the game. Adjusting your FOV slider to the max does just that. Sloclap's commitment to its focused, third-person gameplay means you won't be able to see the whole pitch, but if your running up the side and have your camera angled slightly in front of you, you'll be able to see the majority of half the field.</p>
<h3>Use the boards (walls)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Part of Rematch's arcade elements is the fact that the whole pitch is encased in invisible holographic walls. These are there partly for show, since you can unlock customization features for them, but they're also a key element of gameplay.</p>
<p>'Use the boards' is a mantra I heard time and again growing up playing hockey, and now that there's a version of football that has walls that serve the same function, it's just as viable here. There's even an achievement for passing it off the wall to a teammate to get a goal.</p>
<p>That's the obvious way to use the walls for offense, but don't forget them when playing defense as well. If you're chasing the ball into the corner on your side, launching it high and off the wall towards the opposing teams side can take the pressure off and give you a chance to recover if you're trying to wind down the clock or just put an end to heavy offensive pressure that's gone on too long.</p>
<h3>Manage your stamina for offense and defense</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>As much as Rematch is an arcade football game, it's not so arcade-y that you can sprint for infinity across the pitch. You have a stamina meter you have to watch, and just holding down the sprint button will leave you out of breath and unable to help your team, no matter the situation.</p>
<p>That's why it's important to watch your stamina and to use your 'extra-effort' sprint as tactically as you can. For example, you'd be smart to use your extra-effort sprint after moving the ball up the field to your teammate, in order to be ready in a scoring position for a potential cross or rebound.</p>
<p>Likewise, you'd also be smart to use the extra-effort sprint if there's suddenly no one on defense and the ball is quickly turned over and going the other way. In either scenario, you're better off using it when you <strong>don't have the ball</strong>. When you do have the ball, activating that extra-effort sprint will cause you to lose control as you kick the ball ahead of you. If you don't press the A/X button to dribble the ball, you run the risk of accidentally running past the ball and losing possession.</p>
<p>Use your regular sprint when you have the ball and want to maintain control. If you want to give some space between yourself and an opposing player, you can use your extra effort to kick the ball ahead of you, to set up a pass or a shot with your next touch.</p>
<p>You also don't have to use your slide tackle at every turn, and not using it constantly will help keep your positioning and keep your stamina bar full for when you need to use it in more desperate situations. Holding the left trigger on your controller to be in defensive mode, and just tapping the B/O button will help you keep your positioning and prepare you to stop a player from trying to just rainbow kick the ball over your head.</p>
<h3>Practice</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Lastly, the best thing to do to help you win as many matches as possible is to just practice. The prologue and the practice section of the menu have drills that can help you master different skills in the game, and while those can be helpful, it's also important to take some time in the free play mode you get into from the main menu, to run around the pitch and work on your skills.</p>
<p>Work on your dives as a goalie by firing the ball above the net against the wall and diving towards it. Do the same outside of the keeper's box to practice the timing of your touches and corralling the ball as it comes towards you. It's not ideal that you have to essentially make up your own drills to practice scenarios you'd face in a game, but that's the state of play for the moment. For now, we can only hope that Sloclap will add a better practice mode and better drills in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p>Following these five tips and guidelines in Rematch will help you win nearly every game in Rematch. It's not a guarantee, of course, but after all, it's football, not rocket science. Passing, playing good defense, and making good use of your environment will lead to strong scoring chances and the chance for you to boot the ball into the back of the net for a goal. See you on the pitch!</p>

In fact, it should be a priority to stick one onto the console’s screen as soon as possible to avoid accidental scratches. </p><p>I’ve been installing and removing Switch 2 screen protectors to test others on my console at an alarming rate, more than any sane person should, and here are the most important takeaways:</p><div><ul><li><span>Do not buy a flimsy plastic screen protector. They won’t protect your Switch 2 enough.</span></li><li><span>It’s impossible to tell different brands’ protectors apart once they’re on your screen; product packaging and the installation process are the biggest differences (as well as the key factors that increase cost).</span></li><li><span>Some protectors are glossy and some are anti-reflective, each with its own tradeoffs. For my money, glossy is the way to go. The matte finish looks good, but it reduces the screen’s vivid quality and its viewing angles.</span></li></ul></div><p>Of the options below, it’s easiest to recommend <strong>amFilm’s three-pack of glossy screen protectors</strong>. Not only is the pack incredibly affordable ($7.19 from <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Installation-Transparent-Accessories-Anti-Scratch-SWTCH2-7-9/dp/B0DS73N83B/ref=sr_1_1?crid=231EBG3UY5Q1Y&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JMr6OSZhN-me8fKx8Im9R7U5j4AtUW8FmAj8fOrmMVp_kd7IaANV23xirhpm-Nu3u-IW9iIW7MNKWLynDfeCvTM2LeTAqiwbCro0UMaMS5CO4mvnbSCGtxMxuaMqvAZXGtL2vxQlcWcs5Fkgaa1I2ZKVRowy8OLW-Wax7noSoOMqPYLkUO3_7nsVKhEqEfF6M9s17fsV_zGG7C56ySqBsYVn15FHF4z6XBZwn9q2mf4ZfMiNLS2t3-hVQAqp9kyDNUcMHg7duxH_HIS8GqbcYDIlf69VsTAA2fMFoFGokFQ.yZ4lHneAbW6omJP3ynK2hf1RHRN3D5G-yXRBUxDOPHg&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=amfilm%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1751290880&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=amfilm%2Bswitch%2B2%2Celectronics%2C78&amp;sr=1-1&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> at the time of publication), but the tray also allows for perfect alignment of the glass protector for easy, bubble-free installation. I’ve used this company’s screen protectors on various gadgets for years, and I particularly like its glossy option over the matte finish, since it lets the Switch 2’s screen fully shine through.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption>Here’s what the Switch 2 looks like with a glossy screen protector.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><div><h2>What I’m looking for in a Switch 2 screen protector</h2><section><p>The only way to test a screen protector is to go through the installation process for each option.

I don’t put those particular claims to the test because I’m using my personal Switch 2, paid for with my money. Also, all models included feature an oleophobic coating to resist oils from fingerprints.</p></section><section><p>I’m ensuring that, during installation, screen protectors fit the entirety of the Switch 2’s screen, including its bezel.

Three glossy tempered glass sheets come in the box, and the tools make installation fairly simple. <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZS0lty">JSAUX’s model</a> is just as good based on my testing, and just as affordable.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>In keeping up with some brands that offer faster installations, amFilm offers a two-pack of glossy protectors that includes a “OneTouch” tray.

It includes two protectors, and the installation process is nearly identical: just align the plastic frame with the console, pull the tab, and run your finger across the exposed section of the frame. <a href="https://amzn.to/4nsWQ6R">Spigen makes a similar product</a> that costs $24.99 for a two-pack.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->9</span></p><div><p>Let’s start with one of the most affordable options if you want to go the matte-textured route. AmFilm sells a two-pack of protectors at Amazon for $8.99. The set includes a plastic frame that serves as a guide to align the protector just right. <a href="https://amzn.to/3G1DtBa">JSAUX</a> makes a similar product that’s the same price.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>AmFilm also sells a two-pack with a OneTouch frame for easier installation. Again, keep in mind that opting for matte over glossy will reduce glare, but at the cost of viewing angles as well as the full vivid quality of the Switch 2’s screen. That’ll be an acceptable tradeoff for some, but not all people.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/reviews/694948/best-switch-2-glass-screen-protector-glossy-matte]]></content:encoded>

I know I struggled at first trying to understand what was different or better. Luckily, it’s easier than you think! Let’s go over Alpha, Beta, and the new Gamma armors.</p><h2 id="h291653"><a id=""></a>Alpha vs Beta Armor</h2><p>Aside from a handful of armor sets, most have an Alpha set and a Beta set. Discerning the differences between the two can be hard at first glance. Although they have slightly altered colors, that doesn’t matter as you can customize your armor pigments. They even share the same defense and resistance values.</p><p>Skills and slots are where the armor types differ the most. <strong>Alpha armor will give you more preset equipment skills, while Beta armor will instead give you extra and/or higher-level Decoration slots.</strong> Beta pieces are the preferred option for creating a custom build. If you don’t have any worthwhile decoration pieces for your proposed build or simply don’t enjoy going super in-depth with these mechanics, sticking with Alpha can be a viable option. As an example, let’s compare the same Rey Dau armor piece across both variants:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Alpha:</strong> Provides a single level-three Decoration slot and both Latent Power and Maximum Might as level-one skills</li><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Beta:</strong> Provides a single level-three Decoration slot, two level-one Decoration slots, and the Latent Power skill at level-one</li></ul><p>You’ll receive a different Group Skill depending on which set you use. Rey Dau Alpha Armor has the <em>Inspiration</em> Group Skill, while the Beta Armor has the <em>Resuscitate</em> Group Skill.

If you love to get into the nitty-gritty of customizing decoration slots, I can’t argue with that. However, I will point out that the entire Rey Dau Gamma Armor set still has the same equipment skills as the prior versions. They even match the highest levels or exceed them from either set. The only difference is that they’re spread out differently among the five pieces.</p><p>Even though the enhanced defense and skills are great, one of Gamma Armor’s will always give you more options. Pairing pieces from Alpha and Beta sets can feel pretty monotonous since they share the same equipment skills. Gamma Armor genuinely feels different due to the mixed skill placements, allowing for more variance with entirely separate pieces or even some from the beta set. I know I’ve had a lot of fun running a mix of Gamma and Beta Rey Dau armor.</p><p>It all depends on how you like to play at the end of the day. Some hunters like using precise skills, and others just like seeing big damage numbers. Choose the pieces that fit you best and have some fun!</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Alters developer 11 Bit Studios has responded to fan accusations it used generative AI text and translation in the game, and has promised an update to both to replace the AI-generated content with handcrafted assets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, players of The Alters spotted what appeared to be text generated by AI in the game, on a screen in the Command Center. Specifically, the text includes the line, "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data:" followed by a Captain's log, which suggests that someone prompted an AI for the text and forgot to delete the AI's lead-in response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the English-language version of the game, that was the end of it. However, players of other language versions <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:o7fzbrxgcaoek5sjkxq3acq3/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">began to point out</a> that some of the game's translations include lines like, "Sure! Here is the translated text into Brazilian Portuguese.", suggesting that 11 Bit Studios had used generative AI to localize at least some portion of the game. The Alters does not include a disclosure on its Steam page stating that it includes generative AI, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve makes mandatory</a> for all games that use the technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement sent via email to IGN and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published across social platforms</a>, 11 Bit Studios offered an explanation for the generative AI text and translations. The studio explained that the Captain's Log text was intended as a placeholder and simply got missed during final release, and that no other such instances appear in the game. As for the localization, 11 Bit says that generative AI translations were limited to a few cutscenes added very late in development that needed last-minute translations, and that it always intended to replace them with professional translations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the studio's statement, in full:</p><blockquote>We’ve seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters, and we feel it’s important to clarify our approach and give you more context. AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner. Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.</blockquote><blockquote>During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated. </blockquote><blockquote>For transparency, we’ve included a screenshot to show how and where it appears in the game. While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to that, a few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development. While those were externally produced, our team was not involved in the creative process, and these required additional last-minute translations. Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented.</blockquote><blockquote>To give you a better understanding of what a small part of the overall scope of the game’s narrative layer they are, those few external movies are approximately 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text. The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know. </blockquote><blockquote>As AI tools evolve, they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We’re actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">11 Bit Studios is just the latest company to come under fire for generative AI usage. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-includes-generative-ai-portraits-following-fan-backlash">Just last week</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 developer Frontier Developments had to walk back its use of generative AI characters portraits after widespread criticism. Activision has been skewered repeatedly for its generative AI use, including recent examples of an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-once-again-under-fire-over-alleged-generative-ai-use-now-for-a-fake-guitar-hero-game">ad for a Guitar Hero game that doesn't exist</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">certain Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets.</a> Other games, such as Palworld, have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood">accused of using generative AI</a> but have gone to great lengths to prove the accusations were unfounded and that no generative AI was used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of generative AI usage, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-review">gave The Alters an 8/10 in our review</a>, calling it "a highly atmospheric sci-fi character study mixed with simple but effective resource and base management that cleverly builds existential and interpersonal pressure throughout its story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
Nintendo has suggested it's preparing to raise prices across a significant number of Switch products in Canada - including consoles, games, and even Nintendo Switch Online memberships - blaming what it calls "market conditions".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nintendo-switch-pricing-update-892304996.html">said</a> pricing for the Switch family of systems and products in Canada will "change" due to market conditions, with the company confirming Switch, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite are all affected, alongside Switch accessories. Physical and digital Switch games are also impacted, as are amiibo and Nintendo Switch Online memberships.
</p>
<p>
The company hasn't specified when these 'changes' will happen, but revised pricing for all impacted products is set to be shared on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/">Nintendo's Canadian store</a> from 1st August, suggesting that's when all this comes into effect. "Please note," it adds. "This pricing change does not apply to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> system, accessories, or software."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's decision comes amid ongoing trade uncertainty between the United States and Canada, and follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">brief pause in the company's Switch 2 launch strategy</a> - for both the US and Canada - earlier this year as it grappled with US president Trump's volley of tariffs.
</p>
<p>
While Nintendo ultimately elected not to increase the cost of Switch 2 in response, it did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raise prices for various Switch 2 accessories in the US</a>, noting, "Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions." It's unclear if the price "change" it's now announced for Canada will be expanded to other countries.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo isn't the only console manufacturer to change its pricing in response to recent global trade uncertainty, of course. Back in April, Sony revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">yet another price increase for PS5</a>, blaming a "challenging economic environment", and a month later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Microsoft followed suit</a>, confirming worldwide price increases for Xbox Series X/S and a bump to $80 for some of its games. Shortly after, Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-considers-further-price-rises-as-it-braces-for-500m-tariffs-impact">refused to rule out further price rises</a>, saying it was currently evaluating whether to "pass on" additional costs brought about by US tariffs to consumers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Warner Bros. Animaniacs" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71c8225a059ab/warner-bros-animaniacs.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF4PqtMVTCc&amp;t=7s&amp;ab_channel=WBKids">Warner Bros.</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>If you were a kid who grew up in the '90s, you've probably watched more than a handful of episodes of <strong>Animaniacs</strong>. The Warner Bros.-produced cartoon ran from 1993 to 1998 and received well over 250 episodes. And, you can bet there were many video games out there to accompany Yakko, Wakko, and Dot's animated antics.</p>
<p>In fact, there were nine different games between the SNES and DS eras, in fact, but a tenth, long-lost one has recently been rediscovered and preserved online (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/06/nearly-complete-prototype-of-cancelled-animaniacs-gba-game-surfaces-online">Time Extension</a>!); <strong>Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics</strong>, which is now fully preserved and playable online thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://x.com/HiddenPalaceOrg/status/1939452768210604173">Hidden Palace</a>, MrPinball64, and Billscat-socks.</p>
<p>The 2D platformer, which mixes in puzzle-solving elements, was originally due to launch in 2003. It would've been the first Animaniacs game on the handheld console, but production woes, an insolvency procedure at Full Fat, and lack of a new publisher meant that the project was quietly cancelled.</p>

<p>As you'd expect, Pinky and the Brain are at it again, and in their quest for world domination, they've planned to turn the Warner Bros. Water Tower into a rocket, and in-turn have hypnotised all the actors and crew members at Warner Bros. That leads the Warner Bros. siblings, who are immune to the hypnotisation, to stop the evil duo's plans and save the studio.</p>
<p>After its cancellation, Hollywood Hypnotics was essentially thought lost for years, despite numerous screenshots and box art being available to view online. And <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Animaniacs_-_Hollywood_Hypnotics">according to Hidden Palace</a>, not even the former developer knew if the game was actually finished.</p>
<p>But yes, folks, it was <em>basically</em> done, with the whole game all the way to the final boss now playable online. Some visual inconsistencies and "rough around the edges" moments aside, this is essentially the game we were meant to get over two decades ago. And you can see just how it runs in a brief gameplay video from <a href="https://youtu.be/S6EQ4aeWY9M?si=SNta7vhtaunnf10c">GreenShield</a> below!</p>

<p>Hidden Palace has also shared two early builds of another Full Fat Games release — <strong>Justice League: Chronicles</strong>, which did in fact get a full release.</p>
<p>All of these releases are extremely important for video game preservation, particularly the Animaniacs game, which we all thought was lost media. Credit to the fans and communities who work tirelessly to ensure these projects are not lost to time.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/squid-game-season-3-hwang-jun-ho</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-season-3%E2%80%99s-hwang-jun-ho-storyline-sucked.1232187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Squid Game</em> season 3 is out, and with it comes the close to the most anime-cour move Netflix could've pulled by splitting a once razor-sharp series into fragments. Creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, who honestly only envisioned making one season, tried his best to buck the streamer’s erosion of the show’s scathing critique of class exploitation into a corporate spectacle complete with a real-life game show and video game that spectacularly miss the point.</p><p>The third and final (?) season, for all its occasional highs, suffers from the law of diminishing returns. It's not bad or incompetent wholesale; it’s just more, and it suffers from its excess. Highs remain: Seong Gi-hun’s impromptu revenge arc, his strangely poignant old man yaoi dynamic with the show’s masked villain, and moments where the series moved away from season 1’s noticeably male-centric grim satire. Also, Thanos was fun and will forever be famous.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Best of Thanos | Squid Game: Season 2 | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4CgNIFdUDiY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But as a continuation, <em>Squid Game</em> dilutes its potency. The back half of season 3 shifts into a drawn-out trolley problem metaphor coalescing into a setup that promises even more to come, making the whole experience feel like a corporate cop-out rather than a cultural event worth relishing in.</p><p>But I could forgive all of the season’s shortcomings—be it its insufferable foreign “guests” who sound like aliens speaking English for the first time to the show’s groan-inducing final scene—had its resident cop, Hwang Jun-ho, not gone on such a frustrating and pointless excursion.</p><p><strong>Spoilers for that.</strong></p><p>Hwang Jun-ho is an interesting and smart character who stood out in season 1 as a resourceful presence. His feats included an undercover infiltration onto the murder playground game island, disguised as one of the PlayStation symbol-masked workers, and cornering the big bad Front Man in its finale. If that weren’t enough, Juh-ho got extra intrigue sprinkled into his capable character’s mystique with the reveal that the Front Man was none other than his estranged brother, Hwang In-ho, who shot Jun-ho off the side of a cliff face into the sea. Jun-ho’s miraculous survival made him more than just a side character, turning him into a mirror of the show’s central dilemma about trust and morality. This all rolled into positioning Jun-ho as a central player at the start of season 2, when he and Gi-hun joined forces using the latter’s winnings to contract a private militia to mount an invasion of the island. The only problem is that the plot thread never went anywhere because season 2 sidelined Jun-ho hard.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wi Ha-jun reads Thirst Tweets | Squid Game: Season 2 | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Btucae5qFac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The majority of season 2 saw Jun-ho aboard a boat with the mercenaries as its captain attempted to triangulate the location of the island. Their navigation became all the more pressing when they lost contact with Gi-hun, leading him to improvise an insurrection with the participants while trying to stay alive long enough for them to arrive. Every time season 2 cuts back to Jun-ho on the boat, nothing happened. While I can levy my complaints at the show’s uneven pacing, the real issue, unfortunately, lies in the show downgrading Jun-ho’s intelligence to 0 when assessing his situation. Namely, the captain of the boat is obviously not on the up and up.</p><p>As far as Jun-ho knows, the ship captain just so happened to find him waterlogged and brought him back ashore. For whatever reason, no amount of bells were ringing in his head over why a fisherman would be close to such a place in the first place, and why he’s suddenly forgetful of where that location could be. I was even more frustrated with Jun-ho when the captain kills a mercenary and throws him overboard, and Jun-ho fails to investigate the captain’s claim that the mercenary fell overboard while drunk.</p><p>I held out hope that season 3 would make up for the narratively constipated development with Jun-ho and remind me why I enjoyed him in the first season, but the show did precisely the opposite. Despite Choi Woo-seok, whose suspicions in the show have been proven reliable, raising his concern with Jun-ho that the captain’s story does not pass the smell test, Jun-ho ignores every inquisitive instinct in his body and dismisses the assertion.</p><p>A season ago, Jun-ho was chasing a mob of people wearing pink jumpsuits through a Halloween party, trying to stop them from abducting others to play live-or-die games of hide and seek. I think he should be beyond paranoid and open to inquiring into things that don’t seem normal, especially when they happen under his nose. This whole debacle teeters on hilarious when the captain crosses out a spot on the map and all but says, "The island definitely isn't there.” My frustration reached a boiling point when it all coalesced in Woo-seok going on a whole side mission to investigate the captain’s background, track down his residence, break into his house, kill his dog, and uncover a mountain of evidence proving he was right. Key among them being the captain’s pink jumpsuit and mask buried in his yard with oodles of money and (hilariously) a bunch of photos of the captain, Front Man, and The Recruiter on fishing trips together like Squid Games hosts company retreats.</p><p>Mind you, this is all from the legwork of a lovable idiot loanshark with a heart of gold. Not, say, a detective with a database of information and an overwhelming sense of suspension of disbelief about a socialite death tournament. Woo-seok is then burdened with relaying this information to Jun-ho while detained in the police station, but it's too late, because Jun-ho took forever and two seasons to do anything before the captain shot up the rest of his crew.</p><p>Sure, Jun-ho isn’t entirely useless. His reclaiming of the ship and remembering the captain crossing out the map (lol) gets him to save an escaped contestant. But even then, he only arrives on the island with a literal 30-minute timer until the whole thing goes boom to do anything. Does he use his time well? At this point, you should know that’s not his MO. He shoots through some glass and confronts his brother, training his rifle on him as he stands on a pedestal of the last game. Finally, the confrontation we’d been waiting for! What will Jun-ho, who didn’t tell Gi-hun the Front Man was his brother and is beyond doing anything about it when it would’ve helped in season 2, do with this confrontation? He asks his brother the same thing he asked him in season one before getting shot off a cliff: “Why?”</p><p>In-Ho doesn’t grace his brother with a response and just leaves, prompting Jun-ho to mount his escape and somehow wind up back in the sea far away from the exploded island before a timeskip where he humors quitting the force to work alongside Woo-seok as a loan shark, as if he’s done anything to earn such a resume. The term "character assassination" is thrown around haphazardly in media critiques. I don’t think what happened with Jun-ho is anything of the sort. But it is a useful cop becoming something far worse: a cop.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”

The service also has its own achievements system in the form of medals, which are awarded when you hit different milestones (such as using Zonai powers 1,000 times), along with a function to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-notes-lets-players-swap-items-between-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530614/" data-ref-id="1100-6530614">share items</a> and autobuild designs with other players.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this is neat, but inessential; you can play through either title without once consulting the app and your adventure would not feel any less fulfilling. However, one feature that does have an appreciable impact on the experience is Navigation. On top of being a repository of personal stats, Zelda Notes can effectively act as a GPS for your game, leading you to a specific point of interest or collectible. As you're exploring Hyrule, the service displays your current location on the map along with an extensive list of things to discover around the kingdom, from shrines and cave entrances to different treasures and enemies. Select a destination--such as a Korok you've yet to find--and the app will guide you there with audio directions, helping you mop up any collectibles you've missed or had trouble locating.</p><div

games – Nintendo Switch 2 Editions &amp; ZELDA NOTES – Overview Trailer</p><div><p>         Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?       </p><p><a

videos.     </p><p>       This video has an invalid file format.     </p><p>Sorry, but you can't access this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">On one hand, this seems like the most compelling reason to use Zelda Notes, especially for completionists. Both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are vast games, with an overwhelming number of shrines to activate and other secrets to discover, so having a means to track down any you've overlooked (without having to go through the inconvenience of Googling the solution) is a boon. And indeed, it works fairly well. Aside from the occasional syncing quirk, the feature is intuitive and simple to use, which makes it temptingly easy to fire up when you're, say, struggling to suss out where your shrine radar is trying to lead you. And yet, as I was testing out Navigation, I couldn't help but feel like I was cheating.</p><p dir="ltr">Much of the appeal of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom stems from their freeform, open-ended structure; both are designed to continually stoke your curiosity, encouraging you to stray from your current objective with breathtaking landmarks and other enticing diversions. Exploration is very much a reward unto itself, and the most satisfying discoveries often occur when you indulge a whim and venture off the beaten path. In this respect, the entire purpose of the Navigation feature runs counter to what makes these games so special. Being able to pinpoint a shrine you've missed and simply follow directions there is convenient, but it undermines the sense of discovery that makes these games so enthralling.</p><p dir="ltr">What's more, both titles already offer in-game ways to track certain objects, which are better at preserving the spirit of adventure than Zelda Notes' Navigation feature. On top of the aforementioned shrine radar, there's the Korok mask, which will rattle when you're in the vicinity of a hidden Korok. Both of these do a fine job of nudging you in the right direction without overtly spoiling the solution, offering helpful guidance while still allowing you to feel the satisfaction of discovering things on your own. Navigation removes that entirely, which in turn diminishes the sense of accomplishment when you do finally locate the object you're seeking.</p><p dir="ltr">The same can also be said of the Daily Bonus feature. Once every 24 hours, Zelda Notes allows you to spin a roulette of perks that can be applied within the game. These range from buffs like a temporary boost to defense or speed (much as you would get from consuming a meal), to even the ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-zelda-app-fixes-weapon-degradation-in-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530853/">repair a damaged weapon</a>. The latter is not as overpowered as it may initially sound; the odds of actually pulling it are fairly slim, and it's only good for one use. Still, its availability flies in the face of one of the games' core design elements. Controversial as it may be, weapon degradation is integrally woven into the fabric of the gameplay, reinforcing the need to continually poke around the world and gather whatever resources you happen upon. Having a means to repair a weapon, as limited as it is, circumvents this carefully designed system in a way that cheapens the experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4523473-img_6791.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523473" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4523473-img_6791.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523473"></a><figcaption>Once a day, Zelda Notes lets you roll for a free perk you can activate in your game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4523473-img_6791.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To be fair, the available perks are hardly game-breaking. One seven-minute speed buff will make very little difference in the grand scheme of your adventure, and the fact that you can only spin the roulette once a day ensures these bonuses cannot be abused. It is, in effect, no different from obtaining meat and other materials by scanning an Amiibo figure--a small gift that amounts to little more than a minor convenience. Even so, when the systems underpinning the gameplay feed into each other as meticulously as they do in these two Zeldas, any free advantage--however slight--feels counterintuitive.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo had to tread a very fine line with Zelda Notes, designing a service that provides some helpful ancillary features that enrich the experience for core players, but can safely be ignored by those who wish to preserve the satisfaction of discovering things on their own. To that end, it achieves the intended results. Zelda Notes offers enough supplemental functions to make it a handy companion app, particularly for those who just want to check off any remaining collectibles and have no compunctions about spoiling their location. But when the games the service is tied to are so deliberately designed to foster ingenuity and inquisitiveness, it may be more fulfilling not to use it at all.</p><p dir="ltr">As I was scanning the map in Zelda Notes, I spotted a cluster of Koroks I'd yet to find not far off from my current location. It would have been very easy to navigate directly to each one and check them off my to-do list, but I decided to close the app, put on the Korok mask, and set off with no particular destination. And along the way, I stumbled upon a cave I'd never noticed before.</p>

The station log displayed in the image includes a bunch of astronomical data, though it was the out-of-place words at the top that raised questions. “Sure, here’s a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data,” it reads, suggesting it was copy-and-pasted from a ChatGPT-like prompt box. </p><p>Another image from one of the in-game movies that characters can watch also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/zitosilva.bsky.social/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/zitosilva.bsky.social/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">displayed clear leftover language</a></span> from a machine-translation service in the Portuguese subtitles. The allegations began to spread, with some on social media claiming to have spotted other examples of AI-generated content in <em>The Alters</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/boardgamefeast.bsky.social/post/3lsavrnw4qk2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/boardgamefeast.bsky.social/post/3lsavrnw4qk2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including a character portrait</a></span>. With various parts of the game becoming suspect, developer 11 Bit Studios posted a response on June 30 to try to clarify the situation. </p><p>“During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “This was never intended to be a part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game.” 11 Bit Studios said it conducted a thorough review and found no other incidents. Its defense for the movie translations, meanwhile, was that it planned to replace them with authored ones after launch, but didn’t have time beforehand and didn’t want to deprive non-English speakers of helpful context.</p><p>“Those few external movies are approx. 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3 percent of the overall text,” the studio wrote. But despite being “committed to transparency in how we make our games,” 11 Bit Studios has not yet responded to requests for comment from <em>Kotaku</em> or others that elaborate on the company’s actual stance regarding generative AI tools. Are they permitted to help create in-game assets or text? What makes something “meaningful, handcrafted storytelling” if even just a few of those elements were offloaded to AI, whether in the brainstorming process or the final version of the game?</p><p>“The use cases, admittedly very transparently laid out here, have been done without genAI for decades,” wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/aurahack&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/aurahack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artist and illustrator aurahack</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/aurahack.ca/post/3lstmis6chs2x&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/aurahack.ca/post/3lstmis6chs2x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Bluesky</a></span>. “This all reads a lot like ‘we’re sorry we got caught’ because there’s no recognition here of why this poses any kind of problem ethically or creatively. 0.3 percent is not a lot but it’s more than enough to cast a shadow over the rest of your work!

"We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event," the developer said.</p><p>It was at last year's Halo World Championships that Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">"A New Dawn" trailer</a> that showed off concepts for new Halo projects in the Unreal Engine, including Project Foundry.

		<p>Over the last couple of days a screenshot was taken showing an AI prompt in some background text of 11 bit Studios latest game, The Alters. The use of AI in the development of The Alters had not previously been disclosed by 11 bit Studios, including on Steam where games should be making it clear if AI has been used. Now, 11 bit Studios has released a statement, which is presented below without comment.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/965Km7t6KwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We’ve seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters, and we feel it’s important to clarify our approach and give you more context. AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner. Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.</em></p>
<p><em>During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>For transparency, we’ve included a screenshot to show how and where it appears in the game. While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience.</em></p>

<div>

<p><em>In addition to that, a few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development. While those were externally produced, our team was not involved in the creative process, and these required additional last-minute translations. Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented.</em></p>

<p><em>To give you a better understanding of what a small part of the overall scope of the game’s narrative layer they are, those few external movies are approximately 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text. The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know.</em></p>
<p><em>As AI tools evolve, they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We’re actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal.”</em></p>

<figure><a title="Disney Speedstorm Stitch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a2d48e5229ac/disney-speedstorm-stitch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gameloft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gameloft has announced that its free-to-play online racer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a>, is getting a free Switch 2 upgrade.</p>
<p>Shared via an in-game message (and reported on by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/30/disney-speedstorm-is-getting-a-nintendo-switch-2-update/">My Nintendo News</a>), the upgrade is due to arrive at the start of the new season, which lands on 3rd July.</p>
<p>Gameloft promises that the Switch 2 upgrade will mean the game will run at 6fps and will be 1080p in handheld and 1440p in docked, which is a huge upgrade from the Switch 1 version. We're also getting "better shadows, anti-aliasing, and shader quality".</p>
<p>You can read the full statement below, shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneySpeedstormGame/comments/1lo1zmh/we_finally_got_an_update_on_switch_2_improvements/">DisneySpeedstormGame subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>We're definitely looking forward to seeing the improvements on the new console, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/disney-speedstorm">our biggest criticisms of the Switch 1 release</a> were the visuals and frame rate issues. The game was meant to hit 30fps, but it frequently struggled to reach that number, and it didn't look <em>great</em> in handheld either.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out what';s coming in Season 14 — alongside the Switch 2 update — in the trailer below.</p>

<p>With the Switch 2 update, hopefully this means fans will be able to enjoy the game on Nintendo's hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/brandt-ranj">Brandt Ranj</a> <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/brandt-ranj">Brandt Ranj</a> is a commerce reporter for <em>The Verge </em>writing about the best deals and gadgets. He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A summer camping trip is the perfect excuse to stop staring at screens, but it doesn’t mean you need to go completely off the grid. <strong>Jackery’s Explorer 1000 Power Station V2</strong> lets you charge your gadgets and have more fun while you’re camping. For instance, you can plug in a projector, speakers, or a space heater. In other words, it’s great for entertainment and for maintaining a certain quality of life you may not be willing to give up while camping. This charging station, which also includes a SolarSaga 200W Portable Solar Panel, costs $698.99 ($601 off), its lowest price ever at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Generator-Portable-Off-Grid-Emergency/dp/B0D2L1G66J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. </p><p>The Explorer 1000 v2 will typically output 1,500 watts, which is enough juice to run a mini fridge, coffee maker, and other small appliances, or recharge a smartphone dozens of times. It can handle 3,000 watt power surges if a gadget draws a lot more energy briefly. The Explorer 1000 has three AC Outlets, two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and a DC power port, and can power or charge multiple gadgets at the same time. A small screen shows its battery percentage and how much power is being drawn. You can also view that information on your smartphone using the Jackery app. </p><p>The Explorer 1000 recharges in under two hours when plugged into an outlet, but you can reduce that time to one hour by enabling its Emergency Charging setting using the Jackery app. Fast charging will sacrifice battery health, which is something to consider. Jackery says the Explorer 1000 can retain up to 70% of its original capacity after 4,000 charges. </p><p>The SolarSaga Portable Solar Panel that’s included can refill the generator’s battery in about seven and a half hours with direct sunlight, and you can cut that time in half by connecting a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-SolarSaga-Portable-Compatible-Generator/dp/B00GCMUUPA?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">second one</a>. The panel is waterproof, and can be folded up to protect the panels from damage. The panel uses a sensor in the upper-right corner to automatically adjust its positioning to ensure the sun is hitting it at the optimal angle. </p><div><p id="four-more-deals-worth-a-look"><h2><strong>Four more deals worth a look</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Thousands of games are heavily discounted during the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F" rel="sponsored">Steam Summer Sale</a>, which is running through July 10th.

But we’ve compiled some undeniably useful recipes that everyone should know, so here’s to hoping they can make your time with the game a bit easier. Let’s get cookin’.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h128444"><a id=""></a>Essential recipes in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></h2><p>The recipes listed below ensure you get the very best version of a meal, but you can often choose to use fewer ingredients to get similar but weaker dishes.</p><p>For instance, you can cook five Hearty Durians to net you full heart recovery and 20 additional temporary yellow hearts. However, if you opt to use only one Hearty Durian instead, you’ll still get the full heart recovery, but you’ll only get four temporary yellow hearts. Meanwhile, cooking up five Endura Carrots can provide you with full stamina wheel recovery and two temporary yellow stamina wheels, while cooking a single Endura Carrot will only provide the full stamina wheel recovery.</p><p>So, as you might suspect by reading that, there are a hell of a lot of variations you can toy around with.

                <p>The Animaniacs was the follow-up series to Tiny Toon Adventures and introduced young audiences to the Warner Bros. characters Wakko, Yakko, and their sister, Dot. The animated program was a huge hit, spawning merchandise, a movie, and nine video games--including the two spin-off games focused on Pinky and The Brain. Recently, however, a never-released tenth game has been unearthed, and it would have been released on Game Boy Advance.</p><p>The preservationist group <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Animaniacs_-_Hollywood_Hypnotics" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hidden Palace</a> released information about the game, Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics, and even uploaded it so players can now play the long-lost game.

The Brain wanted to take over the famous Warner Bros. Water Tower--and the Warners' lair--and turn it into a rocket. The title of the game came from the duo using hypnosis to put their plan into action.</p><p>The game was likely to be released in 2003 after what seems like an incredibly bumpy road to production. Initially starting as a project for the publisher Conspiracy Entertainment, it was eventually rebooted under another company named Swing Entertainment. It was put aside after Swing entered insolvency proceedings also in 2003, officially putting an end to the project.</p><p>Swing would eventually release Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt for GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2005--it would be one of the last Animaniacs games made.</p>

            <p>
11 Bit Studios has responded to criticism surrounding its use of generative AI in sci-fi game The Alters, insisting the controversial elements discovered by players were either "temporary" assets "never intended to be part of the final release" or used in a "very limited manner."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit, which has also developed the acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a>, found itself the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation">focus of controversy over the weekend</a> after evidence of AI-generated assets were discovered in The Alters - despite the studio failing to disclose their use on Steam, as mandated by Valve.
</p>
<p>
One image widely circulated on social media showed an in-game background display featuring a text-based "Captain's Log" conspicuously incorporating the giveaway generative AI phrase, "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data". But it was the instances of shoddy AI-generated localisation - used alongside professionally translated text - that drew the most criticism. One Portuguese subtitle translation, for instance, began, "Sure! Here is the translated text into Brazilian Portuguese".
</p>
<p>
The discoveries weren't well-received, particularly given 11 Bit's failure to disclose its generative AI usage, but the studio has now responded, insisting some of the offending elements were used in error, while others were down to misjudgement. "We've seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters," it wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i">statement on social media</a>, "and we feel it's important to clarify our approach and give you more context."
</p>
<p>
"AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary [work-in progress elements] during the development process and in a very limited manner," it insisted. "Our team has always prioritised meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game."
</p>

"During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated." The studio also shared a screenshot of the controversial assets - including the Captain's Log display - as they appear in-game, adding, "While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience".
</p>
<p>
As for those controversial translations, 11 Bit suggested these were limited to a "few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base." It says these "externally produced" assets were made without the team being "involved in the creative process", and were "added at the final stage of development". As such, "last-minute" translations were required, said to account for "just 0.3 percent" of in-game text. "Due to extreme time constraints," 11 Bit continued, "we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localised using AI to have them ready on launch."
</p>
<p>
"It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localisation hotfix," the studio added, "to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented... The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English-speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit didn't address why it had chosen not to disclose the use of AI-generated content on Steam, despite Valve's mandatory requirements, nor has it added the disclosure since being called out. "As AI tools evolve," it concluded, "they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We're actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit isn't the only studio to face criticism for its generative AI usage, of course. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3 studio Frontier Developments announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-3-is-ditching-its-ai-generated-art-after-some-initial-feedback">removing the game's AI generated scientist avatar art</a> in response to "some initial feedback", while Activision and Microsoft have respectively been criticised for producing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">AI-generated Call of Duty promotional art</a> and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-muse-microsofts-gen-ai-game-tool-everyone-hates-whats-really-going-on-and-why-is-it-being-marketed-at-xbox-fans">AI-generated playable demo "inspired" by Quake 2</a>. As Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale reported last year, however, for all the controversy surrounding AI, it's clear the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">technology is changing game development forever</a>.

<p>Move comes due to "market conditions"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch OLED" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c39d84c0d7ce/switch-oled.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced it will change the price for a whole bunch of its products in Canada, citing "market conditions" for the move.</p>
<p>This comes via <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nintendo-switch-pricing-update-892304996.html">Newswire</a>, with more information on specific prices coming directly from Nintendo of Canada on <strong>1st August 2025</strong>. The official announcement specifically mentions "price changes", but let's face it, we all know they're probably going up, not down.</p>
<p>Here's a list of products expected to be affected from the price changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Switch - OLED Model</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Lite</li>
<li>Digital and Physical Games</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Accessories</li>
<li>amiibo</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Online Memberships</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the good news (if you can call it that) is that the Switch 2 seemingly won't be affected by the move – at least for now. Nintendo specifically states that "This pricing change does not apply to the Nintendo Switch 2 system, accessories, or software", so that's good to know.</p>
<p>Nintendo had previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-is-delaying-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">delayed its intended pre-order launch date for the Switch 2 in Canada</a>, stating that it wanted to align its plans with North America, which had also seen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-the-us-amidst-new-trump-tariffs">a delay of its own as a direct result of uncertainty surrounding tariffs in the region</a>.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is seemingly not going anywhere after President Donald Trump recently stated he would be <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg629n7wzvo">"terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada"</a>. Trade talks are, however, set to resume after Canada ditched its digital services tax on tech companies.</p>

One problem with this is that controls get switched around once your weapons are equipped. That’s not to say you can’t use both!</p><p><strong>If you hold down L1 while holding a weapon, you can push in the left stick to shoot your slinger.</strong> The one drawback is that heavy ammo, such as Heavy Slicing Pods, can’t be used with most weapons equipped. Only the Sword and Shield can freely use any Slinger ammo type.</p><h2 id="h390968"><a id="4"></a>There is a separate Slinger item bar</h2><figure id="" data-id="97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-recommend-id="image://97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-recommend-id="image://97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up, you guessed it, is another shortcut for your Slinger.
