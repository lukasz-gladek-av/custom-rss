                <p dir="ltr">Dying Light fans might want to tune into Gamescom Opening Night Live tomorrow, August 20. That's because host Geoff Keighley seems to be teasing a new entry in the zombie video game series, especially in light of a recent US Patent and Trademark Office filing.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1825502979950064033" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Keighley shared a roughly one-minute live-action video alongside the text: "The Beast Is Coming." What's notable here is that Keighley focuses on "The Beast," since <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98693419&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the USPTO website</a> shows a trademark application for Dying Light: The Beast was submitted on August 12.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the teaser shows a woman frolicking in a forest for the first half before the tone turns dramatically darker--and bloodier--in the second part. At the end, she says, "Please, help me," before being dragged away. When someone on X responded that they "don't want live-action trailers," <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1825504189327233321" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Keighley replied</a>: "I'd tune in then."</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, series director Tymon Smektała posted a poll on X <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/techland-gauges-interest-in-possible-dying-light-3/1100-6513373/" data-ref-id="1100-6513373">asking what fans would like to see in a possible Dying Light 3</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/final-fantasy-xvi-launches-on-pc-this-septmeber/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix have announced that Final Fantasy XVI will be coming to both Steam and the Epic Game Store on September 19th 2024. The whet your appetitive there is a free demo available right now on both stores, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi-demo-c289c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s the link for EGS,</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2738000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s the link for Steam. </a></p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XVI “DELIVERANCE” - PC Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2WT_0m0dsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As usual there are a couple of variations of the release.&nbsp; Final Fantasy XVI Standard Edition &nbsp;includes the base game, or the Complete Edition &nbsp;includes the exciting DLC chapters “Echoes of the Fallen” and “The Rising Tide” at a discounted price. You can also buy the DLC chapters individually or as part of the Final Fantasy XVI Expansion Pass, which includes both chapters. All of these will be available on launch day.</p>
<p>If you pre-oder the game on either Steam or the Epic Games Store will also receive the following in-game DLC items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brave Blade Weapon</li>
<li>Cait Sith Charm (Gil Boost Accessory)</li>
<li>“Sixteen Bells” Orchestrion Roll</li>
</ul>
<p>The game originally launched in June 2023 on PlayStation 5 and we gave it a whopping<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/21/final-fantasy-16-review/"> 9/10 in our review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>“If you’re a fan of strong narrative experiences, Final Fantasy lore, breath-taking graphics and a particularly sassy Moogle, and you don’t mind a sprinkling of The Witcher, The Handmaids Tale and the many accents of Old Blighty, then Final Fantasy XVI is the game for you,” said Nic. “Heck, it might just be the best Final Fantasy yet!”</p>

<p>If you need even more convincing you should get the game then let me remind you it won our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-playstation-game-ps5-psvr2/">PlayStation Game of the Year foe 2023</a>.</p>
<p>“Final Fantasy XVI is very different to its predecessors. First and foremost, it’s a lot more grown up, with the sex, swearing and everything else that its muse, Game of Thrones, offers. Then there’s the set-piece Eikonic battles, where players duke it out as the Summons the franchise is famed for. It looks and sounds utterly spectacular.”</p>
<p>“This game is a must-play for all action-RPG fans who want something a little more grown up. It shines for its lore and its lack of exposition for the sake of it, with reams of backstory hidden just a button-press away, offering a flow that feels more natural than any other Final Fantasy game to date. Its characters are fantastic, and as you grow to love them, their moments of sacrifice hit in a way unfelt since the likes of Final Fantasy X.”</p>

<p>Following the game’s most recent update, in which developer Starbreeze Studios released the Houston Breakout DLC, featuring a brand-new heist, tailor pack, and weapon pack, if you purchase the entire Chapter 3 bundle, some players cannot join a lobby. It’s becoming more widespread with each passing minute. Here are some potential fixes for the failed to fetch game config in Payday 3!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-potentially-fix-failed-to-fetch-game-config-in-payday-3">How to (Potentially) Fix Failed to Fetch Game Config in Payday 3</h2>



<p>If you’re among the many suffering from this bug that’s plagued the game since its launch, you’re not alone in dealing with it today. Countless players cannot get into a game because of the “game config” error in Payday 3. While not guaranteed, here are a few potential fixes for the problem:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create an entirely new Starbreeze account and link it to your game via Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation.</li>



<li>Verify the game files on Steam by right-clicking the game in your library, selecting Properties, then Installed Files, and then “verify integrity of game files.” It will need to check every file, so be patient!</li>



<li>If that doesn’t work, delete the contents of the % appdata%LocalPAYDAY3 folder and attempt to verify the game files once more.</li>



<li>Attempt to log in repeatedly until it connects.</li>
</ul>



<p>While certainly not ideal, some of these fixes may help you finally check out the new content in the Houston Breakout DLC!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-causes-the-game-config-error-in-payday-3">What Causes the Game Config Error in Payday 3?</h2>



<p>It’s unclear precisely what causes the failed to fetch game config error in Payday 3. Some users report it as a problem with their internet connection. More often than not, however, it’s on Starbreeze’s end. It’s not your fault.</p>



<p>Even worse, Starbreeze has not yet addressed the problem, as far as we’ve seen. Many experienced it on launch day, and here we are, nearly a year later, with the problem persisting for many players.</p>



<hr>



<p>Payday 3 is a bit of a mess, especially considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbreeze fired its CEO</a>, but we’re hopeful the team can turn things around and create a cooperative heist game for the ages!</p>

The Ultimate supports three custom profiles and offers handy internal customization settings via 8BitDo's app, including macro support, full button mapping, adjustable trigger and rumble sensitivity, and analog stick stick deadzones. The Ultimate has a pair of remappable back buttons, whereas the Ultimate 2C's extra buttons are on top next to the triggers. In addition to the controller, you get a charging stand with a compartment to store the dongle.</p><p>You can get the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller for Switch, PC, and mobile for $48</a></strong> (was $60) at Amazon right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1825594654387294219?t=-rx6Q_9ptJcZJYDfNIcunA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateTheHate2 on X</a>, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be released on PC and Xbox as a timed exclusive in December 2024. The timed window is supposedly six months, and a planned release on PlayStation 5 is planned for the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming purchased MachineGames, the developer behind this Indiana Jones game after it acquired Bethesda in 2021 for $7.5 billion. Because of that, it seems highly likely that the game will be an Xbox exclusive, with the game being available on day one on Xbox Game Pass for both PC and Console.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't know how true this is, as it is purely speculation. We know that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is being showcased at Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will hopefully provide more information about the game and what to expect.</p>
<p>This upcoming action game is being developed by MachineGames, who also developed games such as the Wolfenstein franchise, some Quake games, and, most recently, the Indiana Jones game. Bethesda Softworks is publishing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a game between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this title is in a first-person perspective, with some third-person moments throughout the action, predominantly used for environmental exploration. The game also relies heavily on stealth, where players can control Indiana and use his whip as a weapon and a tool to solve puzzles that allow them to traverse difficult obstacles.</p>
<p>Bethesda and MachineGames announced in January 2021 that the game was officially being developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. Jerk Gustaffson, the Director, teamed up with Gordy Haab to contribute original music and reinterpretations of classic Indiana Jones themes heard throughout the movies.</p>
<p>At the moment, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn't have an official release date other than sometime in 2024. It's possible that, with the footage shown at Gamescom, they will announce a release date then. So far, the game is set to be one of the most highly anticipated Xbox exclusives.</p>
<p>With the speculation suggesting that the game will be coming to PlayStation 5 in the near future, it seems as though <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-reportedly-coming-to-ps5-as-microsoft-seemingly-prepares-to-go-third-party/">Microsoft has slowly started weighing up</a> the options of whether to bring the game to the PlayStation 5 or not. While <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/4-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-starfield-and-indiana-jones-arent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phil Spencer</a> spoke out at the Xbox Business Update, he suggested that four exclusives were being ported to other platforms but didn't mention which ones. This has given the audience plenty to speculate on, but we'll have to wait and see what the footage from Gamescom Opening Night Live brings us.</p>

Loot includes, but is not limited to, XP, materials, or drops (e.g. Exotic class items).”</p><p>While Bungie didn’t call out exotic class item farming specifically, that seems to be the most popular form of AFK macros lately, ever since players hit peak exhaustion with the gameplay loop required to attain them. Since exotic items spawn with random perks, it’s not just a matter of getting one but of getting the “right one” for the builds you’re running. And with  Overthrow activities in the Pale Heart not being generous enough and Dual Destiny being a lot of work to keep re-running, some <em>Destiny 2</em> diehards on PC started turning to running scripts in the background to farm for them, especially after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-exotic-class-overthrow-tier-4-chest-drop-rate-1851616742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-exotic-class-overthrow-tier-4-chest-drop-rate-1851616742">recent accidental nerfs</a></span> made the whole thing even worse. </p><p>The way it works, as you can see from dozens of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/1duhy7f/pale_heart_afk_chest_macro/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/1duhy7f/pale_heart_afk_chest_macro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit threads</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNZZBzG3dNM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNZZBzG3dNM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a></span>, is by loading players into the Overthrow the Landing patrol zone and looting the same old chest that has a roughly 2 percent chance to drop an exotic class item over and over again. Because the chest is close and always in the same place, it’s just a matter of rinsing and repeating. The script can loot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNNxdB0WqWM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNNxdB0WqWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about one chest a minute</a></span>, which would be mind numbing for a player to do but can make quick work of the farm if outsourced to a macro script that inputs all the commands for you while you’re busy complaining about <em>Destiny 2</em> on the subreddit.</p><p>“Is this allowed?” one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/my_friend_is_using_a_macro_to_farm_exotic_class/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/my_friend_is_using_a_macro_to_farm_exotic_class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a></span> in early July amid discussions of whether this was a bannable offense. “I mean, as long as he’s doing it solo and not hampering anyone else’s enjoyment of the game, I personally don’t see a problem with it,” another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/comment/lcajour/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/comment/lcajour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a></span>. “I don’t know why anyone would wanna spend hours actively running around a patrol space for a 1/64 chance to get something they are looking for for a build in the game.”</p><p>Bungie is now making it clear that that’s no longer the case. Most players seem to be okay with this change, and the studio specified that checkpoint macros, which are used to give teammates the same encounter save spot as the main person running the activity, won’t be regulated in the same way. But it still leaves the larger issue of why players were so turned off by the current grind that they started AFK farming to begin with. “Based,” wrote<em> Destiny 2 </em>YouTuber Stefan “Datto” Jonke. “But now it’s time to do something about why people opt for those paths in the first place.”</p><p>“That is indeed the goal,” Bungie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1825586394842149103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1825586394842149103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote back</a></span>. “We have some changes to XUR coming that we announced last week, and the team is continuing to look at opportunities for improvement.  Know it can be frustrating, but increased feedback/data to show the problem helps a lot, rather than resorting to Macros.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tactical-breach-wizards-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Games about high stakes, globetrotting military operations with the balance of global power at stake are a dime a dozen. But take their automatic weapons and tactical gear and replace them with flying brooms and pointy hats, and now we’re firmly in “things you don’t see everyday” territory. Tactical Breach Wizards’ imaginative setting pairs well with its snappy and witty script. The actual tactics in its main campaign didn’t challenge my brain as often as its jokes tickled my funny bone, but the small encounters kept a brisk and engaging pace that put hours of my time under a magical handkerchief and made it disappear in a blink of an eye.</p><p>Tactical Breach Wizards is a pretty literal name, all told. Your party, a rag tag group of magic using mercs from all walks of life, take their fight to the enemy one splintered door at a time. While this fits directly into the wheelhouse of Zan, a former black ops agent turned wizard of fortune, there’s no great explanation as to why his old friend Jen, a pretty mid private detective, takes to the explosive breaking and entering so well. But a few missions in, it didn’t seem out of place anymore. A lot of this world feels like pieces of real life and bits of witchy ideas kinda dropped together, with powerful spellcasters who have day jobs as traffic cops. But everything is treated so matter of factly that it all made sense eventually. Of course there’s a powerful mafia of druids featuring a guy who turns into a dog like Snoop in that one music video. Why wouldn’t there be?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tactical Breach Wizards Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The story is solid enough, following Zan and Jen as they chase a powerful and dangerous operative who can move faster than sound across the planet, but that tale isn’t all that enchanting in and of itself – especially in the back half where things escalate and get pretty convoluted. The dialogue is absolutely stellar throughout, though. It’s fun and plucky in a way that reminds me of TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly. Characters can be funny and vulnerable and sincere all in the same conversation without undermining any of it. There’s a lot of reading to do since there’s no voice acting, but the conversations are so energetic that it doesn’t feel like a drain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The dialogue is absolutely stellar throughout.</p></div><p>Most of the story happens in cutscenes that surround each mission. These turn-based skirmishes are more Chimera Squad than XCOM 2, with characters that have specific ability sets operating on more limited maps with lots of environmental factors to consider. Each encounter starts with the eponymous breach, where you deploy your units across one or many possible infiltration points and figure out your first moves. Having a really good first turn can set the pace for a good mission, but I rarely felt the opposite was true. I could almost always recover from a bad turn thanks to the ability to rewind any actions during it. You always know where your enemy is targeting, so you can always be reactive about mitigating their damage by any means necessary. That said, since you don’t always know where they are going to move the following turn, you still have to be more proactive to get good positioning on the map so that enemies have to react to you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As far as your squad of (eventually) five goes, it’s all hits, no misses when it comes to powerful abilities and the creative ways in which you can combo them with each other for big results. Most of your characters don’t fit neatly into well worn archetypes of the genre – there are no generic mages and fighters here – but their roles are distinct. Jen is a disrupter who can push several enemies around the level at once. Zan can put down overwhelming damage when mixing in a clone or overwatch-style abilities into his regular actions. Later, you get access to a tank who can switch places with anyone on the map, and can charge into people from long distances. Even through to the end of my 13 hour run, I was finding clever new ways to stunt on my foes.</p><p>Much of the action requires you to get your surroundings involved. Bouncing enemies off of walls and other objects is not just an enriching experience in its own right, but a sound and necessary tactic against well-armored baddies. This, as with the other two games in developer Tom Francis’ aptly named “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34631927-The-Defenestration-Trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Defenestration Trilogy</u></a>”, has a healthy(?) obsession with throwing people out of windows, to the point that one character can actually <em>make </em>windows to throw people out of if one isn’t readily available. Many objectives involve not only knocking out all bad guys, but also interacting with points on the map; interfacing with a laptop, locking down doors so reinforcements can’t come in, and turning off turrets are the bulk of the ask here. </p><p>Tactical Breach Wizards didn’t overwhelm me with these sub-goals, but it didn’t really wow me either. I spent most missions doing the same things in different configurations. There are tougher, optional goals that did test my skills when I chose to engage with them, like attempting to KO all the bad guys in one turn or using certain abilities in specific ways. Going back to complete these with stronger loadouts and characters is on my list of endgame stuff to do, but during my initial run though the story I didn’t stress much about them, and the game itself didn’t poke me too much about them either.</p><p>There are also some special challenges to vary things up that come in three forms: Anxiety Dreams, which are personal missions for each character, Dream Training, and Proving Grounds, which are unique maps with tests themed around specific mechanics or units. The latter two are where the real difficulty lies, tactically speaking, but unfortunately there are only a limited amount of them. Meanwhile the Anxiety Dream missions aren’t as tough, but they are creative, usually focusing around one character’s unique kit and lots of ways to use it. They pop up in the middle of the story and earn characters special upgrades for their abilities, but you can skip them without sacrificing the buff and comeback to it later. In fact, Tactical Breach Wizards lets you just skip every mission to progress the story if you so choose, and you can even choose to jump into any mission from the mission select screen regardless of if you’ve done it before or not. It’s a strange feature that I didn’t personally get any use out of, but it’s a bold statement to say “play this game at your own pace, literally whatever that pace may be.”</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Jarrett Green's Tactical Toolbox</h3><p>The definitive, completely correct list of the best turn-based tactics games you can play</p></div><p>Every mission grants you XP that become perk points you can spend to give character abilities a little extra zazz. Not all of these upgrades are made equal, and I’ve definitely made the most out of the perk point refunds in search of the right bonuses. Making Zan’s clone hologram, normally just used to draw enemy fire, a shooting platform in its own right is one of the several upgrades I trial and errored myself into that became significant game changers for me. It’s all pretty linear progression, though, and the only choices you have to make regarding customization are due to the scarcity of your perk points at any given moment. <s>You could pretty easily go back to old missions and grind XP to unlock everything. </s><em><strong>Editor's Note: </strong></em><em>It turns out replaying missions doesn't actually grant you additional XP, so you can't go back and grind out unlockables like this review originally stated. We apologize for the error.</em></p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Tactical Breach Wizards doesn’t demand knowledge from lost magical tomes to conquer its character-focused missions, each of which is filled with lots of doodads to fiddle with and not a lot of space to do it in. Being easy doesn’t mean it isn’t fun though – in fact, the very opposite is true here, thanks to the creative kits on every unit and how dynamic the combinations between them can be. Wrap that up in a vibrant and weird world with some truly incredible writing and it’s hard not to get entranced in its spell.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A reputable insider has claimed that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be coming to PlayStation 5 after an expired timed-exclusive window.</p>



<p>That’s according to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1825594654387294219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a>, who took the news to Twitter, “MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will release on Xbox &amp; PC this holiday (Dec) as a timed console exclusive. After this timed-exclusive window expires, Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle is planned to come to PlayStation 5 in the first half of 2025”, he said.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, some outlets have been given the heads up on the news and have signed NDAs, but it’s currently unclear on if the information will be announced at Tuesday’s Opening Night Live or not.</p>



<p>Nate’s claims come following another report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/4/24057433/microsoft-bethesda-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge’s Tom Warren in February</a>, who stated that Bethesda was “considering” brining Indiana Jones to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for the information Nate has revealed himself, the news that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will only be a timed-exclusive for what appears to be less than six months has already had people talking about Microsoft’s future strategy with its Xbox titles.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Insider Gaming did revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-2024-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle was still intended to release in 2024</a>.</p>

The Steam version will also feature a free <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-fortress-2/" data-ref-id="5000-3069">Team Fortress 2</a> character pack that will include the Scout, Heavy, Engineer, and Medic as playable characters.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Activision put the kibosh on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mod-shut-down-by-activision-hours-before-launch-leading-to-review-bombing/1100-6525865/" data-ref-id="1100-6525865">an ambitious mod</a> known as H2M: a fan-created attempt to bring classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer to Modern Warfare Remastered. Now, a member of the mod team that goes by the handle "Watchful Wolf" says that the gaming giant put out the cease-and-desist order due to concerns that H2M would hurt Black Ops 6 sales.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans immediately took to forums like the Call of Duty subreddit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1et5csh/cod_h2m_cease_desisted/" rel="nofollow ">express</a> their displeasure with the move, with many of them noting that the C&amp;D came the day before H2M was scheduled to release. In a video posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhHQ76SgPUI">YouTube</a>, Watchful Wolf stated that the order from Activision came just hours before the mod's release, and that the team immediately "dropped everything," taking their website and all servers down.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Watchful Wolf also stated in the video that the C&amp;D explicitly stated why Activision moved to shut the project down. They said it was "because of the popularity H2M was gaining and how close it is to Black Ops 6 releasing. They did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of Black Ops 6."</p><p dir="ltr">As usual in this kind of situation, it's difficult to verify Watchful Wolf's claims. However, it does make sense that Activision would do whatever it can to try to maximize Black Ops 6's sales, as it's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-game-pass-savior-spot-on/1100-6523868/" data-ref-id="1100-6523868">first one releasing</a> on Xbox Game Pass. It also comes at a sensitive time for the Xbox brand, which now owns Activison. But it's also important to note that this isn't the first high-profile Call of Duty mod to get the axe from the publisher, and we highly doubt that it'll be the last. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Black Ops 6 beta</a> begins on Friday, August 30.</p><p dir="ltr">We've reached out to Activision for comment, and we'll update the piece accordingly if we hear back.</p>

            <p>Nintendo and Level-5 have announced a delay for Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, which was originally due to launch for Switch on 10th October.</p>
<p>"To all of you who have been looking forward to the release, we apologise for any inconvenience caused and sincerely appreciate your understanding," Level-5 said in a <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/240819/">statement</a> sharing news of the delay. "Thank you for your patience."</p>
<p>Level-5 hasn't yet suggested when Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time might now release, nor did it offer any reason for the delay. Could the studio be waiting for Nintendo's next generation of hardware, tentatively dubbed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>? I suppose time will tell.</p>

<p>We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February last year</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back into this year.</p>
<p>We got a subsequent look at Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time this February, when the team gave us a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">peek at the various jobs players</a> will be able to undertake in this time travelling adventure. You can see for yourself in the trailer above.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are 1) wizards, 2) tons of tactical breaching, 3) a huge conspiracy to unravel and 4) so many windows to throw people out of.

Jen Kellan, the Storm Witch who serves as <em>Tactical Breach Wizards’ </em>de-facto protagonist, has just returned from a job gone badly. As a PI, she responsibly goes to the police to file her report and findings before being dismissed for inserting herself into missing persons cases and having her abilities dismissed as “witch’s tricks.” Since the game is wildly sharp, it lets you talk your shit right back at them, pointing out that maybe she wouldn’t have to insert herself if the police did their jobs. Soon after, you spend a mission dismantling the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-police-recruitment-poster-peoria-apology-1851300689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-police-recruitment-poster-peoria-apology-1851300689">brutally inefficient police force</a></span>, and once again, toss people out of windows.<br></p><p><em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>is immensely talk-y. It’s got an unfiltered voice that I’m deeply jealous of and which bleeds into its presentation and lovely level design. Some of my favorite moments in the game aren’t even in combat, but instead in the dialogue-heavy cutscenes that play between missions or just before you breach a door to begin a level. You get to know Zan, a veteran black ops wizard with ties to the game’s villain, and the “base” he brings you back to is actually his mom’s flat. Once you’re there, the two of them regale you with Zan’s “origin story” and his mom tells you that he’s got his dad’s “dogshit spirit.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-recommend-id="image://0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Tom Francis</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-recommend-id="image://0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Everyone is a <em>character</em> in <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>,<em> </em>which makes me appreciate how much it squeezes from these interstitial scenes. A traffic warlock with uncanny hearing named Steve Clark is among the brightest of them, and he thankfully recurs as a hilarious rival to Jen. Bori, a pyromancer known for producing barely-hot flames, is another such oddity, and a necromedic named Banks even ends up joining your team. Her whole shtick is that she can only heal people by resurrecting them and she can only resurrect someone who’s died within an hour, so she carries around a gun to expedite things. Yes, she resurrects you with a headshot. </p><p>Naturally, this quirkiness extends into the game’s story and approach to level design. Combat plays out via a turn-based system on an isometric grid, where you first deploy your units and take your actions before the enemy goes. If you leave one of your allies in a precarious position, you can foresee what the enemy will do before ending your turn and committing to it, and a rewind button allows you to carefully calculate every step of the turn before letting your foes advance. More often than not, you won’t be dealing direct damage as much as you’ll be debuffing enemies, knocking them into parts of the environment, or sending them careening out a window or into holes. However, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>does a marvelous job of ramping things up, despite how simplistic this might sound.<br></p><p>One of the latest levels I took on occurred within Jen’s own anxiety dream, and it was appropriately pretty unorthodox and challenging, both thematically and mechanically. On one level, Jen is quite literally interrogating herself about her inability to separate her identity from her work, diminishing her worth and sense of self. On another, two versions of her are fighting through stifling bureaucratic offices filled with the very police officers and traffic warlocks that filled her otherwise bland daily life. That is, until Zan came to her for help preventing World War <em>Five</em> and she began to feel like she was capable of being more than a cog in a broken machine.<br></p><p>In addition to familiarizing me with her struggles, this anxiety dream also pushed me to get to know all of Jen’s tricks. For example, the biggest thing about Jen is that she is both highly mobile and capable of pushing units around, so rather than confronting enemies head on, I tried to reposition her near windows. That way she could either use her main weapon (which pushes a unit at a time) or her Chain Bolt (which knocks back even further and also attacks multiple enemies) to send people flying out of windows, <em>or </em>use her broom to fly out of a nearby window and emerge from another one.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-recommend-id="image://7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tom Francis</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-recommend-id="image://7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Banks plays an excellent supporting role, being able to transfer damage from one character to another, opening up eldritch portals that enemies can be sucked up into, or even just softening them up with a thrown sedative, multiplying the effectiveness of any knockback damage. Zan is much more offensive, having the ability to set fire to any enemy that crosses whatever axis he fixes his sights on, but my favorite move of his eventually allows him to send out multiple projections of himself to take fire, shoot at nearby enemies, or even interact with objectives. It’s corny to admit, but you feel downright magical after a certain point, though <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>rarely feels pitched in your favor because of that.</p><p>An enemy turret will still absolutely cap you in 1-2 hits, and other traffic warlocks will send spectral cars and buses in three lanes directly at you. Neutralisers occasionally fill the ranks of enemies, and since they fixate on the closest unit to them and strip them of their magic, you have to carefully consider pulling enemy aggression when breaching a room and tactically position your allies accordingly. You wouldn’t want Zan to be pinned down on that opening turn, for example, since his clones and uniquely offensive skills make him ideal for taking out that Neautraliser quickly. That then creates an opportunity for Jen to dart through the room and push people into walls, portals, or out of windows. No matter what you think the goal of this game is, it’s <strong>pushing as many people out of windows as possible.</strong></p><p>If you don’t believe me, try and meet all the “confidence” goals in every level. These sub-objectives encourage you to optimize your playstyle by challenging you to sometimes beat a level in a certain amount of turns, toss a certain number of enemies out of windows in one move, or extend a turn so long that you and all your allies are able to use a number of skills, which take either action or mana, or sometimes both. Each character has their own confidence objective, which gives points to unlock cosmetics, but just beating missions will reward XP that can be doled out to modify and level up individual skills in a system that’s deeply familiar to anyone who’s played the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331">beloved tactics game <em>Into the Breach</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p>While I am two acts into the game, there’s another two that are even longer and there’s a slew of dream missions, which include challenging gauntlets as well as survival missions. You know, just in case you thought there wouldn’t be enough meat on the bones. Between its ridiculous cast and premise, a sleek sense of style, and a mystery I actually want to unravel—complete with a board and lots of interactive red string—not to mention its incredible wit, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>is absolutely one of the best games I’ve played this year. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The rumors of FIFA and 2K Sports working together continue to circulate, and it’s even gotten to the potential competition at EA Sports. In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/fc-25-developer-interview-career-mode-football-manager-fifa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, EA FC 25 developers Andreas Wilsdorf and Alex Constantinescu&nbsp;addressed the rumors of FIFA 2K coming in the future.</p>



<p>“It’s still just rumors, but even if the rumors are true, we welcome competition. I think competition is always interesting to see, you know, how other people approach the sport,” Wilsdorf says. “We know how tough it is to make a football game and it will be interesting to see how they would challenge us, but again, we’re welcoming competition.”</p>



<p>To add to that, Constantinescu, EA FC 25’s principal game designer for Career mode, said that challenges from the past is something they he feels they are lacking at this stage.</p>



<p>“I remember it was pure coincidence that a couple of years ago when we added press conferences to the game, PES did as well,” he said. “And when we saw the announcement from PES, I remember I got like ‘Okay, this is interesting. Now I really need to pick it up a notch and work a bit more on the content’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wilsdorf then said that while competition “brings out the best of everyone”, the team at EA Sports isn’t afraid of what could happen with a FIFA 2K game.</p>



<p>“We’re not worried because we know how good the game is…,” he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-do-things-stand-with-a-fifa-2k-game">Where Do Things Stand With A FIFA 2K Game?</h2>



<p>Regarding FIFA 2K, while nothing is official, there have been continued talks between FIFA and 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive. After talking to sources last week, the hope is that the sides can announce a deal sometime later this year. Negotiations, which date as far back as earlier this year, remain ongoing.</p>
