            <p>Playtonic, the developer behind the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a> series, has confirmed layoffs at the studio.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media, the studio stated it has "felt the knock-on effects" of recent changes in the industry and so, "after exploring every possible avenue" it has made "the incredibly heartbreaking decision to say goodbye to some truly brilliant members of the Playtonic team".</p>
<p>It's unclear if Playtonic's next game, the remaster Yooka-Replaylee, has been affected. It's set for release later this year.</p>

<p>"We've all seen in recent years how the games industry has been changing, resulting in studio after studio finding themselves in situations where to continue to exist, they must make painful decisions - decisions that impact the lives of so many individual talented developers," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"This isn't a reflection of anyone's talent or dedication, the people leaving have poured so much heart, creativity, and care into everything we do. They've helped shape our studio, our games, and our culture, and we're incredibly proud of what we've built together."</p>
<p>The studio surmised: "This isn't simply a difficult moment, it's a period of profound change in how games are created and financed. The landscape is shifting, and with it, so must we."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-won%E2%80%99t-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake.1202592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">Yuri Lowenthal confirmed in a post on BlueSky</a> that he wouldn't be returning to reprise his role as Yosuke in the Persona 4 Remake, a project that had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">rumored</a> to be happening, but not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>Lowenthal's claims that he potentially "<em>begged</em>" to be asked back and the fact that he deleted his original post made it look like Lowenthal had gone rogue, confirming his absence from the game as a small rebellious act against Atlus and SEGA.</p>
<p>But then a second actor, Erin Fitzgerald, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-wont-see-the-return-of-another-beloved-voice-actress/">confirmed her absence from the Persona 4 Remake</a> in a similar manner. Again, posting on BlueSky, Fitzgerald said, "<em>For those asking, I have not been asked to reprise my role as Chie Satonaka in the Persona 4 remake. RIP. I am blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her.</em>"</p>
<p>And now today, for a third day in a row, another Persona 4 voice actor has come out on social media to say that they will not reprise their role in the Persona 4 Remake. This time, it's Amanda Winn Lee, the only difference this time is that <a href="https://x.com/amandawinnlee/status/1928242559685472293">she posted the news on X</a> instead of BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em><span>Since, I've had several people ask me: No, I wasn't asked to voice Yukiko in the P4 remake</span></em>."</p>
<p>The first time, it seemed like Lowenthal had gone rogue. Fitzgerald's post then opened up the possibility that the cast are all voicing their displeasure about not being asked back for the remake. That could still be true, but now that a third actor has come out and made the same claim, for a third day in a row, for a game that's not even officially confirmed, it's starting to feel like a marketing ploy ahead of the game's reveal, most likely next week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest.</a></p>
<p>A user on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oscarexplosion.bsky.social/post/3lqefs2747226">BlueSky</a> also cleverly noticed that the order of these announcements also matches the order the characters each of these actors play are added to your party in Persona 4. If Matt Mercer is next to say that they weren't asked back to voice Kanji Tatsumi, with the same wording, then this has almost certainly all been a marketing ploy to build up awareness of the upcoming remake ahead of its official reveal.</p>
<p>The twist is probably that it's not called Persona 4 Remake, with the word 'Remake' swapped for something else, similarly to how the remake of Persona 3 was called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and that instead of recasting everyone, the whole voice cast is indeed returning for whatever the remake is actually called.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-3-is-getting-cross-platform-mod-support-later-this-year.1202586/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>will be getting cross-platform mod support later this year, potentially bringing some of the game's most popular mods to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/es/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, cross-platform mod support will be added to the game via the mod.io platform, which is the same one used by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-developer-teases-robust-cross-platform-plan-for-mod-support" rel="nofollow">games like&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Naturally, console mods will be available at no extra cost; all you'll need to do is create a mod.io account and connect it to your CD Projekt Red profile in order to access mods on PS5 and Xbox.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support-griffin.jpg?itok=21bUxwMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support-griffin.jpg?itok=aTIDBPbU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could turn this griffin - or, indeed, Geralt - into something truly bizarre when&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>mods land on console later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll only be able to mod&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S; the last-gen versions of the game won't be getting mod support. Additionally, only mods approved by CD Projekt Red will be accessible on consoles.</p>

<p>While CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-redkit-mod-editor-release-date" rel="nofollow">REDkit mod editor</a> isn't necessary for creating&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>mods on consoles, the developer does recommend that you use it if you want the "best chance" of your mod being approved.</p>

<p>Additionally, if your mods use scripts, you will need to use REDkit, so it's probably worth downloading it and getting to grips with it now if you're planning to put anything together for PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>It's also not possible to create mods for the game directly on the consoles themselves. You'll need to make the mods on PC, even if you're intending for them to be used specifically on consoles.</p>




<p><em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, but the series isn't stopping there, of course; back in December last year, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, although it's likely to be some time before we get more info about it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio revealed earlier this week that pre-production on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sequel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">has officially begun</a>. Again, though, expect to wait quite a while before an official announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-declares-victory-the-battle-of-super-earth-is-won-what-next-for-the-illuminate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2’s ongoing Galactic War appears to have reached another turning point, with the Federation declaring victory over the Illuminate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Illuminate have retreated from Super Earth battlespace,” reads the in-universe message to the game’s community. “The Heart of Democracy has been defended. The Battle of Super Earth is won.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate’s invasion certainly took its toll on Super Earth, with only two Mega Cities left standing: Prosperity City and Equality-on-Sea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remaining Illuminate forces were last observed making FTL jumps from Super Earth orbit,” the message continues. “The enemy has also vacated New Haven, Pilen V, and Widow's Harbor, burning the surface of those planets as they fled. No stations detect Illuminate forces — the enemy has gone into hiding. They will be found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After days of nonstop fighting, Super Earth stands. The mettle of Managed Democracy has been tested; the will of the people has overcome the enemy. The Helldivers have achieved victory.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, no-one actually believes the Helldivers have achieved a long-lasting victory here. As is developer Arrowhead’s way, Federation communication is by default propaganda, and further turmoil is almost certainly coming down the pipe. And players really want to chase the Illuminate as they retreat, potentially to their home planet to stamp them out for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, an in-game message revealed the President of Super Earth was killed while fighting back the Illuminate forces. But again, there was a healthy dose of scepticism from players, with some saying it might have been an Illuminate communication in disguise. What’s really going on here?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Helldivers 2 suffered a controversy this week surrounding the invasion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-gets-review-bombed-again-this-time-over-its-big-battle-for-super-earth">leading to a fresh flood of negative reviews</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the days since the Heart of Democracy update went live, players have fought to hold the various Mega Cities of Super Earth, which correspond to major cities in real-life. York Supreme, for example, corresponds roughly to New York, and Remembrance to Buenos Aires. As the invasion continued, more and more cities fell, leaving only Equality-On-Sea (Shanghai) and Super Earth's capital, Prosperity City (Stockholm) standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Efforts rallied behind Equality-On-Sea to make a last stand. But Equality-On-Sea never hit 100%; the current arc closed with the cities' percentage meter at 99.9783%. Many of the negative reviews are in Chinese, and while the machine translation doesn't seem accurate enough to quote, there are some recurring points one can easily glean: frustration over driving the narrative, the perception of a thumb on the scale from Arrowhead, and repeat mentions of "99.9783%."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s next? Well, for a start, the Federation needs a new president. Let’s see what Game Master Joel has up his sleeve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-toughest-challenge-so-far-finding-friends-to-play-with<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s early days for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, but already players have run up against their toughest challenge so far. No, it's not a classic FromSoftware boss, it’s the struggle to find friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign drops players into the shifting lands of Limveld, exploring and fighting for survival either solo or in groups of three. There is no way to play two-player co-op. We’ve already reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-massive-steam-launch-tarnished-by-mixed-user-reviews-over-lack-of-duos-co-op-voice-chat">Elden Ring Nightreign’s ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating</a>, with most of the complaints revolving around a lack of a duos option as well as no voice chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo is proving to be a particularly difficult experience. As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, solo players are faced with matchmaking with random players, which itself is presenting problems because of a lack of coordination required to defeat Elden Ring Nightreign’s bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, players are turning to the Elden Ring community for help. The Elden Ring subreddit, for example, is packed with requests from duos looking for a third player (yes, the community is having fun with this situation).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s like a zero % chance I’d find one other person to play with much less two,” said redditor trickponies. “Is the game even worth it solo?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are pointing out that Elden Ring Nightreign does have matchmaking, so you can play trios if you do not have friends to play with. But, as others have countered, playing this game with randoms isn’t always the best experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have seen too many videos on this sub to trust randoms with anything more than the newspaper,” said one player. “I love you all. But from a distance. My blood pressure can only take so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are turning to Discords and other online platforms as they hunt for like-minded fans to team up with. Elden Ring Nightreign hasn’t even been out 24 hours, but this is proving to be a big hurdle for the community as they work their way through the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Nightreign solo cuz my friends have a 9 to 5 and I'm unemployed <a href="https://t.co/t47UrYoDSv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t47UrYoDSv</a></p>— Raph (@RaphDeee) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaphDeee/status/1928074268279026068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some Elden Ring fans are even saying they won’t buy the game because they don’t have any friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, as disappointing as it is, Imma have to pass on this game, purely because I don't have any friends to play it with and I can't play solo,” said Twinkie454.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are calling on FromSoftware to rebalance the solo experience so it’s more manageable. “We'll see what FromSoft does to re-balance it, so maybe have some patience,” one person said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, as you’d expect, some fans are offering to help others out. “.... Did we just become best friends?!” said one Elden Ring player. “Get the game bestie, I'll see you tomorrow when I get off work!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these issues, Elden Ring Nightreign has enjoyed a massive launch on Steam, with an incredible 313,593 peak concurrent users on Steam overnight. That was enough to make Elden Ring Nightreign one of the most-played games on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like FromSoftware may add a duos option at some point in the future. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first"><u>IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</u></a>, the Nightreign lead developer discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options. When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Nightreign tips and tricks</a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides">all the eight Nightlord Bosses</a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes">Nightfarer Classes</a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant">How to Unlock the Revenant</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess">How to Unlock the Duchess</a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters">How to Change Characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Grace was reportedly credited as outsourcing and co-dev lead, although it's unclear if she has personally donated this plaque, or if it was somehow lost and donated when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown"><u>PlayStation shut down developer Firewalk Studios towards the end of last year</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord, a live service hero shooter from Sony-owned Firewalk Studios, has gone down as one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony pulled Concord offline just two weeks after launch. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>only sold around 25,000 copies</u></a>. At the time, we awarded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review"><u>Concord a 7 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Concord isn’t the most innovative or content-heavy hero shooter you could play, but with such fantastic competitive gameplay, 16 compelling characters to master, and 12 well-designed maps, it’s got the makings of something that could go the distance in the months and years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're thinking a plaque like this could be worth something for collectors and fans alike, you're not wrong. So far, it's attracted dozens of bids and is, at the time of writing, <a href="https://shopgoodwill.com/item/231642470" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sitting on an asking price of $3,002</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/concord-devs-commemorative-plaque-hits-auction-the-price-is-already-soaring-3206903/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>). The money will go to <a href="https://shopgoodwill.com/home" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Goodwill</u></a>, which helps people improve their lives by assisting them to find jobs and grow their careers. So far, it's served more than 25 million people.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/5a57ee30-4b46-4705-aace-aab35d664e87icar-05271-1748605118765.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tim Miller, the chief creator of Amazon’s upcoming Prime Video animated anthology <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/secret-level"><u>Secret Level</u></a>, spoke out for the first time on Concord's closure last November, saying: "I honestly don’t understand why it didn’t work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million but sources familiar with the agreement say the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk itself. It's thought ProbablyMonsters — Firewalk's original parent company — raised $200 million in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

In the real world, however, they’ll be haunted by the dark entities that have latched on to this strange game, as they frantically try to unravel the mystery behind the game and its enigmatic creator.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Rebellion Developments has revealed the release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atomfall/" data-ref-id="5000-631970">Atomfall’s</a> Wicked Isle Expansion. Dropping June 3, this story-based DLC will send players to a new location called Midsummer Island. Once there, they’ll have to contend with new enemy factions--including infected druids who use severed heads like lanterns--strange fauna, and more while exploring story threads that could lead to alternate endings for the main game.</p><p>Midsummer Island will seemingly be a tough place to explore thanks to its close proximity to the Windscale Nuclear Plant; the level of infection is higher there than Atomfall’s other environments. Thankfully, fans won’t be thrown to the radioactive wolves without some form of help. New weapons like the Blunderbuss shotgun will be available on the island. There will also be new skills to unlock, items to craft, and an upgraded metal detector to find. Essentially, players should have enough tools to stave off death for a long as possible.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ene-2XTQUV8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ene-2XTQUV8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Atomfall has proven to be quite the survival game. Featuring an interesting mission structure, challenging combat, and unique RPG elements, it easily stands out amongst the genre’s best. That said, given the conclusive nature of its campaign, the Wicked Isle Expansion significantly increases the prospect of venturing back into its post-apocalyptic environments.</p><p>Fans who’ve purchased the Deluxe Edition of Atomfall will be able to do just that come June. Everyone else will be able to buy the expansion separately for $20 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC, with a 10% discount if subbed to Game Pass.</p>

		<p>Shin’en has released the launch trailer for their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive anti-gravity racing sequel, Fast Fusion. The game is a launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, coming out on 5th June alongside the new generation console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fast Fusion Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XB5Hf2HIroc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Shin’en’s Fast series has become a staple of Nintendo’s consoles, debuting on Wii in 2011 with Fast Racing League, before Fast Fusion Neo on Wii U, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/09/fast-rmx-review/">Fast RMX</a> remixed that game for the Switch’s launch, Fast Fusion is a brand new entry.</p>
<p>It looks to be a real technical showcase, with gorgeous, realistic looking environments and fast racing through them. The game will run at up to 4K and 60fps on the Switch 2, and support HDR as well. Heck, there’s even four-player local split-screen. The game will also adopt the GameShare and GameChat feature for two players to share one copy of the game for multiplayer, both locally and online.</p>
<p>The key trick for the game is that you can now fuse together vehicles, blending their visuals, stats and creating hundreds of possible combinations.</p>

<p>Looking back at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/09/fast-rmx-review/">Fast RMX</a> in 2017, I said, “Fast RMX is practically a must buy, but it’s a purist take on the genre and damn difficult without many, if any of the bells and whistles of other racers. That said, if you’re looking to scratch a certain F-Zero or Wipeout itch on Switch it’s absolutely worth a look.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will receive one more patch that will allow PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users to play the game with mods.</p>
<p>As part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10th anniversary celebrations</a> for the third entry in the series, CD Projekt Red confirmed today that the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S versions of the game will get another patch later this year that will introduce cross-platform mod support across all three versions of the game. With this, creating, sharing, and enjoying mods will be easier and more accessible than ever with a shared modding ecosystem.</p>
<p>With the announcement above, CD Projekt Red shared an FAQ on the official <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/es/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt website</a>, providing additional details on how cross-platform mod support will work. A mod.io account connected to a CD Projekt Red account will be needed to access cross-platform mod support, but modders won't be limited to using only mod.io, as mods shared via Nexus Mods and the Steam Workshop will continue to work with the game. Console players, on the other hand, will only be able to access mods via mod.io. In addition, not every mod released for the PC version of the game will be available on consoles, although even those created without using the official REDkit modding tools have the chance of being released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S if they follow Fan Content Guidelines and CD Projekt Red User Agreement.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Cross-platform mod support will be available later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>People love to categorize games. It used to be pretty easy. You had your platformers, shooters, sports games, and RPGs. Then we started saying things like "metroidvania." Fast-forward to today, and burgeoning genres and new ideas led to phrases like "deckbuilder roguelite," "strand game," and "soulslike." These labels are useful to get a quick idea of what a game is, but it gets complicated when you're confronted with something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538">Hell is Us</a>. I played three hours of Rogue Factor's upcoming title at a recent press event in Montreal, and I walked away thinking it defies easy categorization.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the early 1990s in the fictionalized hermit nation of Hadea, players assume the role of Remi. He was born in Hadea and re-enters the country after years abroad in an effort to learn about his past and find his parents. It seems like he could have picked a better time to do this, as Hadea is currently being torn apart by both a civil war and a phenomenon called the Calamity, which has resulted in the appearance of otherworldly, violent creatures.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hell is Us | Investigation Gameplay Walkthrough</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As Remi, players will quickly acquire tidbits of information that start to flesh out the story of what happened to his hometown and family. Conversations with NPCs frequently offer up relevant information that is tracked in Remi's datapad. The "investigation" tab of your datapad starts out very basic, with only a few broad threads to follow. Before long, those threads branch out until the investigation tab is a web of leads and mysteries. For players who love piecing together disparate events until a mystery becomes clearer, the early hours of Hell is Us should be very enticing.</p><p dir="ltr">Each player's path to uncovering this information should be unique. Rogue Factor is steadfast in its mission to not hold the player's hand throughout this journey. There is no map, no quest log, no objective marker, and very little in the way of a HUD. At most, you might get some diegetic hints like markings on trees or wind chimes in a forest to affirm that you're on the right path. On occasion, you might find something like a hand-drawn map that you can equip just like a health item for easy access.</p><p dir="ltr">I was playing the Oblivion remake on my flight out to Montreal. Between my quest log, the Clairvoyance spell, and an abundance of objective markers, I couldn't have gotten lost even if I had wanted to. Going straight from that to Hell is Us gave me whiplash. I wasn't necessarily getting lost in Hell is Us, but discovering the next step in my journey felt solely up to my own deduction rather than looking at a red triangle or compass marker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4499940-hiu_presstour_2025_screenshot_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499940" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4499940-hiu_presstour_2025_screenshot_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499940"></a><figcaption>The enemy design leans into unnerving aesthetics.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4499940-hiu_presstour_2025_screenshot_19.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's hard to think of many games that are as confident as Hell is Us in the player's ability to progress. Red Dead Redemption II could be customized to remove HUD elements so that the player had to rely on in-world markers and NPC shoutouts to guide them on their way, but playing like that depended on the player deliberately tweaking numerous options (and you could still fall back on your quest log). Hell is Us does not give players a choice. You are going to find your own way through the game or you will not make progress.</p><p dir="ltr">Plenty of games don't hold the player's hand by default, though they typically still allow you to change some options to make their journey easier. After I dug through the menu of Hell is Us, I saw no such option for navigation and progression, but there are numerous tweaks you can make to the combat difficulty. You can alter enemy aggression, enemy damage, enemy health, and even the penalty upon death--if you find yourself dying a lot in combat, you can make your life a bit easier. It doesn't seem like Hell is Us offers that same mercy when it comes to overall progression, however. Rogue Factor seems to want to leave that part of the game as challenging as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat feels deliberate but not quite at the difficulty level of something like a From Software title. The enemies I faced were largely variations of Hollow Walkers. These are white, humanoid, faceless monstrosities that frequently eject formless energy clusters from their bodies. It's hard to explain, but their look and movement is fascinating and disturbing. Often, they're connected via an umbilical cord to these energy clusters, which you have to destroy before you can deal damage to the base form.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4499941-hiu_presstour_2025_screenshot_14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499941" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4499941-hiu_presstour_2025_screenshot_14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499941"></a><figcaption>You'll meet plenty of faces.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4499941-hiu_presstour_2025_screenshot_14.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Your options in combat are fairly simple at the outset. There's a standard attack and a heavy attack, the latter of which you have to charge up, and a drone can be deployed to distract enemies, which is especially helpful when facing groups. None of this is particularly unique among third person action games, but at one point during my session, I was instructed to load a save from later in the game and saw widely expanded options for combat. Each weapon levels up independently as you use it and I discovered several in my relatively short time with the game. I have no doubt that Hell is Us will allow players to approach combat in a way that's tailored to their style.</p><p dir="ltr">One of my favorite elements of the game is essentially "active reload" but for restoring health. As you land successive hits on enemies, you'll see floating particles form around Remi. With a well-timed press of a button, these particle clusters will restore health. An element of risk/reward is present because if you allow more particles to form by continuing to attack, you'll recover a larger chunk of health, but if you take damage or miss the window of opportunity, they disappear and you recover nothing. It's a great system and adds a fun layer to the usual attack/parry/dodge formula.</p><p dir="ltr">After three hours with Hell is Us, I'm certainly more intrigued than I was coming in. It's a unique game in ways that can't be easily communicated via a short State of Play trailer. I feel like it's bound to be polarizing. Some players will thrive on the level of player agency Hell is Us offers, while others will butt their heads against it and quit in frustration. I'm leaning toward the former--this is a game filled with bold, confident, deliberate design decisions on the part of Rogue Factor, and it'll be interesting to see how players react when it releases September 4.</p>

			<p>Watching Rogue Factor’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-is-us">Hell Is Us</a> in action is like video game clickbait. At first glance it’s a dark and depressing modern war story, but suddenly there are white art-deco style creatures rising from the ground, huge balls of spinning time, and melee combat rather than guns. It invites investigation and that is a key element to the game, as there are no way points or quest markers; you need to use your instincts to work you way across the landscape and find out what exactly what is happening.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Is Us - Official Gameplay Trailer | State of Play 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMcqTSPjEak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set in the fictional country of Hadea you play as Rémi, a native Hadean who moved out of the country when he was very young, leaving his family behind. Now a member of a United Nations-style peacekeeping force, he returns to his war ravaged home country in the 1990s and promptly goes AWOL so he can search for his parents. He is very much on his own, wandering through the country trying to piece together three overlapping stories: What happened to his family, what happened in the war, and what is the ‘Calamity’, the event that has caused the supernatural creatures to appear.</p>


<p>These creatures take strange humanoid forms that will attack you if you get to close, but they can have more dangerous forms. Get too close to one and a ball of glitching mass will spew from the creature and attack you as a secondary drone which needs to be defeated before trying to kill the creature itself. These extra nodes are colour-coded to specific emotions – red for rage, green for terror, yellow for ecstasy and blue for grief – with each emotion having a specific attack style.</p>


<p>While the game may look like an open-world Soulslike, it isn’t. Or at least, it’s not totally. Combat uses melee weapons made of a special Lymbic material as conventional firearms cannot harm the creatures. So you’ve got to resort to the swords, axes, poleaxes and other low-tech weapons that are available, each with their own strengths and weakness. You will need to use the block and dodge button effectively, running in and hacking away will lead to certain death, but chaining hits will gradually increase the damage from some weapons. You also have a stamina and health bar, attacking and dodging will use stamina which will eventually recover, but health does not and death will send you all the way back to your last save point.</p>
<p>You also have a drone, KAPI, and you might be thinking that would be used for extra firepower, and you’d be right, but not in the way you would expect. As conventional weapons do not hurt the enemies it would be pointless giving KAPI a gun, so it instead attaches itself to Rémi to power him up for special moves, such as a whirlwind of blades or an extra strong forward stab.</p>
<p>Now, I am not the biggest fan of Soulslike combat, but after unlocking a few special moves and power ups I really began to enjoy the core fighting loop, chaining together attacks and special moves soon becoming second nature. The development team are keen to stress that this game isn’t a hardcore battler like Elden Ring, and is maybe more of a “Souls-lite”. Think of a middle ground between modern <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/">God of War</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/03/30/bloodborne-review/">Bloodborne</a> and you’d be close; you can still do hacking and slashing, but carefully.</p>

<p>For my hands-on preview I played a large open world section near the start of the game and, after walking past a disturbing pile of corpses and a crying woman, a large marshland area was revealed with plenty of landmarks spread across it that invited investigation. The main task is to discover what happened to your father, the blacksmith in the village, but there are many other characters to talk to and pick up information and side quests. It’s worth talking to everyone you can as they may just reveal a small detail that sends you in a completely new direction, although many of them are wary of strangers. You also may also need to return to characters as moving the story forward will unlock new dialogue options.</p>
<p>Rémi’s village, Jova, is occupied by one of the forces in the civil war, so he must be careful with what he says and who he talks to. Suffice to say, Dad is no longer there and you are given directions as where he might have gone. I decided to ignore the main quest and have a wander around the rest of the map, uncovering more information on the war, the Calamity and an Abbey which I could not access due to soldiers barring the way. A little more wandering and an audio clue led me to a new character, who in turn unlocked the trainee blacksmith back at the village, who had more news on good old Dad and also allowed me to upgrade my weapons.</p>
<p>While there are no quest markers to direct you, you do have a handy digital device that keeps track of who you met and what they want, along with any significant details that will help you find what you are looking for.&nbsp; You can also access your inventory here and assign weapons and consumables and read any documents you have discovered. From the four hours I have played it does seem the world is packed with things to do and discover and you may want to have a notepad by your side to remind you of everything you are investigating.</p>

<p>I also played a section from later in the game, a water-filled dungeon packed full of enemies and contraptions. You have to unlock mechanisms that drain out the water, gradually revealing more and more of the dungeon. This section felt a little more guided as, while there are no clues what to do or where to go, your options are limited by locked doors or pools of water, and the obvious destination would usually have a key or mechanism for unlocking the next part of the dungeon. Oh, and there’s the obligatory boss battle at the end.</p>
<p>I think the most alluring part of Hell Is Us is the unknown.&nbsp; It has the feel of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-ps4-pro/">Death Stranding</a> where clearly something very odd is going on, but you have no idea what. Clearly there’s a link to the war and the creatures powered by emotions, but what has your family got to do with it? I have no idea how the story will unfold but Creative Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête has said “The central theme of Hell is Us is that human violence is a perpetual cycle fuelled by human emotions and passions.”</p>

<p>I really enjoyed playing Hell Is Us, and from my hands-on time it could turn out to be something very special. I can’t wait for the final game, set to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/hell-is-us-release-date-confirmed-for-september/">release on September 4th, 2025</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><em>Hell is Us will also be part of the June Steam Next Fest and the game’s demo (with about 1.5 hours of play time) will be live ahead of time, from Monday, 2nd June at 3 PM BST / 4 PM CEST.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-the-most-overpowered-character-to-use-to-beat-most-bosses-easily-even-solo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unlike base Elden Ring, where the differences between classes are minimal in the long run, the eight Nightfarers available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> are quite different from one another, coming with some unique skills and traits that make them better suited for certain playstyles.</p>
<p>While every Nightfarer is more than viable to defeat the powerful Nightlords awaiting them at the end of each run, one of them has some clear advantages over the others, so much so that a team of three of the same one can make very short work of most Nightlords, even if the random generation of upgrades hasn't worked in the players' favor the previous two days. This Nightfarer is <strong>Ironeye</strong>.</p>
<p>On paper, a ranged fighter like Ironeye doesn't inspire much confidence, but the mechanics that made ranged-exclusive playstyles more limited in the original Elden Ring and every other entry in the Souls series are gone in Elden Ring Nightreign. Bows and crossbows have <strong>infinite ammo</strong>, allowing their wielders to spam long-range attacks as long as they have stamina. And in a game where you are constantly swarmed by a great number of enemies, this is extremely beneficial, as it gives you the chance to better control crowds while staying out of danger.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250528130002_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The above, however, isn't the only reason why Ironeye is so good in Elden Ring Nightreign at launch that he can take on Nightlords even solo and win. His Character Skill and Ultimate Art, <strong>Marking</strong> and <strong>Single Shot</strong>, are among the best in the entire game. The first is a quick lunging slash with plenty of invincibility frames that marks hit enemies, exposing their weak points. Once the weak points have been destroyed, the enemy will be staggered and open to a critical hit. The second is a powerful arrow that hits in a wide radius, knocks the vast majority of enemies down, even some bosses, and can bring back to life downed companions in a single hit, all the while making Ironeye invincible for the entire duration of the attack. Both abilities can be used both offensively and defensively to get out of a sticky situation and deal tons of damage, and the very quick cooldown of Marking allows Ironeye to see it very often.</p>
<p>Ironeye's weapon of choice, the bow, also works great in conjunction with ailments like <strong>poison, frostbite, and scarlet rot</strong>, which are extremely powerful in Elden Ring Nightreign as much as they were in the base Elden Ring at launch. A bow with the <strong>Barrage</strong> skill and the ability to inflict status ailments is invaluable, as you can inflict the affliction much more quickly using the skill. Even when using a weapon with no elemental or affliction property, Barrage works great with the Marking skill and builds that improve critical hits. To increase your chances of being able to use this strategy, pinpoint locations on the map showing the status alterations icon and defeat the bosses there. These locations have a higher chance of weapons with the related affinity being offered as rewards.</p>
<p>At the beginning of your adventure in Limveld, Ironeye may not be an enticing choice over other Nightfarers, but give him a chance, and you will be surprised by how good he is. Parties of multiple Ironeyes can destroy most bosses, while solo, he will allow you to enjoy the game more, as he has an easier time dealing with the gameplay elements that make solo play very challenging to the point of frustration. During the review period, I played solo rather often, and my only successful runs were with Ironeye. Not only did I almost always get the final day to fight the Nightlord, but I also managed to defeat Gladius and Maris without the help of any player, while also getting very close to defeating a few of the other Nightlords. It's still no walk in the park, to be sure, but considering the high challenge level and how much melee characters struggle in a lot of different situations, Ironeye does make Elden Ring Nightreign a little more manageable, no matter the situation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hell-is-us-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hatred paves a fierce and ugly path to some of the worst humanity has to offer. It's in many games to justify violence, aggression, and prejudice, though few explore it in a visceral, gut-wrenching way that holds a mirror up to our souls. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> did it (especially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow">with its recently finished season 2</a>), and now, I have a feeling <em>Hell Is Us</em> will be the next one to do it with similar depth.</p>

<p><em>Hell Is Us</em>, Rogue Factor's first original IP, balances weighty melee combat with cerebral investigatory gameplay reminiscent of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-wilds-review-groundhog-universe" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Wilds</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/15-years-later-legacy-deus-ex" rel="nofollow"><em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em></a>. It's a labor of love for the small but mighty team of 50 or so developers, and a lot of it comes from the passionate vision of Creative Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête.</p>

<p>I spent some time on site at the studio in Montreal to see the game and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/interview-how-hell-is-us-shows-true-horrors-of-violence-and-war" rel="nofollow">chat with him about the game's themes</a>. After spending two hours hands-on with <em>Hell Is Us</em>, I found myself hooked by the mysteries of its world and eager to investigate further.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hel-lis-us-remi.jpg?itok=mtJ4E1PZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hel-lis-us-remi.jpg?itok=5yBk2FPQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Reward of Player-Driven Exploration</h2>

<p>In <em>Hell Is Us</em>, you play as Rémi, a soldier in search of his parents whom he hasn't seen since he was 5 years old. He joins the Organized Nations (you know, the totally-not-UN) to become a Peacekeeper and then goes AWOL to sneak into Hadea, his home country. Why sneak in? Well, it's a locked-down country, much like North Korea. Even worse, it's in the midst of an ugly, brutal civil war.</p>

<p>The story setup starts in media res, with Rémi being interrogated by a surreal, unsettling man. He's forced to recount how and why he entered Hadea, which then puts you right into the gameplay, at the beginning of his journey via his recollection.</p>

<p>As you explore the countryside, you'll pick up clues and talk to NPCs, both vital to Rémi's goal of finding his parents. His data pad contains his quest log, though it's not as straightforward as you might expect from other games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-captain-vaas-chat.jpg?itok=shgyczBt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-captain-vaas-chat.jpg?itok=wXIRfs6K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every conversation uncovers new information for Rémi to explore.</figcaption></figure><p>A big part of the philosophy behind <em>Hell Is Us</em> is something that Jacques-Belletête calls "player plattering," an inversion of "silver plattering." To him, signposts like quest markers and minimaps tend to deliver objectives to the player on a silver platter. It's a false form of discovery; did the player <em>really </em>discover that cave if a magical overhead map and quest marker told them it was there?</p>

<p>Instead, <em>Hell Is Us</em> harkens back to a more old-school philosophy that requires players to do a bit more digging into the world, all while making it feel more lived in. As an example, early in the game, an NPC will tell Rémi to find a vehicle that's in a forest. The entrance to the forest is to the north, but then you have to follow windchimes to get to the other side—the very same chimes his kids followed to return home, back when they were alive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-investigation-web.jpg?itok=wqAGT_0h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-investigation-web.jpg?itok=JXP6xLfv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jova is the first major village players will explore in&nbsp;<em>Hell Is Us</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Already, the focus is on the details of the world and its characters, rather than an objective marker that tells you where to go. How this manifests in the data pad is similar to games like <em>The Outer Wilds</em>, where the clues are laid out in a web. It's up to you to figure out where your objectives are and how you'll get there, hence the phrase "player plattering."</p>

<p>Exploring the world is also gate checked by puzzles in the environment, though I didn't see any that were too complex. For example, match three glyphs to open a door, or discover a secret code hidden in nearby pictures.</p>

<p>This player-driven exploration creates a sense of satisfaction that I intrinsically felt whenever I chased down a lead, and it's a satisfaction that felt better than getting 100 gold for turning in some fetch quest. Fans of the recent indie breakout hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> probably know exactly what I'm talking about here--though so far <em>Hell Is Us </em>isn't nearly as complicated.</p>

<h2>Hadea Is a Land of Dark Curiosities</h2>

<p>There's more to investigate besides Rémi's personal connection to Hadea, of course. The country is a character unto itself, with many layers hiding within. The civil war between the Sabinians and Palomists paints the soil red with blood, and there are seemingly endless letters, diary entries, audio logs, and military orders that paint a full picture of hate, horror, and hubris.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-mural.jpg?itok=IzZv0Uu1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-mural.jpg?itok=ex-P7mWI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some murals in dungeons give you hints, others give you lore. Sometimes, it's both.</figcaption></figure><p>The first major Palomist town I came across was recently occupied by Sabinians, who ruthlessly killed every "devil" they could find. A mass grave sits just outside of town, while notes and other moments of environmental storytelling show just how terrified the Palomists were—and how vindictive the Sabinians are.</p>

<p>That's juxtaposed by a large tree just outside of town, where Sabinians were hanged and left to rot. Graffiti in town mocked it as a "family tree," laying out the stomach-churning tit-for-tat that's plagued Hadea. In fact, the area beforehand is laden with Palomist religious text that literally demonizes the Sabinians for believing in a false god.</p>

<p>Clearly, <em>Hell Is Us</em> paints an ugly picture of both sides of this civil war. I don't get a centrist "both sides" argument from it, though; instead, this clearly illustrates how we have a tendency to "other" certain groups, demonizing them until they aren't considered human anymore. The wider the gap gets, the more likely violence is to break out. We see it in real life, like with the Hutus and Tutsis, or North and South Korea, or... well, I'm sure you can come up with another example.</p>

<p>I saw the results of this in-game barbarism in the survivors of the conflict. A husband grieved for his lost children, who only wished for a possession of theirs so he could have a proper Palomist burial. A tooltip came up, hinting at a potential side quest there. I assume I could find one of their possessions and give it to him, which is a powerful way to turn a random fetch quest into something more meaningful to the world and its lore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-graves.jpg?itok=PDr4AXNB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-graves.jpg?itok=8XgX7zTD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's no shortage of human suffering and gravesites in Hadea.</figcaption></figure><p>This is all before we even get into the Hollow Walkers. Yeah, those horrific humanoid monsters with holes in them, that you saw in the trailer? According to Jacques-Belletête, they're like the manifestation of the hate and suffering that plagues Hadea. The country was hit with something called the Calamity, which is likely the supernatural cause behind these Hollow Walkers.</p>

<p>That mystery is just another thread to tug at in <em>Hell Is Us</em>. All this is to say, naturally curious minds will find a lot to sink their teeth into here. Sure, the main mystery about Rémi's parents is interesting, too, but for me, I'm curious to see what Rogue Factor has to say about human nature as a whole. It's only made even better that the player-driven gameplay neatly complements that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-hollow-walker-2.jpg?itok=wVZkJP9K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-hollow-walker-2.jpg?itok=RiVDj-S6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hollow Walkers aren't exactly the friendliest looking creatures.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hacking and Slashing Through Hadea</h2>

<p>While the war rages between Sabinians and Palomists, Rémi doesn't directly fight either side. Instead, he fights against Hollow Walkers using specially treated weapons and his trusty drone sidekick. He can equip weapons like swords, greatswords, and twin axes, and it's your standard light and heavy attack system.</p>

<p>Holding down either trigger gives Rémi access to four special active abilities each. One set is based on his weapon, while the other set is for his drone. He can dodge, block, and parry, too, and breaking an enemy's stance leaves them open to a big special attack.</p>

<p>All of this should sound pretty familiar if you've played third-person melee action games, and <em>Hell Is Us</em> feels mostly serviceable. The standard difficulty did feel more punishing than expected, especially for a game that is supposedly not a soulslike. However, that's something that the studio is still finessing ahead of the game's release.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-combat-2.jpg?itok=uJG_guW4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-combat-2.jpg?itok=f1CeFfPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Regardless, fighting Hollow Walkers proved to be a little tricky. Parry windows are really tight, and the way enemies move is so erratic that it's hard to pin down exact strikes. Arguably, that's part of the point though; these creatures, despite being vaguely humanoid, are obviously anything but. It's what makes them so unsettling.</p>

<p>To add some complexity, some Hollow Walkers come with what's called a Haze, which are brightly colored, highly geometric shapes that are attached to the Walkers. You have to neutralize the Haze to make the Walker vulnerable, so you'll be fighting two enemies at once.</p>

<p>That's where abilities come in handy. The drone can distract a Walker for a certain time frame, and it can also make Rémi spin around with his weapon stretched out to damage a wide area.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-haze-1.jpg?itok=3lGdmqG4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-haze-1.jpg?itok=DC4I4-j7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Perhaps my favorite part of the combat, however, is something called the Lymbic Pulse. Every time you land a hit, some energy circles around you. When it flashes white, pressing R1 lets you absorb the energy and restore endurance (aka health). The longer the combo, the more the pulse will restore.</p>

<p>It creates a nice risk-reward system that reminded me a bit of <em>Bloodborne</em>. However, I also found that most enemies, even the basics, would nearly always attack me through any combo. I could reliably do a two-hit tap maybe 80% of the time, but anything beyond that felt like too much risk, not enough reward.</p>

<p>Overall, though, I see a lot of potential in the combat in <em>Hell Is Us</em>. What I played isn't quite where Jacques-Belletête wants it either, but I have faith that he and the team at Rogue Factor can get it to a place that's satisfying most of the time instead of some of the time.</p>



<h2><em>Hell Is Us</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Hell Is Us</em> is one of those game titles that feels a bit aggressively edgy, but it's an apt, concise description of the game's main themes. Hell is the human experience when you look at it through the lens of our constant proclivities toward violence and othering over the course of human history.</p>

<p>So far, I'm intrigued with what Rogue Factor is trying to say with this game, though whether the whole story will land is yet to be seen. And the combat, which has potential, has yet to really fully impress me. Nonetheless, <em>Hell Is Us</em> is a story I want to keep an eye on and explore every lead I can find.</p>

<p>If you're curious to try <em>Hell Is Us</em> for yourself, a demo will hit Steam next Monday ahead of Steam Next Fest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/interview-how-hell-is-us-shows-true-horrors-of-violence-and-war<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Hell Is Us</em>, an information web connects all your evidence, leads, and clues, replacing the classic quest log so you can find things using your own deduction skills. It immediately reminded me of the information log in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-wilds-review-groundhog-universe" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Wilds</em></a>.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, Rogue Factor Creative Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête had no idea until after development of <em>Hell Is Us</em> was already in full swing.</p>

<p>"I played [<em>Outer Wilds</em>] for quite a few hours and I had figured out a few things, and I hadn't at all seen that," he said with a laugh. "It's literally last year that I said, 'Let's go back to it,' and I was like, 'Oh f***, they have this wall of clues interconnected.'"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-old-man-npc.jpg?itok=KGaSeA1v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-old-man-npc.jpg?itok=_oNSE-FP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In&nbsp;<em>Hell Is Us</em>, you talk to NPCs like this character to round out your investigation.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hell Is Us</em> isn't the first time he's had this idea, either. Back when he was working on <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em>, the concept of an information web was already on his mind. As with many things in game development, though, some ideas can be lost for one reason or another.</p>

<p>"It's very common with designers. We have these things that we carry with ourselves for years and years and years, and then at one point is the right time to do it, you know?" he said. "It doesn't look it when you look at the system, but it's very complex to make. It's in terms of like how the interrelationships between the info and the updates and this and that."</p>

<p>Despite the lighthearted place where its core mechanic comes from, <em>Hell Is Us</em> is anything but lighthearted.</p>



<p>At its core, it's about a civil war between Palomists and Sabinians in the fictional country of Hadea, and the war has made it a no-go zone. As you explore, environmental storytelling shows how deep the hatred between them runs. The Palomists are religious by nature, so they paint the Sabinians as devils and heretics. On the flip side, Sabinians believe they know the country's true ruler, making the Palomists liars and cheats.</p>

<p>"They're the exact same people from the same stock," Jacques-Belletête said. "They have different religious beliefs, but it's also from the same religion. Think of the Protestants and the Catholics, right? And look at how much bloodshed has been from that.</p>

<p>"At the same time, the game is not about 'religion is bad' or 'religion is the cause of all suffering.' But it still had to be part of it, right? As you play the game more and you learn about all the history and where the hatred comes from, it's much more. It's really much more about what makes us decide that we're different."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-religious-leader.jpg?itok=G1OhZf8W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-religious-leader.jpg?itok=mjblSUO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Essentially, this conflict showcases the cycle of violence and human suffering. He compared it to other real-world conflicts, like the Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda or the Bosnian War. Maybe it's my American slant, but I also see early moments of this along the political divide here. The division isn't as violent, but the "us or them" rhetoric strongly resonates with what I see.</p>

<p>"[<em>Hell Is Us</em> is] thematically saying, even though we're the same, humanity tries to find a way. We always find a way. And it's all about grievances and it's about who's got the most scars," Jacques-Belletête said.</p>

<p>Because of how raw and real this message is, the team at Rogue Factor landed on a middle ground in terms of realism. <em>Hell Is Us</em> is set in a facsimile of reality, where real countries like Canada and fictional nations like Hadea coexist.</p>

<p>Even the Organized Nations is an overt reference to the United Nations. Rogue Factor reached out to the UN to get permission to use its colors and some iconography, like the stencil lettering. However, the actual name and logo were off the table.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-injured-soldier.jpg?itok=t7hevf3j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-injured-soldier.jpg?itok=PBObUcdk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"We're talking about this capacity that I truly believe we all have inside each human being. That with the right circumstances, the right context, everything, we can wake up one morning and decide that our neighbors should be eliminated," Jacques-Belletête said.</p>

<p>"History just proves it, you know? Maybe a few people are immune to it," he continued. "The structure of society is in big part to keep that beast in check, in a way, right? So when those structures fall is when people just bloody lose it. So that was important for me, that all this was as close to the real world as possible."</p>

<p>Of course, it'd be quite a statement to specifically use real-world groups to convey such a difficult, harsh message. Thus, it made sense to create Hadea, a made-up nation where the people suffering are fictional, yet their suffering echoes some of the worst moments of human history.</p>

<h2>Are the Hollow Walkers the Real Monsters?</h2>

<p>When it comes to how you interact with <em>Hell Is Us</em>, though, the player won't ever fight another human, despite all the hatred in the air. Instead, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hell-is-us-preview" rel="nofollow">all the combat is strictly against the Hollow Walkers</a>, the pale, unsettling, human-ish monsters that you see in the trailers. This was very important to Jacques-Belletête—despite the barbarism on display, he didn't want the player to contribute to the violence against other humans.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-marshes.jpg?itok=iTMSn7cx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-marshes.jpg?itok=xOOOxSIx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So Hollow Walkers were the answer to that. They roam the land, and some have colorful, geometric entities attached to the giant holes on their torso via an "umbilical cord," per Jacques-Belletête. These entities, called the Haze, represent intense human emotions, as expected from people amid a civil war.</p>

<p>Figuring out what an emotion looks like was one of the big design challenges for the team at Rogue Factor. The big creative leap, according to Jacques-Belletête, was how the Haze ends up attached to the Hollow Walkers.</p>

<p>"An emotion cannot walk by itself, right? You can project it around you to a certain perimeter, depending on how pissed you are," he said. "It has an area of effect. But technically, you can't send it anywhere else. It goes with you, right? The Haze cannot just move by itself. It's kind of like the analogy to how much we can project our emotions around us."</p>

<p>In a fight, the Haze will come out of the Hollow Walker, and you have to neutralize it first before you can defeat the Walker. Otherwise, the emotion stays inside; it comes out as a literal fight or flight response, which is a pretty on-the-nose metaphor.</p>

<p>"Just like you, you decide how much you keep your emotions inside and how much you project them. So it's all these things that you think about that, and then it informs your designs and it informs your gameplay," Jacques-Belletête said. "I think that's how things should be created."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-haze-2.jpg?itok=zgyjh5aD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-haze-2.jpg?itok=yB-D8YgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>How Hollow Walkers are... made? born? manifested? is still a mystery that awaits us in <em>Hell Is Us</em>. The inspiration behind their designs, though, comes a bit from the horror genre, as you might expect. However, they've become less horrific across different design ideations, primarily because of how action-oriented the game is.</p>

<p>"<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/why-there-should-never-be-bloodborne-remake" rel="nofollow">Bloodborne</a> </em>is super— the themes are horror, the monster design are horrors, but I wasn't scared playing the game. I'm sure you weren't, but it's horror," Jacques-Belletête said. "But It's not like playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/silent-hill-4-room-interesting" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill 4: The Room</em></a> where you're literally s***ting your pants, you know what I mean?"</p>

<h2>On the Industry at Wide</h2>

<p>Speaking of s***ting your pants, while I had him, I wanted to know how Jacques-Belletête felt about the industry at large, considering we're amid an endless barrage of layoffs and turmoil. Obviously, Rogue Factor has weathered the storm so far, but I wanted to know his thoughts on everything that has happened in recent years.</p>

<p>For him and studio co-founder Yves Bordeleau, part of their vision is remaining a "small-ish," tight-knit team of experts that doesn't need $200-something million dollars to make a game. At the time of the interview in early May, the studio had roughly 50–55 people directly working on the game (not including business needs like human resources, finance, and so on).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-jova.jpg?itok=e4_Fso3b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-jova.jpg?itok=qD9D4Iak 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I got the sense that, with Montreal being a historic hub for huge studios like Ubisoft, WB Games, and Eidos-Montreal, the veterans at Rogue Factor have lots of experience with large companies. This commitment to a tighter ship felt like a direct response to that.</p>

<p>"You don't build on [success] to get to a company that has 500 people. Because usually, in Montreal it's like, 'Oh, we have success, we get bigger, we get bigger,'" Jacques-Belletête said. "Especially in this city, the minute a studio has success, it's like, 'Alright, three projects at the same time now, blah, blah, blah.'"</p>

<p>Instead, at Rogue Factor, the goal is to be good at what they do, develop new skills together as a team, and keep getting better at what they can do. <em>Hell Is Us</em> let their third-person melee action skills bloom, and it'll only get better as they develop new worlds.</p>

<p>"Here, if we have success, it just makes the foundation stronger, and we build on it."</p>

They're not recruiting hundreds of new developers or expanding the budget to ridiculous levels. And of course, having a publisher like Nexon doesn't hurt for maintaining the bottom line, either.</p>

<p>"It's not to say that it hasn't been hard, it's not to say that we haven't had to regularly go like, 'Oh my god, how are we going to make sure that it's not going to happen to us' or this or that," he said. "And there's a bit of luck always there, but you kind of make your own luck as well."</p>

In a way, it's a mirror that reflects the worst parts of humanity, but it's in that ugliness that we're able to learn and, hopefully, be better.</p>

<p>Even though I only played a small slice of the game, I found myself wanting to learn more about it—how and why these people hate each other, what gruesome extents they've gone to against each other. It's these sorts of thoughts that Jacques-Belletête wants the player to explore after the game releases on Sept. 4.</p>

<p>"If it stays in your head, if you think about it driving to work, if you go to bed and you're thinking about your next session or what does it mean, or if you just think about the themes, that's what it's all about."</p>

            <p>There was a time when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> wasn't called Wild Hunt and CD Projekt Red was trying out various names for its new game - and we've just unearthed a couple we'd never heard before.</p>
<p>"I liked Northern Lights," Michal Platkow-Gilewski, vice president of communication and PR, told Eurogamer. "For a moment there was The Witcher 3: Northern Lights. It never made it into even a logo design but on the whiteboard, for a while, it was there."</p>
<p>There was also, he revealed, A Time of Axe and Sword, and he said that for a while, this name was going to be 'the one'. However, it's a bit of a mouthful to say.</p>
<p>"Yes!" Platkow-Gilewski said, speaking as part of an interview for a larger article looking back on 10 years of The Witcher 3, which we'll publish tomorrow. "That's why it died pretty fast. But I remember I created a doc with the final name and that was the final name, and with some colleagues we were betting how long it would last.</p>
<p>"It didn't last long," he added. "So we were toying with the name but the moment we found Wild Hunt..."</p>

<p>The moment the studio tried "Wild Hunt", the name fit. It not only directly referenced the titular threat of the Wild Hunt in the game - the phantasmal group of riders which relentlessly pursues Ciri - but it, regardless of whether you knew the lore or not, left a strong impression of what the game might be about.</p>
<p>That was a big concern for CD Projekt Red at the time: bringing new players in. Remember back in 2013, far fewer people knew about The Witcher games, the studio making them, or the The Witcher lore - those books written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The two released Witcher games only had a cumulative 5 million sales at that point, which is an order of magnitude less than the 60 million copies The Witcher 3 has now sold. There was no Netflix Witcher TV show, either.</p>
<p>That number 3 in the game's title was a potentially off-putting thing for a prospective audience, then. Would people who hadn't played the other two games feel like they needed to in order to enjoy this? It's for precisely this reason the game's logo changed mid-campaign, switching from displaying an actual number 3 to displaying three claw-like slash marks instead. "We decided, in the middle of the campaign, with all the questions of like, 'Should I play? Do I have to play?' that we should turn the three into these marks from Eredin's helmet in the centre of the logo," Platkow-Gilewski said.</p>
<p>Today, 10 years later, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the name in our heads. The question is, would a different name have had any effect on the legacy it left?</p>
<p>We also now look forward to a new Witcher game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">The Witcher 4, which is in full development although not likely to be released until after 2026</a>. The new game will star Ciri as its protagonist, moving her into a central role after being the co-protagonist, of sorts, in The Witcher 3. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">It's a decision that's met some resistance</a> but one the game's makers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-actor-celebrates-witcher-4-protagonist-ciri-following-woke-criticism">and people such as Geralt's English language voice actor Doug Cockle</a>, have openly and vocally stood behind.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/scar-lead-salvation-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Scar-Lead Salvation can be succinctly summed up as PS5 classic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/">Returnal</a> with an Anime aesthetic. It’s a third-person action-adventure roguelike, then, and one that sees its heroine battle through waves of robots to recover her memory and escape the mysterious factory she finds herself trapped within. Unfortunately, there’s also another way to describe Scar-Lead Salvation: a torrid, unfinished mess.</p>
<p><iframe title="Scar-Lead Salvation | Boss Trailer | PS4®, PS5®, Steam®" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtMmL3AOs9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Things start off promisingly enough. Your amnesiac avatar certainly looks cool, decked out in chunky armour and with that distinct anime visual style imbuing her with bucket loads of charm. She moves well too, smoothly darting around each enclosed area, blasting away with a multitude of weapons as she goes. In a neat touch, her armour is damaged and falls away as she’s injured, giving you a nice visual signifier of how close you are to death.</p>


<p>Initially, you’d be forgiven for thinking that there was nothing wrong with the game. Our hero shoots some bland looking robots, causing them to explode in a satisfactory manner. The floating big robo balls and giant can machines she faces spew out patterns of pulsing laser blasts, forcing the player to dodge and parry through the bullet hell. Once you are victorious you move on through an interconnecting corridor to a new room to do it all again.</p>
<p>Things become concerning when nothing changes. You face the same floating big robo balls and giant can machines again and again. Sure, a turret might get added, but you are ostensibly fighting the same handful of enemies, with boredom soon setting in. Worse, your foes are dumb as under-achieving bricks, mostly doing nothing until you attack. They don’t try to flank the player, pursue them, overwhelm them, or do anything interesting at all really, they just politely wait until you start shooting them.</p>


<p>Now, with most roguelikes, after clearing an area you get a choice of doors, usually with an indication of a certain type of enemy you’ll face or a specific reward you might earn for picking that path. Not so in Scar-Lead Salvation, as while there are always three doors leading out of every arena, two of them are inexplicably locked. I thought, at some point, as the game opens up, surely these doors will become accessible? Nope, this is a roguelike with a strictly linear path, leading to an incredibly tedious gameplay loop without a hint of self-determination. Worse, despite the basic visuals and bland environments, the game insists you run along a dull identical series of corridors to reach the next area, presumably to give it time to load up the encounter. As you careen along the next corridor, there’s some turgid banter between our protagonist and the AI voice that is guiding her. I wouldn’t bother trying to pay much attention; both characters are snarky, whiny, and deeply unlikeable.</p>
<p>The gameplay is so very boring. Partly because the game is insanely easy, outside of a scripted moment. I just didn’t die, which is kind of the whole point of a roguelike. But also, because every arena is the same grey shoe box shaped space with a slightly different configuration of walls, I became increasingly glassy-eyed, blasting away at more identical robo cans, but then I had an epiphany. The door out of the arena isn’t even locked.</p>
<p>That’s right, you don’t actually need to fight the enemies, you can just run straight through to the next corridor. Now, you’d be forgiven for thinking that would be a bad idea as, without killing enemies, how will you level up and receive powerful new abilities? Well, by collecting the new weapons and power ups in one of the reward rooms that pepper your journey – though, you don’t really need to bother choosing a new weapon, as the basic machine gun you get at the start is by far the best and will see you to the end.</p>

<p>In fact, so dull has the combat become, I elected to just run through each room, avoiding the robo cans and – in a new enemy type shocker – some drone thingies, until I reached the bosses. The bosses are rubbish too, there’s no tactics or strategy required, no attack patterns to overcome, just strafe and shoot for ten minutes and you’ll win. Shockingly, the frame rate drops at these points, resulting in lags and pauses that are just embarrassing considering the two or three polygons being thrown around on screen.</p>
<p>From the second boss onwards, the frame rate really gets choppy, even on PS5, but, fear not, because after a few hours or more of struggling through this drudgery, Scar-Lead Salvation comes to a welcome conclusion. And that’s the end of that.</p>
