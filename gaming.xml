So far, season two looks like a pretty faithful adaptation of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. But even in the short, two-minute teaser, it seems like HBO is taking a few creative liberties with the source material. So we figured we’d go shot by shot and break down the trailer, the ways it’s adapting the events of <em>Part II</em>, and try and suss out some of the new scenes that weren’t included in the game. Open up your music streaming service of choice, put on Pearl Jam’s “Future Days,” and read on.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-recommend-id="image://7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-recommend-id="image://7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As we saw in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-hbo-max-joel-ellie-abby-1851613343&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-hbo-max-joel-ellie-abby-1851613343">the first trailer</a></span>, it looks like Joel is going to therapy in season two. <em>Schitt’s Creek</em>’s Catherine O’Hara is playing Joel’s therapist, and we see her get a bit snippy with Pedro Pascal’s “sad dad.” She puts on a timer and asks if he “wants to start, or what?” I imagine Joel is not too thrilled at the idea of going to a therapist, and might be coming into these sessions rather guarded, so O’Hara’s character is likely unhappy with his dismissive attitude. </p><p>This scene does appear to be a kind of stand-in for the opening of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> in which Joel confesses to his brother Tommy that he murdered dozens of Firefly radicals who were planning to kill Ellie to create a vaccine for the cordyceps fungus ruining the world. Does doctor/patient confidentiality apply to something of that magnitude?<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-recommend-id="image://0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-recommend-id="image://0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Next we see a shot of Ellie walking through the snowy streets of Jackson, Wyoming. Joel and Ellie returned to this settlement after the events of the season finale. The small town is led by Joel’s sister-in-law Maria and sustains a decent population with good quality of life for the post-apocalypse. We also get a shot of Joel’s mailbox with “Miller” on the side of it. It’s all very idyllic. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-recommend-id="image://a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-recommend-id="image://a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of idyllic, Joel gifts Ellie an orange-brown sunburst acoustic guitar with a moth design on the fretboard. He did promise to teach her how to play, after all. The trailer plays Pearl Jam’s “Future Days” over the scene, but it’s unclear right now if that’s the song Joel will play for her when he gives her the guitar as he did in the game. <em>The Last of Us </em>show begins in 2003, rather than 2013 as the game did. So that song technically wouldn’t have been around then, as Pearl Jam released it in 2013. Ellie could learn a different song, or the show might just say “fuck it” and keep it in there anyway. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-recommend-id="image://5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-recommend-id="image://5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Whether she learns “Future Days” or something else, Ellie starts learning how to play guitar thanks to Joel.

In <em>Part II</em>, she plays an acoustic version of A-ha’s “Take On Me,” which sounds like an out-of-left-field pick, but it’s a very sweet moment between the two. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="193c335a83c26356f1ae9d0d22fb95d1" data-recommend-id="image://193c335a83c26356f1ae9d0d22fb95d1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel stops playing guitar as he sees Ellie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel stops playing guitar as he sees Ellie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="193c335a83c26356f1ae9d0d22fb95d1" data-recommend-id="image://193c335a83c26356f1ae9d0d22fb95d1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel stops playing guitar as he sees Ellie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just how much of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> the show plans to adapt in season two is unclear right now, as the plan is to break the game into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">multiple seasons</a></span>. Most of what we see in this trailer looks like scenes that would fit neatly in the first half, but there’s a moment that seems a bit out of place. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is structured around multiple flashbacks, and the final one is a conversation between Joel and Ellie on his back porch. There’s a scene in here that sure looks like the beginning of that one, in which Joel is playing his guitar and stops when he sees Ellie, though from a distance. If this scene is in season two, it could mean a lot for the thematic thrust of <em>Part II</em>’s story, but we’ll see if this is a fake out soon enough.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-recommend-id="image://88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-recommend-id="image://88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, we get our first look at Young Mazino as Jesse. We see him helping to build something in Jackson, which lines up with the good ol’ boy persona he has in the game— he’s known to help out and take responsibility for the people of the town. This scene didn’t appear in the game, however, so it looks like we’ll get more Jesse in the show.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d018243cb655e4b22703c2db2edea514" data-recommend-id="image://d018243cb655e4b22703c2db2edea514" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie puts down her switchblade in a sink." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie puts down her switchblade in a sink." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d018243cb655e4b22703c2db2edea514" data-recommend-id="image://d018243cb655e4b22703c2db2edea514" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie puts down her switchblade in a sink." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We don’t get context for this, but we do see what looks like Ellie washing her blood-stained switchblade in a sink. Ellie is likely going to do a lot of murder in this season, so I could not tell you whose blood that is.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a456656aefee4e1fc54d747ae0539437" data-recommend-id="image://a456656aefee4e1fc54d747ae0539437" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tommy looks out at something off the top of the border wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tommy looks out at something off the top of the border wall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a456656aefee4e1fc54d747ae0539437" data-recommend-id="image://a456656aefee4e1fc54d747ae0539437" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tommy looks out at something off the top of the border wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gabriel Luna’s Tommy is shown looking over the border wall protecting Jackson alongside several other armed civilians. We saw in the previous trailer that there would be an infected mob attacking the town at some point during season two, and this seems like that scene.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb6918fd606f2119d1bd83a661e9ac54" data-recommend-id="image://bb6918fd606f2119d1bd83a661e9ac54" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An infected sneaks up behind Ellie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An infected sneaks up behind Ellie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb6918fd606f2119d1bd83a661e9ac54" data-recommend-id="image://bb6918fd606f2119d1bd83a661e9ac54" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An infected sneaks up behind Ellie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of infected, we see one crawling slowly behind Ellie in a dilapidated building. The stealthy behavior implies this is a Stalker, one of the earlier stages of infection in <em>The Last of Us</em>’ universe. We don’t get a good look at its face, but we can see some of the fungus growing from its head.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="edf95c18dbfb9370b5948e5fe82af46f" data-recommend-id="image://edf95c18dbfb9370b5948e5fe82af46f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="edf95c18dbfb9370b5948e5fe82af46f" data-recommend-id="image://edf95c18dbfb9370b5948e5fe82af46f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kaitlyn Dever as Abby was briefly seen in the last trailer, but this is the best view we’ve gotten of the co-protagonist yet. We first see her kneeling over a makeshift grave then looking over her shoulder teary-eyed. Whose grave could that be? Why is she so sad? …Anyway, it’s unclear if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-casting-shannon-berry-muscles-1850237103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-casting-shannon-berry-muscles-1850237103">she’ll be as ripped as she is in the game</a></span>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="661aee9e89886b35c3da2adfd4675b99" data-recommend-id="image://661aee9e89886b35c3da2adfd4675b99" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An infected horde barrels toward Jackson." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An infected horde barrels toward Jackson." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="661aee9e89886b35c3da2adfd4675b99" data-recommend-id="image://661aee9e89886b35c3da2adfd4675b99" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An infected horde barrels toward Jackson." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We once again see a Jackson civilian standing on top of the border wall, but this time he’s looking through some binoculars at a massive crowd of infected coming straight for the town. Based on the cuts between this scene and the one featuring Abby crawling under a fence trying to avoid a group of infected, it seems like the creatures Abby faces at the beginning of the game have been spun off into a much larger threat for the show. One that reaches the Jackson borders, as well as those traveling on the outskirts of the town.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a8ec3ce74eba84316d730c89cc6ebe3b" data-recommend-id="image://a8ec3ce74eba84316d730c89cc6ebe3b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby is saved from an infected and rides off on horseback." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby is saved from an infected and rides off on horseback." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8ec3ce74eba84316d730c89cc6ebe3b" data-recommend-id="image://a8ec3ce74eba84316d730c89cc6ebe3b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby is saved from an infected and rides off on horseback." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Abby gets pinned down by an infected here, but is saved by someone who puts a revolver right to that sucker’s head. This is immediately followed by a shot of people traveling on horseback through the Jackson winter.

We get a good look at some of the Seraphites, a cult that lives in the Washington city where much of <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>takes place. The Sepharites are characterized in-game by the scars around their mouths and bulky trench coats, and they’ve got the same look in this trailer.

He began by explaining that part of the reason for the existence of the museum is for "not only our employees but also people who know about Nintendo, including three generations of parents and children, could come out to see the museum and understand what Nintendo is all about."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/26/miyamoto-1727373909314.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Shigeru Miyamoto would rather you leave Nintendo out of the "game wars" conversation. (Image credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I hope that they will understand Nintendo and not get involved in what is sometimes called the 'game war,' such as high specs and how to improve the performance of game consoles," he continued. "Nintendo will continue to make products that are uniquely Nintendo using various technologies available in the world today and we will continue to create not only games but also entertainment content."</p><p>Miyamoto's comments are candid, but also not a massive shock considering Nintendo has largely been left out of the console war conversation, at least in comparison to Sony and Microsoft. Those two companies have continued to focus on high specs and performance in particular, with Sony recently announcing the pricey <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024">PS5 Pro</a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Nintendo will continue to make products that are uniquely Nintendo using various technologies available in the world today."</p></div><p>And it's not like the approach hasn't been working for Nintendo, with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-switch-2-waiting-in-the-wings-nintendo-believes-the-og-switch-has-plenty-of-sales-left-in-it">Switch still selling well</a> even as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-everyones-talking-about-nintendo-switch-2-leaks-today">its successor waits in the wings</a>. </p><p>These comments are only the latest from Miyamoto to make headlines, with the video game icon recently saying Nintendo <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction">would rather go in a "different direction"</a> from some of its industry peers when it comes to the subject of AI. </p><p><em>Thumbnail credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p dir="ltr">California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law, <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" rel="nofollow ">AB 2426</a>, to address concerns over "disappearing" purchases of digital media, including games, movies, music, and ebooks. The law mandates that digital storefronts inform customers they are acquiring a license to use these products rather than indicating actual ownership, as reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Effective next year, the legislation prohibits digital retailers from using terms like "buy" or "purchase" unless they clearly state that customers do not receive unrestricted access. Retailers must disclose that these licenses can be revoked and provide a list of associated restrictions. Companies that fail to comply may face fines for false advertising.</p><p dir="ltr">This law emerges as digital game sales surge and subscription models dominate the industry, prompting questions about ownership. The gaming community is increasingly aware that titles may not be accessible in the future. An episode of GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/should-we-give-up-on-owning-games-spot-on/1100-6520479/">Spot On</a> earlier this year discussed a hypothetical scenario in which, wanting to revisit a game like Alan Wake 2 in 2045, players could find it unavailable due to the shift away from physical sales.</p><p dir="ltr">The legislation responds to practices by major companies like PlayStation and Ubisoft. Earlier this year, Ubisoft removed The Crew from player accounts after shutting down its servers, while last year, Sony indicated it would remove purchased content from users' libraries before reversing that decision.</p><p dir="ltr">"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," said California Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing" rel="nofollow ">in a press release</a>. "AB 2426 will ensure the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past."</p><p dir="ltr">While the law raises awareness about the limitations of digital licenses, it does not prevent storefronts from revoking access to purchased content. This legislation reflects ongoing efforts to clarify the nature of digital acquisitions and the evolving landscape of media ownership.</p>

		<p>Jackbox Games has announced The Jackbox Survey Scramble, a second smaller collection of games that will put survey-based games to the fore when it launches in late October.</p>
<p>The game will arrive for all major platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV, and will be priced at the rather appealing point of $9.99. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948640/The_Jackbox_Survey_Scramble/">A free demo</a> will be available during Steam Next Fest from 14th-21st October.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Survey Scramble | Announcement Trailer (EN)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPqck0NjkPs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The immediate comparison that many have already drawn is to Guesspionage, one of the minigames from Jackbox Party Pack 3, which used survey data to populate the answers to its many questions. However, Jackbox Survey Scramble is, at the very least, that idea on steroids. The good steroids.</p>
<p>Jackbox Survey Scramble will feature four game modes, and with more game modes added in a free up date before the end of the year. Initially these will include Hilo, where you guess the most and least popular answers, Speed mode, where you’re guessing against the clock, Squares, where you organise choices in popularity order, and a mode where you can intercept your opponents answers in Bounce.</p>

<p>In each case, the survey data that the game is drawing from is dynamically shifting based on the answers that you and all of the game’s players are feeding into it. Come back to the game a week, a month, a year later and the same prompts will potentially give rather different answers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Off the back of the recently released Jackbox Naughty Pack, Jackbox is making this a game with broader settings. One of the question examples is “what’s the cutest word for a butt?” but that won’t be in there if you apply content filters for a lower age range. There’s also streamer settings and accessibility options aplenty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking Naughty Pack, this is the first year in a decade without a 5-game Party Pack release, and Naughty Pack didn’t manage to fill that void for us in anywhere near the same way. An experimental fumble in the dark which sought to put more adult-rated prompts and games together, it did not land. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-review/">Naughty Pack review</a>, Jason said, “Ultimately, Jackbox Naughty Pack is the worst Party Pack to date, […] Maybe making our own fun and our own filth is the way forwards to a truly naughty experience.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s hoping that Survey Scramble can right the good ship Jackbox.</p>

Hardware leaker Kopite7kimi has <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1839343725727941060">published rumored specifications</a> for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 today, and both cards will reportedly be more power-hungry as Nvidia looks to debut more capable next-gen GPUs.</p><p>The RTX 5090 is said to have a 600-watt spec, although as <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-specs-leaked"><em>VideoCardz </em>points out</a> it’s not clear if this refers to how much the entire GPU board draws, or how much power the chip itself consumes. Either way, it looks like the RTX 5090 will draw 150 watts more than the 450 watts that the RTX 4090 pulls. The RTX 5090 will also reportedly include 32GB of GDDR7 memory on a 512-bit bus, with 21,760 CUDA cores.</p><p>Similarly, the RTX 5080 is said to use 400 watts of power, up from the RTX 4080’s 320-watt total graphics power. The RTX 5080 will <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1839345147789934794">also reportedly ship</a> with 16GB of GDDR7 memory and a 256-bit memory bus, with 10,752 CUDA cores.</p><p>Kopite7kimi has leaked a variety of GPU information over the years and has a reliable track record for Nvidia hardware leaks. Kopite7kimi previously revealed the specifications of the <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1430716119367622660">RTX 3090</a> and RTX 3080 cards ahead of their launch, the launch dates of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23950348/nvidia-rtx-4080-4070-super-ces-2024-launch-rumor">RTX 4070 / RTX 4080 Super cards</a>, and the return of the 12GB RTX 4080 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446875/nvidia-rtx-4080-12gb-return-rtx-4070-ti-rumor">as the RTX 4070 Ti</a>. They also correctly predicted the RTX 4090 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/16/23076656/nvidia-rtx-4090-rumor-release-july-2022">would require</a> 450 watts of power.</p><p>While the specs for Nvidia’s top RTX 50-series cards may have been leaked already, dates for when we’ll see these cards have not been shared. I understand from one source familiar with Nvidia’s plans that we might hear more about the RTX 50-series at the Consumer Electronics Show in early 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The mobile game—which featured hundreds of characters, quests, events, dialogue written by Simpsons writers, and let players re-build Springfield—will be removed from app stores on October 31. EA has turned off in-app purchases already. The game will remain playable until January 24, 2025. After that, servers for <em>Tapped Out</em> will be turned off and the game will no longer be playable. </p><p>“The decision to end our twelve-year journey is an emotional one,” posted EA on the official <em>Tapped Out </em>Facebook page. “Together with our partners at <em>The Simpsons</em> and The Walt Disney Company, we have delighted in bringing this game to you, the fans, and seeing how you’ve each built your own beloved versions of Springfield. It has been a remarkable journey, and we are grateful that we’ve been able to deliver 308 updates, 831 characters and including today’s final farewell 1,463 questlines.”</p><p>Personally, I’m sad to see <em>Tapped Out </em>go away. I’ve been playing the game for over a decade now and have enjoyed returning to it every few months or so to check out new events, spend a few bucks on some silly new characters, and enjoy all the Halloween fun each other October. </p><p>While <em>The Simpsons Tapped</em> Out is over a decade old at this point, it’s still the newest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544?_gl=1*1no0fls*_ga*MjAxMTA0MDE1Ny4xNzI1Njc1NzAy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2NTcwMC40Mi4xLjE3MjczNzUzMDkuOS4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544?_gl=1*1no0fls*_ga*MjAxMTA0MDE1Ny4xNzI1Njc1NzAy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2NTcwMC40Mi4xLjE3MjczNzUzMDkuOS4wLjA."><em>Simpsons</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>game available right now.

Throughout the coming weeks, we will be returning as much content from the past twelve years as possible, in waves of a few years of releases at a time. Look for these in the store! This includes both Premium and Prize items. Waves of items will be released on a weekly cadence for the next five weeks.</p><p><strong>Q: What about land and item limits?</strong><br>A: As part of the previous event, A Bart Future, we phased in increased land tile availability, along with ramped-up item placement limits. While we are not adding any additional increases with Taps, there will be a reference to it within the final questline, as we did not formally announce this enhancement<br>previously.</p><p><strong>New Items:</strong><br>There are new items coming to the store as part of the final wave of Taps store items – a building and a bunch of decorations, that were not previously released. All of these items will be available for in-game money.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lenny’s House (Building)</li><li>Pink Bouncy Horse (Decoration)</li><li>Brown Bouncy Horse (Decoration)</li><li>Purple Bouncy Horse (Decoration)</li><li>Tan Bouncy Horse (Decoration)</li><li>BBQ Grill (Decoration)</li><li>Picnic Table (Decoration)</li><li>ATM (Decoration)</li><li>Residential Mailbox (Decoration)</li><li>Blue Postal Box (Decoration)</li><li>Red Trashcan (Decoration)</li><li>Holiday Person Sculpture (Façade)</li><li>Holiday Creature Sculpture (Façade)</li><li>Holiday Dog Sculpture (Façade)</li><li>Holiday Dragon Sculpture (Façade)</li><li>Holiday Bear Sculpture (Façade)</li><li>Holiday Horse Sculpture (Façade)</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Holiday Gator Sculpture (Façade)</li><li>Holiday Chimp Sculpture (Façade)</li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Note that some Switch games offered by Woot are region-free imports--so while the ratings board logo on the box might look different, they’ll still run just fine on your console and function as if you bought them at your local retailer. Woot doesn't explicitly state which games are imports, but as long as that possibility doesn't bother you, you can get some Switch games for their lowest prices yet with Prime shipping.</p><hr><h2>Nintendo Switch Game Deals at Woot</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> -- $45 ($<del>70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-2%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_56&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> -- $40 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fpaper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-4%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_17&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> -- $45 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13112648%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsuper-mario-rpg-2%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario RPG</a> -- $32 ($<del>50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fluigis-mansion-2-hd-7%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luigi's Mansion 2</a> -- $45 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fprincess-peach-showtime-8%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_6&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Princess Peach: Showtime</a> -- $45 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13112648%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsuper-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_9&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros.

<p>Today marks the debut of the first full trailer for the second season of <em>The Last of Us</em>, the grim but compelling post-apocalyptic drama on HBO that's based on the popular video game of the same name.</p>
<p>The trailer revisits the first season's two protagonists—Joel and Ellie—five years after Joel's fateful choice. Here's the simple, straightforward logline HBO provided:</p>
<blockquote><p>After five years of peace following the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie’s collective past catches up to them, drawing them into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to returning characters, we get some glimpses of some new characters and the actors who will play them. Jeffrey Wright (<em>Westworld</em>,&nbsp;<em>American Fiction</em>) will reprise his role as Isaac from the game, while Kaitlyn Dever (<em>Booksmart</em>,&nbsp;<em>Justified</em>) will play Abby, a key character in the sequel.</p>
<p>Just as season one retold the story of the first <em>The Last of Us</em> game, season 2 will retell 2020's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/the-last-of-us-part-2-isnt-a-fully-satisfying-return-to-the-apocalypse/"><em>The Last of Us: Part II</em></a>. Those who've just been following the TV show know to expect something grim, but those of us who have played the game (or followed its controversies in gaming communities) know that non-gaming TV fans are probably not prepared for what's coming.</p>
<p>If that describes you, you fortunately have some time to steel yourself. The show is slated for a 2025 premiere, but there has been no official marketing to narrow that window any further. That said, HBO content chief Casey Bloys recently <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/casey-bloys-hacks-emmy-win-harry-potter-series-euphoria-1236090121/">hinted</a> that the network plans to air <em>The Last of Us</em>'s second season soon enough to position it for the next Emmy Awards, which means it's likely to arrive in the first half of the year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-quietly-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-on-ps-store/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-on-ps-store.993501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-quietly-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-on-ps-store/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At this point, with Sony's antics, it probably doesn't come as a surprise that Sony has quietly raised the price of Horizon Zero Dawn on the Playstation Store. The Complete Edition of Horizon Zero Dawn was $19.99 on the PlayStation Store, but the price has now doubled since they announced the remaster. The doubled price has been visible on the PS store since September 25, where the price is now $39.99. In the past couple of months, Sony has made multiple price changes quietly. For example, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-controllers-receive-price-hike-in-us/">bumped up the price of their DualSense controllers by $5</a> at all outlets without making any sort of announcement.<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/"> Japan saw a huge price hike of the original PlayStation 5 console of $90</a>, which is the second time Japan has seen the console's price go up.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA10213_00-HRZCE00000000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price increase of the original version of Horizon Zero Dawn</a> puts the cost of the remaster at $49.99 instead of $29.99 if you were someone who had to purchase the remaster new from the PlayStation Store. While those who owned the original are able to get the remaster as an upgrade for $9.99, those who had the game on disc and now use a Digital Edition PlayStation 5 are at a huge disadvantage. Not only can they no longer play the original unless they have their PlayStation 4, but they won't be able to buy the game for the upgrade price of $9.99, as they cannot verify their purchase by inserting the disc into the console. This means that those from that group of people would have to pay the full-blown price of $49.99 if they wanted to own the remaster.</p>
<p>If you want to get a physical copy of the game, you are able to get the game for $19.99 from physical retailers, but of course, those who are digital-only are at a huge disadvantage.</p>
<p>This is the first time Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition has experienced a price jump in the six years it's been on the market. Of course, it's been on sale during this time, but this is the first time the game has bumped up by such a huge margin. At the moment, Sony has made no comment as to why the price increase has happened or has not verified the fact that they did it.</p>
<p>Again, it's not at all surprising that Sony has done this, especially since they have made so much money by remastering games (with The Last of Us being remastered multiple times), and bumping up the price of the original PlayStation 5 console to attempt to bring in more profit, as their finances have been in a rough position, as shown by their financial reports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-londons-next-patch-said-to-bring-huge-improvements-team-folon-drafted-extra-help-for-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fallout: London was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/">mod that took the community by storm</a> and completely overhauled Fallout 4. TEAM FOLON is the team who have been working on the mod, and while the mod did release successfully, there were some teething issues. Since then, it's been relatively quiet. TEAM FOLON has now offered an update regarding what's going on with Patch 1.02. To ensure the update is going how it should, TEAM FOLON has drafted in some extra help to improve the performance of the mod.</p>
<p>While they haven't provided an exact date for the patch, they've said that the patch should be out before London Comic Con, which takes place on 25-27 October. "We know we said it'd be soon and yes it's taken a little longer than expected, but it's for a good reason - we've brought in some external help to improve performance, facegen data, and LOD, and it took awhile to get them up to speed, but <em>wow</em> the difference," says Project Manager Dean 'Prilladog' Carter. It's not specified if the people hired to help out with the Fallout: London mod came from a specific company or whether they were freelancers. Depending on how the patch goes, it'll be interesting to see if any of it leads to a potential position working alongside Team FOLON.</p>
<p>For those who want to know what Team FOLON is working on, the team provided a link to a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTHHRBjaKituLhWsOBQtYsH1oXkZQljkQNaiHTyfNRY/edit?gid=1194763901#gid=1194763901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Spreadsheet</a> that shows off all of the fixes and improvements they are making so that you can keep an eye on their progress.</p>
<p>While the Google Spreadsheet is extensive and covers a lot of ground, some of the main tweaks they're including are changes to LOD clip volumes, which should hopefully reduce the number of save file corruption issues that players are experiencing when visiting Islington or St Paul's Cathedral. They are also working on pre-combine regeneration, which should "fix various random/repeatable crashes."</p>
<p>In addition to these, they are working on some of the mod's long-broken quests, such as Lay of the Land, which has caused many issues for those who have been playing Fallout: London. Of course, the tweaks don't end there. There will also be many gameplay tweaks, including the removal of the ability to eat Atkins robots. The message regarding your afflictions at the start of the game will also be tweaked to provide the player with accurate numbers.</p>
<p>Team FOLON will be attending London MCM Comic Con, which explains their tentative due date for the patch being between October 25 and 27 for Fallout: London.</p>

Like others from the region, enhanced traversal is baked into her kit. Her skill summons a drill that she can use to quickly move up cliffs or bounce onto the ground for AoE damage. Everything aside from her normal attacks scales off of her DEF, so you’ll want to build her into a tank. From unlock methods to the ideal Artifacts, here’s everything you need to know about this adorable breakdancer.</p><h2 id="h5215"><a id=""></a><strong>How to unlock Kachina for free</strong></h2><p>Like every character in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, except for the Traveler, you’ll be able to unlock Kachina through banners. She’s currently being promoted in the limited-time event banners and should be added to the standard Wanderlust Invocation banner in the future. Thankfully, you don’t have to rely solely on luck to unlock her.</p><p><strong>Playing through the recently added 5.0 Archon quest line will unlock her for free.</strong> If you’re a new player or just a little behind on the story, you can also skip ahead to play through these events. The only requirement is completing the Chapter 1 Act 3 Archon Quest first. Then you just need to open the Events Overview menu and scroll down to the “Turbo Twirly!” tab. Confirm that you want a Quick Start and you’ll be able to start the quest.</p><h2 id="h5216"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Kachina team composition</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9e94c124b74f7a4ce50e8543853e7b2f" data-recommend-id="image://9e94c124b74f7a4ce50e8543853e7b2f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party setup screen with four characters at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party setup screen with four characters at the ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e94c124b74f7a4ce50e8543853e7b2f" data-recommend-id="image://9e94c124b74f7a4ce50e8543853e7b2f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party setup screen with four characters at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The primary role for Kachina will be a Sub-DPS, but it’s possible to build her as a Support as well. I’ll be listing the optimal choices for each aspect of her build. Starting it off is choosing the right team.</p><p><strong>Noelle and Itto are wonderful characters to fill the primary DPS role</strong>, bouncing off Kachina’s attacks with Geo Resonance. Geo can sometimes be a finicky element, which is why it helps to pair them with each other.</p><p><strong>Navia is another great option to focus on DPS.</strong> Just remember that her kit benefits from the Crystalize reaction, so she should not be included on a mono-Geo team. One of the Artifact Sets I’ll be mentioning later works best with a Rainbow team (one with multiple element types), so consider diversifying your party.</p><p>You can also place Kachina with a support and DPS pair that shares the same element. This can provide consistent Crystalize shields, which is nice to have against certain enemies or bosses. <strong>Typical pairings include Furina and Neuvillette, Shenhe and Ayaka, or Bennett and Xianling.</strong></p><p>The Natlan characters revealed so far do have unique regional mechanics and can shorten their Nightsoul Burst cooldown when multiple are paired on a team together.<strong> Mualani is a solid choice for a primary DPS, but Kinich and other Natlan characters coming in the future should work too.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="91a8a5ef83a1f8e918e28aa2729bff97" data-recommend-id="image://91a8a5ef83a1f8e918e28aa2729bff97" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Weapons screen shows a girl wielding a polearm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Weapons screen shows a girl wielding a polearm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91a8a5ef83a1f8e918e28aa2729bff97" data-recommend-id="image://91a8a5ef83a1f8e918e28aa2729bff97" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Weapons screen shows a girl wielding a polearm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since her DEF is so crucial for her gameplay, you’ll want to equip her with items that increase that stat. There sadly aren’t many weapons that buff DEF though, so I suggest focusing on DMG or energy regeneration for alternates.</p><p>Kachina’s best weapon is one introduced along with their region. <strong>Footprint of the Rainbow increases Base ATK and DEF, which is exactly what we want.</strong> Additionally, it also has an ability that triggers when an Elemental Skill is used, increasing DEF further for 15 seconds. It practically feels custom-made for her and you can easily craft it after a bit of grinding for materials.</p><p><strong>Another solid option is Deathmatch.</strong> Its primary effect is to increase CRIT Rate, but it will also increase ATK and DEF when 2+ enemies are nearby, or just ATK when fewer are nearby. The only catch here is that this weapon is only attainable from the battle pass.</p><p><strong>It’s a bit different, but Favonius Lance is also a great alternative option.</strong> It increases the user’s energy recharge rate and also adds a decent chance for CRIT hits to generate additional energy. The weapon is a default item included on every primary banner. This means it can technically be earned for free, as long as you have some luck.</p><h2 id="h5217"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Talents to Level Up</strong></h2><p>Both Mualani and Kachina have transformative skills that enhance their combat and make exploring a lot easier. You’ll want the skills to be active far more often than not for either one. Among the talents, here’s the order to focus on:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Elemental Skill - Go, Go Turbo Twirly!</li><li>Elemental Burst - Time to Get Serious!</li><li>Normal Attack - Cragbiter</li></ul><h2 id="h5218"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Artifacts for Kachina</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ae2b39f75a6f3d164cc19c1c4d603b76" data-recommend-id="image://ae2b39f75a6f3d164cc19c1c4d603b76" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae2b39f75a6f3d164cc19c1c4d603b76" data-recommend-id="image://ae2b39f75a6f3d164cc19c1c4d603b76" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your choice of artifacts will depend on the role you want Kachina to fill, as well as who’s on her team. Those that buff DEF are perfect, but there are some other choices to slot in.</p><p><strong>My top Artifact suggestion for Kachina is Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City.</strong> The two-piece effect regenerates elemental energy as long as a nearby party member triggers a Nightsoul Burst. Its four-piece effect activates once the user triggers an elemental reaction and can provide one or two buffs. The base buff is that nearby party members will receive a 12 percent increase in Elemental DMG for the elements involved in the reaction. If the user is in the Nightsoul’s Blessing state, an additional 28 percent increase will be added as well.</p><p>Similar to Mualani and the Obsidian Codex, this artifact set has been introduced along with the Natlan region. It can be earned by completing the Sanctum of Rainbow Spirits Domain of Blessing.</p><p><strong>Next in line, and pairing very well, is Husk of Opulent Dreams.</strong> This artifact’s two-piece effect increases the DEF stat by an impressive 30 percent. The four-piece effect brings in a unique Curiosity stack mechanic, with one stack added for every Geo attack every 0.3 stacks. A stack will also be added every three seconds when the user is off-field. Each stack provides a six percent increase to DEF and Geo DMG.</p><p><strong>Last is the sometimes overlooked Defender’s Will artifact set.</strong> Like the above, the two-piece increases DEF by 30 percent. The four-piece meanwhile increases Elemental RES by 30 percent for each element present in the party. Pair Kachina with a rainbow team, and you’ll have a party with multiple resistances and a beefy tank.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237"><em>Genshin Impact</em> Finally Hitting Xbox In November But Still No</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237">Nintendo Switch Port In Sight</a></span></p><hr><p>I wouldn’t say Kachina is the best at what she does, no matter what choices are made in building her. That doesn’t change the fact that she’s a solid character and one worth working with, especially as she’s free to every player.
