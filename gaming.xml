<p>Days Gone 2 is a sequel many gaming fans have wanted for a long time. Its sales suggested the debut title was a success, but 6 years later, we’re still twiddling our thumbs, waiting to get our Freaker on for Days Gone 2.</p>



<p>I’m glad I get to write about Days Gone as I think it’s one of the most underrated games of all time. I played it when it first came out, and I’ll never understand the lukewarm critical reception it got. Freakers and hoards are utterly terrifying, the story is consistently engaging throughout, and it’s a rock-solid survival title from start to finish.</p>



<p>Rumors circulated in late 2024 that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone PS5 Remaster</a> was in the works. This finally happened at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s February 2025 State of Play</a>. Now, the Days Gone 2 discourse is hotter than ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-days-gone-2-sequel-happening">Is a Days Gone 2 Sequel Happening?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it be? Credit to Bend Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As it stands, a Days Gone 2 sequel is not in development, nor is it on the cards—and there’s a good chance it will never happen.</strong></p>



<p>It breaks my heart writing this, and I hope I get to backtrack on everything I’m writing one day. But we believe developer Bend Studio has moved on and was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-layoffs-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service title before it was canceled by Sony</a>. This means outside of Days Gone’s Broken Road DLC—and now the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> release—this may be all the <a href="https://www.bendstudio.com/game/days-gone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Days Gone</a> content we get.</p>



<p>Oh, and we also mustn’t forget its connection to Astro Bot—something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">Days Gone’s dir</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">ctor</a> wasn’t keen on.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-hasn-t-days-gone-had-a-sequel">Why Hasn’t Days Gone Had a Sequel?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s been widely reported Sony was not the biggest fan of Days Gone when it first came out, despite the game selling very well.</strong></p>



<p>Days Gone took a long time to develop and probably cost a decent amount of money to make and market. But <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/12/20/playstation-game-sales-bloodborne-days-gone-7-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game World Observer reported</a> in 2023 Days Gone had sold close to <strong>7.5 million copies</strong>—bettering Bloodborne and 2016’s Ratchet &amp; Clank—and by now, it’s probably closer to 8 million—with the Remaster sure to give it a boost.</p>



<p>Despite this, Jeff Ross—a senior member of the Days Gone team—had this to say on there being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-sequel-sony-never-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no sequel</a>: “A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence <strong>it will never happen</strong>. <strong>Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans</strong>, so you won’t hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever.”</p>



<p>I think the only way we’re going to see a sequel is if there’s interest. The Days Gone remaster needs to sell well, and people need to show they want another game. Plus, if Bend Studio’s rumored live-service title has been stopped, it means they’re free. Maybe they have some time to develop a certain Zombie-game sequel?</p>



<hr>



<p>In short, if <em>you </em>want a Days Gone 2 sequel, support it by buying it. Post about it on social media, make videos, and everything in between. What are your memories of Days Gone? Is it scandalous we’ve never had a Days Gone 2?</p>

<p>"Each year, we plan out a bunch of themed sale events (Fests) that center around a rotating category of games, and we know that announcing those dates ahead of time is helpful to developers planning their overall participation for the year," Valve explained.</p>
<p>"This is especially true given that we sprinkle them throughout a year already marked with each of our four seasonal sales and three Next Fests!</p>
<p>"We announced the schedule for the first half of 2025 last summer, and are now sharing the themed Fests and their dates planned for the second half."</p>

<p>Developers are invited to register their games for the events, as well as the digital store's legendary seasonable sales, which take place four times a year.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-bans-all-steam-games-that-force-players-to-watch-advertisements">Valve re-emphasised its rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads</a>.</p>
<p>The rules confirmed that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not. Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Is this the best start to a year in gaming we’ve ever had? It feels as though we’re seeing massive, hugely enjoyable games appear on the daily, and this week it’s been my pleasure to play through<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/"> Avowed</a>, an early highlight on the calendar for RPG fans. I’m also diving into the Elden Ring Nightreign network test which started today, had fun with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/the-knightling-is-set-to-be-a-fantastical-shield-bearing-indie-hit/">The Knightling</a>, and a bunch of other stuff I’m not allowed to talk about that totally don’t feature large creatures in them.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the prerequisite amount of Destiny 2, while also finding time to review <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/robobeat-review/">Robobeat</a> which he grudgingly liked very much. <strong>Gamoc</strong>, meanwhile continued to tinker with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 after our review, reiterating that it’s excellent, as well as Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and a bit of Palworld.</p>
<p><strong>Aran </strong>has returned to us after an amazing trip to Japan, and he’s getting back up to speed by playing Citizen Sleeper 2 for review, while <strong>Jim</strong> finally saw the credits roll on Alan Wake 2. He told us, “I wasn’t too keen on the ending and felt like it meandered a bit too much without really offering anything diverse or satisfying with its combat gameplay. That said, I feel somewhat obliged to play through the DLC as it ties more into the wider Remedy universe.</p>
<p>“Not sure what my next game will be, either Plague Tale or Rise of the Ronin.” Any suggestions?</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has had a quieter week than normal, working his way through Gears of War 5. He says, “It’s fine but suffers from serious modern-day gaming bloat compared to the original trilogy. I’ve also been pottering through some indie games for review.”</p>
<p>Having seen off Unicorn Overlord, <strong>Ade</strong> has immediately made a tactical move to another Switch title, “I needed a game to fill the horned horse-shaped hole in my life, so, I’ve started Fire Emblem Engage! I’ve also enjoyed accidentally blowing up pals in Helldivers 2, solving physics-based puzzles in Immortals Rise of Fenyx, and watching Laura build uni halls in the hilarious Campus 2.0.”</p>

<p>Last, but never the least, <strong>Tef</strong> has also been playing Avowed to help produce <a href="https://youtu.be/_PCSaHYOKoY">our video review</a>, complimenting this with some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">Killing Floor 3 for a preview</a> of the closed beta, and is just getting started with the technical test of Exoborne, where he’s roping Miguel and myself in for some exosuit extraction. There’s some other bits and bobs that he can’t talk about yet, though…</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-ix-remake-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-are-still-in-active-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1109397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite not having been announced yet, the Final Fantasy IX remake remains in active development alongside another unannounced series remaster, but both may not be released soon, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, well-known and reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake of the ninth entry in the series by Square Enix, saying that it remains in active development alongside another rumored remaster, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-playtested/">Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>. Unfortunately, it looks like it may be a while until we see how Zidane's adventure will get updated for modern gaming hardware, as the game isn't expected to be released in 2025, although, the insider highlighted, the fact that nothing has been heard about it doesn't mean that it won't release for sure before the end of the year. The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster also isn't expected to release this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Both remain in active development. FFIXR isn't expected to see release in 2025. Maybe we'll see it launch in 2026.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just because I haven't heard it... doesn't mean it's not coming this year, to be clear. I simply don't have a timeline of release on the game at the moment.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1889021467490136206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake, as mentioned above, has yet to be officially announced and was originally revealed via a huge GeForce Now leak a few years back. While multiple insiders have provided different details on the game, all have suggested that the remake will be quite <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">faithful to the original and will have a more modest budget than the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy.</a> Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer Naoki Yoshida also commented on a potential remake last year, acknowledging the demand and highlighting how it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-multiple-games/">difficult to remake the original with a single game</a>, although it's difficult to imagine Square Enix committing to another long undertaking with multiple games to remake a title that, while beloved by many, it's not as popular as the seventh entry in the series.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will get "additional playable characters and bosses" via DLC, according to an entry on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/">Steam page</a>. This isn't massively surprising, given that Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off featuring preset Nightfarer heroes rather than custom RPG characters, as in vanilla <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It also supports the idea that Nightreign is the foundation for a From Software Connected Universe of sorts, with characters and antagonists from the original Elden Ring, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> trilogy, Sekiro and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> reappearing in Nightreign via the Mystic Nexus of Monetisation.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Steam page mention of DLC has since been removed, but not fast enough to evade the watchful harpies of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/">Parsimonious Gamer</a>. The now-deleted entry didn't specify which characters or bosses, but it seems overwhelmingly likely that there will be some familiar faces. We already know that Nightreign features a few bosses from previous From Software games, including the first Dark Souls' Centipede Demon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s dragon-riding solar warrior the Nameless King.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-talks-about-attacking-friends-for-their-own-good-and-other-new-elden-ring-nightreign-ideas/1100-6529380/">Gamespot</a>, From Software game director Junya Ishizaki has explained the return of Nameless King and other stalwarts as reflecting the need for variety in a battle royale-flavoured bossrush experience that thrives on creative match-ups. "We needed a lot to add to this mix, so we wanted to leverage what we deemed appropriate from our previous titles," he told the site, going on to note that "our players have a lot of affection for these characters" and that From are being careful to ground things in lore and ensure the bosses "make sense within the atmosphere and vibe of Elden Ring Nightreign".
</p>
<p>
I don't doubt Ishizaki's sincerity when he adds that "from a personal standpoint, I thought it'd be kind of fun", and I don't want to get too picky with the wording of an answer that presumably came via translator, but "leverage" is a word you tend to hear from publishers looking to squeeze more cash out of their established fictional worlds. If Nightreign finds an audience, I expect there will be plenty more leveraging. In this regard, From are of course following in the footsteps of modders, who've been porting bosses between games for yonks and even making them fight each other Salty Bet-style.
</p>
<p>
There are definitely some old From characters I'd love to see in Nightreign. It's interesting to consider how they might be adapted to the game's quickfire open world multiplayer format. Bloodborne's sorrowful cosmic being Ebrietas, for example, although that's partly because I didn't have the heart to attack her in the original game. Sekiro's many Headless varmints.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, though, I'm less interested in which characters might return than in how From Software might justify their presence at the level of environmental storytelling and backstory. While it's an angle I've overegged in the past, From's tales of overthrowing corrupted kings and being corrupted in the process can easily be read as a mythologisation of the pitfalls of prolonging a narrative franchise, stretching out stories till they become boneless and dissatisfying, and reviving characters who should have died or retired several iterations ago. 
</p>
<p>
In Dark Souls 3, for example, there is a cannibalistic monster who fights using the half-eaten husk of a character from the original game. It's interesting to place that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-dark-souls-3s-aldrich-is-2016s-best-boss">act of regurgitation</a> against what we know of Nightreign's update plans, which seem heavily informed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">the undead philosophies of live service games</a>. I wonder if the new game will end up being one big metaphor for seasonal update entropy?

It’s a success for the Ukrainian studio, a miracle, really, considering the harrowing circumstances that followed Russian’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. But Stalker 2 suffers from well-documented bugs and issues; chief among them A-Life 2.0.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A-Life was a key feature of the first STALKER game that governed AI behavior across the game world. At a high level, it is a system for simulating life in the Zone that works its magic seemingly independently of the player’s actions or whereabouts. It helps to create convincing AI and the emergent gameplay STALKER is famous for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC had said A-Life 2.0 would make the Zone feel alive as never before, that it would fuel emergent gameplay on a scale previously thought impossible. Indeed for some fans, A-Life 2.0 was STALKER 2’s biggest selling point. But when STALKER 2 actually came out players discovered that A-Life 2.0 didn’t work properly, with some questioning whether it was even in the game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam"><u>GSC explained what went wrong with STALKER 2’s A-Life 2.0</u></a>, and vowed to fix the system. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-patch-11-is-a-big-one-adds-first-iteration-of-a-life-fixes">Patch 1.1</a>, released in December, was the first step on that road.

<p>We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>We got a subsequent look at Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time in February last year, along with a peek <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">at the various jobs players</a> will be able to undertake in this time travelling adventure.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Eclipse Glow Games has shared an extended gameplay video of its exciting newly announced action/adventure game Tides of Annihilation. The video, published on IGN's YouTube channel, is embedded below. In the footage, we get to see a bit of exploration, some standard fighting, and a boss fight against the game's version of Mordred Pendragon.</p>
<p>It's clearly a work-in-progress build, but it shows a lot of promise, confirming what we already saw at Gamescom 2024 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in this article</a>.</p>
<p>In the game, players will explore an alternate version of London that lies in ruins, following a surprise invasion from another realm. They'll step into this world as Gwendolyn, supposedly the city's last surviving inhabitant, as she navigates otherworldly foes and gains awesome powers of her own.</p>
<p>Throughout Tides of Annihilation, Gwendolyn will be able to summon over ten legendary knights (picking two at a time). They were inspired by Arthurian myths, bringing unique skills and abilities that will allow players to craft their own fighting playstyles and combos. Such powers will be needed to face the gigantic knights that now roam ruined London. Players will get not only to fight them but also scale them, as they are practically levels of their own.</p>
<p>In this game, London isn't just devastated, it's also transformed. But there's also the fantasy realm of Avalon, where the supernatural is even more prevalent between ancient magic and legendary creatures. Throughout the journey, Gwendolyn will have to save her family, the city, and even reality itself.</p>

<p>The game is in development for PC and consoles with Unreal Engine 5, and the studio has already confirmed PS5 Pro support with ray tracing and 60FPS mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-patch-fixes-bugs-and-overhauls/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GSC has published the 1.2 patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, releasing more than 1,700 bug fixes across all platforms. In a post accompanying the release, it was revealed that ‘all aspects of the game’ have been addressed, from AI and UI to weapon balancing and open-world exploration mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s one heck of a list, but that has become par for the course for GSC, which has worked tirelessly to optimise STALKER 2 since the game was released in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-update-1-2">Major Update 1.2</h2>



<p>One of the major areas addressed by GSC Game World in the 1.2 patch for STALKER 2 is the game’s AI engine and mechanics.</p>



<p>This update has swept the ‘A-Life’ ecosystem, with upgrades being applied to the accuracy, stealth, behaviour, and interactions of NPCs throughout The Zone. The team has also provided extended fixes and tweaks to the many mutants that roam this open-world title.</p>



<p>Many performance-based changes have been applied in the STALKER 2 1.2 patch, too. GSC has repaired some sequences that were causing FPS drops, and a major memory leak issue has been sorted out.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full list of improvements</a> is nuts – GSC has considered every little detail in this major patch. For instance, the team has looked at everything from visual glitches occurring when NPCs <strong>smoke</strong> to the visual clarity of PDA models in low-light areas. The granularity is insane.</p>



<p>Hundreds of fixes have been applied to the full suite of missions – both major and minor – that players explore as they traverse the story of Heart of Chornobyl. In December, I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">gave STALKER 2 a glowing review</a> despite there being a few issues that surfaced in some of the missions I uncovered.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 was more about fixes than it was about <strong>additions</strong>, so don’t expect there to be too many new things to uncover the next time you log into the game. GSC added some extra controller features, and there’s a new ‘night music theme’ that’ll play when you explore Zalissya. Plus, some new notes have been scattered around the open world, but that’s about it.</p>



<p>Are you still playing STALKER 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

From the “Yellow Turban Rebellion” to the climax of the “Battle of Chibi,” the story will transport players to the heart of an ancient China in turmoil. Through the eyes of a nameless hero, players will have to fight fiercely and make choices to restore peace, shape history to their own experience, battle enormous enemy armies, whilst navigating the chaos of the Three Kingdoms era.</p><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> delivers an overwhelming sense of realism on every battlefield, with the largest number of soldiers in the series’ history to date. Enemy soldiers attacking <a title="Genres > Co-Op [234 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly are a formidable threat, and players will not only fight with their own skills but also charge forward with their allies into massive enemy armies, allowing for a sense of realism on the battlefield of unprecedented scale where thousands of soldiers will collide.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The protagonist of this title takes to the battlefield alongside the heroes of the Three Kingdoms, wiping out swarms of enemies with swords, fists and various other weapons. Travelling across the world map as they embark on their epic journey, players can suppress rebellions or choose to rescue government forces during “Missions,” overcome “Skirmishes,” and visit various locations where they will be able to buy weapons. Throughout their quest, players will also encounter a variety of characters familiar to the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Depending on the bond forged, these characters can become travelling companions, or an enemy as players dive into the most aggressive 1 vs. 1,000 combat in series history!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot has dominated DICE Awards 2025 with five award wins:&nbsp;Outstanding Achievement in Animation, Outstanding Technical Achievement, Family Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, as well as the most coveted one, Game Of The Year.</p>
<p>It's another big victory for the platform game, which had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received the Game of the Year prize at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards</a> ceremony in December and <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-sweeps-at-new-york-game-awards-ceremony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the New York Game Awards</a> last month. So far, when taking in most outlets and organizations, Astro Bot has put itself far ahead of any other game released in 2024 when it comes to GOTY awards. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-24-best-games-of-2024-and-most-anticipated-of-2025-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here on Wccftech</a>, though, it only won the genre-specific award, whereas the overall Game of the Year went elsewhere.</p>
<p>On another note, the developers have just started releasing free new Astro Bot content. The Tick-Tock Shock level is already out, while four more levels will be rolled out according to the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feb 20: Thrust or Bust</li>
<li>Feb 27: Cock-A-Doodle-Doom</li>
<li>Mar 6: Hard to Bear</li>
<li>Mar 13: Armored Hardcore</li>
</ul>
<p>Team Asobi also confirmed that a PS5 Pro update for Astro Bot is on the way, allowing players to enjoy the game at 4K@60 frames per second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot Add-On - Tick-Tock Shock | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iI4iROxxkHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As for the rest of the DICE Awards 2025 winners, Helldivers 2 won four prizes: Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition, Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design, Action Game of the Year, and Online Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which our staff voted as Wccftech's Game of the Year, won in the Outstanding Achievement in Character, Outstanding Achievement in Story, and Adventure Game of the Year categories.</p>
<p>Balatro developer LocalThunk also won three awards: Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game, and Mobile Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong prevailed in the Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction category, while Metaphor: Refantazio won RPG of the Year.</p>
<p>For the individual award, Don Jones received the Lifetime Achievement Award, while former Insomniac founder and CEO Ted Price (who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resistance-4-was-unsuccessfully-pitched-to-sony-a-while-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the cancellation of a Resistance 4 project) was officially inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015 and has been a stalwart figure in the first-person shooter space ever since. It’s a flagship title for Ubisoft, a live-service title with millions of fans and a booming esports ecosystem. It’s arguably one of the best games in the space that has proven time and again that it has the staying power to weather the ebbing and flowing of the wider industry.</p>



<p>This weekend, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-esports-eliminated-six-invitational-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Six Invitational</a>, a massive $3 million esports event, wraps up in Boston, Massachusetts. It’s expected that Ubisoft will make a grand reveal on the final day of the event – February 16 – outlining the future of Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s Yves Guillemot has also alluded to big things being in store for the tactical shooter.</p>

<h2 id="h-consistency">Consistency</h2>



<p>Ubisoft might have struggled with other franchises in recent years, but Rainbow Six is going strong, thanks to Siege. This decade-old tactical shooter has solid player numbers and a pipeline of content updates that show no signs of ending.</p>



<p>I caught up with Ubisoft’s representatives a while back and it was suggested that the company has plans to carry Rainbow Six Siege to <strong>100 Operators </strong>in total before stopping. At the time of publishing, there are 74 Operators, and more are being added all the time.</p>



<p>Despite that note, people have claimed recently that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/">Rainbow Six Siege 2</a> is on the horizon, but I feel that’s unlikely.</p>



<p>During a recent financial update, Ubisoft’s CEO, Yves Guillemot, touched on the future of Rainbow Six, suggesting that something mighty is in store for the franchise:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you know, we are preparing a big launch for Assassin’s Creed Shadows in the short term. Next year, <strong>we’ll have big plans that will benefit Rainbow Six across all platforms, </strong>that’s focusing well, and that’s a key milestone in the gross plan for the company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has invested extensive time, effort, and money in Rainbow Six Siege. It’s not only a staple of the esports industry, but one of the most consistent shooters in the wider gaming market. It’s available on multiple platforms, has crossplay mechanics, stacks of maps, modes, and weapons, and it’s getting better with time.</p>



<p>Love it or hate it, Rainbow Six Siege is around for the long(er) haul, and more is coming.</p>

<p>Eclipse Glow Games has released an 11-minute gameplay walkthrough for Tides of Annihilation, which was unveiled this week at the State of Play showcase. Tides of Annihilation has been dubbed ‘Stellar Blade meets Elden Ring’, mostly by <strong>me</strong>. I was looped into the development of Tides of Annihilation last year and loved what I saw, and now it’s out there for everyone to admire.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have a release date, but when it drops, Tides of Annihilation will be available on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC platforms. </p>



<p>Check out the full gameplay walkthrough below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-world-bending-battles">World-Bending Battles</h2>



<p>Tides of Annihilation is an innovative and impressive game that has a relatively unique story. It tells the tale of Gwendolyn, one of the last survivors of humanity and a warrior battling to push back dark, otherworldly forces. To do this, she’ll lean on the spectral powers of ancient knights of Arthurian mythology, fighting alongside them in clashes with immense bosses.</p>



<p>It’s set in an apocalyptic rendition of London, and all the landmarks are front and centre for all to see. In that respect, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-revealed-by-eclipse-glow-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s quite like Stellar Blade</a>, and the female protagonist with her undeniable sword-based skills adds further credence to that comparison.</p>



<p>Here’s the 11-minute gameplay walkthrough from Tides of Annihilation:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tides of Annihilation - Extended Gameplay Walkthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hU-lpWlaEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Tides of Annihilation promises to be a challenging game, but when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-interview-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed the developer</a>, I learned that there will be accessibility considerations made for gamers who want an easier experience. I also learned that there will be extensive customisation opportunities in the game, with players tweaking Gwendolyn’s hair, makeup, outfits, and skill loadouts.</p>



<p>Does Tides of Annihilation look like something you’re eager to play? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Since Apple invented MagSafe for a stronger, more reliable connection between a wireless charger to an iPhone 12 or later, the company's latest generation of MagSafe Charger is the best, most effective option for the iPhone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The MagSafe Charger features a sleek, slim hockey-puck design with a strong magnet that aligns with the back of the iPhone for charging. The powerful connection between the two devices means there shouldn’t be any problem when picking up the phone to answer calls or checking socials while charging. The durable, high-quality materials used in its build mean the charger can handle some wear and tear too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike other wireless chargers, which are often limited to 7.5W speeds when charging an iPhone, the Apple MagSafe Charger can reach up to 25W with a 30W or 35W USB-C power adapter. Unfortunately, that wall charger will need to be purchased separately. Still, this option offers excellent value, as it features Qi2 and Qi support – any device that has Qi charging can juice up wirelessly. </p></div><p id="best-battery-pack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best battery pack" id="magsafebatterypack">7.

For a cable-powered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger"><u>portable charger</u></a>, the Mophie Powerstation Plus, remedies this problem. With it comes a 10,000mAh battery for an over a full extra charge to your phone. But what makes this power bank a real standout is the inclusion of built-in, durable USB-C and Lightning cables that tuck away neatly when not in use. It’s perfect for those constantly losing and tangling wires. Beyond those cables, an additional USB-C port is provided to juice up a third device. However, to enjoy up to 30W charging speeds from the USB-C or 20W from the Lightning cable, only one device can be charged at a time. That’s plenty of power for an iPhone or iPad. Just don’t expect to charge a MacBook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the Mophie Powerstation Plus will be spending lots of time getting tossed in bags and pockets to take on the go, the solid aluminum frame and compact build are ideal. Four tiny indicator lights on the side of the power bank also let you know when it’s time for the battery itself to get juiced up. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Razer Kishi Ultra – Photos</h3></div></output></p></div><p id="best-controller"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best controller" id="backboneone">10.

Still, Apple has made some headway with the A18 chips found in the iPhone 16 models, especially the extra graphics core living in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/iphone-16-pro-max-review"><u>iPhone 16 Pro Max</u></a>. That’s coupled with higher-tier games coming to iOS like Assassin’s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil.

It connects directly to iPhone 16 and 15 models via USB-C for zero latency when you play, while the controller stretches, flanking the screen for a comfortable grip. On it comes full-size analog sticks, an 8-way D-pad, and hall-effect triggers. But the star of the show is the ultra-responsive and clicky Mecha-Tactile buttons. L4 and R4 buttons are also ready for some macro inputs. It's a major upgrade from just tapping away at the screen, and you can even use this controller away from your phone by connecting to a PC or iPad via USB-C. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Razer Nexus app makes it simple to tinker with the different buttons and controls. You can remap buttons, adjust dead zones, swap RGB lighting, and more. Unfortunately, using the Kishi Ultra with iOS is slightly more limited than with Android, so Sensa HD Haptics and Virtual Controller Mode aren’t available. Still, Razer makes it simple to access Apple Arcade, Steam Link, Xbox Game Pass, and PlayStation Remote Play, so you can get gaming quickly on your iPhone. </p></div><p id="best-portable-bluetooth-speaker"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best portable Bluetooth speaker" id="bosesoundflex">11.

Earlier models of the iPhone, such as the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone X</a>, came with wired Apple earbuds, a Lightning to 3.55mm headphone jack adapter, and a power adapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as part of Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new environmental goals</a>, more recent iPhone models only come with the USB-C charging cable (iPhone 15 and later), with an included recommendation that purchasers “re-use your current USB-A to lightning cables, power adapters, and headphones.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Can I use any USB-C charger for my iPhone? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The occasional rumor will circulate that it’s bad form to use non-Apple chargers on your iPhone.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> <span>is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As always, the most important Nvidia graphics card is the one you can actually buy, and Nvidia’s talked a big game for its RTX 5070, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">making the dubious but nuanced claim</a> it can deliver RTX 4090 performance for just $549. On February 28th, AMD will get its chance to intercept with the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612375/amd-will-reveal-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-february-28th">in a streaming event it just announced today</a>. But Nvidia has now made its own wiggle room, delaying the launch of the RTX 5070 from February to March 5th, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5070-family%2F" rel="sponsored">its product page reveals today</a>.</p><p>Nvidia will ship its $749 RTX 5070 Ti ahead of AMD’s event, though, on February 20th, a week from today.</p><p>AMD has telegraphed that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240173/amd-udna-gpu-ai-gaming-rdna-cdna-jack-huynh">won’t be competing</a> with Nvidia’s latest and greatest cards, so price is the one big lever that AMD can potentially pull in order to compete. (The AMD Radeon 9070 cards <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025#:~:text=in%20a%20branding%20slide%20for%20RDNA%204%2C%20AMD%20appears%20to%20suggest%20the%209070%20series%20will%20offer%20similar%20performance%20to%20the%20Nvidia%20GeForce%20RTX%204070%20Ti%20and%20RTX%204070%20Super.">appeared to be targeting</a> Nvidia 4070 Ti and 4070 Super levels of performance, not necessarily higher.) But Nvidia, a company that can now make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301811/nvidia-just-made-nearly-20-billion-in-pure-profit-in-a-single-quarter">$20 billion in pure profit in a single quarter</a>, could theoretically counter that if it feels it needs to, and now has more room to do so.</p><p>All that said, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-reportedly-working-on-gaming-radeon-rx-9000-gpu-with-32gb-memory">there is a rumor</a> that AMD may be working on a more potent card than its already-announced RX 9070 and 9070 XT, one with 32GB of RAM. AMD gaming marketing boss <a href="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1890123828367601764">Frank Azor says</a> the 9070 XT won’t be a 32GB card, but did not address the larger rumor.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to its announcement on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/579378232238800945" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Stalker's 1.2 patch has more than 1,700 individual fixes and improvements, including a large number of bug fixes, NPC behavioral changes, revamped visuals, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">There are truly too many changes to go over here in detail, but some of the major ones include an overhaul to NPC shooting accuracy, with reduced wall penetration and better shot randomization. The update also revamps how the game's stealth works, gives some enemies (like the Controller) new abilities, and improves NPC behavior overall. It improves performance during certain sequences, and fixes dozens of major and minor issues that could affect main story and side quests. More than 450 improvements were made to the game's map and level design, including several sections where the player could get stuck, such as X-17 Lab.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 was generally praised for its atmosphere and unique presentation when it first released last year. However, many players and critics noted its many bugs. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/">Stalker 2 review</a>, critic Richard Wakeling listed its "torrent of technical problems," but said that it's "difficult to not to fall under its enticing spell." With the introduction of this most recent patch and its predecessors, hopefully most of those bugs are a thing of the past. Stalker 2 is also available on Xbox Series X|S.</p>
