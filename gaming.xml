            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Funcom has announced that it will lay off a number of employees, despite the fact that the survival MMO has been the studio's most successful launch to date.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the Oslo-based developer will let an undisclosed number of staff members go in order to "restructure [its] teams and focus [its] resources from across projects and studios".</p>

<p>Funcom says this is needed because of the move to shift&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"from development to long-term live operation", which, to me, sounds rather like NetEase's shutting down of its Seattle studio after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' release, although whether a proportionate number of employees will be affected is unclear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs-training-dummy.jpg?itok=ZlPCk5cv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs-training-dummy.jpg?itok=4MlUBp2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is effectively what Funcom appears to be doing to its workforce.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, in the statement given to GI.biz by Funcom, the studio brags about&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s success, declaring that it has "shown incredible potential" and that it was "the biggest release" Funcom has enjoyed in its 32-year history.</p>

<p>To me, announcing how successful your latest game has been and then immediately revealing that you're laying off a tranche of employees comes across as rather unforgivably gauche, but perhaps I just don't have a corporation's perspective on things.</p>

<p>Of course, Funcom is right to say&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has been a big success. The game, which launched on PC back in June, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">managed to hit a million sales</a> within just two weeks of its launch. It's also due to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S at some point next year.</p>

<p>Still, Funcom is far from the only studio to lay off employees following a purple patch. Microsoft laid off thousands of employees earlier this year, many of them within the gaming sector, but Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">revenue actually increased</a> last fiscal year.</p>




<p>It's becoming a very common refrain, but it seems that making and releasing a successful game is no longer enough to guarantee the retention of your job in the gaming industry. Stay tuned to find out which successful studio inevitably becomes the next one to lay off employees regardless.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/they-finally-did-it-fallout-76-is-pretty-good-now-1845315294"><em>Fallout 76</em></a> is going to Ohio, and waiting for players in the new region is none other than the Ghoul from the popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138"><em>Fallout</em> TV show on Amazon</a>. This new expansion, which the devs claim is the biggest map expansion they’ve done yet, is out later this year and also adds bounty hunting, new characters, fresh mutated creatures to kill, and more.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7uCbEFtoNrbecM1hMWtY3u/fallout-76-burning-springs-first-look">Bethesda announced <em>Fallout 76′</em>s next big update,</a> Burning Springs. This new update is set to arrive in early December for all platforms and adds a brand new region to the game’s map. The region is named Burning Springs, hence the name of the update. This area is set in Ohio, a location that we’ve not seen much of in past <em>Fallout</em> media, giving the devs a bit of a blank slate to do whatever they want.&nbsp; And according to the people making it, Burning Springs is directly inspired by <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas.</em></p>

 <p>Here’s a big update video from Bethesda going into more detail about the new region, what players can expect to find there, and more:</p>   <p>“The new region is terrifyingly beautiful and will feel very familiar to fans, drawing its main influences from&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3 </em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>,” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76s-burning-springs-draws-its-main-influences-from-fallout-3-and-fallout-new-vegas-as-players-venture-to-a-whole-new-state-ohio/">creative director Jon Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We wanted it to remind folks of what they came to know and love in <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. And so when we set out to make this new region, the three pillars that we gave to the team were, ‘It’s got to have desert, death claws and Raiders,’ and to me, that captures the tone, the essence, and the danger of those games.”</p>

 <p>While it’s neat that the new area is inspired by past <em>Fallout</em> games, the big news with Burning Springs is that it will directly connect to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>. As mentioned, the Ghoul from the show will be an NPC that people can talk to in <em>Fallout 76′</em>s new region. Located in Highway Town, he will hand out various repeatable bounties to players and is even voiced by Walton Goggins himself. Another example of the show and game syncing up: The free update is launching at around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-teaser-deathclaw-new-vegas-gamescom-2000618496">same time season two of the show is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video</a>. And that’s not an accident.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>© Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>“Burning Springs is in total tonal tandem with <em>Fallout</em> season two, “Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em>. “It is poised to be our biggest update ever, and will coincide with the timing of the premiere of the Amazon <em>Fallout</em> series season two that’s coming this December.”</p>

 <p>The new location in <em>Fallout 76</em> will be added to the Western edge of the current map in a similar way to how the last world expansion, <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/fallout-76-skyline-valley">Skyline Valley</a>, was added in 2024 to the bottom of the map. To access this new area, players will travel across the Point Pleasant Bridge, leaving Appalachia and entering Ohio.</p> <p>Console players will have to wait until December to make that journey to Ohio to meet the Ghoul. But PC players willing to check out the update before launch will be able to start visiting the new region as early as tomorrow, October 2, via <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s testing server. Bethesda also says full patch notes for the big update will arrive at that time, too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A - 22 Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p>But devoted trainers and soup lovers who collect all eight cans will have a chance to win the grand prize, which, alongside the Switch 2, includes a copy of the upcoming Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and a limited-edition collectible can. Campbell’s Pokemon Pewter City Special Stew isn't available in stores, and the soup company calls the can a "true collector’s item."</p><p>All you have to do to enter the sweepstakes is collect Pokemon-themed cans of Campbell's soup and submit a photo of yourself and the soup cans on the <a href="https://www.campbells.com/challenge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Campbell's website</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After a few years in a console's life cycle, its common to see dips in price for its older games and hardware, but in 2025, the opposite has been true. The latest culprit of the rising cost of gaming is Xbox Game Pass, which we learned today would be getting new features, but a massive increase in monthly fees. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">Ultimate, the highest tier of the service, will cost 50 percent more</a>, going from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month. A breakdown of the new tiers is included below.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developer Funcom has announced it's laying off staff today as part of a restructuring process across the studio, with an undisclosed number of staff losing their jobs.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">statement to GamesIndustry</a>.biz, the Norway-based developer stated it's laying off staff as part of a restructuring effort towards: "releasing new content, features, and enhancements."</p>
<p>The statement continues: "The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues.</p>

<p>"This difficult process is starting now, and we cannot yet determine the exact impact. We are working to find new opportunities for those affected.</p>
<p>"Our focus now is to provide these team members with the support and guidance they need, and we ask for your understanding at this time as we will not make further comments during this process."</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, as mentioned both in the statement and widely reported, was a massive success for Funcom. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend">The game had a Steam concurrent player count of roughly 190,000 players during its launch</a>, with around 100,000 coming from a more expensive priority access version of the game. In recent months, the game is floating around roughly 20,000 concurrent daily players.</p><p>Funcom, a studio with ample history in both the MMO and survival game genres, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">had plans to continue supporting the game</a> post-launch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-first-major-dlc-and-story-update-on-10th-september">recently rolled out its first major free update to the game</a>. This, unfortunately, was not enough to stave off layoffs.</p>

<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has had a turbulent development and a rocky road to release, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lasombra-and-toreador-clans-added-to-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-base-game-following-fan-backlash-to-original-premium-dlc-plans">questionable paid-DLC plans that were subsequently reversed</a> (the playable clans that were going to be charged for are now included in the base game) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">an unconvincing preview showing</a>.</p><p>For all it might lack the RPG depth that followers of the Bloodlines series might want, and that players of the tabletop Vampire: The Masquerade game might want, Bloodlines 2 does appear to have good production values and strong cinematic character performances. Let's hope it turns okay.</p>

<p>Silent Hill is now a big focus</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1e85afedc4d17"><a title="Cronos" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e85afedc4d17/cronos.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> has proven to be a pleasant surprise since its launch at the start of September. Though not a masterpiece, by any means, it's a solid survival horror that's found a good home on the Switch 2, and reception has been largely positive.</p>
<p>Developer Bloober Team is seemingly pretty happy with how things have panned out too, with a recent <a href="https://www.stockwatch.pl/czat-inwestorow-gieldowych/piotr-babieno-prezes-karolina-nowak-wiceprezes-bloober-team-start-30-wrzesnia-o-godz-1100,797">investor chat</a> with CEO Piotr Babieno and Vice President Karolina Nowak (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/silent-hill-1-remake-now-a-big-focus-at-bloober-team-could-make-cronos-2">Push Square</a>) revealing the game's early sales performance.</p>
<p>Though the team have not gone into too many specifics, it calls Cronos a "huge success" and notes that the majority of sales have been on console. Specific details around its performance on Switch 2 have also not been revealed, but the team acknowledge that physical copies have largely been sold out across various regions (though it's important to note that its physical release has been somewhat limited compared to other titles).</p>
<p>Despite the game's early success, Bloober confirms it is currently not working on any DLC expansions, and nor is it looking at a full sequel at this time. It is, however, keen to expand on the IP in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Cronos is our first major IP. The team that created it has already begun work on a new project, but we definitely plan to further develop this IP in the future, within various fields of exploitation. We have high hopes for it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, the studio's biggest priority at the moment is the development of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> remake, which Konami commissioned following Bloober's stellar work on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is currently a timed exclusive for the PS5 (though only for a week or so longer), so there is a possibility, however slim, that it might show up on the Switch 2 at some point in the future. We'd be very keen to see it, though we're not getting our hopes up just yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom, the studio behind the hit survival MMO Dune: Awakening, has just announced it will layoff an undisclosed number of its staff in a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while also declaring Dune: Awakening to be "<em>the biggest release we've had in our 32-year-long history of making great games</em>."</p>



<p>Dune: Awakening launched to PC players this past June 10, 2025, and within its first month had surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">1 million copies sold</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">also being one of the most-played games in June</a>, and immediately shooting up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">one of the highest-earning games by revenue for 2025</a>.</p>



<p>It's clear, though, that a stunning launch, even the biggest and fastest-selling release in the studio's history, could not thwart layoffs. Or at least, it was clear to Funcom's bean counters and executives that it would have to reward the developers who worked hard to make Dune: Awakening the studio's biggest release ever with layoffs.</p>



<p>"<em>The game has already shown incredible potential and the right way forward is to focus our internal resources on releasing new content, features, and enhancements,</em>" the statement read per GI.Biz.</p>



<p>"<em>The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues. This difficult process is starting now, and we cannot yet determine the exact impact. We are working to find new opportunities for those affected.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Our focus now is to provide these team members with the support and guidance they need, and we as for your understanding at this time as we will not make further comments during this process</em>."</p>



<p>This news comes just off the back of Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-2-dlc-free-weekend/">releasing the first major DLC and content update</a> for Dune: Awakening, which also included a free weekend for players who had yet to jump into Arrakis to check the game out themselves.</p>



<p>The console launch mentioned above is set to come about a year after the game's PC launch, according <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-launch-console-cross-play-sony-microsoft/">to what Funcom told Wccftech at Gamescom 2025</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-about-buying-video-games-is-getting-more-confusing-and-expensive.1313863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Recently, I dug out my old Nintendo 3DS because I was craving simpler times. Really, I just wanted to play some games; to chip away at the mystery of <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, or solve a few puzzles in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8325077/boxboy-nintendo-3ds-review"><em>BoxBoy</em></a>, without the headaches of system updates or subscriptions or any of that stuff. It’s been refreshing. And my choice has felt especially prescient of late, given just how much more complicated and expensive modern game consoles have become. It’s not a new problem, but it keeps getting worse.</p><div><p>The most recent example comes from Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">Today, the company announced changes to its Game Pass subscription service, which, yes, also include a price hike</a>. Game Pass Ultimate is now $29.99 per month, a hefty $10 jump, and more games and features are being added to justify the higher price. There have also been some name changes. What used to be known as the “core” tier is now called “essential,” while “standard” is now “premium.” There are a bunch of charts to help you understand the differences between the tiers. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOtXisIDRi9/?hl=en">Trying to figure out what to choose is like living in a <em>Portlandia</em> sketch</a>.</p></div><div><p>Of course, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max">subscription prices rise all the time</a>, but the timing of this latest hike from Microsoft feels particularly egregious. It comes just a few weeks removed from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">Xbox hardware also getting more expensive</a>, to the point that an Xbox Series X now costs $150 more than it did at launch five years ago. We’re living in a tariff-influenced bizarro world, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">where game consoles actually get more expensive over time, rather than cheaper the older they get</a>. And it’s not just Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">Sony has been bumping up prices, as well</a>, and just released a new version of its digital-only PS5 in Europe — but instead of adding features or capabilities, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789686/sony-digital-ps5-slim-less-storage-europe">it has less storage for the same price</a>.</p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Even Nintendo is not immune. While, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">unlike its predecessor</a>, the Switch 2 hasn’t seen a price hike (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/717611/nintendo-switch-price-increase-risk-safety">yet</a>), its launch was filled with confusion around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656049/nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-price">the upgrade costs</a> of “Switch 2 editions,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dsite%253Atheverge.com%2Bswitch%2Bvirtual%2Bgame%2Bcards%26oq%3Dsite%253Atheverge.com%2Bswitch%2Bvirtual%2Bgame%2Bcards%26gs_lcrp%3DEgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg60gEIOTEzOWowajeoAgCwAgA%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8" rel="sponsored">how virtual game cards work</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">those weird “game-key” cartridges that don’t actually have games on them</a>. And I still don’t understand why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642436/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-f-zero-hands-on">games from the GameCube</a>, a console that launched in 2001, are only playable for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers with a Switch 2. I’m pretty sure my OLED Switch can handle <em>F-Zero GX</em>.</p></div><p>When you add all of these elements together, it can feel like chaos. Just choosing a console is hard enough, and now you have to factor in the timing of it. When is the safest, cheapest time to buy an Xbox or PlayStation? There’s no longer a clear answer, but it’s probably right now before the hikes get worse. Once you have the box, then you have to figure out which versions of games to play and decide if you want to invest in a subscription to get the most out of your hardware. That, of course, means picking the tier that suits you best. Most of these issues have been brewing for some time, but it feels like we’re now at an inflection point where everything seems particularly frustrating.</p><p>There are some good things about this generation, of course, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/781303/microsoft-sony-playstation-xbox-future-of-gaming-console">the slow erosion of console exclusives</a>. But I mostly just find myself annoyed, pining for the days when buying a console and playing a game didn’t require so much forethought. Do I want to go back to the days of the Nintendo 64? Not especially (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">well, maybe a little</a>). But it is nice to know that when I want to go back, that old hardware will still do exactly what it was designed for.</p><p>And, really, that is what used to be the main sales pitch for a game console: it just works. You buy a device, you don’t have to fuss with it, and it’s clear what games work on it. That’s no longer the case. As technology has improved to the point of giving us wonderful experiences like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784888/ghost-of-yotei-review-ps5"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, it’s also been a monkey paw situation. Rising prices, confusing upgrades, constant subscription pushes — together, these form the headache that’s at the center of modern gaming. It’s enough that playing a 15-year-old handheld feels like an escape.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We've done a lot of eye-widening on this website about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-cutting-the-gags-borderlands-4s-pc-specs-say-it-still-needs-100gb-of-ssd-space">lofty</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-the-updated-system-requirements-for-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-and-it-looks-like-a-bigun">requests</a> of certain games’ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forspokens-pc-system-requirements-are-still-weird-so-lets-fix-them">system</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2s-system-requirements-are-as-harsh-as-they-look">requirements</a>, but it’s the recommended specs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-remastered">Deus Ex Remastered</a> that might just send my brow surging through the ceiling and into the fuselage of a passing Airbus, killing everyone on board. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-remastered-a-modernized-version-of-ion-storms-classic-cyberpunk-rpg-releases-early-next-year">You’ve seen it</a>. You’ve seen how it only adds, at most, five years’ worth of graphical nous to the 2000 classic. So, per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3131640/Deus_Ex_Remastered/">Steam</a>: a Core i7, 16GB of RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce RT-goddamn-X 2080? No. I’m sorry. No way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://x.com/Mab_Devv/status/1971814555652444193">As noted on Xitter by Mab</a>, developer of fellow imsim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525040/ETOS/">ETOS</a>, that’s more than what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a> was asking for its own recommended hardware. And while that was nine years ago, it’s still quite clearly a more proficient user of visual whiz-bang tech than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> Remastered is. At no point, for instance, does Adam Jensen ever resemble a haunted bottle of children’s shampoo:</p>

</figure>
<p>Also, they spelt 'Nvidia' as 'Nvida'.</p>
<p>You must think us fools, Aspyr. Fools! To believe that a graphics card which cost 699 Ameridollars at launch could possibly be necessary to render the remaster’s meagre, sometimes actively vibes-quelling graphics changes. The original can run on a netbook, assuming any working ones still exist. There’s just no way. You’re lying. You must be. Oh god. Oh god what if they’re not lying.</p><p>What if you <em>actually</em> need, in 2025, high-end components to comfortably run a game built around something released a quarter-century ago? What if we’ve been played, and the past three years of stuttering, fan-torturing Unreal Engine 5 performance disasters were just a distraction from the true threat of questionable Blair-era remakes? What if ray tracing did nothing wrong and Randy Pitchford was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">only trying to warn us</a>? That’s a reality I’m not sure I can face.</p>
<p>Y’know what, maybe some things are better left unbenchmarked. Sadly, there doesn’t seem to be much else for starving Deus Ex fans (hello) to look forward to instead, with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-deus-ex-game-in-the-works-for-two-years-reportedly-cancelled-almost-100-staff-laid-off-at-eidos-montreal">Mankind Divided sequel cancelled</a> last year and Jensen VA Elias Toufexis <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-voice-actor-elias-toufexis-bids-goodbye-to-adam-jensen-and-calls-the-games-industry-a-disaster-zone">vocally doubting</a> the series’ future. With that cancellation came 100 staff layoffs at developers Eidos Montreal, a studio that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eidos-montreal-lay-off-75-workers-in-further-cuts-to-the-deus-ex-studio">cut jobs further</a> earlier this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has added a number of new games to Xbox Game Pass today as part of a major shakeup that has seen the Ultimate tier increase in price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-rises-to-30-a-month-microsoft-adds-more-day-one-games-and-throws-in-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-to-help-justify-the-cost">Microsoft has hiked the price of Ultimate from $19.99 to $29.99 a month</a>, while renaming and upgrading the other tiers. As part of the justification for the price rise, Microsoft added Ubisoft+ Classics for the first time ever to Ultimate, and the games that are part of that subscription are now a part of Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, Warner Bros.’ smash hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> is now available across Ultimate and the new Premium tier (which replaces Standard), but it’s not in the new Essential tier (which replaces Core).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Premium gets more than 40 new games available today, including Blizzard’s action role-playing game Diablo 4 and the aforementioned Hogwarts Legacy. Microsoft said Premium gets new Xbox-published games within a year of their launch, but, interestingly, that excludes Call of Duty titles. So don't expect to play Black Ops 7 day one as a Premium subscriber when it comes out this November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Essential, meanwhile, is a curated catalog of over 50 games playable on both console and PC. The Essential library is now fully playable on PC, featuring games like Hades, Cities: Skylines – Remastered, Stardew Valley, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the full

                <p>Frictional Games, the team behind horror hits like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soma-review/1900-6416245/" data-ref-id="1900-6416245">SOMA</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/amnesia-the-dark-descent-review/1900-6280302/" data-ref-id="1900-6280302">Amnesia</a>, didn't show up at this year's Horror Game Awards Halloween Showcase, but it's kicking spooky season off right with a brand-new reveal. Working with Kepler Interactive, the studio released a creepy teaser for a new project called Hotel Samsara. The short video features mysterious shots of an eerie, empty hotel, accompanied by strange chanting in the background, ending with a voice saying "something new."</p><p>Along with the teaser, a <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website went live</a> that looks like it's promoting a fancy investment opportunity. It promises a luxury experience and even includes fake reviews. But fans quickly realized this wasn't just a normal game announcement--it was the start of a hidden puzzle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmHnnvQQxaE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SmHnnvQQxaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3906667/soma-developers-frictional-games-teasing-next-title-with-hotel-samsara-video/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">It's been pointed out</a> that one paragraph had certain bolded letters. When put together, the letters spelled out "steganog," which might be short for "steganography"--hiding secret messages inside normal text or images.</p><p>After signing up for email updates, users received strange messages with hidden phrases like "FOLLOWERS OF __." These clues sparked a full-blown mystery, with fans delving into the website, emails, and even old game files to uncover answers. Many believe this new project could be connected to SOMA, or possibly a brand-new horror story.</p><p>As the community solved clue after clue, Frictional Games posted a thank-you message along with the teaser. "We really wanted to try and create something fun to show you a bit of what we've been working on," its said. "What we didn't expect is just how much you would impress us with your ability to all come together as a community and work with each other to solve everything we threw at you." The studio even admitted it had to make the puzzles harder once it saw how quickly fans were solving them.</p><p>Frictional also said how much fun they had watching the community come together--not just to solve puzzles, but also to create jokes, memes, and theories.</p><p>"It's been a pleasure, waking up excited every morning to check the Discord and seeing which rabbit holes you ended up falling into," it continued. While we still don't know exactly what Hotel Samsara is, one thing is clear: Frictional has once again captured fans' attention with their unique mix of mystery, horror, and storytelling. Whether this turns out to be SOMA 2 or something completely new, the hype has already begun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Summerfall Studios (a developer founded in part by Dragon Age writer David Gaider) made its debut with Stray Gods, a musical game starring modern-day adaptations of the ancient Greek pantheon. Its next game, Malys, is a massive departure in both tone and gameplay. Earlier this April, Summerfall announced a Kickstarter for this new project, but unfortunately, it failed to reach its funding goal. However, the game still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3449690/view/525346350588493892?l=english">entered early access this past June</a>, and now, just a few months later, <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">it's hitting 1.0</a>, launching on Steam on October 24.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdOC7dwPUzM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdOC7dwPUzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This deckbuilder tells the story of Noah, a demon hunter, on his quest to slay the Malys, an evil creature with the city in a chokehold. The game's combat encounters are exorcisms, and you'll play and burn cards in order to expose demons' true names and expel them from their hosts. According to <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">a blogpost on Summerfall's website</a>, the 1.0 update will also include "cloud saves, a fully playable story, all three regions and the final boss fight, as well as a full scale music update across the game."</p><p>The blog post also mentions that the price will increase slightly at launch, so if you're interested in grabbing it cheaper (it's currently $9.99 in the US), make sure to do so before October 24.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/01/malys-a-deckbuilder-from-the-stray-gods-team-enters-10-later-this-month]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/airpods-pro-3-review-heartrate-v-shaped-sound</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-airpods-pro-3-are-everything-i-wanted-and-they%E2%80%99re-crucially-flawed.1313815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a long time the AirPods Pros have operated in a very specific classification for me. They aren’t as well tuned as the best IEMs, nor do they have any of the “good” codecs that nerds love, but if you have an iPhone and want something that “just works” then they are the one you get. They are a perfectly acceptable tool, and I was more or less satisfied to replace lost buds and broken cases Ship of Theseus style but was in no rush to replace them. Then I made the mistake of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3KnMyojEQU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turning on the last Apple event</a>, saw they had added a heart rate monitor and cursed out loud. Apple had gotten my ass.</p><p><strong>Matters of the heart</strong></p><p>Last year I had a heart scare that lasted for several months. My heart was skipping beats occasionally, so my primary care physician recommended that I go to a cardiologist. This is something that happens more and more as you approach middle age, and the constant worry took a lot out of me. In my panic I did the thing many people do: seeing if spending money on gear could solve an existential problem.&nbsp;</p><p>When you begin to become aware of your own mortality, you will often end up at Apple. The actually good heart rate monitors are chest straps, but the wrist based ones do a decent enough job for exercise and occasionally flagging potential problems. Overwhelmingly the agreed-upon form factor is a smartwatch, but I am not a watch person no matter how many times I have tried because I fidget a bit too much and I don’t need another screen. They still make monitors shaped like fitbits that lack a display, but they’re ugly as sin or require a subscription. Smart Rings are promising, but none of them are particularly compelling aside from the Oura Ring, which requires a subscription, and it’s simply below my dignity to pay a subscription to a ring. I would love a good heart rate monitor that just looks like a plain metal band and is neither a narc nor draining my wallet monthly, but that product does not exist.</p><figure><figcaption>The Apple Watch wins by default.</figcaption></figure><p>This is why Apple wins almost all the time by default. The entire wearables market is a mess, but the Apple Watch is simple, works with an ecosystem many people already have, and is a no brainer to give to an ailing or elderly relative. Health has become the primary reason many people buy Apple Watches, because unlike a lot of the technology currently propping up the unstable tech bubble, “I would like to know if I’m dying” is an easily parsable pitch to most people.&nbsp;</p><p>I went back and forth about buying an Apple Watch for a few months until, after half a dozen doctor’s visits, tons of stress, and a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/holter-monitor/about/pac-20385039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holter monitor</a>, my doctor said “yeah no you’re fine, just keep an eye on it.” So I backbenched it until Apple announced that the AirPods Pro 3 would have heart rate monitors, thus providing an elegant solution to something I had been wracking my brain trying to solve. It would not replace going to the doctor, but it’s a clear upgrade that would require me to change absolutely no behavior since I live in New York and have at least one AirPod in whenever I go outside. In a bit of serendipity, the announcement coincided with me getting a refund from Midea for the recalled <a href="https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air conditioner I had initially reported on</a>, which added up to basically the exact amount of money I needed to buy the AirPods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>An improved fit&nbsp;</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>The case is a slightly different size from the previous one so you will need a new protective case if you use those. I went with neon green this time.</figcaption></figure><p>If the sole improvements in the AirPods Pro 3s had been a heart rate monitor and an extended battery, that probably would have been enough for me to shell out my cash, but there were thankfully other perks to make it a no brainer. One of the failings of the previous AirPod Pro models was the tips and the fit. AirPod Pro tips will eventually just get kind of shitty and rip, so there’s an entire aftermarket ecosystem of alternatives made by the same people who produce IEM tips. The aftermarket tip alternatives range from silicone to foam, although it’s difficult to tell long term if they will actually do a better job at tuning the headphone outside of improving the durability. Apple this time opted for a hybrid of the two, which bypasses the flaw of foam (it gets nasty) while leaning in on its strengths (a fit that really just gets in there.) Only time and abuse will tell if this was a wise decision.</p><p>Aside from improved waterproofing, one other big physical change is that the AirPods Pro 3 are just shaped differently, more like an ear canal. As a result, the buds get really in there and do a fairly good job at maintaining their grip. It is intimate and a tiny bit bizarre. My old AirPods Pro 2 did not fall out of my ears as frequently as I’ve seen other people complain about, but it happened enough to be a jump scare if I was anywhere near an open street grate. The AirPods Pro 3 feel much more secure, which I assume is necessary for the heart rate sensors to function. This also has the added improvement of having a better seal on the headphones, which in turn assists with noise cancellation.</p><figure><figcaption>Noise cancellation is scary good now.<span></span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-airpods-pro-3-the-ultimate-audio-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a></figcaption></figure><p>Though Apple boasted in their presentation that their noise cancellation had been radically improved, I was not prepared for how good it had gotten in practice until I tried them on. Part of it may just be that “new earbud” sensation when you turn on a fresh piece of hardware, but when I picked them up from an Apple Store in a very weird New York mall I was floored by how much of the world got entirely shut off. They did such a good job at locking me into my space that I missed two different buses home and had to get a car.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Everything is better except the sound</strong></h2><p>The AirPods Pro 3 sounds markedly different this time around, and this is the part where I have seen the most visceral reactions online. AirPods have always been tuned in a way that’s crowd pleasing but inoffensive – not fully neutral, but something you could give to basically everybody. There are two very notable differences in tuning from the AirPods Pro 2 to 3. First is the bass, which is noticeably more substantial now but may be a bit too much for some people. The second and more egregious is the treble, which is sharper and a bit more pronounced. They took a sound signature that was already slightly “V-shaped” and made the V deeper.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Apple RUINED my favourite product - AirPods Pro 3" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VC1t56agJ7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I tend to like a “bright” pair of headphones, and there are parts of how these headphones sound that I like a lot (the midrange and the sound stage in particular are great). But the line between clear and fatiguing is razor thin. It has been fascinating to see the reactions. Linus from Linus Tech tips got more pissed off than I have ever seen him get about a product (and had measurements by headphone expert DMS to back him up). Another YouTuber I like, Super* Review, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLk_VXvXavg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roasted Linus a little for that</a>, although claims he has his own quibbles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-d0H_5lAfQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Headphone Show</a> was more measured than Linus’ original reaction but echoed many of his concerns. Uniformly, people who care about headphones seem a bit concerned, and their concern is justified – the changes Apple made are showy, bound to alienate people and not great if the goal of buying AirPods is simply “listening to music.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Apple AirPods Pro 3 Review: Disappointment of the Year?" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-d0H_5lAfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"The AirPods Pro 3 goes for a more V-shaped sound signature, prioritizing a plump bass response and sparkly treble,” Griffin Silver aka “listener” from <a href="http://headphones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headphones.com</a> told me via DM. “While many consumers may ultimately find this more exciting sound to be an improvement, it's a bit of a shame that the more reserved, natural sound of the AirPods Pro 2 is being replaced by a sound profile that just seems overall a bit less safe"</p><p>This also points to a larger problem with Apple products, and that’s one of hubris. Apple spends an obscene amount of time and money to create products that they believe will satisfy the greatest number of consumers. They have mountains of research to back up their claims. You are not supposed to EQ the AirPods Pro 3, you are supposed to enjoy them. And to some degree they are correct; the headphones are a marvel in how they correct for the ear canal of the listener. But making a fairly noticeable change to how the successor to your flagship audio product sounds without giving people accustomed to it the ability to EQ it close to its predecessor is going to ruffle some feathers. They went from an inoffensive headphone tuning to something fairly divisive and a little tacky.&nbsp;</p><p>How Apple is approaching the sound signature of the AirPods Pro 3 is similar to how they have tuned their cameras: impressive to normal people but a little garish to anybody who is even semi-professional. There is no real way to <em>actually </em>EQ these headphones. Nobody would be as mad if they had thrown a Parametric EQ in a submenu for the people who are freaks and called it a day, or even thrown in an EQ profile that shifts it closer to the AirPods Pro 2. EQing is a feature that even the cheapest good wireless earbuds all have. If Sony ever pulled this shit with their headphones they’d be tarred and feathered for it, but Apple knows best.</p><h2><strong>Seamless heart rate monitoring</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Tiny heart rate sensors are in both buds.<span></span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-airpods-pro-3-the-ultimate-audio-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a></figcaption></figure><p>The entire reason for me getting this thing was to monitor my heart rate, and on that front the AirPods Pro 3 are fantastic given the form factor. If you are in the Apple ecosystem they just kind of integrate seamlessly, and work fairly well by all accounts. <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/09/airpods-pro-3-in-depth-sports-fitness-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DC Rainmaker</a> is one of the better reviewers out there for wearables and was blown away by how it performed, while noting some variability. Fit seems to make a huge difference on the performance of the hear trate tracker, and making sure the AirPods are positioned in the correct way with sufficient depth is key. I’ve read a lot of people online who have sized down their tips to get a snug fit.</p><figure><figcaption>Screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>I could not rigorously test the heart rate monitor while lifting weights and cycling because my right foot shattered into several pieces and currently has metal pins protruding from it, but I am able to log my short walks using the <a href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iWalkFree</a>, a task that is far more strenuous than it appears. The AirPods Pro 3 will periodically update your heart rate during the day or continuously when you use the Fitness app, so I have been using the app to log my walks. Third party support for the heart rate monitoring feature feels patchy currently, which makes sense given that the ecosystem was built with the Apple Watch in mind. You should not treat the AirPods Pro 3 as a medical device when it comes to heart health, but I am supremely impressed that Apple found a way to add beat tracking to active workouts in a product I already live with every day without changing much of the form factor.</p><h2>(Beta) <strong>Translation</strong></h2><p>Apple has been fairly quiet about Apple Intelligence, perhaps because they spent a ton of time positioning it as the next big thing and so far everyone hates it because it sucks. One very noticeable exception during the last presentation was the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Live Translation</a> feature that’s now in opt-in beta for AirPods Pro 3, and AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4.</p><p>The idea of having a universal translator that’s just inside your ears has been a tech dream for decades, that’s just the Babel Fish from<em> The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy</em>. As far as AI products go, it’s a legible and practical idea that you could explain to an elderly parent in a half a sentence as opposed to “what if I asked my glasses how to make a sauce and they couldn’t.” <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/products/destroy-ai-t-shirt-black" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our stance on the topic of AI is clear</a>, but it is worth testing to see if it gets even moderately close to how it was pitched. But because I neither need nor respect live AI translation, I decided to test it in the funniest way possible: watching artsy foreign movies from the 70s.</p><p>As of this writing, only a handful of language models are available for the Live Translation beta: English (US), English (UK), French, German, Portuguese (Brazilian), and Spanish (Spain). These are functionally very limited and safe models to start with when it comes to machine translation. If you are wondering if you can translate between US English and UK English, I want you to know that was the first thing I tried and the answer is no – you can’t have it translate Cockney slang into regular English. The translation mode requires you to download local models in case you go offline. You can also force on-device mode for translation in the settings, but Apple warns that this is not nearly as accurate.</p><figure><figcaption>My experience with live translation is that it will occasionally work in fits and starts but it's on a significant delay, messes up basic phrases, gets easily snagged by ambient noise, and the noise warning interrupts the translation.</figcaption></figure><p>The first thing you will notice if you try to watch a foreign movie with your AirPods Pro 3 is that it’s a terrible idea. It’s not just that there is a 3 second delay to everything, but the translation is contingent upon the speech being accurately picked up to begin with. The AI will often misunderstand what’s being said, causing the translation to shift in and out of coherence. If there is any odd noise, the iPhone gives you a way too wordy warning about reducing ambient noise every single time, interrupting the flow of whatever it was translating. The combination of these factors leads to a surreal experience that feels like you’re having a stroke. I even tried various Spanish children’s TV shows and YouTube channels but it produced nothing approaching legibility. This feature only succeeded intermittently for me with the native speakers in Fassbinder's <em>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul</em>. I even occasionally tried it while listening to adjacent conversations on walks out, and even then it never seemed to fully work. The most plausible use case at this point would be talking to someone who speaks a different language and who is saying simple phrases clearly and loudly at you, but I can’t even begrudgingly say that I care at this point.</p><h2><strong>Apple can never fail</strong></h2><p>I’m so conflicted on the AirPods Pro 3. On several basic features (waterproofing, battery, health, noise cancellation, fit) it is a clear, generational improvement. It solved a problem with wearables that I could not solve despite trying everything. For listening to podcasts and taking phone calls it’s fantastic. As a health and lifestyle product, Apple has created a fitness product that others will be tested against for years, a piece of technology that simply works for gym freaks and people in lycra with wraparound sunglasses.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet the sound signature of the AirPods Pro 3 is so divisive, weird, chintzy, and distinctly un-Apple. They spent more money than I can conceive of and did obscene amounts of research to make the most advanced earbuds on Earth sound kind of corny. It felt like they went with a sound signature that normal people could tell was different from its predecessor, without interrogating if that was a good idea. And though they could fix these with an update and include at least a fraction of the customizability of every other earbud on the market, I don’t think they will. To do so would be to admit that Apple was wrong about something, and who the fuck are you to tell them that?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone"><h3>The EA Sale Is Bad News For Everyone</h3></a><p>Except--you'll never believe it--the guys who already have the money</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/airpods-pro-3-review-heartrate-v-shaped-sound]]></content:encoded>

<p>The patch notes (via <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-1-2-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>) aren't particularly detailed, but they cover both the base Switch version of the game <em>and</em> for those playing on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here's the rundown of all the updates now available for Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 on Switch:</p>
<h3>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Version 1.2.0 Patch Notes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>- Several fixes and adjustments made to improve the gameplay experience on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.<br>
- Several issues fixed to ensure smooth gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890zskyxq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So... pretty vague, as usual! Perhaps just the usual smoothing out minor issues. The duo are already playable at 4k resolution docked and 1080p handheld, so we'll take any minor updates.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amazon-luna-re-launch-later-this-year-prime-subs-library-cloud-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-re-launching-amazon-luna-later-this-year-introduces-new-party-games-focused-gamenight-feature.1313785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon is re-launching its Amazon Luna service later this year with a new design and new features, including a rotating library of games available to Amazon Prime subscribers, playable through Luna's cloud services.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna#ags-MediaPopup">long blog post on the Amazon Games site</a>, Amazon announces the overhaul coming to Amazon Luna while touting its belief that "<em>gaming needs a rethink</em>." It frames the fact that there are more users playing games on mobile devices than there are on PCs or consoles as the videogame industry's failure to "<em>welcome the 100s of millions of people who want to experience the magic of playing games on the big screen but feel left out - those who don't see themselves as 'gamers,' those who don't want to spend a fortune on hardware, or those who just want something simple, social, and fun</em>."</p>



<p>Without exploring the possibility that the 100s of millions of people who play games on their phones might possibly prefer to play the select few games they enjoy that way, the blog post continues to introduce "<em>a completely redesigned and reimagined Amazon Luna that combines innovative social party games with amazing blockbusters to make every night in your house the perfect game night to share with your family and friends</em>."</p>



<p>A new trailer shared along with the post shows the new Luna in action, which will be an added feature for Amazon Prime subscribers "<em>at no additional cost</em>" to the current subscription price they already pay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing: The All-New Amazon Luna" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ajawdjs6KKA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The two key features coming in this redesign include GameNight, a library of Amazon Luna-exclusive titles mostly comprised of party and social games that can be played through your phone, just like the widely popular JackBox Party titles. Its featured launch title is 'Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg', which is "<em>a human-built, AI-powered improv courtroom game where players</em> <em>invent outrageous characters, spin wild stories, and do whatever it takes to defend their testimonies before Judge Snoop Dogg</em>."</p>



<p>There will be a total of 25 titles launching for GameNight whenever the new Luna arrives, with new variations of Angry Birds, Exploding Kittens, Flappy Golf Party, Taboo, Clue, and Ticket to Ride, to name a few.</p>



<p>The other key feature coming to this new version of Amazon Luna is a new rotating library of games, including Hogwarts Legacy, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Dave the Diver, Dead Island 2, Borderlands 3, and more, all playable through the cloud. There's a base library of games available through your regular Amazon Prime subscription, but there's also a premium tier to the new Amazon Luna that'll get you other big titles, including "<em>EA Sports FC 25, LEGO DC Super Villains, Team Sonic Racing, and Batman: Arkham Knight</em>."</p>



<p>These titles will all be playable through any Bluetooth-compatible controller, or, of course, an Amazon Luna controller will work.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-review-hardware-service-and-performance/">When Wccftech reviewed Amazon Luna two years ago</a>, we concluded that it was the content, not the hardware and cloud experience, that held it back. This redesign seems to try to address exactly that. But it's more than lofty for Amazon to try suggesting that "<em>gaming needs a rethink,</em>" as if those who already enjoy games in their own way, whether that's through consoles, PCs, or mobile devices, are currently doing it wrong.</p>



<p>We'll see what this overhaul does for Amazon Luna when it arrives sometime later in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month.1313779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is raising the price of its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription again and rebranding some of its Xbox Game Pass plans. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans">Starting today</a>, Game Pass Ultimate will be priced at $29.99 per month instead of $19.99 — a 50 percent increase. Microsoft is attempting to justify the price hike with a variety of upgrades across all of its Xbox Game Pass tiers.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Core is being rebranded to Xbox Game Pass Essential, and the Standard plan is now Xbox Game Pass Premium.</p><p>“What’s new for everyone across all three Xbox Game Pass plans is bigger game libraries, including PC games across each of the plans,” explains Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “There is also unlimited cloud gaming, which is new to Essential and Premium subscribers.”</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-ultimate"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</h2></p></div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is moving from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month, which is a surprising $10 increase. While Microsoft increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate last year without improving the subscription, it’s adding a bunch of improvements this time around. “[Game Pass Ultimate] will now include access to more than 400 titles globally, this includes the majority of our partners who want to continue to bring their future games to Xbox Game Pass,” Blackwell explains.</p><p>Microsoft is adding 45 games to Game Pass Ultimate today alone, including <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, a variety of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> titles, and many more Ubisoft games. “We’re also now giving access to more than 75 day one releases each year,” Blackwell says. “That’s a 50 percent increase over the day one titles we provided last year.”</p><p>Ubisoft Plus Classics is also now part of Game Pass Ultimate, a perk that provides access to a selection of Ubisoft games across console, PC, and cloud. On November 18th, Fortnite Crew will also be part of Ultimate, which gives subscribers the Fortnite Battle Pass, 1,000 V-bucks each month, and more. “With Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft Plus Classics, those combined add about $28 a month in value to Ultimate subscribers,” Blackwell says.</p><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is also coming out of beta and getting 1440p resolution support and bitrate improvements for certain games on select devices. These cloud improvements are exclusive to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>Finally, Microsoft is also reworking its rewards program. Ultimate subscribers can now earn up to $100 per year (100,000 points) in the store just by playing games.</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-premium"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Premium</h2></p></div><p>Game Pass Premium will be priced at the same $14.99 monthly price of the existing Standard subscription, but it will now have a bigger library of games to choose from. More than 200 games will be available on both Xbox and PC, giving Game Pass Premium subscribers access to PC games for the first time — including <em>Diablo IV</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> today.</p><p>Game Pass Premium is also getting unlimited cloud access for the first time, meaning you no longer need a Game Pass Ultimate subscription to get access to Xbox Cloud Gaming. Premium subscribers will be able to stream titles from the Game Pass library, as well as select titles they own.</p><p>While Game Pass Premium won’t get access to day one launch titles like Game Pass Ultimate does, Microsoft is now making a clear commitment to bring new Xbox-published games to this subscription tier “within a year of their launch.” This excludes <em>Call of Duty </em>titles, but every other Microsoft-owned Xbox game will be available.</p><p>Microsoft is also expanding its in-game Game Pass perks down to the Premium subscription, instead of being locked to Ultimate. Subscribers will get in-game benefits in games like <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, and <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X</em>. Premium subscribers will also be able to earn up to $50 a year by playing games through Microsoft’s rewards program.</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-essential"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Essential</h2></p></div><p>Game Pass Essential will be priced at the same $9.99 monthly price of the existing Core subscription, but it will now include more than 50 titles in the library instead of the more than 25 games that were available in Core. You’ll also be able to play all of these titles on PC or console, and there’s even unlimited cloud access, which was previously only available through the Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p><p>Essential subscribers will also be able to stream select games they own, as well as access in-game benefits from Riot Games and earn up to $25 a year in the store through Microsoft’s revamped rewards program.</p><div><p id="pc-game-pass-price-changes-and-more"><h2>PC Game Pass price changes and more</h2></p></div><p>Microsoft is also increasing the price of its PC Game Pass subscription today, moving from $11.99 a month to $16.49 monthly — a nearly 40 percent increase. Microsoft isn’t trying to justify this increase with any added extras for PC players, though.</p><p>“The only change happening for PC Game Pass subscribers is that they won’t be getting Ubisoft Plus Classics, but they’ll be getting about 50 additional Ubisoft titles across PC Game Pass,” Blackwell says. “It will continue to get day one titles.”</p><p>With PC games also being added to both Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium today, I get the feeling that Microsoft may eventually rethink its dedicated subscription for PC gamers and try and tempt subscribers over to its Essential, Premium, or Ultimate tiers instead.</p><p>While the Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium tiers aren’t seeing price increases in the US today, pricing will be adjusted for these plans in some markets. All existing Game Pass Core and Standard subscribers will be automatically upgraded to the Essential and Premium plans. Any price changes begin today for new subscribers, or at the next billing cycle for existing Game Pass subscribers.</p><p>The price increases come after Microsoft has been increasingly investing in Game Pass deals over the past year. “This last year alone we’ve made our largest investment in Game Pass so far, signing deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog over time,” Blackwell says.</p><p>Microsoft is also set to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">increase the price of its Xbox consoles</a> in the US again later this week, with the Xbox Series X now $150 more than it was just six months ago. Microsoft and Asus also just announced that the upcoming Xbox Ally X handheld will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784286/xbox-handheld-ally-x-price-preorder">priced at $999.99</a> in the US.</p><p>“We understand price increases are never fun for anybody, but we’re trying to reinforce by adding more value to these plans as well,” Blackwell says. “It’s something we don’t take lightly, and we’re listening to the feedback of players and the community to try to provide them with more of what they’re asking for.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is finally coming out of its preview state, more than five years after the streaming service first launched in 2020. “We’re officially removing the beta tag from Xbox Cloud Gaming,” says Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The beta tag removal coincides with some key changes to Xbox Cloud Gaming today, and a big <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">price increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>. Microsoft is also expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming to more Game Pass tiers, and it’s improving the streaming quality and resolution exclusively for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>“We’ll have our highest streaming quality yet for Ultimate subscribers,” Blackwell says. “It’ll go up to 1440p for select games and select devices, and still deliver the shortest wait times for players.”</p><p>Some Xbox Cloud Gaming users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/776320/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-limitations-strategy-notepad">already spotted</a> the 1440p support in games like <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> last month, with bitrates that can peak at 27Mbps. Most Xbox Cloud Gaming streams average at around 10Mbps right now, with some devices able to access a better 17Mbps stream. An upgrade to 27Mbps should greatly reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of game streams.</p><p>It’s the first major visual quality improvement to Xbox Cloud Gaming since Microsoft upgraded the hardware in the service to Xbox Series X-like blades. The previous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527432/microsoft-xcloud-server-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade-game-streaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming upgrade in 2021</a> allowed games to load faster and have improved frame rates, all because the hardware enabled support for Xbox Series S / X-optimized titles.</p><p>It’s not immediately clear whether Microsoft is doing any hardware upgrades to enable 1440p support and higher bitrates this time around. I asked the company to comment on whether PC-like hardware is being used in its Xbox Cloud Gaming configurations to enable these upgrades, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p><p>The expansion of Xbox Cloud Gaming to Microsoft’s new Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium tiers will allow many more Xbox fans to access cloud games they own or titles from the Game Pass library. It’s the first time, beyond the free-to-play <em>Fortnite </em>streaming, that Microsoft has enabled cloud access beyond its top Ultimate plan.</p><p>The 1440p upgrade is still limited to select games and select devices, and Microsoft needs to go further to match the impressive quality from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/775222/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-hands-on">Nvidia’s GeForce Now service</a>. I suspect we’ll have to wait until Microsoft is ready with its next-gen console launch to see a bigger upgrade to 4K resolution, higher frame rates, and even better bitrates.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789461/xbox-cloud-gaming-launch-1440p-resolution-bitrate-changes]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft are reshuffling their Xbox Game Pass subscription tiers and hiking the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass in certain regions. You'll now need to pay $29.99 a month for Ultimate - a 50% jump, with pricing for places outside the US to follow. PC Game Pass subscriptions are going up from $11.99 to $16.49 monthly - around 40 percent higher.

"We understand price increases are never fun for anybody, but we're trying to reinforce by adding more value to these plans as well," Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, told the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">Verge</a> in a briefing. "It's something we don't take lightly, and we're listening to the feedback of players and the community to try to provide them with more of what they're asking for." 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft are attempting to sweeten the pill by means of larger game catalogues per tier, expanded access to their cloud gaming services, and various other perks detailed in full on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">the Xbox Newswire</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimate now includes access to various Ubisoft games via Ubisoft Plus Classics, plus the Fortnite Crew service, which spans a load of seasonal Fortnite stuff.  Ultimate subscribers will also get access to the poshest version of Microsoft's cloud gaming service, which includes 1440p resolution support and bitrate improvements on certain devices. Microsoft are also promising to increase the number of Xbox games coming to Ultimate at release day. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Xbox Game Pass Core is being rebranded to Xbox Game Pass Essential ($9.99/month, around 50 games), and the Standard plan is now Xbox Game Pass Premium ($14.99/month, around 200 games). Both tiers now include access to new cloud gaming features alongside PC games. While neither of these services will cost more than Core and Premium in the US, they'll see pricing adjustments in some regions. Again, more to follow.
</p>
<p>PC Pass subscribers benefit the least from all these changes, seemingly. "The only change happening for PC Game Pass subscribers is that they won’t be getting Ubisoft Plus Classics, but they’ll be getting about 50 additional Ubisoft titles across PC Game Pass," Blackwell told the Verge. "It will continue to get day one titles."</p>

As Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">note</a>, Microsoft's Game Pass price hikes come in the wake of both record returns and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a>. Game Pass <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off">earned them $5 billion last year</a>, while Microsoft saw an overall 18 percent increase in revenue to $76.4 billion. Microsoft have also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">bumped up the price of their console hardware</a> in the USA. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subscription-models-like-xbox-game-pass-are-not-properly-valuing-developers-says-former-bethesda-exec">debates continue</a> about whether videogame subscription services are good for participating developers.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft are also currently the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">a consumer boycott over their business partnerships with the Israeli military</a> during the latter's assault on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, which a UN commission of inquiry has now <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds">formally defined as a genocide</a>. The Boycott, Divest, Sanctions movement has specifically called on people to cancel their Game Pass subscriptions until Microsoft divest fully from the state. The company recently announced that they would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">block Israeli military access to Azure and AI services</a> used for a specific surveillance project that violates their terms of service, but they continue to do business with Israel's armed forces at large.
