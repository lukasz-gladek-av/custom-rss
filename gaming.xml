<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/02/gran-turismo-7-review-ps5-ps4/">Gran Turismo 7 Review | TheSixthAxis</a></h2>
<p>In our Gran Turismo 7 review, Stefan said, <em>“Gran Turismo 7 takes everything that was excellent about GT Sport’s fantastic multiplayer, high fidelity cars and circuits and innovative Scapes mode, and builds up a more traditional GT experience around it. It’s got its own quirky new ideas which will likely be passing diversions to most, but at its core, this is the Gran Turismo you know and love. Broad and accessible, but with depth, nuance and competitive racing for those keen to find it.”</em></p>

<p>A viral piece of content appears to be the next to head to the big screen in multiple formats. According to Variety, a Skibidi Toilet movie and TV show are in the works from former Paramount Pictures president Adam Goodman and director Michael Bay.</p>



<p>Skibidi Toilet has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WePNs-G7puA">blown up in internet meme culture</a> after debuting as a series of shorts from YouTuber Alexey Gerasimov. The first episodes lasted just seconds with nothing really behind it before expanding into a full series that depicts human-headed toilets in a conflict with humanoids.</p>



<p>In talking <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Variety</a>, Goodman talked about the show’s growth from a “silly meme” to something deeper than that.</p>



<p>“It started as a really wacky, crazy,  fun inspired thing and has now turned into something that has episodes and lore and cliffhangers,” Goodman said.</p>



<p>As far as the growth from just over 1 million subscribers to over 43 million in a little over a year, Goodman credits Gerasimov’s passion for creation and his project.</p>

<p>“[He] is someone who is a massive studio of cinema and television and animation and franchise, and we encouraged him — and the encouragement comes from his massive, massive audience — to tell stories, and to look at this as though he’s building something that could be the next Transformers or could be the next Marvel’s Universe,” Goodman said.</p>



<p>As far as the plans for a Skibidi Toilet movie and/or TV show, Goodman said it’s not the “be all, end all” for the series. However, it’s part of the plans for the franchise moving forward.</p>



<p>“This lends itself, very well [to traditional media],” Goodman said. “I will say that Michael [Bay] and Jeffrey Beecroft, his long-time production designer and colleague that has worked on all of his movies, have been working very closely with Alexey to design art, to start to really professionalize the back engine of this to make sure that if we every decide to go film or television that this is kind of lifted beyond the resources that creators have on the internet.</p>



<p>“We are absolutely in talks right now, both on the television side and the earliest conversations right now on the film side, but it’s not a be all, end all for us. We want to make sure that we’re able to support all the other business that have been built.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">"I think two things really gave us the courage to proceed," said Ford. "Of course, the success of Baldur's Gate and their romance system was like, 'Okay, like, people do want this fantasy.' It does help, there's no doubt, but we did have, I should say, ambitions of it, that fit the Warframe architecture, on and off.

		<p>Garcia Hotspur will be fighting Hell itself once again when Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered releases on October 31st. The release date trailer is a bit insane so mentally prepare yourself before clicking on play. It confirms that Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered will have new costumes for Garcia Hotspur, and a New Game+ mode, which was not present in the original 2011 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwpT42plQiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story follows demon hunter Garcia Hotspur who comes home to find that the Lord of Demons has kidnapped his girlfriend, and will kill her over and over in the underworld. Garcia cannot stop him initially, but he descends to the underworld with his demon ally Johnson. Johnson is also Garcia’s main weapon taking on the shape of a gun, as well as taking the form of a torch and motorcycle too. The game does have some environmental puzzles to complete too, which Garcia navigates by using light bullets to push back the darkness. The darkness is pockets of the underworld that would damage Garcia, taking his health and eventually killing him if he stays in those areas for too long.</p>

<p>In our original 2011 review for Shadows of the Damned, nofi wrote,<em>“Shadows Of The Damned provides eight hours or so of some of the best third person shooting we’ve seen for ages – it’s well produced, expertly paced and deliciously funny.&nbsp; It’s not scary, by any stretch, but it doesn’t need or want to be – this isn’t played for scares, more for cheap shock and fun, and it manages that perfectly.&nbsp; Sure, it’s not for everyone and once it’s done it’s done (there’s no New Game +) but if you’re looking for something to blast through this weekend this might just be your tonic.”</em></p>

<p>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, and it is available to pre-order on all platforms for £19.99.</p>

This new project is different from their ongoing actual play or the original programming on their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beacon</a> streaming service. They and Third Person are working on <em>Moonward: A Midst Roleplaying Journey</em>, a brand new experimental miniseries.</p>
<h2>The Moonward: A Midst Roleplaying Journey Announcement</h2>
<p><em>oonward: A Midst Roleplaying Journey</em> is a four-part experimental series. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/metapideon-and-critical-role-purchase-semi-improvised-audio-drama-series-midst" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Midst</em> series</a>, it is a blend of audio drama, live music, multimedia, and semi-improvised theatre, all in service of creating an immersive experience. The miniseries is accessible to both newcomers and Midst fans alike.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonward-third-person-trio-profile-image.jpg?itok=loCD_ts- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonward-third-person-trio-profile-image.jpg?itok=hFN-SIGj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Critical Role founders Marisha Ray and Liam O'Brien will join the Third Person performance group for this miniseries. <em>Moonward</em> is a standalone story in the <em>Midst</em> cosmos. It will follow an expedition to uncover the remnants of Midst's destroyed moon.</p>
<p>It must be noted that <em>Moonward</em> marks the first time the Third Person performers have made their names public. Both Ray and O'Brien will be join Sara Wile and Matt Roen as players, and the experience will be guided by Xen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Midst itself was born from Third Person's shared love of tabletop gaming,” stated Xen. “We're thrilled, over the moon, you might even say, to return to our gaming origins with Moonward and tell a new Midst story in one of our most favorite formats."</p>
<p>“Midst has always been about play and experimentation,” said Wile. “We're honored to have this opportunity to adapt our storytelling style into a new medium with Critical Role, and we hope people will find it as fun to watch as we did to create!"</p>
<p>“The <em>Midst</em> cosmos was built using roleplay and improvisation to craft a collaborative narrative sandbox: Storytelling with friends,” added Roen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first episode of <em>Moonward</em> will debut on August 7 at 7 PM PDT on Critical Role's Twitch and YouTube channels, Midst's YouTube channel, and in podcast format via Spotify and Apple Podcasts. New episodes will debut on Wednesdays. Beacon members will have access to the first two episodes on August 7 and future episodes two weeks in advance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/24/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Warner Bros. Games has acquired Player First Games, the developer of its cross-over platform fighter MultiVersus. The price of the sale was not disclosed, but according to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240722944100/en/Warner-Bros.-Games-Acquires-Player-First-Games">press release</a>, Player First Games will continue to operate under its current leadership of co-founders&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2022/05/30/an-interview-with-multiversus-director-tony-huynh">Tony Huynh</a> and Chris White.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The announcement comes&nbsp;<span>only a couple of months after MultiVersus'&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/11/multiversus-is-back-in-action-this-may" target="_blank">relaunch</a>&nbsp;on May 28. Player First Games served as a work-for-hire studio on the game, and Warner Bros. is apparently pleased enough with its performance</span>&nbsp;to formally bring the studio in-house. The move comes only a few days after Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-mobile-game-to-shut-down-a-year-after-launch-as-developer-netherrealm-suffers-layoffs">shuttered the entire mobile division</a> of Mortal Kombat developer Netherrealm Studios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games,” said David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Games. “The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”</p>

<p>“Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”</p>

<p>MultiVersus is a 2v2 spin on the Super Smash Bros. blueprint that pits a variety of characters from different Warner Bros. properties against each other. It was first launched in open beta in 2022 (read our review of that version <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/multiversus/packing-a-punch">here</a>), then taken down months later to be rebuilt and expanded before returning this year. MultiVersus recently kicked off its second content season, and it has received new fighters such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/13/check-out-the-jokers-multiversus-gameplay-and-the-batman-who-laughs-alternate-costume">The Joker</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/20/multiversus-launch-trailer-reveals-jason-voorhees-and-the-matrixs-agent-smith">Agent Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/jason-voorhees-gets-a-dedicated-multiversus-trailer">Jason Voorhees</a>, and the recently announced <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/22/samurai-jack-and-beetlejuice-are-headed-to-multiversus">Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice</a>.</p>

At the time, nobody knew that there was more to the deal beyond some toys and collectibles. But Goodman told <em>Variety </em>that Bay is working closely with the creator of Skibidi Toilet on the franchise’s future. </p><p> “I will say that Michael....has been working very closely with Alexey to really professionalize the kind of back engine of this, to make sure, if we ever decide to go film or television, that this is kind of lifted beyond just the resources that creators have on the internet,” explained Goodman. </p><p>No specific streaming or studio partners were shared, but Goodman did say they are thinking about doing a hybrid animated/live-action version of Skibidi Toilet, which the former Paramount prez said would stylistically compare to <em>John Wick </em>or <em>District 9.</em></p><p> “If we find a partner in this that really believes there’s opportunity for this to grow and to really see the storytelling grow and for this to be where we hope this can be,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>then film and TV seems like a natural extension for us,” Goodman told Variety. </p><p>So you uh... can look forward to Ryan Reynolds, Jack Black, or The Rock appearing in a Skibidi Toilet movie or TV show on Amazon or Netflix one day. That’s something we get to experience.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator has just announced the arrival of World Update XVII, with the game returning to the United Kingdom and Ireland to expand these regions with new points of interest (POI), challenges, exploration flights and more. Learn more details about Microsoft Flight Simulator’s biggest world update below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Microsoft Flight Simulator World Update XVII: United Kingdom &amp; Ireland is now available as a free update. Players on Xbox Series X/S, PC, Game Pass and Cloud Gaming can now explore the new content.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="World Update XVII: United Kingdom &amp; Ireland Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xGlXW3-xYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new MFS World Update will include new POIs for players to visit and new landing challenges to test their capabilities. Players can also expect Discovery Flights and Bush Trips with enhancements towards the aerial imagery of the entire region. These enhancements come with the help of high-resolution DEM or Digital Elevation Maps for England, Scotland and Ireland.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the new update promises an “improved quality” for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The improvements come through a blend of the latest aerial imagery, digital elevation modelling (including LiDAR coverage), TIN (triangulated irregular network) surface modelling, and hand-crafted airports designed to enhance your gaming experience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, Jorg Neumann, further explained that the Big Data world will be shared between the 2020 and 2024 iterations of the games. However, they will not be “two different digital twins,” but cities, POIS, DEM, and aerials will be shared. The difference for the 2024 version will be seen in how the data is optimised and brought to the player, with much of the data stored in the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data stored in the cloud allows the developers to do more, like adding 200 species of trees instead of the original 2023, and be more accurate in depicting the regions in the game. Neuman expanded, stating that “Sophisticated is a keyword” when you describe the latest world update for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Check out their <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/24/biggest-world-update-ever-microsoft-flight-simulator-best-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> here for more details about World Update XVII.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mobile-gaming-is-evolving-apple-is-evolving-with-it.935778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mobile-gaming-apple-iphone-ipad-resident-evil-assassins-creed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s no longer accurate to say mobile gaming is bigger than ever. With over $100 billion in revenue, there are more gamers on mobile devices than any other platform. But that’s never been a fair comparison. Mobile games have always been distinct from their console and PC counterparts since mobile games cater to a different audience. But maybe that’s no longer the case?</p><p>At a recent showcase for games coming to Apple devices, I got a peek at what looks to be the next evolution in gaming on mobile: bringing console and PC games straight to your iPhone and iPads.</p><p>Alongside new Apple Arcade exclusives, developers like Ubisoft, Capcom, and EA were in attendance to show off console-level experiences running on the latest Apple machines, ranging from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-iphones-to-buy">iPhones</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ipad-models">iPads</a> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-macbooks-to-buy">Macbooks</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Among the games we saw were Assassin’s Creed Mirage, the newest in Ubisoft’s popular open-world adventure series running flawlessly on an iPhone. This isn’t some watered-down demake like we’ve seen in the past. One game that comes to mind is Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition which is effectively a scaled-down remake of Final Fantasy 15 for mobile devices. </p><p>Mirage was running in full on iPhone, and combined with Ubisoft’s online account system, your save from the console version can transfer over to your iPhone version seamlessly, though you’ll have to purchase a separate version on your iPhone.</p><p>Mirage follows the heels of Capcom games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-played-resident-evil-4-on-the-iphone-15-pro-i-didnt-like-it">Resident Evil 4</a> and Resident Evil Village. As it happens, Capcom was also there to show off their most recent release, Resident Evil 7 which was running on iPhone and iPad, but is also available to play on Macbook as well.</p><p>Like Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Resident Evil 7 on iOS and Mac is the full experience, rather than some made-for-mobile port. Between these two games and titles already on iOS and Mac like Death Stranding, it appears that the next device to run console quality games is already in your pocket.</p><p>As far as performance goes, I didn’t notice anything particularly egregious. There were a few framerate dips when I played Assassin’s Creed Mirage, but overall these games ran silky smooth. Graphically, these games also impressed. While I wasn’t able to drill down on a proper pixel count, the smaller iPhone screens means whatever loss in detail is covered up by the smaller screen real estate. But even then, games like Resident Evil 7 in particular looked mighty impressive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Apple supports something called Universal Purchase, meaning if you buy a game to play on iPhone, you’ll also be able to play the game on iPad, Mac, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-vision-pro-review">Apple Vision Pro</a> if they support it. But no luck for customers who’ve already purchased games like Resident Evil 7 or Assassin’s Creed on PlayStation or Xbox, which makes sense. But considering a game like RE7 has been out already for several years makes purchasing a full-priced new copy a somewhat bitter pill to swallow. </p><p>There’s also the matter of playing these games. During my experience with the fully ported console games, a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-phone-controller">phone controller</a> like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/backbone-one-review">Backbone</a> is almost mandatory. I’ve heard younger gamers who grew up on mobile gaming are quite good at touchscreen controls, but my old dumb hands require tactile buttons. And considering the Backbone retails for about $100, though there are certainly cheaper alternatives, is an added cost to get into full-fledged console gaming on mobile.</p><p>It feels to me like mobile gaming is entering new territory. For the longest time, mobile games were smaller affairs, designed to distract you on your commute while finding ways to charge you a few dollars here and there (and generating massive profit doing so), culminating in a world-dominating hit like Pokemon Go. A new era began with the rise of console-lite experiences like Genshin Impact which combined console-quality visuals and gameplay with the gacha mechanics that defines mobile gaming. </p><p>All the while Apple tried a new approach. Taking notes from services like Netflix, Apple launched Apple Arcade, a subscription-service with quality, ad-free games available to subscribers for a monthly fee. This service is home to several, quality indie games as well as huge hits like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-kitty-island-adventure-might-be-your-next-favorite-cozy-game">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a>.</p><p>And it seems that between Apple Arcade and full AAA game ports, Apple’s found a winning formula for games going forward. Apple Arcade is still in full swing, with hit, mobile-forward games like Vampire Survivor+ slated to arrive for the service, but for gamers looking for something more advanced, there’s a steady stream of AAA games heading to Apple devices.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Not everything will run on every Apple device. At the event we got hands-on with the upcoming Frostpunk 2 and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, but those were only playable on Mac. Though Prince of Persia was also released on the Nintendo Switch, I can’t help but think this title will also make its way to iPhone, even if Ubisoft hasn’t officially announced anything.</p><p>It certainly feels like we’ve entered a new frontier of mobile gaming. While consoles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-review">Steam Deck</a> and Switch have pushed the envelope of mobile console gaming, Apple’s latest moves into pure mobile gaming is certainly worth a deeper dive. There are some lingering questions, like whether Apple will begin offering new games day and date with other platforms, or Apple customers should just expect to get games much later than everyone else.</p><p>But for millions of iPhone and iPad owners around the world, suddenly getting a stream of quality, AAA games right onto devices they already own feels like a surprise revolution.</p><p><em>Matt T.M.

Now, with the launch of Season 5, Activision has finally done something about it.</p><p>Warzone Season 5 launches today, July 24, and brings with it this much-needed improvement. Developer Raven Software’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> detail the ‘Dynamic Gas Mask Overlay Quality of Life’ change:</p><p>“The gas mask overlay will now fade in and out depending if you’re in gas or not,” Raven explained. “This way, players can equip the gas mask at any time without having their vision impacted.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The battle royale’s gas mask, which, as you’d expect, lets players breathe within the damaging gas as the circle of play shrinks, had an equip/unequip animation that would trigger whenever the wearer would move in/out of the gas. It had the habit of getting in the way of the action at the worst possible moment (during a firefight), forcing players to store it in their inventory and manually equip it when needed.</p><p>Now, this issue should be a thing of the past, leaving those with the gas mask free to equip safe in the knowledge that doing so won’t harm their chances of victory. Players have reacted positively to the change, which comes over four years after Warzone’s record-breaking launch.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It only took 4 years and 3 months but it has finally happened in Warzone hahahaha</p><p>The Gas Mask Animation is Gone <a href="https://t.co/OI90iR0LRD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OI90iR0LRD</a></p></div>— James - JGOD (@JGODYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JGODYT/status/1816130228647080072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, Season 5 makes big weapon balance changes and other user interface and user experience improvements. The update comes ahead of the launch of this year's mainline Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>, and its integration into Warzone.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The film serves as season 20 of the series and offers an "alternate universe" ending that follows up the original 13 "main series" seasons.</p><p>For those who don't know, Red vs. Blue is a long-running machinima fan-series set in the Halo universe and largely uses in-game footage from various Halo games. The series starts as a humorous, in-universe spoof on Halo multiplayer and evolves into a sci-fi epic with long-running story arcs and surprisingly moving character moments. It was the first video series created by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rooster-teeth-shutting-down-after-two-decades-is-looking-to-sell-off-red-vs-blue/1100-6521649/" data-ref-id="1100-6521649">now-shuttered Rooster Teeth</a>.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">If you don't want to wait for the Red vs. Blue: Restoration Blu-ray release, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0CQ8TMJB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy or rent the digital version on Prime Video</a>. And if you haven't caught up on all the previous seasons--which stretch all the way back to the original episodes from 2003--you can also stream the entire Red vs. Blue series leading up to Restoration <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Gulch-Chronicles-Chapter-8/dp/B0B6T44CQ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Prime Video</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, Red vs. Blue owes its existence to the Halo franchise. While the official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-tv-series-cancelled-after-two-seasons/1100-6525132/" data-ref-id="1100-6525132">Halo TV series was recently cancelled</a> (though there's a chance it may continue), season two is now available on Blu-ray, including a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Season-One-Limited-Steelbook/dp/B0BF2WXJ3X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">limited-edition 4K steelbook edition</a>.

                <p>The use of AI in video game development has become a hot-button issue in recent months, especially at the very top of the industry. Now, a wide-ranging report claims that Call of Duty publisher Activision sold cosmetics that were partially made with AI.</p><p dir="ltr">The piece, which comes via <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a>, describes a climate of fear and anxiety surrounding the use of AI in the gaming industry, especially for 2D artists. It opens with a quote from an alleged email from former Activision chief technology officer Michael Vance, stating that artificial intelligence was "top of mind" for the publisher, and that the systems "hold a ton of promise."</p>

<p dir="ltr">An internal memo cited later in the piece apparently approved the use of generative AI tools like GPT-3.5 to create concept art and marketing materials. A cosmetic created by AI was then reportedly released Modern Warfare 3 through the in-game store. The Wired report links to the Yokai's Wrath bundle, which includes a skin, loading screen, sticker, and more, though it's unclear exactly what was generated by AI. </p><p dir="ltr">"I think we all didn’t talk about it much for fear of losing our jobs," a pseudonymous Activision artist identified as "Noah" said. He further claims that "a lot of 2D artists were laid off" in early 2024 when Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs, and that the remaining concept artists are being "forced to use AI to aid in their work."</p><p dir="ltr">We've reached out to Activision for comment on this, and we'll update this piece accordingly if we hear back. The Wired report presents the AI issue as one endemic to games, with many top studios and publishers like Riot, EA, and Activision struggling to determine the proper use of the technology. The report also suggests that the AI boom has triggered further interest in organizing activity within the industry, which may help explain how large studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/">Bethesda</a> have become fully unionized in recent weeks.</p>

There was no TikTok, DLC was still a relatively new concept on consoles, <em>Fortnite</em> didn’t exist, and covid-19 wasn’t a thing. But what if <em>Skyrim </em>launched in 2024? And what if it was written and developed by 13-year-olds? Well, you don’t have to wonder, because YouTuber CJMattis has created a video that presents us with that alternate timeline. </p><p>Using AI-generated voices, CJMattis has rewritten <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734">the famous intro to <em>Skyrim</em></a></span><em> </em>in which you wake up on a wagon alongside a few other captured prisoners as you all await your execution. Now all the characters use “Gen Alpha Slang,” according to the video’s title. </p><p>So instead of saying “Watch your tongue!” when someone in the cart speaks poorly of Ulfric Stormcloak, we get “Check your vibes!” When the person realizes who they are talking to they freak out, saying: “You’re the leader of the rizz-bellion!” At another point, someone asks what gooncave someone is from after he starts to panic and yell out, “No, this is cap. This must be cap.” </p><p>Here’s the original <em>Skyrim </em>intro in case you want to compare.</p><p>I do think that some of the “Gen Alpha” slang in this video is actually much older internet speak, like ratioed and doxx. And I’m not sure a reference to Twitch streamer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479">Kai Cenat</a></span> is slang, but hey, what do I know? I’m an old man. Besides, the main point of the video is to rot your brain, and it does a solid job of that. </p><p>Although, personally, I don’t mind kids using new words because that’s how this whole language thing works. That’s how this has always worked. The youth develop new words and phrases, their parents and teachers roll their eyes, and then 10 years later those kids—now teens—roll their eyes at the new kids and their fresh slang. Repeat until the heat death of the universe. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
