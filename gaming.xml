<p>News on the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC is right around the corner, with The Pokémon Company announcing updates will be shared very soon.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A released on October 16 for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, with major headlines being the return of Mega Pokémon to the franchise and major tweaks to the battle structure.</p>



<p>More content for Legends: Z-A is imminent with the previously announced Mega Dimension DLC on the horizon, and significant updates are coming sooner than we thought.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It’s coming. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>As shared by the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1986071211579941235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Serebii</a>, The Pokémon Company has announced that an update for the Mega Dimension DLC will be shared on November 6 at 11 PM Japan time, which is 2 PM GMT and 6 AM PT.</p>



<p>No exact details have been shared on what the news will be, though it’s possible that a release date for the DLC will be announced, perhaps alongside a new trailer that outlines the additions to the game.</p>



<p>We already know that Mega Dimension will introduce two Mega Evolutions for Raichu, with Hoopa playing a central role, and further Mega Evolutions for other Pokémon could be revealed.</p>



<p>The Mega Dimension DLC will also bring more Pokémon to Legends: Z-A, expanding the Pokédex further, alongside new story content and side missions.</p>



<p>Full details are still to come, but excitement levels are certainly rising for more news to be shared, particularly as we edge closer to the 30th birthday of the Pokémon franchise next year.</p>

Some of the original criteria did not fully reflect that intent, and we have updated them to make their difficulty and purpose clearer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first set of changes went live today, November 5, through a server-side update and are available immediately. Any progress you’ve already made will automatically be applied when you enter a match, unlocking any challenges or assignments you now meet based on the updated criteria.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios said the scale of its plans for Challenges and Assignments is “large and will take place over multiple server-side and client-side updates,” so players can expect additional updates in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Battlefield 6 has enjoyed a record-breaking launch, some have critisized the pace of in-game progression, which this update looks to address. Other hot topics include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">the size of Battlefield 6's multiplayer maps compared to those in previous games</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">out-of-place soldier skins</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including word on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-hidden-room-discovery-has-players-developing-theories-and-searching-for-easter-eggs"><u>the hidden firing range room that players are investigating</u></a> for secret Easter Eggs and hints at future content.

Below we’ve highlighted a few examples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Class Challenges</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon challenges now complete much faster.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Assault 2: </strong>Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon.</li><li>Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li><li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support.</li><li>Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon Assignments</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All weapon-type assignments (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, DMRs, Snipers, Carbines) have been significantly simplified.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rapid Fire 1/Assault Rifle:</strong> Inflict damage with Assault Rifles.</li><li>Reduced from requiring 10000 inflicted damage to 3000.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mode &amp; Unit Assignments</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The majority of our mode-specific assignments (Conquest, Rush, Breakthrough, Domination, and others) have been standardized to require two wins per tier. This change makes it easier to pursue these challenges with clear intent.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Conquest 2: </strong>Wins in Conquest.</li><li>Reduced from 5 wins to 2.</li><li><strong>Conquest 3: </strong>Objective kills in a round of Conquest.</li><li>Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay &amp; Mastery</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">General “Expert” and “Master” assignments that require multi-kills, headshots, kill streaks, or revives have been adjusted to better match the natural rhythm of gameplay. For example, multi-kill and streak goals now align with average round performance rather than rare, outlier achievements.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives.</li><li>Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.</li><li><strong>Adaptable 2:</strong> Repair damaged Vehicles in a life.</li><li>Reduced from requiring 3000 damage to 500.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>"Enjoy a game side-by-side with a friend who's using your PS5 under a separate account, or stream your favorite game while someone else watches a movie on the console," a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">PlayStation Blog post</a> reads. "Cloud Streaming also makes it easier to enjoy PS5 games on the go – at a hotel, cafe, friend's place, or anywhere else with a high-speed internet WiFi connection – since you can keep playing even when your PS5 console back home is powered off or is in use by another account."&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside this update, PlayStation has implemented a new UI for the Portal, including a Remote Play home screen, a Cloud Streaming home screen, and a search screen. You can check it out in the image below:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios has made sweeping changes to challenges today, reducing the required milestones for class assignments,  weapon assignments, gameplay and mastery assignments, and more.</p>
<p>This was revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229?t=hLk3LaaiyV47LOqtvFCxKQ&amp;s=19">Battlefield Community Update post</a>, which notes that over 90 challenges in total have been tweaked to be easier. The post states that this came following ongoing player feedback.</p>
<p>The post states: "As we continue to build on the improvements we mentioned previously, we are also delivering a major overhaul of Challenges and Assignments, guided by gameplay data and your feedback. Some of the adjustments in this update are substantial, and we wanted to share more context on how we arrived at them.</p>

</figure>
<p>"This update makes significant reductions to challenge requirements, cutting down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression that rewards consistent play. Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length."</p><p>Changes have gone live today, and progress across affected challenges have been retained post-update. That means that for many players, they'll boot up the game and find a suite of previously incomplete challenges have been mysteriously accomplished. There will, according to the post, be additional updates addressing challenges in the near future in which further adjustments to completion requirements will be made.</p>
<p>Challenges in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <em>have</em> proven exceptionally grating for a subset of the playerbase since the game's release. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oms515/these_challenges_can_absolutely_suck_the_will_out/">Take this post by user AwkwardSoldier</a>, who posted a screenshot of support healing and LMG suppression challenges, titling the post: "These challenges can absolutely suck the will out of you". So players have been suffering big time trying to finish these, which is likely where the aforementioned feedback has come from.</p>
<p>It's yet another tweak to Battlefield 6 made following its release, following a nerf to aim assist as well as updates <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">addressing weapon bloom</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-makes-temporary-adjustments-to-xp-earned-in-strikepoint-mode-to-maintain-fair-and-consistent-progression">removing Strikepoint XP exploits</a>. Whether or not this will tame the increasingly loud Battlefield 6 community throughout Season 1 remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The year may be coming to a close sooner than we’d all like, but there’s still plenty of big releases on the horizon, including Where Winds Meet, and we’ve got all the details on early access availability.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 and PC</a>, with expectations for the title high as over seven million pre-registrations have been filed for the game.</p>



<p>With such a high amount of interest, it’s only natural to wonder if early access is available for Where Winds Meet, and we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-where-winds-meet-early-access">Can You Play Where Winds Meet Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Patience. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access to Where Winds Meet, meaning that, even if you do splash out on the pre-order edition, you won’t be able to jump into the game early.</strong></p>



<p>Where Winds Meet is not offering any early access incentives for players, and everyone will be able to jump in at exactly the same moment when the global servers are released. Naturally, given that there could be thousands of players looking to enter the game at the same time, you may encounter some server issues—but they should be resolved quickly.</p>



<p>The bonus is that nobody will receive a head start in the PvP elements of the game, with everyone starting on the same foot, but it also means patience is required.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-where-winds-meet-early">Is There Any Way To Play Where Winds Meet Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, there is no way to play Where Winds Meet early, as the servers for the game will not be opened until the launch takes place.</strong></p>



<p>While there was a closed beta earlier this year, offering players the opportunity to try the game out early and provide crucial feedback, those doors have long closed. Additionally, any progress made in the beta will not transfer over to the full release, and players will have to start again from scratch.</p>



<p>On top of that, Where Winds Meet has a global launch, with doors opening to players around the world simultaneously. Therefore, there’s no way to jump the queue by adopting the popular New Zealand trick that is utilized by many players for other releases.</p>



<p>If you really were desperate to play Where Winds Meet early, you could head to China, where the game has been released since December 2024, but the easiest approach is just to wait it out.</p>

Games [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/yeah-us-games">Yeah Us! Games</a> announced. <span id="more-1004741"></span></p><p>“As a long term fan of both BMX and video games, I’m thrilled to be able to bring them both together in <em>Streetdog BMX</em>,” said Yeah Us! Games’ Adam Hunt in a press release. “I can’t wait to get the game out into the world and see other fans enjoy it as much as I do!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Yeah Us! Games:</p><blockquote><p>Spin, flip, grind and shred through six jam-packed maps where the streets become a biker’s playground. Players can master their latest combo in the skate park and then show off their skills off buildings, rooftops, construction zones and more. Each location offers more than just tarmac for tires – discovering the full breadth of these maps can lead players to new challenges, tricks and hidden areas, all while perfecting their craft at the same time.</p><p>Nailing that perfect combo may be “tricky” enough for some, but for the more adventurous there are over 270 challenges that will see players push their creativity to the limit. Race against the clock, master an ambitious stunt, break records and reach new heights to grind through each challenge. If players can best the bike and beat all 270, there’s no need to hit the brakes—<em>Streetdog BMX</em> dares players to keep biking and experimenting, hitting even higher scores and inventing creative new combos. </p><p>Created by BMX riders, for BMX riders, <em>Streetdog BMX</em> recognises that every player is unique. From how they play, down to how they look, this action-packed title ensures a truly custom experience as individual as the people behind the handlebars. Players can customise their bike to match their style, and choose from a range of outfits, hairstyles, tattoos and accessories before showing off on the streets.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Close to one year on from the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/">Cloud Streaming beta</a> for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a>, Sony has announced the official launch of this feature, as well as the debut of being able to stream your own games. All you need is a PS Portal and an active PlayStation Plus Premium subscription.</p>
<p>The update will arrive overnight tonight at 2AM on 6th November GMT, or 6PM 5th November on the US West Coast.</p>


<p>Cloud Streaming of your own games lets you stream from Sony’s servers instead of using Remote Play with your console. This has been shown to have some better performance, which seems daft in certain situations, but comes down to the server architecture having been optimised specifically for streaming. By incorporating your digitally owned games into this, it means titles such as Astro Bot, Borderlands 4, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Fortnite, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, and Resident Evil 4, which are not in the PS Plus library can be streamed.</p>
<p>The announcement notes that this can open up new multiplayer possibilities, such as having another player on your PS5, while you stream from the cloud. It also makes the experience of using the PS Portal away from home better and more reliable – no more remembering to leave your PS5 in standby or telling other family members not to use it.</p>
<p>For a full list of streamable games, visit <a href="http://playstation.com/ps5-game-cloud-streaming">here,</a> where Sony has constructed a really annoying layout with a search bar, instead of just making a list.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the system software of the PS Portal has been given an overhaul.</p>
<p>The refreshed UI presents three options when booting up – remote play, cloud streaming and a cloud streaming search – and cloud streaming now has a dedicated UI. There’s also 3D audio support for streamed games, a passcode lock, and a network status screen for finding a good connection. When you’re in a game, the in-game stores now work, there’s better accessibility options specifically for when streaming games, and game invitations arrive on a system level as well.</p>
<p>All around, this seems like a great update, so long as you have a PS Plus Premium subscription.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps-portal-cloud-streaming-out-of-beta-live-for-ps-plus-premium-users/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cloud-streaming-on-ps-portal-finally-out-of-beta-officially-live-for-all-ps-plus-premium-users.1344343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in November 2024, a year after the PlayStation Portal first launched in November 2023, PlayStation pushed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/">Cloud Streaming Beta in a firmware update</a>. Now, yet another year later, a device that everyone would have understandably assumed would support Cloud Streaming from launch (but for some reason did not) now has official Cloud Streaming support, as PlayStation confirmed today that streaming your digital library of games already compatible with streaming is now available to all PS Portal users who are also subscribed to PS Plus Premium.</p>



<p>A new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">PlayStation Blog</a> goes through the features that PS Portal owners can now take advantage of, and the many caveats around cloud streaming on your device. Those caveats being that you can only use cloud streaming if you are subscribed to PS Plus Premium, which as a reminder is the highest of the three PS Plus tiers.</p>



<p>You can also only use it for a select number of digital games in your library. Not every game you have may be available for cloud streaming, as that availability can differ based on region. That said, there are thousands of games available to be streamed, so while <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">you can check out this list of games available for cloud streaming here</a>, chances are what you're looking for is up to be played over streaming.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cloud Streaming for PS5 games on PlayStation Portal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPgBMPkWXeg?start=3&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Along with the feature exiting its beta stage, users who have been testing out the beta will see a few changes. Firstly, for all PS Portal users, today's update offers a new remote play home screen. There's also a new home screen for when you're on the page to play your games over streaming. The search screen now also helps you identify if a game is available to be played over streaming.</p>



<p>Remote play and cloud streaming users also now get full 3D audio support, and there's a new network status screen to help you better gauge your internet connection strength if you happen to be experiencing issues while playing. Also, if you're concerned about someone using your PS Portal when you're not, you can now add a passcode lock to your device.</p>



<p>Regarding cloud streaming-specific updates, you can now access accessibility options like screen readers and adjusting the size of the text on screen, game invitations will work properly while playing a game over streaming, and you can make in-game purchases while streaming your games.</p>



<p>It's a good day for PS Portal users who have been waiting for this to be official, but it feels worth noting that it is almost insane to see a feature that should have come with the device only officially arrive two years after it has been on shelves. </p>



<p>Not that PlayStation doesn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-system-update-adds-support-for-basic-features-like-game-captures-to-cloud-streaming/">already have a history of adding basic features to the Portal late in the game</a>, but when the news of cloud streaming exiting beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-leak-suggests-highly-requested-feature-is-coming-soon/">PS Portal leaked just a week earlier</a>, you'd be forgiven if your reaction was one of complete surprise that it wasn't there at launch.</p>



<p>At least it's here now, and as senior manager in product management at Sony, Takuro Fushimi, says in his PlayStation Blog post, we can "<em>look forward</em>" to PlayStation "<em>sharing more updates in the future</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Epic and Google Look Set to Bury the Fortnite Hatchet Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-fortnite-joint-proposal</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-and-google-look-set-to-bury-the-fortnite-hatchet-soon.1344340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic's Tim Sweeney has revealed that Google has made what he calls an "awesome" proposal to open up the Android operating system, thus setting the stage for a potential burying of the hatchet (if you'll forgive the mixed metaphors).</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a> earlier today, Sweeney said the proposal would "double down on Android's original vision as an open platform" by streamlining "competing store installs", reducing developer service fees on the Play Store, and enabling third-party "in-app and web payments".</p>

<p>Sweeney goes on to describe this proposal as a "comprehensive solution" which he contrasts against Apple's "model of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">blocking all competing stores</a> and leaving payments as the only vector for competition".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-epic-apple-proposal-tim-sweeney.jpg?itok=0lTmU7AU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-epic-apple-proposal-tim-sweeney.jpg?itok=bYx_7HKU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic's long battle with Google could be over soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Google's Sameer Samat, president of the Android ecosystem, <a href="https://x.com/ssamat/status/1985920218602918343" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">echoes</a> Sweeney's comments. He says the proposal is aimed at "expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe".</p>

<p>Samat goes as far as to say that if the proposal is approved in court, it would "resolve [Epic and Google's] litigations", so if the proposal goes through, it'll mark an end to the protracted legal battle that began all those years ago.</p>

<p>Epic and Google's battle started in 2020, when&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">removed from the Play Store</a>&nbsp;after Epic attempted to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">bypass Android's proprietary payment system</a> in order to offer direct discounts on several in-game purchases.</p>

<p>In response, Epic sued Google (as well as Apple, who took similar measures), leading to a lengthy court battle in which Epic accused both companies of holding a mobile duopoly and discouraging competition.</p>




<p>The proposals must now be approved by US District Judge James Donato, who's presiding over the Epic vs. Google case. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-proposes-app-store-reforms-settlement-with-fortnite-maker-epic-games-2025-11-05/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, Donato is scheduled to meet with lawyers for "a previously scheduled hearing" tomorrow, so the new proposals may be discussed then. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Effectively a DualSense controller with a screen in the middle, the handheld lets you stream your PlayStation 5 to it if you’ve got good wifi, but it’s mostly just an extension of the console itself. Well, not anymore. Sony has announced that the PlayStation Portal will finally be able to stream games directly rather than needing them to bounce off your console.</span></p> <p><span>In a post on the </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/"><span>PlayStation Blog</span></a><span>, Sony announced that if you’re subscribed to PlayStation Plus Premium, you’ll be able to stream </span><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/"><span>cloud-streaming-compatible PS5 games</span></a><span> directly to your Portal instead of having them ping back and forth between your console and the handheld. The feature will go live tonight, November 5, at 6 p.m. Pacific Time. Sony still recommends you play on internet speeds of at least 15 megabytes per second, which might not sound like much until you’ve lived in the boonies and dealt with service providers only offering 3 megabytes per second in your area, forcing you to take your game devices to other people’s houses or your college campus to download patches. So if you’re considering grabbing the Portal to make cloud streaming your way of playing, make sure your router’s got the juice.</span></p>

  <p><span>This update is part of a wider revamp of the Portal’s systems, which includes a new UI, 3D audio support, and some smaller added functions like passcode support.</span></p> <p><span>I’ve considered buying a Portal in the past as a way to play my PS5 games in bed, but I will always be sad that PlayStation hasn’t invested in a dedicated handheld device since the PlayStation Vita.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“It’s important to realize that we’re really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we’re taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that.” That’s how PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst described Sony’s approach to porting its first-party exclusives to PC <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html">earlier this year</a>. But recently discovered references to PC gaming and a possible “cross-buy” feature on the PlayStation 5 storefront have some wondering if the company’s about to do something more bold <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">when its PS6 console lineup</a> arrives in the not-too-distant future.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst/status/1985788815030861860">dataminer Amethxst</a> (<a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1986037256205766714">and corroborated</a> <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1985795788895580232">by others</a>), new symbols have recently been added to the PlayStation Store backend for PS5. One is a shared “PS5/PC” icon and the other reads “Cross-Buy.” They add that the new symbols use official Sony fonts and aren’t found on PS4. While these new icons aren’t yet proof of anything, they suggest Sony is exploring new features that would expand the PlayStation ecosystem beyond a single console, much like Microsoft has been doing with its “Play Anywhere” initiative and recent movement into PC gaming handhelds with the full-screen Windows gaming experience for the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>

That effort began with <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> in 2021 and has seen major PS5 exclusives like <em>Spider-Man 2</em> arrive on PC in as little as 15 months after the console version released. At that pace, <em>Astro Bo</em>t should arrive by early next year. But Sony has stopped short of going full day-and-date on PC with its releases, outside of online multiplayer games like <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p>

 <h2>Sony’s rumored PlayStation PC launcher</h2> <p>It’s also struggled to navigate how to bring those games to another platform while still getting new players to join its existing PlayStation Network service. Sony has added trophy support and other features to Steam versions of games like <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> but has also faced backlash over PSN login requirements for even its single-player blockbusters. It’s a tricky tightrope to walk that comes with obvious downsides for Sony, the most significant of which is that other companies get a cut of the sales when PlayStation games are sold on PC.</p>

 <p>One obvious solution to that problem would be a full-blown PlayStation PC launcher like Ubisoft and other third-party publishers have. Indeed, Sony <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/now-reference-to-a-playstation-pc-launcher-has-been-discovered-in-spider-man-pc/">was reportedly exploring exactly that</a>&nbsp;based on references found in the files for <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em>. While the company eventually opted to integrate PSN directly into the Steam versions of games, the newly discovered references to “PS5/PC” and “Cross-Buy” make it seem like a bespoke PlayStation PC launcher might still be on the table.</p>

 <p>A PC launcher seems like the most obvious way that Sony could allow players to purchase a game like <em>God of War</em> on console and then redeem the PC version of it at no extra cost, or vice versa. Microsoft’s “Play Anywhere” initiative works similarly. Buying <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>&nbsp;on Xbox Series X doesn’t qualify you for the Steam version of the game but it does get you access to the Windows version, because Microsoft owns that storefront and has worked out the licensing agreements with third-party publishers.</p>

 <h2>The new platform wars</h2> <p>But this isn’t the first time Sony has supported “Cross-Buy” in the PlayStation ecosystem, and these new references could also be hinting at potential plans for the company’s rumored handheld. A big selling point of the PlayStation Vita back in the day was that some games only had to be purchased once to play them across both the portable and PS3. One of those was the original <em>Helldivers</em>. It was a neat idea that abruptly ended thanks to the Vita’s quick demise.</p>

 <p>A new high-end gaming handheld that approaches the power of a PlayStation 5, however, would bring “Cross-Buy” back in a big way. There are two interesting possibilities here. The first and most expected is that Sony’s rumored next-gen handheld would have access to all of the games players already have in the PS5 and PS4 libraries. But “Cross-Buy” would also give players coming from PC who are otherwise new to the PlayStation console ecosystem a better foothold if their existing Sony purchases can be redeemed across both platforms.</p> <p>Or maybe Sony is exploring a more hybrid PC gaming handheld approach in the vein of the Xbox Ally X. It’s easy to speculate but hard to say with no concrete info to go on. The most interesting takeaway, however, is that Microsoft’s recent moves might be forcing Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-pc-mobile-streaming-leak-more-subscriptions/">to compete in unexpected ways</a>. The tech giant might be retreating from the traditional console hardware market, but its wider platform initiatives could still be pushing PlayStation to offer players better features in the future.</p>

                <p>PlayStation Portal owners can now stream their games from the cloud, Sony has announced. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-update-adds-more-features-to-cloud-streaming/1100-6530723/">After rolling out a beta version last year</a>, the updated version of Cloud Streaming will allow PS Plus Premium members to play a massively expanded selection of games on the device, and it won't require them to connect to a PS5 console through Remote Play.</p><p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">there are 2,845 games that support PS Portal Cloud Streaming</a>. This includes several of Sony's biggest first-party titles like Ghost of Yotei and Astro Bot, alongside third-party titles like Borderlands 4 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Games from the PS Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog are compatible as well, and Sony has introduced a new home screen that features three tabs to help distinguish between the various modes: Remote Play, Cloud Streaming, and Search.</p><p>Remote Play requires a PS5 console paired to a PS Portal so that installed games can be streamed directly from the system onto the handheld. This mode doesn't require a PS Plus Premium membership, but Cloud Streaming does. The search option will let users look up any game that supports Cloud Streaming.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596866" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596866"></a><figcaption>A closer look at new PS Portal features.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596867,1300-4596868,1300-4596869" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg"></figure><p>Other new features being introduced for both Remote Play and Cloud Streaming include 3D audio support when using a compatible audio device like the Pulse Explore wireless earbuds, a passcode lock screen, and a network status screen so that PS Portal owners can quickly check the quality of their connection.</p><p>The new features that'll be unique for the Cloud Streaming functions are updated accessibility options, an in-game store that supports in-game purchases during a game stream, and game invites from friends who are playing the same game.</p><p>Sony launched the PS Portal in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-portal-just-isnt-good-enough/1100-6519416/">and while the device was a tough recommendation due to its limited use-case</a>, critics and users did note that it was still a well-designed piece of hardware.

            <p>Today, Sony will officially push out one of the biggest PS Portal updates the peculiar little handheld has received since it was first released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">back in November 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This update, which has been in beta for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">about a year</a>, will allow anyone that owns the machine to use Cloud Streaming via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus Premium</a> - effectively meaning you can bypass needing a PS5 console <strong>at all</strong> in order to play the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 4, and many more (thousands more, in fact, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">per PlayStation itself</a>).</p>
<p>So, why is this a big deal? Since its launch in 2023, the £200 device (always sold as 'a PS5 peripheral' rather than a standalone, game-ready device) sold itself mainly on the fact you could stream from your home console directly to the smaller 1080p screen, with Sony pitching it as a way to share a living room TV or play PS5 games in another room of the house.</p>
<p>It's always felt a bit limited, or niche, especially for that costly outlay, but Sony's latest update makes good on its 2024 promise to let you play PS5 games without a central console acting as a hub. It's a little convoluted to set this up, but it can be done. </p>

</figure>
<p>If you own a PS Portal, sign into the machine with your PS Plus account (you must have Premium in order to access Game Streaming). Go to the PS Portal settings, and find the option to turn on Game Streaming - currently, still, with the Beta label. Switch it on, and sign back in with your account. At the boot screen, you will be able to access your home PS5 or a separate streaming tab. This will work even if you don't have a PS5 attached to the PS Portal. 
</p><p>These titles act, to all intents and purposes like 'real' installed games: as of today's update, in-game purchases will be supported, and you can purchase add-on items and in-game currencies without leaving your game session, you will have access to 3D Audio, and you can play in online sessions (though you might want to be mindful of the slight lag).</p>

<figcaption>The real purpose of game streaming. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in the image above, I can play Tekken 3 on the PS Portal without having the game installed on my actual PS5. I could play this - or Astro Bot, or anything from my library or viable game via PlayStation Plus - in the same way. No matter how powerful the title.</p>
<p>Is this going to make me sell my PS5? No, of course not. But I'm going to get far more use out of my Portal, I can tell you that for free: this job has me travelling a fair amount, and sometimes when staying with family or one of my partners, I sometimes have a few hours of downtime. Relying on home and public WiFi connections in order to remote play has always been spotty, but if the Portal can stream effectively from, say, a coffee shop hotspot, the idea of playing Monster Hunter Wilds in a town centre is pretty compelling.</p><p>I'll do a proper test of this from a GP's office tomorrow morning - when the update for the full-fat version of game streaming is actually live - and report back. But, with this one update, suddenly the appeal (and price!) of a PS Portal starts to make sense.</p>
<p>A full list of compatible games via the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog<a href="http://playstation.com/ps5-game-cloud-streaming">is available here</a>. The full update goes live on 5th November at 6pm PT / 6th November at 2am GMT.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> saw a surge of players with the new Simpsons' themed season, which according to Epic Games hasn't been seen since the last holiday season.</p>
<p>The Simpsons season of Fortnite - which brought with it a new map, Simpsons' themed cosmetics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-getting-pets-at-last-including-a-banana-puppy-you-can-dance-with">as well as the Sidekicks</a> (little pets that follow you around) - was released on the 1st November. Since then, it seems as though an absurd amount of players have been keen to explore Springfield across both the Battle Royale and Delulu modes.</p>
<p>In addition, the first Fortnite x Simpsons short that was released on Disney + reached the number 1 spot on Disney Plus, which is certainly a feat. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-all-know-that-the-simpsons-has-come-to-fortnite-but-did-you-know-that-fornite-has-also-come-to-the-latest-episode-of-the-simpsons">The latest episode of The Simpsons also had the Fortnite characters present in its opening coach gag</a>, which I'm sure was a cool surprise for a number of viewers.</p>

<p>Look, we may be a little tired of multi-media crossovers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-hate-the-ready-player-one-ification-of-all-our-favourite-media-but-cant-resist-the-simpsons-in-fortnite">but it turns out this Simpsons crossover has proven a touch irresistible to </a><a href="http://many.it/">many</a>. It appears as though The Simpsons strikes some sort of Achilles’ heel among 30-something pop culture fiends. I, for one, cannot wait for the future Friends crossover that I'm sure will annihilate hordes of city-loving IPA lovers. Me. It'll take out me.</p>

<p>The original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped">Biped</a> was a charming little co-op adventure that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/biped">we rather enjoyed</a> here at Nintendo Life, and now its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped_2">Biped 2</a>, is out now on Switch.</p>
<p>With support for both online and local multiplayer, friends will need to partner up to complete intriguing physics-based puzzles. The game features improved mechanics and smoother controls, loads more customisation options, new biomes, and more.</p>
<p>The trailer above showcases some really cool modes, with both co-op and competitive play available, and we just love how manic and quirky it all is. If you're unfamiliar with the general premise, the characters are controller by moving the analogue sticks to ambulate their legs separately. It makes for some tricky puzzle-solving and hilarious slapstick gameplay. We can't wait to dive in.</p>
<p>So let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Team Up!:</strong> Play as charming bipedal robots, Aku and Sila, who you may recognize from the first game, and two new adorable characters, who rely on each other and embark on incredible adventures side by side.</p>
<p><strong>New Mechanics:</strong> Try out new movement types that are smoothly integrated into the game process. Soar gracefully on a hang glider and leave beautiful patterns behind, or conquer ledges and breaks with a grappling hook!</p>
<p><strong>Explore New Biomes:</strong> Unravel the mysteries of an alien planet and meet new characters, even elementals. Explore unfamiliar environments and be ready to face the challenges that they might bring tailored specifically to the corresponding game modes: solo, two or four player playthrough.</p>
<p><strong>Customize Your Bot:</strong> Dress up your bipeds for the occasion to impress your new friends. Collect treasures and buy wacky hats. Be unique, or choose pair looks with your partner.</p>
<p><strong>Build Your Own:</strong> Use Steam Workshop to create your own levels! Share them with the community and check others’ creations as well! The possibilities are limitless, and nothing can stop you on your way to having even more fun!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biped 2 is available now via the Switch eShop for <strong>£16.75 / $19.99</strong>.</p>

Five years after exclusively launching in Japan as the “<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nintendo-launches-my-nintendo-app-japan/">My Nintendo</a>” app, Nintendo has now expanded the iOS and Android experience under a new name to other regions, including the US, UK, Canada, and most of Europe.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988">App Store</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.znej" rel="sponsored">Play Store</a> listings, the Nintendo Store app allows users to browse and purchase Switch 2 and Switch consoles, hardware accessories, physical and digital games, and other Nintendo merchandise.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-are-editing-game-files-to-turn-off-matchmaking-against-%E2%80%98overpowered%E2%80%99-aim-assist.1344283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 players on PC have found a way to edit the game files to disable crossplay and prevent them from being matchmade with players using a controller, which is said to have ‘overpowered’ aim assist.</p>



<p>It’s a tale as old as time, where keyboard-and-mouse players feel at a disadvantage against controller players because of the aim assist developers add for controller players. In reality, aim assist is traditionally added for controller players in first-person shooters because keyboard and mouse offer more precise aiming. However, in recent years, keyboard and mouse players have felt that developers have incorporated aim assist too much, resulting in controller players now having a far greater advantage than those playing with keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>The theory has led one player to discover that you can actually remove crossplay with controller players from the game files on PC For those who currently don’t have Battlefield 6 on PC, you can <a target="_blank" title="Battlefield 6 - Loaded (PC)" href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/" data-shortcode="true">buy it here for the cheapest price</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-disable-crossplay-with-battlefield-6-controller-players">How to Disable Crossplay with Battlefield 6 Controller Players</h2>



<p>First posted online by the X account <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1985715884455817538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ottr</a>, players can go into the game files at documents/battlefield 6/settings/steam/PROFSAVE and add GstGameplay.CrossPlayEnable 0</p>



<p>The change will ensure you are no longer matched against players using a controller, but there is one problem with doing this… Players have found that despite the game reportedly already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a>, the overwhelming majority use a controller, and at this moment in time, you’ll likely be playing against bots.</p>



<p>Ottr’s theory here is that the more people add the code to their files, the more mouse-and-keyboard players there’ll be, and as such, the lobbies will fill up faster with no bots.</p>



<p>It is worth pointing out, though, that editing your game files at this moment in time <strong>might not be worth it</strong>, as a future patch will be nerfing aim assist by around 25%. So if you are on PC, maybe hold off for now. Or if you don’t yet have the game and are deciding which platform to buy it on, it is <a target="_blank" title="Battlefield 6 - Loaded (Xbox Series X|S)" href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-xbox-series-xs/" data-shortcode="true">currently discounted by 17%</a> on the Xbox Series S|X. </p>

<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160057/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The beat ‘em up genre has experienced something of a renaissance in the last generation, with original titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fightn_rage1">Fight’n Rage</a> (2019) and more recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> (2025) finding new ways to move the genre forward, while releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a> (2020) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> (2022) show how effectively classics can be modernised. It makes sense, then, that Arc System Works wanted to find a way to bring back Technōs Japan's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/double_dragon">Double Dragon</a>, one of the progenitors of the whole genre.</p>
<p>Yet after the middling response of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden</a> (2023), the company decided to go back to the drawing board when it tried again with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a>. This release is a much more straightforward entry in the long-running series. Despite having some interesting ideas going for it, Double Dragon Revive unfortunately lacks polish and comes across as a very ‘okay’ experience.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, it is very story-driven, complete with fully voiced and partially animated anime cutscenes. The narrative here is set (rather oddly) several years after the conclusion of a nuclear war, with society breaking down into a collection of warring city-states ruled by various groups that have managed to seize power. In Billy and Jimmy Lee’s hometown, a nasty group of thugs called the Shadow Gang run the show, and the plot kicks off with them kidnapping (again) the boys’ childhood friend Marian, leading to the famed duo hitting the streets to get her back.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don’t usually play a beat ‘em up for a riveting and emotional story, but the narrative here actually feels pretty interesting and goes a step beyond the typical basic setup most entries in this genre will go for. Those cutscenes go a long way towards setting up a moderately interesting world and characters, even if it does sometimes come off as a bit cheesy and over-the-top.</p>
<p>As far as gameplay is concerned, this entry plays genre conventions relatively straight, with the addition of the key gimmick that the action plays out on more of a 3D plane than strictly 2D. Otherwise, you still move from screen to screen, comboing waves of baddies and occasionally picking up a knife or sledgehammer to dole out intense street justice. Another new gimmick here is that you can use your environment to your advantage, such as knocking enemies into cars for quick kills that net you lots of points.</p>

<p>Double Dragon Revive has all the basics and even has some cool ideas in how it implements them, but the actual execution of these mechanics falters. Movement consistently feels rigid and janky, while the level design is sometimes lacking. One stage involves a forced platforming challenge that the controls <em>definitely</em> aren’t designed for, and there are many encounters where annoying enemy placement can lead to things like getting ganked from firebomb-wielding foes attacking you from off-screen. It’s the kind of game that feels frustrating, and not in the <em>good</em> way that many <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-soulslikes-games-to-play-if-you-like-dark-souls">soulslikes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-roguelikes-roguelites-and-run-based-games">roguelikes</a> manage to hit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things are saved somewhat by the moderate depth of your character’s moveset, which helps make things feel a bit more dynamic. Alongside the lead brothers, there are two unlockable characters whose unique movesets have their pros and cons that give the moment-to-moment gameplay variety. Carefully determining when and where to make certain moves, such as a screen-clearing special attack that builds up as you combo enemies, makes combat encounters more than a simple button-mashing fest.</p>
<p>And of course, in classic beat ‘em up fashion, you can be joined by another player in either couch or online co-op sessions (no drop-in, though) for some good ‘ol multiplayer fun. In my experience, the online environment on Switch is already a total ghost town, but the local co-op is just as engaging as you’d imagine and it tends to amplify the fun factor when you're beating up screens of foes in a friendly ‘co-opetition’. Capping the multiplayer at just two players feels like a bit of a weird decision, but then again it is called <em>Double</em> Dragon, and not <em>Multiple</em> Dragon.</p>

<p>As far as replayability is concerned, there’s a decent amount of content here to justify the price tag. You’re given a ranking at the end of each stage based on score and overall performance, and this, paired with the selection of playable characters, means there’s fair reason for repeat playthroughs to try mastering every stage with every character.</p>
<p>Once you’ve tired out the main campaign, you can then turn to the ‘Extra’ mode where you can do a series of bite-sized missions that also add little vignettes that flesh out the story a bit more. As long as the core gameplay clicks for you, there’s plenty to do here.</p>
<p>Visually, Double Dragon Revive leaves a lot to be desired, mostly sticking to a lifeless and generic-looking 3D art style that immediately makes the game look cheap. Environments have detailed but ultimately forgettable designs, while the 3D models of all the characters on screen are stiffly animated and tend to lack charm. Nothing explicitly looks <em>bad,</em> but the visuals don’t leave much of an impression.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the anime-styled cutscenes are more interesting, but they only serve to further contrast how middling the rest of the game looks when you’re actually playing it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the soundtrack does a better job of supporting the action, mixing together a collection of house, drum and bass, rock, and pop tracks to make for an energetic soundscape. It can be a bit easy to overlook the music amid all the howls and sound effects of a fight, but I thought this music was a pretty solid companion to the action and does a good job of contributing to the scrappy atmosphere the developers are clearly going for here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Double Dragon Revive is the sort of game that’s just damningly mediocre. It doesn’t fumble the ball too hard in any significant way, but neither does it really excel at offering a fun and engaging beat ‘em up. Interesting gameplay ideas are held back by uneven execution, and the uninspired graphical style kind of takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>This will have its fans, and it’s worth purchasing on a deep sale someday, but it’s definitely nowhere close to the list of games I’d recommend to someone wanting to expand their beat-‘em-up collection. Perhaps Billy and Jimmy will wow us with their inevitable next outing, but this one is just 'alright'.</p></section>
