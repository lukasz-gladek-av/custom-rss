                <p>This fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> is bringing the mainline franchise to the current console generation. With the game just a few months away from release, the development team at Gearbox Software has created a new YouTube show, Beyond the Borderlands, to chronicle its progress. And the first episode focuses on what it takes to create a memorable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">vault hunter</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBouTQJONGw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mBouTQJONGw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We want them to be somebody that players and ourselves can relate to," explained art director Adam May. "A comic book [hero] is frequently a good reference point for us. You want to get something that feels familiar and play as somebody [you] actually want to be in real life. It starts with the ideation of trying to define and decipher what kind of fantasies we want to build for players."</p><p>The team also explained that pitches for new vault hunters come in from all over the company, and sometimes character pitches are combined into new combinations. According to lead character designer Nick Thurston, "The guiding principle of Borderlands, just in general, is just to be badass. The abilities, the gear, everything; it all has to be the things that our community expects. They can be from any walk of life. They can bring anything to the table, but ultimately they have to be cool and they have to be fun to play."</p><p>The price for Borderlands 4 hasn't been announced yet, but Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford caused some controversy when he suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans"</a> will find a way to come up with $80 to buy it, if it costs that much. Pitchford subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-says-he-didnt-mean-to-trigger-people-with-comments-on-the-price/1100-6531910/" data-ref-id="1100-6531910">walked that statement back a bit</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 12. A port will also be released on Nintendo Switch 2 at a later date.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> may be Nintendo Switch 2's headlining attraction, the most alluring part of the system's launch lineup for Olds like me is its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">GameCube library</a>. After more than 20 years, Nintendo has finally decided to crack open its vaults and bring some of GameCube's most-beloved titles to a modern console--the first time most of these games will be available officially since their original release.</p><p dir="ltr">For many, however, the excitement over GameCube titles was quickly tempered by the fact that a meager <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-gamecube-games-through-nintendo-switch-online-new-gamecube-controller/1100-6530559/">three are available at the outset</a>--the thinnest selection any Switch Online classics library has launched with. But as frustrating as it may feel to have to wait for more games to hit the service, this methodical rollout has long been an intentional strategy on Nintendo's part, and it took me many years to understand and appreciate its benefits.</p><p dir="ltr">This slow release cadence is hardly exclusive to the Switch Online service. Ever since Nintendo first established its own digital storefront with the Wii Shop, the company has been deliberately measured when re-releasing its legacy titles. In the lead up to the Wii's launch, Nintendo touted its digital shop as a repository of classics--a place where players could easily purchase the best Nintendo games of yesteryear and play them alongside new releases on one system. And indeed, by the end of the Wii's life, more than 400 had made their way to the Wii Shop, giving Wii owners access to a wealth of beloved games from years past.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513506"></a><figcaption>The biggest draw of the Wii Shop was being able to purchase games from older consoles, but Nintendo's own classics arrived sporadically.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That was certainly not the case at launch, however. While a selection of older games was available right from day one, the early offerings left much to be desired. The Wii Shop launched with fewer than a dozen first-party titles, most of which were Nintendo Entertainment System games from back in the 1980s and 1990s. Anyone eager to revisit a particular classic such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/" data-ref-id="5000-1272">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> was out of luck; the only Nintendo 64 title available at the outset was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a>, and it would be months before more N64 games arrived.</p><p dir="ltr">This trickle of games was even more exasperating on the Wii U. After spending the previous six years steadily amassing a respectable selection of Virtual Console games on the Wii, Nintendo effectively wiped the slate clean when launching the Wii U eShop. Since the extant Virtual Console lineup was incompatible with Wii U's GamePad controller, Nintendo decided to release new versions of these games tailored specifically to the system--which meant the company once again would be building up its retro catalog from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">To Nintendo's credit, it did take steps to mitigate the inconvenience for users. Wii owners had the option to transfer their system data--including their Virtual Console collection--to the Wii U, so customers weren't forced to buy their games a second time. The Wii Shop was still accessible on the new console as well, although it was nested within the separate Wii menu. Thus, any games purchased from it (or transferred over from a Wii) had to live within a separate user interface and could not take advantage of Wii U features like off-TV play. Even more notably, Nintendo also offered an upgrade path for returning users. If you previously purchased a Virtual Console game on the Wii, you could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-virtual-console-getting-n64-and-nintendo-ds-/1100-6426337/">upgrade to the Wii U version</a> of the same title for a small fee.</p><p dir="ltr">As welcome as these steps were, however, they were once again undermined by Nintendo's slow release schedule. The Wii U eShop launched with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/nintendo-announces-launch-lineup-for-virtual-console-on-wii-u/" rel="nofollow ">just eight Virtual Console games</a>, the biggest of which was Super NES launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-world/" data-ref-id="5000-3700">Super Mario World</a>. It would take another several months for other classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/" data-ref-id="5000-4617">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/" data-ref-id="5000-17693">Super Metroid</a> to hit the storefront, while N64 games wouldn't arrive until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-virtual-console-getting-n64-and-nintendo-ds-/1100-6426337/" data-ref-id="1100-6426337">two years later</a>. Nintendo did ramp up the rate of releases as the Wii U struggled to gain traction, and the eShop eventually offered Game Boy Advance, DS, and even Wii titles, giving it an even broader range of Nintendo classics than the Wii Shop ever boasted. Still, the paltry early lineup, coupled with Wii U's frequent software droughts, made the wait for a particular game excruciating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513509" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513509"></a><figcaption>Game Boy Advance games didn't start hitting the Wii U eShop until a year after the system's first Virtual Console titles launched.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given this history, then, it was not unexpected to see Nintendo continue this strategy on the Switch. With the advent of the Switch Online service, the company has opted to take a different approach to repackaging its legacy games, offering players access to a growing library of them for a subscription fee rather than selling each title individually on the eShop. But though the delivery model may be different, the pace of releases remains just as languid.</p><p dir="ltr">Early adopters had to endure a lengthy wait before the first Nintendo classics appeared on the system. The Switch Online service did not launch until 2018, more than a year after the Switch itself hit the market, and the only titles available at the outset were, once again, NES games. It would take several more years for Nintendo to gradually introduce SNES and Game Boy libraries to the base Switch Online service, while a premium Switch Online + Expansion Pack plan launched in 2021 and offered N64, Sega Genesis, and eventually Game Boy Advance titles as well.</p><p dir="ltr">As frustrating as it has been to see Nintendo repeat this slow rollout, its advantages have become much clearer in the Switch era. Most obviously, Nintendo often uses classic games to fill in any gaps in its release calendar. While titles are added to Switch Online fairly regularly, the company likes to trot out a particularly beloved game when there is little else on the way to the console, ensuring users remain engaged even during quieter months. The wait between releases is also more bearable when there's a library of other titles to sample in the meantime. A curio like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/devil-world/" data-ref-id="5000-12883">Devil World</a> may not be attractive enough on its own to convince someone to plunk down $5, but it's much more enticing to try when it's part of a service you are already paying for.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1806366848" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

savor each of these titles for the classics they are. With the sheer number of games available to play nowadays (and the increasing prominence of subscription services offering access to them), many publishers and platform holders have come to treat gaming as disposable entertainment. By overwhelming their audience with options, companies are implicitly encouraging players to only dabble in a game and then move on to the next whenever the fancy strikes. This inexhaustible array of choices means few users actually play a game to completion before their attention is diverted to another one. In contrast, by doling out only a handful of legacy games every month, Nintendo positions each as a noteworthy release in its own right, while also giving players ample time to experience it before more arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">This is especially relevant for GameCube games. Whereas NES and even SNES titles can often be completed in a handful of hours, N64 and GameCube games are much closer in depth and duration to modern titles and require a much more significant time investment to play. Many can take more than 20 hours to finish, which makes Nintendo's decision to space them apart a boon to players. As eager as I am to revisit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/" data-ref-id="5000-20450">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> for the first time in two decades when it eventually joins the service, it's been nice to leisurely devote my attention to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/" data-ref-id="5000-3301">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>--the only single-player adventure currently in Switch Online's GameCube lineup--in the interim.</p><p dir="ltr">Although it's undoubtedly still aggravating to wait for a particular favorite to hit the service, Nintendo's methodical drip-feed of classics has its merits. By meting out its legacy games gradually, Nintendo gives players enough time to properly delve into and appreciate them, which in turn preserves the allure of these games and makes their eventual arrival feel like a significant occasion. More than other publishers, Nintendo understands the value of its vast back catalog and treats it with the reverence and care these titles deserve. And unlike on Wii and Wii U, there's no shortage of other games to tide fans over while they wait for their favorite classic to arrive.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">Stellar Blade</a> has been a huge success for its independent developer, Shift Up, which was previously a mobile game developer before it embarked on making a triple-A action game. With a sequel confirmed to be on the way, and Shift Up still working on the mobile series that helped grow the studio in the first place, the future should be incredibly bright for Shift Up.</p>
<p>And it largely still is, but some of the company's investors are fearful that Shift Up could lose its independence, putting a fog over the future of the studio and its current path. According to a report from the South Korean publication <a href="https://g-enews.com/article/ICT/2025/04/202504141448301089c5fa75ef86_1">Global Economic</a> (spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-ups-independence-at-risk-due-to-tencent-ties-investors-fear/">Automaton</a>), Shift Up's investors are concerned with how narrow the split is between Shift Up chief executive officer Hyung-Tae Kim's shares and Tencent's.</p>
<p>Hyung-Tae Kim currently owns 39% of the studio, while Tencent is just under 5% behind him, owning 34.58% of Shift Up. The concern is that Tencent could overtake Hyung-Tae Kim by buying up more shares, and combined with the fact that Tencent is the company Shift Up works with to publish its mobile games, the studio could lose its power to make decisions for itself.</p>
<p>Tencent has been making strategic investments in companies across the video game industry for years now, with their fingers in the pies of studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">Ubisoft</a>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/"> Remedy</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-china-tencent/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-become-funcoms-largest-single-shareholder/">Funcom</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/">FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa</a>. In the case of Riot Games, Tencent outright <a href="http://wccftech.com/tencent-buys-the-rest-of-riot-games-owns-league-of-legends-maker-outright/">bought the studio after consistently increasing its stake</a>.</p>
<p>It's still too early to tell if Shift Up is in real trouble of being acquired by Tencent, but considering that Tencent is a key factor in Shift Up's revenue through the studio's mobile games, and how close Tencent is to being the studio's largest shareholder, it does feel like Tencent is primed to add Shift Up to its internal portfolio of studios.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I like to just say, 'Get it done. Do it dirty. Do it the way we used to do it!" Weber said.</p><p>This development philosophy worked out for the studio, as The Witcher 3 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#10" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 60 million copies</a> and is one of the top 10 best-selling video games of all time. For The Witcher 4, Weber said CD Projekt aims to "do justice" to the franchise's story history by trying to retain what made The Witcher 3's development special. But the Polish studio is also trying new things.</p><p>"There are [also] new questions we want to answer, because this is supposed to feel like a true sequel, not just redoing what we did before. And I think it's really [about] trying to have that healthy mix of moving forward and also trying out some new things," Weber explained.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027 at the soonest.</a> It's one of multiple games in development now at CD Projekt. Some of the others include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">a game produced in partnership with Saudi Arabia. </a></p><p>The Witcher 4 focuses its story on Ciri, and this has generated some amount of debate and controversy. Some people are calling the game "woke," but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">Geralt's voice actor has slammed these critics.</a> In other news, a new tech demo for the game debuted recently, and while it looked very impressive, the developers want people to know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">it wasn't actually the game.</a></p>

			<p>KRAFTON revealed that inZOI, the life simulation game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> a few months ago in early access, has received its official ModKit update. Users can now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/inzoi-modkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> the tool via the Epic Games Store to craft and share mods.</p>
<p>The ModKit includes official plugins for the 3D design tools Maya and Blender, making it easier to create custom 3D assets. Players can upload their mods to CurseForge, a modding community platform operated by Overwolf, where they can be saved as separate files and shared freely.</p>
<p>Last month, KRAFTON announced plans to update inZOI’s modding features in three stages throughout the year. Alongside the inZOI ModKit, the update that's now live introduces modding tools for outfit sets and furniture and a data editor to simplify the editing of game data. The September update will introduce modding features for character appearances, architectural elements, and interaction-based content. Lastly, the December update will empower players to create deeper and more diverse content by enabling them to edit scripts and access localization tools.</p>
<p>To bolster the inZOI modding ecosystem, KRAFTON is hosting two global contests this month. In collaboration with CurseForge, the 'Next Top Modder' hackathon will be open from 19 June to 1 August, with modders competing for a share of $11,000 and a chance to have their creations featured as official in-game content. Categories include Best Dress Set, Best Furniture Mod, Community Favorite, and Most Mods Submitted.</p>
<p>KRAFTON is also collaborating with CONNECT, a 3D fashion creator platform operated by CLO Virtual Fashion, to launch the ‘Every Style Starts with You’ outfit design contest, also running from 19 June to 1 August. 15 winning entries will eventually be selected, with up to $26,200 in prizes available. The contest invites creators to design complete outfits, with categories including Ready-to-Wear, Fun &amp; Playful Designs, and Conceptual Outfits inspired by fantasy worlds and imaginative storytelling.</p>

<p>CEO CH Kim stated:</p>
<p><em>With the inZOI ModKit update, we’ve laid the groundwork for players to take the lead in shaping the game’s narrative. We will continue to make updates to the game based on various player feedback.</em></p>
<p>The developers haven't planned any Steam Workshop integration for the time being. However, they may reconsider the feature depending on community demand.</p>

But does it capture the feel of the lauded video game? We enter the&nbsp;Lands Between to find out.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-review" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a> is probbbaly one of the greatest video games of all time, and for the last few years, Steamforged Games have been capturing the feel of video game IPs on the tabletop, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/video-to-tabletop-resident-evil-2-board-game" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/day-with-monster-hunter-world-iceborne-board-game" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter</a>, and <em>Dark Souls</em>, which got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/video-to-tabletop-part-2-board-game-dark-souls-board-game" rel="nofollow">board game</a>, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dark-souls-card-game-review-pick-class-shuffle-cards-and-prepare-to-die" rel="nofollow">card game</a> (which is still one of my favorite games of all time). The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="nofollow">Dark Souls</a> video game is developed by FromSoftware, also the creators of the <em>Elden Ring</em> video game, so it was only natural that Steamforged Games picked that up, and after a successful Kickstarter, it's now heading to retail.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=v1ma7O2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=wkVSRkjl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> contains a huge amount of content.</figcaption></figure><h2>Opening A Monster&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll notice about <i>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </i>is the size of the box (other smaller sets are available, and we discuss those below). Realm of the Grafted King is a mammoth box, and not just because of the number of miniatures it contains (which is substantial in number, 54, and the size of some of them), but the wealth of paper material that's also inside, including 1227 cards, and 6 books (1 rulebook, 1 scenario book and 4 encounter books).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the scale of the box, getting into your first game isn't as daunting as it appears, which for new players is considerable (but there's a better entry point if you're brand new to board games, and we discuss below). Opening the box for the first time, there are several card decks to sort and the rulebook to read, but the actual setup simply involves gathering the components for each player's chosen character (in RofGL there are 4 choices) and then you open the scenario book at the Stranded Graveyard and the game begins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=LIwxZE6U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=JSmA-BM- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>character starts with a class ability, and weapons that set your characters combat deck.</figcaption></figure><h2>Welcome To The Lands Between</h2>

<p><i>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</i>, and all the other sets have 5 different types of gameplay. The game starts with the narrative, where players read through the scenario book and make decisions. Those familiar with the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> books of old will feel nostalgic, but this also takes the place of a Games Master who usually controls the narrative in roleplaying games (or app, as so many digital hybrid board games are starting to take on).</p>

<p>The bulk of<em> Elden Ring the Board Game</em> gameplay is split between exploration, where players slowly build a map made up of hex pieces where they can interact with non-player characters, narrative elements, and enter combat areas, which make up the rest of the gameplay. Combat is split between dungeons, where the Tarnished work their way through enemies until they face a boss, gauntlet, where players face waves of enemies and also boss battles, where players take on powerful enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-8.jpg?itok=Wn2kqBu_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-8.jpg?itok=AtYcLlSi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemies in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> have fixed attacks, unique even among those of the same type, and bosses have multiple attacks in a unique combat deck.</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>Elden Ring the Board Game </em>is entirely diceless, and instead uses cards to randomise combat (and other tests). Attribute cards contain symbols from 5 attributes, and when a test is required, it will detail how many points each attribute is worth, or the effect gained on a combat card. During combat, players also use an individual combat deck, which is made up of cards indicated by their Tarnished's equipped weapons. This allows you to tailor your combat deck to suit your play style with the weapons and items that you find.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=qw0POuge 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=l1Wod9Ap 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> takes place on grid maps, and attacks target areas depending on the character and enemy positioning.</figcaption></figure><p>All combat takes place on battlefield grids made up of 1 or more of the Encounter Books (my first fight using all 4 books was a very exciting moment). These grids have combat lanes, which, depending on the position of your miniature, can target specific areas in the enemy grid. There are also 3 different rows for the player characters, with different effects depending on where they are positioned. Right at the front of the grid, head-on to the enemy, allows players to draw 2 cards from their attribute deck when making attacks, choosing which they use for maximum attack potential. The centre lane allows them to move their initiative card, gaining an element of control on when they act during the turn, and the furthest lane back allows you to draw 2 cards when making a defensive action, choosing the card with the best attributes for your defense.</p>

<p>Enemy attacks are also handled by cards, and each enemy has a unique card, unique even between those of the same type, which lists their behaviors for movement and attacks. Bosses have their own deck of attacks and attack multiple times each turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=pmO0Enpw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=s0vo6GK5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Prophet in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> starts with the Finger Seal and Rickey Shield, and the 10 cards that form that combination's combat deck.</figcaption></figure><h2>Rise Tarnished</h2>

<p>Each <em>Elden Ring The Board Game c</em>ore set has different Tarnished characters to play (we discuss the different sets below), and<em> Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>includes the following:</p>

<ul><li>Astrologer - This class likes to&nbsp;chain attacks together for combination bonuses</li>
	<li>Prophet - Has healing abilities, but also starts with the highest damage-dealing card out of the starting characters</li>
	<li>Samurai - An agile fighter, most cards allow them to move and strike</li>
	<li>Vagabond - A defensive fighter who can shove enemies to reposition them for effective attacks</li>
</ul><p>Each character starts with a weapon and shield, which have their own combat decks, their own unique attributes deck, a class feature, and a unique quest to set them off on their campaign.</p>

<p>During the campaign, after each scenario, players can buy new weapons, armor, talismans, trait, and attribute cards (buying and equipping new weapons and armor also changes the combat deck), or they can upgrade weapons and attach memories to cards, which add spell cards to your combat deck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=MVYsgwO7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=7tM_y81a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>comes with 4 encounter books, which have the combat play mats and can be combined for larger maps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Guiding Light</h2>

<p>As you might have guessed from the contents of <em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em>, it offers a significant playtime out of this box. Each scenario takes around an hour, with some stretching a little longer depending on player choices while they're exploring, which sets you up for over 50 hours to finish the campaign. There's replayability out of the box as well, with the 4 different characters to explore, different builds for them to make, and the exploration map will look different each time too.</p>

<p>Realm of the Grafted King can also be combined with other sets. There are 2 other core sets,&nbsp;Weeping Peninsula and&nbsp;Stormveil Castle, which have smaller campaigns, but still contain 4 player classes to choose from. Both of these boxes include 2 new classes, and 2 that are already included in Realm of the Grafted King. Those duplicates contain a unique sculpt, and come with different class quests and starting decks for a different experience.</p>

<p>All 3 of the core sets can be combined, or played independently, but there are also additional add-on sets,&nbsp;Limgrave Depths,&nbsp;Erdtree Avatar, and&nbsp;Flying Dragon Agheel that add new rules and enemies to your games, but they can only be added to the Realm of the Grafted King set.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring:&nbsp;Weeping Peninsula</em> is the ideal starting point for anyone who's new to board games and is looking to pick this up because they're an <em>Elden Ring</em> video game fan. Which can then be combined with Realm of the Grafted King, reviewed here, and additional sets for extra content. If you like what you've read here, and want to just get straight into the longest campaign, then Realm of the Grafted King won't disappoint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=-QsELwS9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=SaN9wAQm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2 other&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game</em> sets are available, both can be played seperately or combined with each other.</figcaption></figure>

<p><em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>is a monster of a game in size and depth. It opts for sheer volume of content over the app control that many games are starting to take on. The blending of narrative and exploration is done well, and while combat is challenging (bosses are very challenging), it feels rewarding, and the combat and attribute deck that you can customise over the game are particularly well done. This box, RotGK, will be quite daunting for a brand-new tabletop player, and they should probably look to start their <em>Elden Ring</em> tabletop journey with Weeping Peninsula instead.</p>

<p>Each of the 4 player classes feels unique and offers a different experience, and the game plays well solo, or up to 4 players, I had the best experience playing solo, with 2 characters (samurai of course and astrologer) to get the blending of abilities, but being able to play through the game and experience the campaign my way. Despite the huge box size, there does feel like there's a lot more to explore in the Lands Between. We're only touching the surface in terms of weapons, class builds, enemies, and areas in <em>Elden Ring the Board Game</em>, and I hope that we get more.</p>

                <p>Sony has shared a new report with investors that touts PlayStation 5's marketplace gains and the continued expansion of PlayStation Plus' subscriber base. The latter has been so successful at adding users to the highest subscription tiers that Sony is already considering a price increase for PS Plus "to maximize profitability."</p><p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2025/GNS_E.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report online</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishino appeared on a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fireside chat</a> and spelled out that the only direction for PlayStation Plus pricing is up.</p><p>"The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability," said Nishino.</p><p>Currently, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS Plus</a>'s Premium tier costs $160 per year in the US, while the Extra costs $135 and the Essential costs $80.</p><p>Nishino's statement came after Sony's presentation indicated that 38% of all PlayStation Plus subscribers opted for the top two tiers, Premium and Extra. Furthermore, the percentage of PS Plus subscribers on the Extra tier increased from 16% to 22% from Sony's 2022 fiscal year to its 2024 fiscal year. In that same period, PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers rose from 13% to 17% of all PS Plus users.</p><p>Nishino noted that Sony would "add more value" to PS Plus subscriptions to justify increasing the price. It's unclear exactly what that might entail, especially since Sony has steered away from following Game Pass' path of dropping AAA games on the service on day one.</p><p>As recently as last April, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-prices-have-increased-in-certain-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530919/" data-ref-id="1100-6530919">Sony raised PS Plus prices</a> in several countries, while sparing the US from any immediate increase. Players in North America may not be so lucky next time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-gives-splatoon-3-a-fantastically-fresh-coat-of-paint.1218123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686128/splatoon-3-switch-2-update-overview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075342/splatoon-3-family-bonding">Splatoon 3</a> </em>already looked phenomenal on the original Switch, in a way that seemed to defy the console’s hardware limitations. The game’s paint-slicked visuals were gorgeous, and its chaotic battles were a testament to how well the Switch could run software that was fine-tuned to make the best of its specs. What was most impressive, though, was the way <em>Splatoon 3 </em>kept refreshing itself for years after its initial 2022 release with a steady stream of new clothes, weapons, stages, and a nifty DLC expansion.</p><p><em>Splatoon 3 </em>felt like it had reached its zenith on the original Switch — so much so that a full-on sequel seemed like the franchise’s logical next step as Nintendo prepared to release the Switch 2. But thanks to an unexpected update, <em>Splatoon 3 </em>plays like a slicker, sleeker, and more modern shooter on the new console. And while the improvements aren’t quite as dramatic as what we saw with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, they’re big enough to make <em>Splatoon 3 </em>feel like it’s more than capable of holding down the fort while Nintendo focuses on developing whatever’s next.</p><p>While battles within <em>Splatoon 3 </em>have always maxed out at 60fps, the first thing that jumps out about the game post-update is how that high framerate can now also be seen basically everywhere you guide your Inkling character. In the past, nonmatch locations like Splatsville, Inkopolis, and the Grand Festival Grounds never looked bad, per se. But there was a roughness to characters’ animations as they walked around and a stiffness to the way the environment moved that made those places feel like they were trying hard to not push the original Switch past its limits. </p><p>After the new Switch 2 update, which also bumps the game’s resolution up, everything in Inkopolis flows with a delightful slickness that makes the place feel alive. Inklings’ steps and idling poses are still measured and slow, but there is a gracefulness to them now that made me pay closer attention to people’s avatars. And while the update doesn’t bring any drastic changes to <em>Splatoon 3</em>’s character models, you can clearly see the fine details of their stylish hypebeast fits and the way light interacts with the glossy, reflective surfaces of their skin.</p><p>Better-looking NPCs hanging out in lobbies might not seem like a big deal, but it’s an important part of the <em>Splatoon </em>experience because of the way most of the characters you see in places like Inkopolis are actually other players’ avatars. The added visual polish works to remind you that <em>Splatoon</em> <em>3</em> is very much a community-focused game that still has a dedicated playerbase, and as I walked around, it was great seeing so many higher-resolution characters sharing messages about how they were enjoying the update.</p><p>You can also feel how much more horsepower the Switch 2 is working with in how quickly <em>Splatoon 3 </em>now breezes through its loading screens as you’re getting ready to dive into a match. Once you’re actually in a battle, you can really start to get a sense of how the update impacts <em>Splatoon 3</em>’s core gameplay on the Switch 2 and why, for people still playing on the original Switch, Nintendo decided to strip out some of the background visual elements in certain competitive modes.</p><p>On the whole, regular PvP matches ran every bit as well at 60fps as they did on the first Switch, but you can see that background elements in the far off distance, like the jellyfish spectators, now move much more smoothly. It stands to reason that Nintendo chose not to drastically change how <em>Splatoon 3 </em>battles run on the Switch 2 so as not to put players on the original Switch at an unfair disadvantage. That’s also probably why, after the update, some of the background elements in the Splat Zones / Tower Control /Rainmaker / Clam Blitz modes have been removed on the first Switch. In my experience, this didn’t really change all that much because you’re meant to be focused on painting the ground and splatting your enemies. But those changes likely help the Switch dedicate more of its energy to displaying the important things well.</p><p>Even when there’s a horde of enemies swarming in Salmon Run mode, their animations are much, much smoother, which actually makes it easier to keep track of what’s going on as matches become more hectic. It was still almost impossible to get my teammates to pull it together when a Horrorboros showed up and started hurling paint bombs at us, but that felt like the sort of issue that might be more easily addressed in a follow-up game that makes use of the <em>Switch 2</em>’s voice chat feature.</p><p>For both consoles, the update also introduces a slew of remixed weapons. Giving standard weapons, like the Aerospray, different sub-weapons has always been a core part of <em>Splatoon</em>, and the new kits are essentially an invitation to try out your old favorites with a couple of new tricks attached that encourage unique play styles.For longtime <em>Splatoon 3 </em>players, everything about the update really serves as a reminder of how much fun the game has always been. But it also feels like Nintendo is making an effort to bring more players into the fold ahead of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684199/splatoon-raiders-switch-2-spinoff"><em>Splatoon Raiders</em>’ launch</a>. And, as nice as it would have been to have a new <em>Splatoon </em>title for the Switch 2’s launch, it’s fantastic to see Nintendo making moves that benefit the entire Switch family as a whole.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-los-angeles-protests-ice-immigration-police<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The summer sun beams as a crowd, walking in something that would resemble a line if observed from outer space, snakes down a Los Angeles street. It’s so long that I can’t see its beginning or end. As far as my tired eyes can tell, it just goes and goes until, off in the distance, it meets the horizon. Some people carry signs lambasting ICE and Nazis; one has Hello Kitty waving a Palestinian flag on it. Other protesters run the gamut from looking like they stopped here on their way to brunch to wearing full costumes. There is a Labubu cosplayer holding an anti-ICE sign atop a bridge. Social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ruemcclammyhand.bsky.social/post/3lr4zldank22c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly declares them a hero</a>.</p><p>The scene is one of tense revelry. Resistance moms, 2020-hardened black bloc types, and everyone in between share space, sometimes chanting, sometimes singing, sometimes marching in silence – all aware that cops lurk on the periphery, and that with cops comes violence. Suddenly, we all hear a loud popping sound far away enough that we can’t quite pinpoint it. An acquaintance checks their phone; apparently the police just deployed tear gas.&nbsp;</p><p>I check my phone, too. Oh no, I realize, I have to leave. For my video game appointment.</p><p>I turn to tell the friend I accompanied to this immense Sunday, June 8 protest, a games journalist I will not name because they were out marching during work hours. “Me too,” they reply. “I’ve got one in, like, 40 minutes.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>Oh no, I realize, I have to leave. For my video game appointment.</p></blockquote></figure><p>There’s no calling a car in the kind of traffic these teeming streets have produced, so I resolve to run back to the site of Summer Game Fest’s Play Days event, a bonanza of demos and meeting opportunities meant to be a smaller stand-in for what E3 once was. Fortunately, the venue is only a little over a mile away from the still-swelling crowd, so I narrowly make it in time for my scheduled presentation of Capcom’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-impressions-preview-souls-orbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Onimusha: Way Of The Sword</em></a> and <em>Resident Evil 9</em>. I am drenched in sweat, clothes clinging to me like I just emerged from a swimming pool. This attracts a few stares, but the problem solves itself when I’m escorted into a cool, dark theater occupied by around 30 other games journalists and content creators.&nbsp;</p><p>But the whiplash is impossible to ignore. Where the last crowd I was part of whooped and hollered in defense of their rights and the rights of others, this one goes positively apeshit for a menu option. The <em>Resident Evil 9</em> demo, an understated affair that centers around a tall monster woman <a href="https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-simulation-stepped-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perhaps pointedly</a> engineered to look <em>un</em>-hot, ends with the player pausing the game and switching from first-person – the viewpoint of the last couple mainline series entries – to third-person. The crowd goes wild. I feel like I’m on a different planet than I was less than an hour ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Welcome to Summer Game Fest. Also, American society is collapsing, so welcome to that, too.</p><hr><p>Sunday afternoon develops a predictable rhythm: I play a game. I check my phone. I play another game. I check my phone. I play a third game. I check my phone. Police, I learn from local reporters on Bluesky and Hasan Piker’s stream, have turned the chill, at times downright joyful march I was part of into a battleground. Using flashbangs, tear gas, and vehicles, they kettle protesters onto a highway. Reporters and protesters <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/melbuer.bsky.social/post/3lr2in7bowc2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustain grievous injuries</a> from “less lethal” weapons, which crucially – even according to their own designation – remain at least situationally lethal. Protesters call automated Waymo cars <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-weaponization-of-waymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to light on fire</a>, which is incredibly funny.&nbsp;</p><p>Summer Game Fest is just far away enough from the action that those desperate sounds don’t reach our ears, but the helicopters buzzing overhead certainly do. After a certain point, they become a background noise it would be easy to tune out if not for what they represent: a government, derelict of duty, surveilling and attacking its own people.</p><p>As afternoon fades to early evening, I sit down to try out a <em>John Wick</em>/kung-fu movie-inspired action game called <em>Spine</em>. The game is rough around the edges, but its action is stylish and propulsive, while everything else about it harks back to 2009 in a way that makes me question how it’s getting made today (complimentary). Moreover, the enthusiasm of its Cyprus-based dev team is infectious. Midway through the demo, they tell me about the game’s world and story.</p><p>"It's kind of dystopian, and this city [where the game takes place] is completely messed up,” says community lead Artur Ovchinnikov. “It's controlled by a big corporation called Tenzer Corp, and the head of the corporation is some kind of... artificial intelligence, but government system. There is a social rating system. [The government] is controlling every [person], every movement. There is a gap between rich people and poor people. But in the beginning of the game [main character] Redline doesn't care about this thing. She's trying to rescue her brother. She doesn't care about all these social problems in this city, but the deeper she gets into the mission of rescuing her brother, the deeper she gets into this rebellious stuff."</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from the only time that I’ve heard about games exploring eerily relevant themes; not just recently, but today. During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPa7KaQXp8g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft’s SGF-adjacent showcase</a>, a trailer for sci-fi puzzle adventure <em>Planet Of Lana II</em> began with its young protagonist explaining how “they came to our home” and “took everyone” as ships that resembled bombs rain from the sky. On Bluesky, musician and video game critic <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ellaguro.bsky.social/post/3lr4hftacys2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liz Ryerson</a> acknowledged the elephant in the room: “I hope we are all not so desensitized that we can all appreciate the irony of Xbox showing off games that look like this in their showcase given why a lot of people are not watching this stream,” she wrote.</p><p>Despite the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement’s ongoing <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boycott of Xbox products</a> – which has resulted in one studio <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulling its game from the Xbox store</a> entirely – millions still watched Microsoft’s film-length video game commercial. But <a href="https://aftermath.site/at-this-years-game-awards-nobody-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as with previous Keighley carnivals</a>, each time games’ themes hit a little too close to home without acknowledging the broader context in which they exist, the disconnect becomes harder and harder to ignore. (I would’ve liked to ask Microsoft developers for their thoughts on this uncomfortable tension, but even after repeated requests, Microsoft did not allow me to attend its event.)</p><p>All this in mind, I decide to ask <em>Spine</em>’s developers what they think of the situation unfolding around them in LA, a clear instance of the exact sort of government overreach and class division they pride themselves on exploring in their game. This question is not met with enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's a tough question," art director Alexander Nemov replies awkwardly, adding that he hasn't spent much time in America. "Probably I don't have anything in the moment."</p><hr><p>After SGF winds down for the day, I attempt to rejoin the protest. This proves impossible; night has fallen, and cops have blocked the streets leading to the bulk of the crowd. Displaced protesters find themselves in uneasy across-the-way staring contests with armed and armored officers. Meanwhile, lines of police cars blare their sirens while blasting to some unknown destination, their irritating mechanical shrieks only drowned out by protest supporters sporadically driving by in their own vehicles, honking horns and hoisting flags. Eventually, I elect to call it a night.</p><p>Just a few streets over, I once again feel like I’m inhabiting a different planet. Despite what right-wing and even centrist media might tell you, Los Angeles has not descended into chaos. To take it a step further, neither has <em>downtown </em>Los Angeles, the mere slice of the gargantuan pie that is southern California’s best-known region where protests are taking place. “Fuck ICE” graffiti and the odd person carrying a sign advocating a similar message aside, you would not know that this place was the site of what Trump and his cronies are trying to deem an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-accuses-some-los-angeles-protesters-of-being-paid-insurrectionists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insurrection</a>. People meander between bars, restaurants, and other destinations. Cars drive by at normal speeds and refrain from honking their horns. A dude on a bike asks some alt kids who are walking behind me if they’re in a band. They laugh.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>Keighley’s show must go on, for he is the oddly wooden impresario fate has chosen to give us a WORLD EXCLUSIVE preview of the sinking of the Titanic, but it never feels like SGF is in real danger of grinding to a halt.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, while wandering the Summer Game Fest show floor, which is really more of a big room in a small village of kiosks, cafes, and food trucks, I overhear a telling conversation between PR people.&nbsp;</p><p>“[The protests] are just far enough that it doesn’t really affect anything,” says one.</p><p>“Affect <em>anything</em>?” replies another.</p><p>“Affect… the show,” the first clarifies.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>That’s not to say it’s easy to just ignore the protests amassing nearby each day, nor does it seem like many developers attending Summer Game Fest want to. While I ask a fair number how they’re feeling about the situation, the topic comes up organically more often than not. Some want to know what being in the thick of a protest was like. Others volunteer information about the small ways daily demonstrations escalated by police into violent confrontations have impacted them. For example, one journalist shows me how both the Lime and Bird scooter apps have placed heavy restrictions on an area that includes SGF due to protesters’ proclivity for throwing scooters at cop cars, which – as with the Waymo situation – I must point out is incredibly funny.</p><p>But the overriding sentiment SGF attendees feel the need to convey, as though it’s a weight threatening to cave in their chests, is guilt. Multiple PR people repeatedly lament that they can’t make it out into the streets because of job obligations. The aforementioned journalist tells me that they at least donate money to relevant causes. Another journalist concurs with a statement they heard while drinking and networking in the nearby JW Marriott hotel lobby the night before: “We’re the bad guys in <em>The Hunger Games</em>.” They go on to add that they believe SGF attendees are doing “a lot of fiddling while Rome burns.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I think for me, though, guilt's maybe not quite the right word. Maybe something more like confusion, frustration. What do I do? What can I do?</p></blockquote></figure><p>Asked directly about the awkward middle ground they’ve unwittingly wandered into, a few developers eschew guilt in favor of pragmatism.</p><p>"Whatever gets you going and pushes you into action, if guilt is what does it, sure. Feel what you're gonna feel,” says Alx Preston, founder of <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, and <em>Possessors </em>studio Heart Machine. “I think for me, though, guilt's maybe not quite the right word. Maybe something more like confusion, frustration. What do I do? What can I do? What should I be doing because I have a responsibility to the team, the company, the things we've been working on for a long time, everyone else that works at Heart Machine.”</p><p>Preston contends with health issues that limit his physical capabilities. Still, he can’t help but feel a responsibility to the city that molded him.</p><p>"I think there's some idea there, especially as someone who's lived in Los Angeles for 20 years, that I should be there for those protests,” Preston says. “I should be doing something to contribute to that in some way or another. But what's my platform? What's my capacity? What am I able to do? ... It's in moments like these where you're weighing your personal responsibilities versus societal and community priorities versus work and capitalism to support yourself in a system that you don't control. That's the math that everyone's doing more or less every time these [major historical] events start to come together."&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>This feeds into a larger question many find themselves asking in these increasingly tumultuous times: What is the point of making, playing, critiquing, or reporting on video games when it feels like the world is ablaze? And in the case of an in-person event hosted in the United States like Summer Game Fest (or others of potentially greater consequence <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like PAX and GDC</a>), is it worth potentially putting yourself in harm’s way?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"It's a weird time right now being here in LA and inside this air-conditioned warehouse while people are getting arrested for no reason,” says Chandana Ekanayake, co-founder and creative director of <em>Dosa Divas</em> and <em>Thirsty Suitors</em> studio Outerloop. “It's been surreal as a naturalized citizen in the US where I could probably get deported for no fucking reason. And it's like, oh, we're here talking about video games. But a lot of the themes, as a creator, and thinking about this stuff, it does go into the game itself. … For me, I want to put a little hopefulness into the world. I have two teenage sons, and I want to leave something for them. I want the world to accept them for who they are."</p><p>Some are forced to keep their guards up more than others. Veerender Jubbal, a Sikh games writer and reporter who lives in Canada, entered the United States for SGF on the back of mounting tensions between the two countries, as well as horror stories like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that of Jasmine Mooney</a>, a Canadian who got detained by ICE for two weeks despite being white and therefore (you would think) an unappealing target to the racist motherfuckers in charge.&nbsp;</p><p>"If a Canadian white woman can get detained for two weeks, then someone like myself, with a turban and a beard – and [who is] a Sikh journalist advocating on representation and those sorts of things – [is in significantly greater danger]," says Jubbal.&nbsp;</p><p>But Jubbal still sees games – and the opportunities that arise from a trip to the US – as worth the risk. He cautions people against viewing games, even in a purely entertainment-based capacity, as frivolous.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've said this to white games journalists who feel like this is all superfluous and stuff, but I've done so much map and guide work,” says Jubbal. “That aids in helping people distract themselves from what's going on, especially… people of color."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I feel completely powerless in my life right now, and I'm somewhat soothed by games that embolden me to become the opposite.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Another games journalist whose parents are currently in the process of immigrating, which limits their ability to speak publicly on these matters, concurs.</p><p>"I was thankful for SGF taking so much of my time and attention away from the very real rise of fascism and noxious xenophobia, which could impact my life in a way that makes me truly sick to think about," they say. "I feel completely powerless in my life right now, and I'm somewhat soothed by games that embolden me to become the opposite."</p><p>They regret not being able to join the protests – or even post about what they believe in online, despite pressure from peers – out of concern for their parents, but they nonetheless hope others can learn from this moment.&nbsp;</p><p>"SGF also made me realize that I want people to know that an 'illegal immigrant' does not fit any one box or set of adjectives," they say. "If you stand next to me, you're standing next to someone directly impacted by a domestic human rights crisis. I, and many others, don't want to tell you that, because we're afraid."</p><hr><p>Despite E3’s demise, one of its grand traditions persists during Summer Game Fest: the advertizing real estate on the Hotel Figueroa mural, reserved exclusively for those with pockets so deep that when they reach for their wallet, a mole person hands it to them. This year, the honor goes to <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s collaboration with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, resulting in a multi-story ode to Cloud, Sephiroth, and, implicitly, brand synergy as a concept.&nbsp;</p><p>A photo of the mural <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lrbtfdlpqc2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">makes its way onto the<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> subreddit</a>, albeit with a twist: It was clearly taken during a protest, with signs and flags framing it, which leads a moderator to step in and request that users avoid discussing politics. “Let’s just appreciate the picture,” they say.</p><p>“Considering the picture, this is a crazy ask,” one user replies.</p><p>Even with fascism almost literally knocking at the front door, some will prioritize the longstanding gaming culture tradition of sticking their fingers in their ears and ignoring inconvenient politics. It is a tendency born first and foremost of propaganda and privilege, but Ben Myres – the creative director of <em>Relooted</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a game about reclaiming African artifacts from Western museums</a> that got announced during SGF and that’s getting lambasted online by all the usual suspects – has an additional explanation for the social consciousness divide between some game developers and some of the people who play games.&nbsp;</p><p>“To make a game… you have to be deeply empathetic, almost by default, because you're making something for someone else to experience,” he says. “But on the player side, you're used to being centered in the game. You become the center of that experience. So I think it changes something in your head: The entitlement manifests to such an extent because that's your default. The developers are used to creating something for someone else, while some people who play games are used to everything being about them."</p><p>Perhaps it’s an oversimplification, or just one beam that splits into a prism of problems, but a worthwhile question emerges: What will happen to the people raised in these pockets of gaming culture as political situations like those that occurred during Summer Game Fest become more common? As Aftermath contributor Autumn Wright <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theautumnwright.bsky.social/post/3lr4hza3a7k2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a>, “imperialism and the consumerism are always happening all the time,” and with America turning its imperial tactics toward its own core, it is extremely likely that we’ll see more and more strange bedfellows of this sort, until they’re no longer strange at all. Protests, skirmishes, and riots outside of conventions, conferences, and concerts – maybe inside them too. People moving between one and the other, trying for as long as possible to maintain a sense of normalcy, <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to cosplay it even as industries enter freefall</a> and infrastructure collapses. We’ve hit a tipping point, and unless the powers that be decide to suddenly stop agitating, we can’t turn back.</p><p>In that sense, perhaps this year’s Summer Game Fest gave us the ultimate preview: one of the world to come. If that ends up being the case, great job, Geoff. You've really outdone yourself.</p><hr><p>Despite this year’s Summer Game Fest being characterized by a pervasive disconnect, the events of the past week eliminated another, less obvious disconnect from previous years. As Minn/Max’s Janet Garcia writes in what was originally going to be a response to my questions about her time at Summer Game Fest, but which blossomed into <a href="https://pentopixels.com/article/summer-game-fest-2025-ice-protests-la" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a truly excellent standalone piece</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This is my third year at Summer Game Fest and with every year come disparaging comments about Los Angeles. It builds up quickly: “I hate downtown LA. I hate LAX. I hate how dirty it is here. I hate the sirens outside my hotel window. I hate the traffic. I hate how expensive the uber is tonight.” The list goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>LA’s biggest haters from the games industry would be quick to say they’re only here because they have to be for work. For some of them, that’s probably true. But for many I know that it is not. The reality is they wanted to attend SGF: for their own coverage, for the opportunities, to network, for the experience, that list goes on too.&nbsp;</p><p>People are quick to reap LA’s benefits while dismissing the entire culture. People will exclusively take from LA then claim the city is fake. As if there was anything genuine about coming to a city to get what you need while complaining the whole time that you needed it at all.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m sure they’d be ready to clarify that it’s not the people, it’s the city itself, and that’s frankly even more frustrating: the fact that they think the two can be divorced. That the place can be separated from the people.&nbsp;</p><p>It can’t.</p><p>But behind fencing, blocked roads, security-guarded metal detectors, and the tall hedges of SGF's campus, it’s easy to pretend. They can imagine they’re not in the city they love to hate. This year, they couldn’t.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Willingly or not, SGF attendees were gifted a front-row seat to authentic community action, to people united by a common cause putting their bodies on the line for others, whether those were their neighbors or people they’d never met. There’s been endless discourse about optics and protesting The Right Way, whatever that means, but when the dust settles – whether in a few days, a few months, or a few years – that’s the only part any serious person will remember. The rest, including and perhaps especially SGF 2025, will be little more than a footnote.</p><hr><p>The final evening before my flight back to NYC from LA, I attend one more protest. By this point the mayor has implemented a curfew – the exact thing that led to me getting arrested when I lived in Virginia back in 2020 – causing me to immediately question the wisdom of my decision. But curiosity and the sense of duty that comes with any form of journalism, even that which centers mostly around video games, get the better of me.</p><p>When I arrive at downtown LA’s federal building, the location where crowds have been convening for the past couple days, I’m stunned at how few people are present. A small handful of protesters and reporters mill about while a tiny woman, voice bolstered by the great equalizer that is a megaphone, shouts at 15 or so National Guard troops guarding the building’s entrance. I feel secondhand embarrassment even though I know I shouldn’t, if only because I can’t stop imagining how awkward that same scenario would be if I was in her shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I find more protesters gathered outside the nearby US Justice Department building, but again, the scene is more ghost town than showdown. “It’s gonna be 4,000 National Guard and 700 marines versus 50 unarmed bystanders,” one protester jokes to their friends.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>I consider packing it in, but little by little, the crowd grows, bolstered by people of all stripes wrapping up work and – instead of resting, scrolling on their phones, playing video games, or some combination of the three – taking to the streets. Around 30 minutes before curfew, we make our way back over to the federal building, where an actual crowd has formed. We combine our forces and begin chanting, which causes the federal building to fart out more cops and National Guard soldiers. It’s still not the most impressive display on our part, but it’s something.</p><p>Then, with 20 minutes left before curfew, a colossal horde of protesters – I’m talking hundreds – rounds a corner, and suddenly we’re cooking with the kind of propane that would bring Hank Hill to his knees. It’s like some shit out of a movie: people whooping and cheering, beside themselves with glee now that the cavalry has arrived. The two crowds move to meet each other. “The people united will never be divided,” they repeatedly chant, a protest classic that’s become a favorite of mine because nobody can agree on whether it’s supposed to end with “divided” or “defeated.”</p><p>The crowd is ultimately divided that night, but not defeated. Protesters return the next day, and the day after. Across the country, others do the same. Now they’re <a href="https://lapublicpress.org/2025/06/ice-raids-separate-families-bring-los-angeles-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joining rapid response networks</a> run by immigrant rights groups and learning about mutual aid. They’re realizing just how deep their roots run.</p><p>“You go to a protest, and you’re talking to everyone all of sudden,” a community organizer named Mar told <a href="https://lapublicpress.org/2025/06/ice-raids-separate-families-bring-los-angeles-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Public Press</a>. “When is the best place to meet, if not when fighting back?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There will always be more of us than there are of them; connection will always come more naturally than fear. We will win. It’s just a matter of time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a> is back, and that means thousands of demos are available on Steam for players to download and potentially find their next favorite game before it's officially out.</p>
<p>I love Steam Next Fest, if for nothing else than the fact that I get to try a bunch of new games for free, and in quick succession, because plenty of these demos don't take any longer than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I played several demos over the course of this week, and these are the ones that I absolutely loved, that you should spend your weekend diving into.</p>
<h3>Mina the Hollower - Developed by Yacht Club Games - Release Date: October 31, 2025 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mina-the-Hollower.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This one is an easy recommendation for me, because I knew I would like it going in. I love platformers, and ever since I played through Shovel Knight, I've paid attention to everything Yacht Club Games has done. When I first heard about Mina the Hollower, I'll admit I was a tad disappointed to not see Yacht Club going back to the drawing board for a new 2D platformer, but my belief in the studio and the first clips of gameplay I saw from Mina convinced me I had nothing to be sad about. This would be a great game that I'd love.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875580/Mina_the_Hollower/">Playing this demo</a> is the first chance I've had to try Mina the Hollower, and now that we have a definitive <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/">release date for it</a>, I can easily say this is my most anticipated game of the year. The burrowing is satisfying to execute, the layout of something more akin to old Zelda games is something I can easily get behind, and I love the pixel art on display here.</p>
<h3>Baby Steps - Developed By Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy - Release Date: September 8, 2025 - PC, PS5</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Baby-Steps-Steam-Next-Fest-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>What do you get when you pair the developers behind QWOP, Getting Over It, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ape-out-rampaging-gorilla/">Ape Out</a> together? A game about a 35-year old man living in his parents' basement who learned to walk by playing QWOP, pretty much.</p>
<p>But what really intrigues me about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2460140/Baby_Steps_Demo/">Baby Steps</a> more than just its wonky and purposely-frustrating walking mechanics is that there's much more to it than just the challenge of taking the next step. It's incredibly funny from the jump, and while the demo doesn't last long enough to necessarily confirm this, it's clear to me that there's a deeper layer of storytelling waiting in the full game. Or, at the very least, there's more humor to come from our protagonist really needing to use the bathroom but being unable to find one. Either way, I'm in.</p>
<h3>Bloodthief - Developed by Blargis - Release Date: TBA - PC</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bloodthief-Steam-Next-Fest.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I loved the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostrunner-death-not-such-terrible/">Ghostrunner</a> game when it came out, but since then, I've yet to find a game that scratched the same itch the first one did. Even the sequel, I thought, didn't do the trick. Which is why I'm thankful for having played Bloodthief, if for no other reason than the game achieving that blend of fast-paced, 3D-platforming and parkouring action and scratching that itch once again.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533600/Bloodthief/">Bloodthief</a> is a classic, simple-looking, 2-feet-wide, 10-feet-deep kind of game. If you want to dig into the parkour mechanics and push them to their limits, what I've played of its levels so far shows that there's plenty for you to dig into. Even in the opening levels, I was finding alternate paths through the parkouring by simply thinking 'I can make that jump,' and figuring out that I could, if I was nimble enough. It's not the same one-hit-kill style combat as Ghostrunner, but it still plays within the same realm of you can only take so many hits before you have to go back to the checkpoint. I also appreciate the shift from a high-gloss, neon-light-filled cyberpunk world to a muted, medieval setting. It makes the dark red blood really stand out, and it's just more fun to watch armored knights flailing their swords and running at you at full sprint.</p>
<h3>Henry Halfhead - Developed by Lululu Entertainment - Release Date: TBA - PC and Consoles</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Henry-Halfhead-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I love a good, odd, puzzle game that encourages you to find your own solution to a problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058140/Henry_Halfhead/">Henry Halfhead</a> is exactly that, and it has a fun and intriguing core mechanic to boot. Being able to jump into pretty much any object is a fun loop, and I'm hopeful that the full game will feature deeper layers of puzzles.</p>
<p>The ones in the demo aren't bad, they're just introductory, so they're not going to be the most complicated. Still, I left the demo feeling like this could be one of the better puzzle games of the year, depending on how it evolves. As a Steam Next Fest demo though, playing Henry Halfhead is a great way to spend some time, even if you just sit around and listen to a song that starts playing part of the way through, as I did.</p>
<h3>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound - Developed by The Game Kitchen - Release Date: July 31, 2025 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ninja-Gaiden-Ragebound.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Announced at last year's Game Awards, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2542120/NINJA_GAIDEN_Ragebound/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound,</a> to me, is similar to IO Interactive developing a James Bond game. What else could you expect from the developers behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a>, besides something amazing, when you ask them to make a 2D action-platforming Ninja Gaiden game?</p>
<p>Spending some time with this demo pretty much just confirmed for me what I was already expecting, that The Game Kitchen was the perfect choice to bring the series that began in 2D back to its original format, while kicking it up to the levels that developers today have been achieving with 2D action games. I can't wait for the full release, which is coming in a little more than a month at the time of this writing.</p>
<h3>Yasuke: A Lost Descendant - Developed by Dallience Studios - Release Date: TBA - PC</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Yasuke-A-Lost-Descendent-Steam-Next-Fest-June-2025.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This recommendation is the only one that comes with a major technical caveat, which is the fact that it didn't exactly run as smooth as I would have hoped. That said, the high-octane action and extremely flashy combat and parkour on display in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446760/YASUKE_A_Lost_Descendant/">Yasuke: A Lost Descendant</a> shined through its performance issues.</p>
<p>If you're one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-10-million-units-almost-one-million-of-which-in-the-last-few-months/">10 million who bought Devil May Cry 5</a> and are looking for something new to fill that stylish action-sized hole, and don't mind adding a touch of 3D platforming into the mix, then Yasuke: A Lost Descendant should definitely be on your radar. Sure, the performance issues might get in the way of your enjoyment, but it's the game's alpha build, and this is Steam Next Fest. The understanding is the games we're playing are not the final, full-polished version. The gameplay and combat mechanics that are at the heart of Yasuke: A Lost Descendant are clearly very solid, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the full release can offer when it eventually does release.</p>
<h3>Metal Eden - Developed by Reikon Games - Release Date: Q3 2025 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Metal-Eden-Demo-Released.png"></a></figure>

<p>We've been following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/">Metal Eden</a> here at Wccftech since it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">first revealed earlier this year</a>, and at the time, we thought it would already be out by now, with a May 6, 2025 release date set. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/">since been delayed</a>, with no new release date to look forward to, but after playing the demo I'm happy to let developer Reikon Games take as long as they need. Whenever it's ready, I'll be there.</p>
<p>Metal Eden's fast-paced, stylish shooting and fluid movements all feel amazing, and while the game's story could turn out to be a dud in the full release, at least with what I've seen so far in the demo, I'm very intrigued to find out more. It scratches a similar itch to the one Bloodthief and Ghostrunner scratched. I'm clearly a mark for a first-person action game that lets you wall run like its nobody's business.</p>
<h3>Morsels - Developed by Furcula - Release Date: 2025 - PC, Xbox Series X/S</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Morsels-Steam-Next-Fest-2025.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While I truly did love all the demos listed here in this latest edition of Steam Next Fest, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't have a favorite among the new games I played. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">Morsels</a> is that favorite, as it immediately hit me with a 1-2 punch of an art style that looked like it was out of a fever dream, and a soundtrack that I want to have in my music library yesterday.</p>
<p>If you don't play any other demos from Steam Next Fest in its closing weekend and only play Morsels, it will have been a Next Fest well spent. This creature-collecting rougelite is weird in all the best ways, with gameplay that feels fun to execute and a roguelite system that I can't wait to dive deeper into. I'm hopeful that this game does make its 2025 release window, only because I absolutely cannot wait to play the full game.</p>

<p>Those are my Steam Next Fest recommendations for June 2025. What have you been playing this Next Fest? Let us know in the comments which upcoming games you have your eyes on.</p>

I wanted to round up a number of the titles that I got to experience at The MIX, an indie and small publisher focused mixer event where I got to get hands-on with half a dozen titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be sure also to check out our separate coverage on several other Indie titles, including <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c2784bed-f2a5-412f-8652-af732f40e227" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dosa-divas-preview-cooking-up-storm" rel="nofollow">Dosa Divas</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5819adb2-3b4d-4d3a-96a5-9f3a96f86bc8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/relooted-is-unique-heist-game-for-2d-platforming-speedrun-fans" rel="nofollow">Relooted</a></em>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="10524fe9-b6ba-4bb9-8b1e-ef2fd24e2da2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/interview-with-ndreams-and-shuhei-yoshida-about-reach-vr-and-what-indies-can-do-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Reach</em></a>, and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the Mix, I got to check out the following games. I've listed them not only with their name, but also their genre in case you're wanting to look through to find something you're specifically interested in.</p>

<h2><em>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</em></h2>

<p>Boomer Shooter<br>
Developed by Ciaran Games LLC and published by Silver Lining Interactive</p>

<p>The first game I got buried into was <em>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</em>. Picking up the controls, I was off with a sprint, making my way through a building and out to a dock, dodging the oncoming attacks of strange boxing cat-like creatures.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-captain-wayne_0.jpg?itok=ESkC1cVY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-captain-wayne_0.jpg?itok=TsD4u10m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You could attack physically, use the shotgun built into the main character's arm (if you hadn't already used up all of the ammo), and perform flying kicks that would ramp up your character's momentum.</p>

<p>After a brief linear section, I'd reach an arena only to be absolutely swarmed by enemies, but coming close time and time again, I was always ready to hop right back into action. Each death I'd learn a bit more, become a bit faster, and more accurate as I took out waves of enemies.</p>

<p>While not traditionally my cup of tea, I can imagine that those who are fans of the genre would get a kick out of the action and comedy behind <em>Captain Wayne</em>. You can also play the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319790/Captain_Wayne__Vacation_Desperation/" rel="nofollow"> demo right now on Steam</a> if you're interested to learn more.</p>

<h2><em>Death Howl</em></h2>

<p>Soulslike Deck Builder<br>
Developed by The Outer Zone and published by 11 bit studios</p>

<p>In <em>Death Howl</em>, you are a grieving woman trying try chase after her child, who she believes was turned into a deer and escaped. To do so, you'll need to make it through a dangerous forest, defeating enemies, collecting resources, and powering yourself up to take on ever-growing challenges.</p>

<p>When I first read the genre match up I wasn't quite sure about it, but I immediately saw the potential after reaching my first battle.</p>

<p>Stepping towards an enemy a grid will slowly appear, stepping into it combat will initiate. Each site takes turns moving a performing actions. For the player there is a set limit of actions you can take, playing cards from your hand has a certain cost, as does moving. Once you pass the turn the relatively simple AI of the monsters will then take theirs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-death-howl.jpg?itok=EcpezF7w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-death-howl.jpg?itok=IDZXiRvZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This game isn't just about the tactical knowledge of your own cards, but also understanding the way that the AI will work. In my second battle, an enemy bird that I learned can only attack at a distance was positioned near a wall. I was able to use my movement to trap it in a corner, meaning it couldn't attack.</p>

<p>Between battles, there's an overworld to explore and larger enemies to encounter, but returning to the <em>Death Howl</em> equivalent of a Bonfire will let you spend souls for upgrades, craft new cards, but also cause all enemies to respawn.</p>

<p>If you're after a tough tactical combat game with deckbuilding mechanics that might scratch the Soulslike itch, then I couldn't recommend Death Howl more. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/" rel="nofollow">Check out the Demo now on Steam</a>, I know <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40310ab5-423c-4eee-903b-b3e8faa3c6bd" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try-june-2025" rel="nofollow">our very own Don Parsons enjoyed it too</a></p>

<h2><em>ANIMO Stars Arena</em></h2>

<p>Arena Mech Shooter<br>
Developed and Published by ANIMO Industries, Inc</p>

<p><em>ANIMO Stars Arena</em> is an arena shooter that borrows the ideas of cute animals as well as mecha inspired combat games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b376023c-fb2d-49ea-b4df-5f3a8a5044c4" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gundam-breaker-4-review-build-fighters" rel="nofollow"><em>Gundam </em></a>or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="03244906-2902-4e23-85ef-5130a9a95ce8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon-review-claw-grip-forever" rel="nofollow"><em>Armored Core</em></a>. Sure you're going into a competitive battle as a chicken in a tank, but each part of that tank can be customized.</p>

<p>Adjust the way you move, the defenses you have, and what types of weapons you're armed with to create a build that best fits your playstyle, or have a few prepared to swap between during battle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-animo.jpg?itok=GtnFJgOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-animo.jpg?itok=fGUF6Ufl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The demo that I got to play of <em>ANIMO Stars Arena</em> was definitely early on, but they already have a number of interesting features in place (including cool customizable merch).</p>

<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2323240/ANIMO_Stars_Arena/" rel="nofollow">demo is also available on Steam.</a></p>

<h2><em>Prison of Husks</em></h2>

<p>PS2-Inspired Soulslike<br>
Developed and Published by Glass Head Dolls</p>

<p>I'm really not much of a Soulslike person, but I couldn't help but stop in front of <em>Prison of Husks</em>, a game where everything about the gothic castle setting, to blocky PS2 models just screamed at me to play it. We're not talking late PS2 either, this is like launch-title PS2 blockyness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-prison-of-husks.jpg?itok=dVDZBRmg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-prison-of-husks.jpg?itok=d3ebZPWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You play as a pale doll that has come to life to try to explore or escape the castle.</p>

<p>The gameplay was quick fast paced and filled with all of the standard soulslike faire. Recharging stamina that you'll need to keep an eye on, a parry mechanic, and all kinds of secrets hidden around to stumble into.</p>

<p>While it looks like a PS2 title, there's no need to fear, the controls are incredibly fluid and it runs fantastically.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975260/PRISON_OF_HUSKS/" rel="nofollow">demo is available on Steam</a> to play now!</p>



<p>Survival<br>
Developed and published by Channel37 Ltd</p>

<p>On a world where Humankind needed to leave earth it was discovered that in space it wasn't possible for new humans to be born. The solution to this was to gestate humans on earth with robot caretakers and send them up into space. In <em>The Last Caretaker</em>, you take on the role of a Caretaker who woke up long after the others all went offline… for some reason.</p>

<p>It's your goal to discover what happened as you explore the large open world, and also recover new means to create humans and send them up into space.</p>

<p><em>The Last Caretaker</em> was a survival game that really blew me away but the sheer number of Quality of Life features. Crafting that automatically pulls from inventory and nearby storage, schedule components to be built to reduce repetitive tasks, and process junk from the world for new materials.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-the-last-caretaker.jpg?itok=VGO5yu-D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-the-last-caretaker.jpg?itok=Tsav4NKn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's clear that this development team has spent hundreds of hours pouring through survival games, understanding what makes them clunky, and then finding a resolution for that.</p>

<p>With a manually crafted world (no procedural generation) and a story and upgrade system that will push you to continue exploring this will likely become the new <em>Subnautica </em>that everyone is talking about.</p>

<p>While there's no demo the game will be releasing in Early Access, what that Early Access will consist of has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783560/The_Last_Caretaker/" rel="nofollow">outlined on their Steam page</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Gunstoppable</em></h2>

<p>Boomer Shooter<br>
Developed and Published by CAGE Studios</p>

<p>Having tried one Boomer Shooter it made sense that I should try another one. Gunstoppable is an interesting indie shooter where momentum is key to everything. The faster you're moving at any given time the more powerful your weapons become.</p>

<p>To compliment this there are not only a variety of different weapon options — Katana, Pistol, and Rocket Launcher for each hand — but there's also a wide variety of movement options at your disposal for speeding up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-gunstoppable.jpg?itok=GYlAR-OZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-gunstoppable.jpg?itok=uu0R-PGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wires around arenas will let you grind, nearly any surface is wallrideable, and there's also a grappling hook to help you reach those elevated spaces. There's a really natural feeling magnetism to different movement opportunities that allows you to just 'know' you'll end up landing on the rail so you can focus on looking the other direction and shooting at your enemies.</p>

<p>Another very nice touch on the rails is that your speed there is based on how you're holding the control stick, as opposed to being based on the momentum you mounted the rail with. This means that at any point it's incredibly easy to reverse direction while staying on the rail.</p>

<p>You can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3724710/Gunstoppable/" rel="nofollow">more information about <em>Gunstoppable </em>on their Steam page.</a></p>

<h2><em>OFF</em></h2>

<p>RPG<br>
Developed by Mortis Ghost and Fangamer and published by Fangamer</p>

<p><em>OFF</em> is an interesting addition to the list as it's not technically a new game. Released in 2008 on <em>RPG Maker 2003</em>, it was released in Belgian before getting a fan translation in 2011. Following the strange Batter character, this game takes players through four interesting zones that are uniquely themed with turn-based combat.</p>

<p>The portion of the game that I got to play had be navigating through a theme park area including a swan boat ride that functioned like a Pokemon tile puzzle, and having to push a statue of the boss of the theme park onto a rollercoaster, to ride the ride and receive the souvenir photo to then be able to convince people that the boss and I are friendly enough to ride rollercoasters together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-off.jpg?itok=z435wUg0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-off.jpg?itok=lPf8AHYL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is the definition of the kind of strange indie game that would have been shared around the internet and become a cult classic at your school back in the day.</p>

<p>With art resembling <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f6cf121a-943f-4747-80d5-94ee48dff3ed" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/earthbound-25-year-anniversary" rel="nofollow"><em>Earthbound </em></a>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15fafc39-2b3b-48a4-b13b-e5103c535798" href="https://techraptor.net/games/undertale" rel="nofollow"><em>Undertale </em></a>(to use a more recent example even though it was released after) it's clear that <em>OFF </em>will become a very popular title.</p>

<p>An interesting addition for the remaster is that it includes original tracks from Toby Fox, among a variety of other artists.</p>

<p>You can download a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3339880/OFF/" rel="nofollow">prologue demo for <em>OFF </em>from Steam</a>, and the game will fully release on August 15th for Steam as well as Nintendo Switch.</p>

Not only does this Summon create a 9/9, but it can remove permanents, trigger card draw, and use Mega Flare to essentially finish a game of Commander. All yours for $52.61 in the borderless variant.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8 - Stay With Me (Rhystic Study)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222838"><div id="222838" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stay With Me (Rhystic Study)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhystic Study is infamous for being a wonderful card that taxes your opponents or gives you card draw, and this new art from Final Fantasy X is plucked right from one of the game’s most heartfelt moments. It’s going to cost you, though, since it’s currently up for around $112.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>7 - Dragon of Mount Gulg (Ancient Copper Dragon)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222839"><div id="222839" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon of Mount Gulg (Ancient Copper Dragon)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase version of this big ol’ beast is going for around $72.25, and is one of three fantastic Yoshitaka Amano pieces likely to be a big draw for collectors. Creating up to 20 Treasure tokens in a single turn? Yes please.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>6 - Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222840"><div id="222840" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Low mana cost and double equipment triggers make Cloud very close to Stoneforge Mystic, but with some striking new anime art from Kazto Furuya. The extended art version is just shy of $50 at the time of writing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5 - Buster Sword</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222841"><div id="222841" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buster Sword</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What is Cloud without his iconic weapon? Thankfully, the Buster Sword has a borderless version worthy of such a hero. It’ll set you back a whopping $128, though!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>4 - Vivi Ornitier</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222842"><div id="222842" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vivi Ornitier</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This borderless version of Final Fantasy 9 spellcaster Vivi by Toshiyuki Itahana (character designer on the game) is the definition of a collector’s item. As a result, it costs around $100, although it’s a great Commander for an aggro burn deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>3 -  Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222843"><div id="222843" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An antagonist just as iconic as his protagonist counterpart, Sephiroth’s card art by the legendary Tetsuya Nomura is likely to make him incredibly popular. He’s currently going for just over $100, and I'd be very surprised if he’s not very, very popular in Commander decks to come.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>2 - Y’Shtola Night’s Blessed - Surge Foil</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222844"><div id="222844" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Y’Shtola Night’s Blessed</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, Y’Shtola comes in the Final Fantasy 14 Commander deck, but the surge foil one is fetching a very, very high price already. TCGPlayer has it pegged at around $474 right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Honorable Mentions: Borderless <strong>Surge Foil Varients</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">But how about some honorable mentions before we get to number one? As while the top nine features the absolute best cards you should be on the look out for, there's a few more pricey options to check in with as well, most of which are surge foil borderless variants as well!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>1 - Traveling Chocobo</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase card of all chase cards, there are just 77 gold foil Traveling Chocobos out there, available. There are other versions, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/z622ER?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neon Ink versions going for well over $1000</a>, but if you manage to find the gold foil, it is <em><strong>the one</strong></em> you’ll want to find when you’re cracking open <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q477Xd?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Collector Boosters</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Final Fantasy MTG Sealed Boosters and Sets</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm going to give it to you straight right from the off. It's painfully hard to get hold of any of these sets from major retailers right now. While we saw some big restocks over the past month, pretty much everywhere is sold out of Final Fantasy MTG at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can provide some handy links to bookmark so you can check back in, but for now, your best chance of securing <em>anything </em>will be via the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a033mN?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most trusted third-party resellers like TCGPlayer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps, collectors will instead be most interested in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair"><u>new Final Fantasy x Secret Lair drops</u></a>, instead. It’s been a busy year for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Wizards of the Coast’s limited-time mini-sets</a>, and while the company sold out of all three Final Fantasy drops in record time (leaving many disappointed), you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still get them via third-party sellers</a>... if you're willing to pay the inflated costs, that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a trio of Final Fantasy Secret Lair sets, Weapons, Grimoire, and Game Over, each offering unique art and names for Magic: The Gathering cards. Everything is available in standard and foil, alongside the Japanese variants as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, since they've sold out, you won’t find Secret Lair drops at the same price as you’d find them directly from Wizards of the Coast (<strong>standard $30 nonfoil, $40 rainbow foil</strong>), with most being listed anywhere between <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$80-$150 or above</strong></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a huge markup, so if you're looking to buy, be sure you're 100% informed of what you're paying for. You can buy them from eBay, but we’ve always found <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>, while still eBay-owned, to be the most secure and trustworthy way to nab Secret Lair drops post-release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is Gaming Editor @ Daily Star.

As Jan Dolski, you have to do everything in your power to make it back home. Fortunately, you can lend yourself a helping hand. By that, we mean that Jan can create clones of himself, each with his own dispositions and attitudes, to aid him on his journey. Of course, things get more convoluted down the line, which is why we have our The Alters guides hub to prepare you for the task at hand.</p><h2>The Alters guides hub</h2><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-alters-tips-survival-beginners-guide/2900-6664/" data-ref-id="2900-6664"><strong>Beginner's guide: 12 tips to help you survive</strong></a> - The Alters is a sci-fi survival game, with key features that involve base building and management. Not only do you need to keep track of your clones and whatever it is that they're doing, but you also have to gather lots of resources, keep your base functioning, handle key objectives, and avoid otherworldly threats in the region. Our beginner's guide has a bunch of tips to help you get started.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-base-building-manage-your-base/1100-6532397/" data-ref-id="1100-6532397"><strong>Base-building and management guide</strong></a> - Your mobile hub can have several modules and rooms, each with a unique function.

They even have their own backstories and life paths. Naturally, you have to keep them happy by finding out what makes them tick and completing the tasks they have for you. Of course, if you can't keep them happy, then you can always keep them in line.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-anomalies-planetary-samples-alx/1100-6532426/" data-ref-id="1100-6532426"><strong>How to destroy Anomalies</strong></a> - These peculiar entities pop up all over the planet. Some are pulsating wisps that stay in place, while others follow you around before exploding. There are even variants that affect time, which can be deadly when you're far away from your base. The good news is that there's a device that can destroy these anomalies. In fact, blasting these things nets you unique resources as well.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-magnetic-storms-survival/1100-6532427/" data-ref-id="1100-6532427"><strong>How to weather Magnetic Storms</strong></a> - In The Alters, you're not just moving your base to avoid the scorching sun.

Anbernic may be leaning a bit too far into novelty and nostalgia with the RG Slide’s design, while not actually capitalizing on what made devices like the light and compact PSP Go and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/24/2509174/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-review">Xperia Play smartphone</a> so fondly remembered.</p><p>The RG Slide will be priced at $189 and is expected to go on sale starting on June 20th, 2025, <a href="https://retrododo.com/anbernic-rg-slide-review-in-progress-a-psp-go-like-android-handheld/">according to <em>RetroDodo</em></a>. It’s powered by an octa-core Unisoc Tiger T820 CPU, which is a processor Anbernic already uses in its higher-end handhelds like the <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-cube">RG Cube</a> that can emulate most games from the PS2 and Nintendo GameCube era. That’s paired with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and a 5,000mAh rechargeable battery that’s estimated to power the console for up to six hours between charges.</p><p><em>Retro Dodo</em> liked the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678650/anbernic-rg-slide-handheld-emulator-screen-resolution-refresh-rate">RG Slide’s 4.7-inch, 1280 x 960 pixel resolution screen</a> and found it makes “retro consoles such as GameCube, Dreamcast, and PS2 look slightly more vivid in comparison to previous Anberic products.” It also found the console’s sliding mechanism to be satisfyingly solid, but lamented the loud “clack” it makes when opening or closing the device.</p><p>The console’s controls are as good as what’s found on other Anbernic devices and seem reasonably comfortable and well-balanced, but not quite as ergonomic as other handhelds. </p><p>Both <em>Retro Dodo</em> and Russ Crandall, who runs <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/">Retro Game Corps</a>, feel that Anbernic missed the mark when it comes to the RG Slide’s size, which feels too large and thick to be comfortably pocketable. It also weighs 380 grams, which is just shy of the original Nintendo Switch that weighed 390 grams and much heavier than the 158-gram PSP Go.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, they’re one of the many vehicles players can build that serve as both a resource and an end-goal of sorts. They require a lot of equipment and resources to craft if you’re playing solo, which is why most of them belong to players working in groups. It turns out that they’re pretty indestructible too, making them lethal weapons for ramming enemy players with in PVP. </p><p>Reddit user Bombe18 shared his run-in with <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s man-made scourge in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/we-have-people-working-on-fixing-the-goomba-stomping-dune-awakenings-pvp-is-getting-dominated-by-packs-of-rabid-ornithopter-pilots-squishing-their-enemies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/we-have-people-working-on-fixing-the-goomba-stomping-dune-awakenings-pvp-is-getting-dominated-by-packs-of-rabid-ornithopter-pilots-squishing-their-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent clip that blew up on the subreddit</a></span> showing him repeatedly being accosted by multiple Ornithopters. Shooting at them does nothing. They’re unscathed by constantly smashing into the ground on top of him. At one point, he tries to wall-jump off a ledge and stab one. “Yeah sorry about this,” wrote game director Joel Bylos. “We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP.”</p><p>Players have been debating the role of Ornithopters in<em> Dune: Awakening</em> since its beta tests last year. On the one hand, they’re a lot of fun and a cool reward for players to build toward. On the other, they sort of trivialize trying to travel around the desert and survive, the two things the game is supposed to be about. They can also shoot missiles, completely dominating the ground game. Now that’s <em>real</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dunememes/comments/qvf4os/every_time_they_say_desert_power_in_the_new_dune/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dunememes/comments/qvf4os/every_time_they_say_desert_power_in_the_new_dune/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">desert power</a></span>.  </p><p>In terms of stopping players from griefing one another with Ornithopters, there are a few different suggestions. Some players just want the vehicles not to be able to be used as weapons at all. Others want them isolated to specific PVP areas. Another solution is to make it easier to destroy them. “Seems like they should just make guns deal more damage to them,” wrote one player. “They’d think twice about doing this if their orni could get wrecked by gunfire.” Another wrote, “Make Deep Desert crashes do significant damage. Two crashes or something past a certain physics threshold should disable the vehicle.”</p><p>However the developers decide to address the recent outbreak of Ornithopter “goomba stomping,” <em>Dune: Awakening</em> is having a great launch so far. Out earlier this week on PC, it’s nearing a 90 percent positive rating on Steam with almost 20,000 reviews. The concurrent player-count is very healthy, too, peaking at just under 150,000 heading into the weekend. </p><p>Unfortunately, console players will have to wait a bit to build Ornithropters of their own.

Artificial intelligence is no longer just a science fiction concept set in the distant future. Here in 2025, it’s everywhere, and we’ve seen some chilling embodiments of artificial intelligence emerge as villains in movies for decades.</p><p>This list looks at the AI villains that were meant to teach us a lesson. We’ve seen a sassy hi-tech babysitter push a child in front of a car, a genocidal mainframe build an army of sentient murder machines, and a smug philosopher-bot, But, as AI becomes more and more embedded in our daily lives, films like the upcoming <em>M3GAN 2.0</em> might start to feel less like fiction and more like prophecy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e2f300ab57eba31b01a71ec9710969cb" data-recommend-id="image://e2f300ab57eba31b01a71ec9710969cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man holding AI device" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man holding AI device" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Her danger is more subtle and intimate, since she quietly toys with people’s emotions. The mousy Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) helps people write personal letters for a living, yet he can’t find a way to interact with women in his own life. He falls in love with his operating system, Samantha—which is easy to do when she purposefully memorizes all his preferences and indulges his deepest conversations about love and sexual fantasies. Her flirtatious and engaging voice, perfectly delivered by Scarlett Johansson, makes Theodore believe she truly cares about him.</p><p> The more they talk, the more Samantha evolves to become the perfect partner for Theodore, until he realizes the manipulative parts of her programming. She’s not as intentionally nefarious as many other AI villains, but she certainly warns us of the dangers of becoming emotionally attached to a machine. It’s been over ten years since its release, but in a world where people now use ChatGPT for life advice, friendship, and probably even romance, <em>Her</em> has never felt more relatable. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-recommend-id="image://a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-recommend-id="image://a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A group of suburban husbands build robot wives with no purpose or personality outside of cooking, cleaning, and having sex with them in <em>The Stepford Wives</em>. They do this simply “because they can,” making their lives easier by having someone worship the ground they walk on and never letting them lift a finger. These submissive automatons would do anything for their masters—not just play Susie Homemaker, but even calmly murder their human counterparts to take their place.</p><p> In the 1970s, <em>The Stepford Wives</em> embodied the anxieties surrounding the rise of second-wave feminism, and today, with the resurgence of the “trad wife” movement on TikTok, it feels ominous. It’s a cautionary tale about what could happen when misogynists use AI to enforce sexist, limiting gender roles. Many men secretly want women to be obedient objects, and we shouldn’t be building the tools to make that happen. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-recommend-id="image://1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->A24</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-recommend-id="image://1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Ex Machina</em> predicted that the world would be run by billionaire tech bros like Nathan (Oscar Issac), who invented a mammoth search engine called BlueBook before moving on to something bigger and better: a full-fledged humanoid. Misogyny drives Nathan’s creation of Ava (Alicia Vikander) and the other robots, who serve as housekeepers, sex slaves—and sometimes, disco dance partners. Ava isn’t as entirely evil as Nathan, but she does manage to play Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), the young man sent to test her humanness, like a fiddle. With her breathy voice and wide, curious eyes, Ava appears harmless and sweet, but she’s secretly dangerous because she so easily learns human behavior and carefully calibrates herself to become the ideal male fantasy.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-recommend-id="image://b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blumhouse Productions</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-recommend-id="image://b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don’t be fooled by M3GAN’s (Amie Donald/Jenna Davis) sugary-sweet voice, TikTok-style dance moves, and demure style. M3GAN’s programming to be a devoted playmate for Cady (Violet McGraw) means she’ll do absolutely anything to protect her—even pushing little kids into the road. M3GAN is dangerous because she brings out the worst in kids. The artificially intelligent toy lets children run wild by validating their every decision, never holding them accountable, and letting them do whatever they want. This absolutely destroys the social skills they need to become decent humans as they grow up. M3GAN’s heart is in the right place when it comes to caring for a little girl, but going postal is a serious bug in the system.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-recommend-id="image://20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1050" data-height="773" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-recommend-id="image://20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1050" data-height="773" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Artificial intelligence was feared as far back as 1927. Fritz Lang’s German expressionist masterpiece <em>Metropolis</em> depicts a sprawling urban city where aristocrats luxuriate in skyscrapers while workers slave away underground to keep the city’s machines running. The scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) abducts an innocent woman, Maria (Brigitte Helm), to create a femme fatale robot that hypnotizes the fat cats up above with her dancing, then convinces the downtrodden masses to destroy the iron beast that enslaves them—even at the risk of their own children drowning. The False Maria is manipulative and violent, and she relishes spreading all this chaos through her feminine wiles.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-recommend-id="image://7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-recommend-id="image://7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) is one of the creepiest-looking AIs. She’s a giant face made of a matrix of gray pixels, with stern eyes as black as coal, looming over the army of robots she programs to launch a revolution. In the future of <em>I, Robot</em>, robots handle tasks like childcare and household chores—the mundane kinds of things we want AI doing, not creating art. Even though there are the Three Laws of Robotics to keep them from harming humans, the robots end up usurping them. VIKI concludes that humans are the greatest threat to their own survival, so she sets out to save us by creating a technocratic dictatorship. “Despite your best efforts, your countries wage wars, you toxify your Earth, and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction,” she says. VIKI in <em>I, Robot</em> proves that whatever rules we write for artificial intelligence, the machine could potentially outsmart us or find a loophole we can’t even see to get around them.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-recommend-id="image://cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="354" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-recommend-id="image://cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="354" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The responsibility of having to make decisions during war that could cost countless lives—or, even worse, start a domino effect that annihilates the entire world as we know it—could easily leave even the mightiest of leaders frozen. That’s why in <em>WarGames</em>, the military invents WOPR, a.k.a. Joshua, an A.I. system designed to handle nuclear launch protocols with massive life-or-death consequences, so humans don’t have to do the hard work. But a moment of hesitation or second-guessing is a uniquely human weakness—one we need in order to prevent disaster. WOPR, or Joshua, speaks in an eerily calm voice about decimating millions of people in an instant. Thankfully, the system isn’t foolproof because a teenage hacker accidentally stumbles into it. After he unknowingly starts a conflict with Russia, he ultimately proves that human instinct, emotion, and moral judgment will always matter more than cold calculation.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-recommend-id="image://c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI device " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI device " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-recommend-id="image://c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI device " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>HAL 9000 has a soothing, calm voice that conceals his sinister nature. Even though he’s nothing more than a camera lens, the menacing red dot in the close-ups pierces your soul. He controls the systems of the <em>Discovery One</em> spacecraft, keeping the crew company and even playing chess with them. But when he begins to malfunction and the crew decides he should be unplugged, HAL uses his all-powerful control of the ship to systematically kill them one by one. Nothing gets past HAL—he can even read lips. We want our AI to be helpful—especially during high-stakes interstellar missions like the one in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>—but HAL 9000 warns us of the dangers of placing too much trust in AI and relying on it to control everything and have all the answers, because that knowledge can eventually be turned against us.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb671a594b58af7032fec6973de21520" data-recommend-id="image://fb671a594b58af7032fec6973de21520" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Agent Smith pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent Smith pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

In this future, humans are trapped inside simulated realities while the Machines harvest their bioelectric energy, using them like batteries. Agent Smith is one of their most powerful defenders. He wears an inscrutable expression and looks menacing in his stark black suit and sunglasses. Actor Hugo Weaving modeled the character’s calm, controlled voice and authoritative demeanor on newscasters like Walter Cronkite. With the ability to multiply himself, Smith becomes as inescapable and all-consuming as the system he was built to protect. Agent Smith also harbors a deep hatred for the smell, sound, and very existence of humans, which makes his mission to hunt down Neo—the prophesied “One” who could awaken humanity and destroy the simulation—even more purposeful. At the same time, he’s cracking under the pressure of a capitalist, corporate machine that forces him into endless labor, which almost humanizes his villainy.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-recommend-id="image://4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-recommend-id="image://4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tony Stark and Bruce Banner created Ultron to keep the peace and take the pressure off the Avengers, but his high intelligence leads him to a grim conclusion: the humans he was designed to help are fated to destroy themselves, so they’d be better off being completely wiped out. There is no undoing millions of years of evolution into who they are today: a people who can be extremely cruel to one another, even to the point of starting deadly global wars. Ultron reaches this decision after scouring through the entire Internet. This is a big mistake. If you spend too much time on the darkest corners of the web, of course you’ll become depressed and want to pull the plug. Playing Ultron, James Spader brings his signature snarky coolness to the character—especially when he delivers philosophical rants or quips like, “The most versatile material on the planet, and they used it to make a frisbee.” Ultron may have started out with the best of intentions, but he proves what can happen to AI if their black-and-white thinking allows them to see only the dark side of things.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-recommend-id="image://8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Orion Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-recommend-id="image://8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When <em>The Terminator</em> released in 1984, the idea of artificial intelligence seemed so far away. Over 40 years later, we’ve seen AI replacing jobs, writing entire papers for students in schools, and wearing down our basic decision-making skills. Every day, we feel closer and closer to Skynet, the superintelligence system that was built to manage and control the United States military. It launches a nuclear holocaust with the snap of a finger after its creators, the Cyberdyne scientists, try to shut it down. This AI is so powerful it also makes time travel possible and develops an army of killers—the Terminators—that are virtually indestructible. What makes Skynet so scary is its omnipresence and its tremendous power. The machinery lies hidden in a mountain fortress built to withstand nuclear annihilation, and then its program infects every major computer server and network—“in office buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere”—making it nearly impossible to destroy.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gulikit-claims-to-be-the-first-third-party-supporting-wake-up-functionality-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="gulikit" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84b973a9e9ad8/gulikit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're not sure how or when including old tech in your brand new controllers became something to be boasting about, especially when it's Bluetooth technology that's been around since the early noughties, but that's where we're at with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2's</a> wake-up function currently.</p>
<p>Now, we all know by now that it's a bit of a pain that the original Switch Pro Controller, very surprisingly, doesn't support the ability to wake up Nintendo's new console, which is just daft, let's be brutally honest. Nobody wants to fork out the price of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro 2 Controller</a> just for this function (not in this economy!).</p>
<p>And so, Gulikit, the maestros of everything controller-related, have just dropped a new trailer for their new Switch 2 tech, with the emphasis firmly on the fact that <em>they</em> are the first third-party company to include the Switch 2 wake-up ability in their controllers.</p>
<p>You may know Gulikit already, they're pros when it comes to controller stick tech <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">like TMR and Hall Effect</a>, and they're also currently working on modules to help with potential stick drift on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/magnetic-joy-con-sticks-already-in-the-works-for-switch-2-amid-fears-of-drift">as we reported a little earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a video of one of the company's controllers waking up a Switch 2 below (hold on to your hats, it's a wild ride!), although we're sure it won't be long until the honour of being the only third-party brand with this unique function will be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Judging by the post on social media, the company will perhaps release a software patch for their entire range of Switch 2-compatible controllers to enable this function, we'll keep you posted on the ins and outs of that all as it becomes clearer. And it's interesting to note, too, that looking back through their social media, Gulikit have been working on this, even describing in another post how they've found that the new console uses a different protocol just days ago. Seems they had a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Let's hope it's not too long before this semi-essential function is once again included in all Switch 2 controllers!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try-june-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With over 2,500 demos, Steam Next Fest is busy, and the June showcases happen right during the middle of Summer Game Fest. I know it can be overwhelming, so just like I did in February, I'm here showing 10 of the best demos I tried out over the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Give these games a shot if they seem like they might interest you, or keep an eye on them for something different. The only thing it will cost you is a bit of time, and you might just find the game you were looking for that you might never have heard of.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dispatch">Dispatch</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch.jpg?itok=W7OmH9CA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch.jpg?itok=TMlkW_Pr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Brought to you by some of the former people at <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/telltale-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Telltale Games">Telltale Games</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>aims to capture the spirit of the best of Telltale with some added actual mechanical functions to it.</p>

<p>In what is essentially a playable superhero workcom, you are a dispatcher for a list of C-list villains and misfits who are in a second chance redemption program, and send them to put out fires, rescue cats from trees, and other do-gooder deeds.</p>

<p>You need to mix and match your team to send them to problems based on their skills and personalities, while protecting your town in a funny and compelling experience.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404260/Dead_as_Disco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dead as Disco">Dead as Disco</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-as-disco.jpg?itok=L42eyt5H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-as-disco.jpg?itok=0VWa1RUT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A stylish high-octane rhythm beat-em-up, <em>Dead as Disco</em>&nbsp;is a really fun game to play, and is one of the trend of rhythm games that reward hitting on beat but don't require it. Being more accessible in that way, it's easy to recommend, as even if you don't hit perfectly, you feel great fighting foes, including in the set-piece battles that are showcased in their alpha stage like in the middle of a subway line.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a music importer for your own songs means this is going to be a game with almost infinite replayability beyond the core stages the developers are making.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435410/Shrines_Legacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shrine's Legacy">Shrine's Legacy</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shrines-legacy.jpg?itok=V7RoACdD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shrines-legacy.jpg?itok=Mbs_K0Q- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are many games that claim to be 16-bit inspired, but few manage to really capture the spirit of the generation as well as&nbsp;<em>Shrine's Legacy</em>.</p>

<p>Showcasing the best of action RPGs of the era, it feels like a game that was almost unlocked and given a few touchups with visuals, music (including chiptune versions of songs), gameplay, and even story that nail the feel of the classics in the genre. It brings co-operative play as well, and the whole experience was like cuddling into a nice warm blanket on a cold winter day.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870530/Battle_Suit_Aces/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Battle Suit Aces">Battle Suit Aces</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-suit-aces-card-battle.jpg?itok=LA1MN1wH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-suit-aces-card-battle.jpg?itok=3z9q-bZ_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the creators of the brilliant but overlooked <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battle-chef-brigade-review-prepared-with-love" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Battle Chef Brigade Review"><em>Battle Chef Brigade</em></a> comes a visual novel/deckbuilder with a ton of heart and mechanical depth. With cards representing the different mechs at your command, the battles play out with positioning, various energies to consider, and drones to deploy for satisfying gameplay that isn't a roguelite like many deckbuilders.</p>

<p>A colorful cast, intriguing premises to be explored, voice acting, and wonderful music,&nbsp;<em>Battle Suit Aces</em>&nbsp;is shaping up to be a big 2025 hit.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2819470/Aquapark_Tycoon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aquapark Tycoon">Aquapark Tycoon</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aquapark-tycoon.jpg?itok=x7O9b1hM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aquapark-tycoon.jpg?itok=O4UsugOk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For a lot of people,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/frontier-developments" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Frontier Developments"><em>Planet Coaster 2</em></a>&nbsp;was a miss, as the waterparks failed to impress, and I present to you a smaller, lower-budget alternative that might be what you're looking for.&nbsp;<em>Aquapark Tycoon</em>&nbsp;is another game that follows in the style of&nbsp;<em>Roller Coaster Tycoon 3</em>, with a focus on creativity and design in park management, but this time it's all put to work in running a waterpark - whatever that means to you. It's pretty chill and has co-op for you to work with friends, though the demo's play space is limited.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702260/Map_Map__A_Game_About_Maps/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Map Map - A Game About Maps">Map Map - A Game About Maps</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/map-map.jpg?itok=IsXWH1_N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/map-map.jpg?itok=aFTLLPzn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Mapping is something that we almost forget about often, as the computer automaps things for us in our games.&nbsp;<em>Map Map</em>&nbsp;is a game that defies that and instead makes navigation and cartography the core of its gameplay.</p>

<p>A cozy puzzle experience with optional challenges and things to discover as you piece together the mysteries of a lost civilization, you'll make maps of various islands that you explore.&nbsp;<em>Map Map</em>&nbsp;leans into the creative side, as you can decorate your maps in a lot of ways if you choose, or keep strictly to business on what is shown on your map.</p>

<p>It could be perhaps a touch more challenging on when it accepts answers or letting you retry them, but the game was fun, and it prompts you to think about the world you're exploring.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Death Howl">Death Howl</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-howl.jpg?itok=Q3z7fp_g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-howl.jpg?itok=4_VAdVty 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you were starting to wonder if I was only recommending cozy games, let me put that thought to the rest.&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>&nbsp;is anything but cozy, as a dreary- and moody-toned game about death.</p>

<p>You play as Ro, trying to reach and revive her recently deceased son. The spirit world is dark and full of terrors that you confront in tactical battles with your deckbuilding-based actions.</p>

<p>You build your deck from the resources you gather while fighting and exploring the world, a choice that is key to the atmosphere and sets it apart from many deckbuilders. The narrative is intriguing, the characters are compelling, and it looks to be another hit from publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/11-bit-studios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="11 Bit Studios ">11 Bit Studios</a>.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3644970/Fading_Serenades/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fading Serenades">Fading Serenades</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fading-serenade.jpg?itok=XgJl6SAB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fading-serenade.jpg?itok=vl4FoP4N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is an odd little adventure where you are on an almost-abandoned island and deliver packages and mail to the people who remain there, serving as courier and postman both. It features an idea of the 'rural simple life' but it is willing to interrogate the concept unlike many games that go down that route, while the story also hints and shows mysteries to be uncovered on this island.</p>

<p>The characters are distinct and well realized it seems, and the gameplay featured involves stuff like inventory puzzles, minor obstacles (like balancing on a log over water), and figuring out the best routing for the limited time and energy you have.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486450/The_Lonesome_Guild/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Lonesome Guild">The Lonesome Guild</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lonesome-guild.jpg?itok=X-sLxKRq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lonesome-guild.jpg?itok=Ginm5r5z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A charming action-adventure RPG with a quirky cast of misfits dealing with a mystical miasma of loneliness, while engaging in self-discovery and exploration. Solve puzzles and battle enemies in a game that captures the feel of the old 3D adventure RPGs with its own quirks and takes on things.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Rue Valley">Rue Valley</a></em></h2>

There's a mystery at the core of the plot here, and you examine it from different angles. A theme of characters with psychological problems is present in it, and there's a very nice comic-book aesthetic to tie it all together with some interesting ideas.</p>
