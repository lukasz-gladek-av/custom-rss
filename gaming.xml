  <p id="DvX0dH"><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> isn’t so much a spinoff and prequel of John Krasinski’s 2018 horror movie as it is a riveting drama that plays in the series’ sandbox. You can spot the odd bit of new world-building here or there, about just how and why there are so many damn echolocating aliens, but these tidbits are just background noise (<em>shh, not so loud!</em>) to a much more interesting human story. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/9/17216604/a-quiet-place-parenting"><em>A Quiet Place</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22459067/a-quiet-place-part-ii-review"><em>A Quiet Place Part II</em></a> are rural sci-fi horror, but <em>Day One</em> — from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/7/26/22594110/new-movies-watch-pig-nic-cage-netflix-blood-red-sky"><em>Pig</em></a> director Michael Sarnoski — moves the setting to New York City and crafts its story in the vein of large-scale disaster cinema. It’s likely the best Manhattan mayhem film since <em>Cloverfield</em>, and it’s also a downright excellent Hollywood blockbuster, if an entirely unexpected one.</p>
<p id="UdjTtO">A first-time indie filmmaker being subsumed by the studio system can be cause for concern — it’s usually a sign they’ve been hired to execute a board room’s vision — but <em>A</em> <em>Quiet Place: Day One</em> has Sarnoski written all over it, as a genre filmmaker who finds emotional resonance where most might not think to look. <em>Pig</em>, which initially seemed like “<em>John Wick</em>, but with a chef and his beloved sow,” proved surprisingly thoughtful in its unraveling of grief, a sleight-of-hand gambit that applies to Sarnoski’s horror threequel, too. <em>Day One</em> is as much about confronting oblivion as it is about confronting aliens, for reasons the movie’s seemingly omnipresent trailers have avoided revealing.</p>

<p id="K2OUdu">When <em>Day One</em> opens, its lead character, the former poet Sam (Lupita Nyong’o), is wasting away in a hospice facility, frustrated by her terminal cancer diagnosis, and searching for any reason to lash out. She has just weeks to live, if that, which makes her an especially intriguing centerpiece in a film like this one. Whether she survives the movie is barely relevant, compared to how the experience of living through the end of the world as we know it will change her. The plot’s possibilities are finite, but the film’s emotional possibilities are endless, even within the series’ sci-fi confines.</p>
<p id="tnjHbX">The beats of the previous Quiet Place movies are present, but simplified: giant, insect-like monsters viciously kill anyone who makes noise. Everyone who doesn’t die in the first wave figures this out quickly, without burdening the audience with a guessing game where we already know the answers. But the movie is set so far in the series’ past — several years before the <em>Quiet Place</em> characters find the aliens’ weakness — that there’s practically no hope for a solution, or for humanity to fight back. At no point are these extraterrestrials framed like slasher-movie serial killers, with creeping one-on-one encounters the humans might possibly win. They function more like a force of nature, an inevitable doom sweeping through the streets of Manhattan, akin to an unrelenting hurricane attracted to noise. </p>
<p id="AjBp3j">Not only is New York the worst possible place to be when this specific apocalypse hits — the movie’s opening text claims the city’s average noise pollution is 90 decibels, the same as a human scream — but it’s a particularly thorny place to set a disaster movie in general. Like<em> Cloverfield</em>, though, <em>A Quiet Place:</em> <em>Day One </em>doesn’t shy away from the specter of 9/11, and the indelible news footage that came out of it. When the city becomes ground zero for the invasion, Sarnoski immediately envelops the characters in a disorienting cloud of dust.</p>

<p id="zkYDsH">The film, it turns out, is as much about New York as it is about the characters and the series’ central gimmick. Sarnoski treats the city’s neighborhoods and architecture as a distinct terrain. (Though he takes liberties when it comes to subway station design — New Yorkers will have a lot to say about those.) By the end, the film isn’t just about New York’s history; in subtle ways, it’s about people’s personal relationship to a changing urban landscape and the memories it holds. Some spaces, in <em>Day One</em>, are just spaces; they’re dull and functional. But some, which hold specific meaning, are presented with an ethereal glow. </p>
<p id="doiUTz">The spectacle of vehicles being tossed helter-skelter and familiar landmarks being damaged beyond repair is a key part of any disaster film’s allure. Sarnoski imbues these traditional visual cues with immense emotional weight, though, by focusing on how people would realistically react to experiencing them. This trajectory seems strangely idiosyncratic at first. When Sam visits the city with her cat, Frodo (a cute reference — they’re an inseparable pair), on a bus full of fellow patients chaperoned by kindly nurse Reuben (Alex Wolff), she’s intent on eating her favorite slice of New York pizza. This also remains her objective even when everything goes to hell.</p>
<p id="RXxKHr">That may seem like a joke about New Yorkers’ claims of culinary superiority, but the film is on Sam’s wavelength. Her arduous journey from downtown Manhattan to a specific Harlem pizza place is quickly established as an emotionally rooted fixation, a response to the immense trauma she’s facing. If she’s going to die, she wants to do it on her own terms, even if that means charging headfirst toward certain death for a small but familiar comfort.</p>

<p id="8AS1uY">On her way uptown, she runs into an English law student, Eric (Joseph Quinn), who, rather than evacuating, decides to follow her for a reason that seems equally ridiculous. He winds up as the film’s emotional backbone. Sam’s diagnosis had already turned her world upside down: The alien invasion reads like an external manifestation of her spiritual chaos. Eric’s life, by contrast, was on a straightforward path, but the experience of nearly dying on day one shakes him to his core.</p>
<p id="fbvw9m">Survival instinct as a broad concept is a decent enough character motive for a disaster movie, but Sarnoski anchors this idea in simple but powerfully relatable stimuli. In Sam’s case, it’s the specificity of memory. (The pizza place has a deeper significance than is immediately apparent.) For Eric, it’s the simple act of connecting not with Sam, but with Frodo. Under the circumstances, either of these motives is reason enough to push forward, in spite of the emerging complications.</p>
<p id="N6mSGh">As usual for Quiet Place movies, the action is built around moments where the characters want to escape, which clashes with the need to stay absolutely silent. Few theatrical experiences beat the tense realization of<em> </em>Quiet Place sequences where someone inadvertently makes a noise. But the way <em>Day One </em>frames the human voice is a powerful masterstroke. Between Sam’s intense pain as she runs out of medication and Eric’s intense trauma from recent events, the characters don’t just have to avoid making sounds while moving. They instead have to suppress their natures, their primal need to scream as their lives crumble around them. </p>

<p id="MCu1CK">The movie’s tension remains razor-sharp for lengthy periods, but this is also broken up by sweet moments of release as the characters find isolated ways to interact. Quinn, with his limited dialogue and numerous silent scenes, exudes a sweet, sympathetic vulnerability that takes him to difficult places as a performer. Nyong’o, though she punctuates Sam with moments of abject terror, maintains a stern resolve, which comes with some deeply moving layers.</p>
<p id="mqqKEu">While there’s no hint of traditional Hollywood romance between Eric and Sam, <em>A Quiet Place:</em> <em>Day One</em> is deeply romantic in its depiction of two frightened souls caring for each other, with emotional and physical intimacy born from sheer instinct, as the world tips past a precipice we know it won’t return from. In the process, Sarnoski and his leads turn what could have easily been facile personal pursuits into the most important thing either character will ever do. </p>
<p id="oyOuqP"><small><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em></small><small> is in theaters now.</small></p>

This game, and <em>Final Fantasy</em> as a series, is often incredibly self-serious— it’s always about saving a world from a cosmic evil, which is pretty intense. <em>Dawntrail</em> seems determined to ignore all of that and give us a chance to vibe out with a drink and a fluffy alpaca on the beach. I deserve that. I mean my Warrior of Light deserves that. I can’t wait.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another franchise is heading for the remake machine as Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin’s Creed remakes are on the way. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio’s website</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemont says that the Assassin’s Creed series would see a number of games in the future, including remakes.</p>



<p>“Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes, which will allow us to revisit some of the games we’ve created in the past and modernize them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin’s Creed games that are still extremely rich,” he said.</p>



<p>“Secondly, to answer your question, there will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin’s Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including Assassin’s Creed Hexe, which we’ve announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. </p>



<p>“We’re going to surprise people, I think.”</p>



<p>He didn’t confirm what remakes are coming, but Insider Gaming has reported on the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake in development. That game is under the codename Obsidian. On top of that, Insider Gaming has seen brief footage of Edward Kenway in the remake under the condition that it not be shared.</p>



<p>As far as the engine being used for the Assassin’s Creed remakes, it will be using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-exclusive-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Anvil Pipeline” engine</a> that Insider Gaming first reported on back in March. This isn’t a completely new engine, but is a major evolution in what Ubisoft studios are able to do when developing the game and required substantial changes to the in-game animations, parkour, and more.</p>

Hardware-wise, this is the exact same SSD as the <a href="https://zdcs.link/bP0ve" target="_blank">2TB SK Hynix P41 Platinum</a> (Solidigm and SK Hynix are the same company) which means it is <strong>one of the fastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs on the market</strong>. This is an outstanding candidate for either your PlayStation 5 console or your gaming PC rig.</p><h2>Solidigm P44 Pro 2TB M.2 SSD for $119.99</h2><p><em><strong>PS5 compatible</strong></em></p><div id="179680" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Solidigm P44 Pro 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7000Mbps)</h3></p></div><p>Solidigm is the US-based subsidiary of SK Hynix. SK Hynix might not be as recognizable as Samsung or Western Digital, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker and the world's third-largest semiconductor company. They supply components for brands like Corsair and G.Skill.</p><p>The Solidigm P44 Pro is based off the SK Hynix P41 Platinum, which is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read and write speeds of 7,000MB/sand 6,500MB/s. It also boasts random read and write speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and 1.3 million IOPS. In terms of reliability and stability, this SSD has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. Solidigm backs it all up with a 5 year warranty. Unlike most other SSDs, both the chips and the controller are manufactured in-house. The P44 Pro uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips. </p><p>Of course, in terms of real world performance, the vast majority of users won't be able to tell apart the speeds between the highest end PCI-E 4.0 SSDs. Other top-tier SSDs include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Z446D" target="_blank">Samsung 990 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/X641Y" target="_blank">WD Black SN850X</a>. It really just comes down to which one you can get the cheapest. At its current price point, the P44 Pro isn't just one of the fastest drives on the market, it's also cheaper than any competitor that can come close to its performance.</p><h3>A great PS5 SSD, but you'll need to get a heatsink</h3><p>The Solidigm P44 Pro does not come equipped with a heatsink. That's because this SSD is catered to PC gamers looking to add storage to their desktop computer. Many motherboards come equipped with built-in SSD coolers and will only accept bare SSDs. It's generally harder to remove a heatsink than to apply a new one. If you plan to use this for your PS5, we recommend you install your own heatsink for peace of mind. You can easily get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OGrjj" target="_blank">PS5 heatsink for under $10</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 27, 2024 5:35 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valentine's Day may have already passed, but love is still in the air in EA's latest expansion pack for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>. Titled Lovestruck, the new game expansion features a number of new ways for Sims to romance each other (and, of course, new items and clothing pieces to help set the mood).</p><p dir="ltr">Launching on July 25, Lovestruck introduces a new locale to The Sims 4: Ciudad Enamorada, a romantic in-game world with three distinct neighborhoods where Sims can buy (or build) homes, visit romantic bars and hotels, and experience the world's unique collection of special festivals and events. There's even a new lot trait called Singles Hangout that will attract Sims who haven't yet found their better half.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326023" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326023"></a><figcaption>The Lovestruck expansion pack includes a romantic new world called Ciudad Enamorada.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326015,1300-4326016,1300-4326017,1300-4326018,1300-4326019,1300-4326020,1300-4326021,1300-4326022" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Lovestruck adds a new app to each Sim's phone: Cupid's Corner, The Sims 4's version of Tinder. Sims can create their own Cupid's Corner profile and browse other Sims' profiles. Some Sims are looking for love, while others may not be so quick to commit.</p><p dir="ltr">A new "Create A Date" function will also be included in the Lovestruck expansion pack, allowing players to customize dates, decide which in-game goals they want to complete on said dates, and create the perfect night out (or in) for their love-seeking Sims. Lovestruck also deepens the complexity of Sims' relationships with a new system called Relationship Dynamics. Relationship Dynamics mean Sim romances can now be labeled as Wholesome, Steamy, Strained, or Unpredictable, which will naturally have some interesting in-game consequences.</p><p>The Sims 4 Lovestruck expansion pack will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815270/The_Sims_4_Lovestruck_Expansion_Pack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available for $40 USD</a> when it launches on July 25.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alpha-protocol">Alpha Protocol</a> disappeared from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidian-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-de-listed-from-steam">digital store shelves back in 2019 due to expiring music licenses</a>. Back in March, some four years later, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-espionage-rpg-alpha-protocol-returns-to-store-shelves-after-four-years-in-license-hell">returned via GOG</a>. Now it's once again also available via Steam.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You'll find the spy RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34010/Alpha_Protocol/">over on Steam</a> at a 20% discount for the duration of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-2024-summer-sale-is-now-live">just-launched Steam summer sale</a>.
</p>
<p>I have to assume this Steam re-appearance is the same version that's also available on GOG, which included not only the return of the licensed music that prompted its disappearance in the first place, but also controller support, cloud saves and achievements. 
</p>
<p>Alpha Protocol was developed by Obsidian, who these days are owned by Microsoft, but Alpha Protocol itself is still home at original publisher Sega. Whether the 2010 action RPG is actually any good is a matter of some debate: Alice0 called it her favourite Obsidian game, but I've seen as many people argue that it's janky trash as that it's one of <em>those</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-average-action-games-on-pc">seven out of tens</a>. 
</p>
<p>I have no opinion of my own, having not played it, but I know it's a favourite of enough of you commenters that its appearance on Valve's storefront seemed worth acknowledging. Please start a vibrant but polite argument about its relative merits in the comments.</p>

            <p>You can tell when a major Steam sale goes live, because the Steam store stop loading. If you can make it past the "something went wrong" message you'll find that the Steam summer sale is now underway.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This year's event includes a page of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/special_deals">"featured deep discounts"</a>, which highlights "especially great deals on some of the all-time greats." 
</p>
<p>They're not wrong. Many of the games on the page are 90% or even 95% reduced, and it includes Celeste for £1.67, Civ VI for £2.49, Total War: Shogun 2 for £2.49, The Witcher 3 for £2.49, and Bloons TD6 £1.17. I suppose the catch is that these games are so great that there's a good chance you already own them, but if not you can map out the rest of your gaming year with change from a £10 left over for a bag of crisps.

<p>There are more discounts than I can highlight here, so we'll put together a more robust roundup tomorrow. I will say that there are a lot of recent games on my Wishlist that are 20% reduced, including nunventure Indika and ballwhacker TopSpin 2k25, while train 'em up Sweet Transit is 50% down, Pacific Drive is 40% off, and Surmount is 33% discounted. Cor. 
</p>
<p>Don't be fooled: I'm not going to buy any of these games, because I didn't have time to play them before, and I don't suddenly have time now that they're cheaper. They'll also be even cheaper at some point in the future, so I'm not going to fall for the FOMO. You shouldn't either; just look at all the games already in your Steam library that you haven't played yet. 
</p>
<p>The sale runs <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">over on Steam</a> until July 11th. Be strong, you can do it, I believe in you.</p>

While that mode included respawns, others didn’t, with rounds ending if a team was wiped out. According to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a></span>, that includes Cargo Run, where players compete over a package, and Clash Point where they fight over control for a specific area.</p><h2 id="h12860"><a id=""></a>I hope you like double (and triple) jumps</h2><p>Each of the 16 Freegunners (heroes) will have a unique kit of stats and abilities, and there are even light deck-building mechanics for customizing your bench of heroes before each match. One thing most of the Freegunners have are double jumps. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, some even have triple jumps. They also have dodges that momentarily pull the camera out into a third-person view.</p><h2 id="h12861"><a id=""></a>There are no ultimates or supers</h2><p>Unlike <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Valorant</em>,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> reports there are no ultimates in<em> Concord </em>(or supers if you’re <em>Destiny</em>-pilled like me). Each Freegunner has two unique abilities, like the giant robot  1-Off that can suck up trash, as well as one passive. But there’s no meter charging up over the course of the match to let you wreck havoc on the opposing team.</p><h2 id="h12862"><a id=""></a>Players can deploy structures to help them that stick around</h2><p>What <em>Concord</em> does have, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/27/concord-feels-like-destiny-meets-overwatch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/27/concord-feels-like-destiny-meets-overwatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Informer</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/concord-game-preview/#systems-yet-unseen-concord-39-s-quot-deckbuilding-quot&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/concord-game-preview/#systems-yet-unseen-concord-39-s-quot-deckbuilding-quot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Screen Rant</em></a></span>, are abilities that deploy equipment that lasts between rounds unless it’s destroyed by your enemies. This light build mechanic where players can try to control certain areas of the map with persistent shields, healing pads, and other advantageous structures is definitely something that could add a novel layer of tactics to arena fights.</p><h2 id="h12863"><a id=""></a>What makes<em> Concord </em>unique?</h2><p>To the degree that Sony’s hero shooter has a standout gimmick, it seems to be the way character switching works during matches. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> reports that players expand their roster by “rescuing” different characters, and can only take six of them into any given battle. However, when they swap between them during rounds or respawns, they get to add the previous dead character’s class bonus to their current one, providing over 100 different combinations of bonuses to play with at any given time.</p><h2 id="h12864"><a id=""></a>Post-launch updates will be free</h2><p>Firewalk Studios has already talked about how it plans to release a new cinematic teaser for its in-game characters and universe every week. Now the studio has also confirmed that future content updates will be free. Here’s the exact language from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a></span>: “experience just some of the content that will be available when the game launches on August 23 and will grow over time through post-launch updates at no additional cost.”</p><h2 id="h12865"><a id=""></a>Microtransactions will only be cosmetic</h2><p>Priced at $40 just like <em>Helldivers 2</em>,<em> Concord</em> is somewhere between the current freemium model of <em>Overwatch 2</em> and the old full-priced loot box mode of the original <em>Overwatch</em>. Firewalk Studios assured <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span> that the only paid microtransactions in the game will be cosmetic. “There are purely cosmetic pieces that you can choose to further customize the look of your character, that you can choose to purchase,” the studio told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span>. “Those do not affect gameplay. We believe so strongly that the full experience should be available to all of our players.” It sounds like new maps, characters, and modes will be free and available to everyone who owns the game.</p><h2 id="h12866"><a id=""></a>Beta Early Access weekends are in July</h2><p>Players will be able to try <em>Concord</em> for themselves next month. The closed Early Access beta takes place on July 12 – 14 and requires pre-ordering the game to get into (one pre-order gets you five keys so only one person in your friend group needs to take the hit). The Open Beta that’s free to everyone takes place on July 18 – 21. During these betas, which are basically just demos, players will have access to all 16 Freegunners, four maps, and three modes. There’s also a $60 “deluxe” version of the game that gives players early access to the full game three days before launch on August 20. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mavix-m9-gaming-chair-provides-high-end-comfort-versatility.913650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mavix-m9-gaming-chair/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A lot of gaming chairs today don’t have the kind of features and functionality as the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair. And with these features comes plenty of flexibility that allows for the kind of versatility that is hard to find in most gaming chairs within today’s expansive market.</p>



<p>Coming in at a price point at $999 for the base model and $1128 for the ELEMAX model, the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair comes in a wide range of color options, and wheel color options .This gives the the user plenty of options for maximum customization. The ELEMAX model is the Ferrari of the two which we had the pleasure of testing out features such as massaging as well as heating and cooling. As you can imagine, these high-end features provide for an array of comfort options.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A true S-tier experience. Our M9 gaming chair delivers overclocked performance and engineering, giving you the power to play on an entirely different level. The extra wide, ultra-comfortable seat and temperature-regulating fabrics let you game for hours without overheating while extended recline technology and action-inspired wheels keep you moving all session long.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-the-ferrari-of-gaming-chairs">The Ferrari Of Gaming Chairs</h2>



<p>When it comes to gaming chairs, the number one thing that people look for is ergonomics and comfortability. And after using the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair over the past few weeks, and even without using the Ferrari features the ELEMAX edition offers such as massaging and cooling/heating, I can happily report that this chair is extremely comfortable.</p>



<p>It provides extremely sufficient lumbar support thanks to Mavix’s Dynamic Variable Lumbar (DVL). With the DVL, it adjusts and contours to your body intuitively each and every time you move within the chair.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And when it comes to reclining, the Mavix M9 has you covered with a 127 degree arc angle in the fully extended recline. And the headrest, while somewhat difficult to adjust provides maximum comfort if you’re looking to relax or potentially even take a nap.</p>



<p>What makes this chair stand out though, is the cooling, heat, &amp; massage features known as ELEMAX. ELEMAX provides even more lumbar support to your chair enhancing it into The Final Boss of Gaming Chairs.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our innovative lumbar support technology cools you, warms you, loosens you and more — all with the push of a button.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dual internal fans circulate air, keeping body temps down and comfort up.</li>



<li>Fast-warming tech adds heat when the situation calls for it (up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>



<li>Two massage modes remove tension using a steady pulse and rhythmic vibrations.</li>



<li>Two massage levels let you dial up or down the degree of intensity.</li>



<li>Compatible with all Mavix gaming chair models.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>To use these features, the internal battery must be charged up with a USB charger. It comes with a USB charging card along with a wall charger to keep you focused on your gaming without the stress of the battery being depleted.</p>



<p>With all of these features, there are some shortcomings though and while the Mavix M9 gaming chair is very comfortable, I did find the wheels locking quite often when initially trying to roll on carpet. The wheels seem designed to move more freely on hardwood or tile flooring. The initial push or pull encounters some resistance, but after a second effort, the chair rolls where I need it to go, though it remains a slight annoyance when it comes to movement.</p>



<p>Overall, the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair is a very comfortable gaming chair and if you’re looking for a high end chair with the kind of features you would find in a high end luxury vehicle, this is absolutely the chair for you if you can handle the price point.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Mavix provided an Mavix M9 Gaming Chair with ELEMAX for the purpose of review/impressions.</em></p>

It’s finally <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-ge800/">available starting today</a> for $599.99, although those excited to upgrade immediately can save $100 as part of a “limited-time launch promotion.”</p><p>Designed to take full advantage of the broader 6GHz wireless spectrum that Wi-Fi 6E first had access to, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23902812/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7 further increases speeds</a> by doubling the maximum channel bandwidth from 160MHz to 320MHz, allowing more data to be transmitted.</p><p>The Wi-Fi 7 spec also allows connections to span multiple bands with a feature called Multi-Link Operation (MLO). For example, a file can be downloaded on the 6Ghz band at 1Gbps and on the 5GHz band at 500Mbps, resulting in combined download speeds of 1.5Gbps. TP-Link boasts the new tri-band Archer GE800 can achieve wireless speeds up to 19Gbps by spreading data across the 6, 5, and 2.4GHz bands simultaneously.</p><p>Just keep in mind that you’ll need a Wi-Fi 7-compatible device like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23912370/google-pixel-8-pro-review-camera-assistant-magic-editor-best-take-audio-eraser">Google Pixel 8</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24053907/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review-ai-screen-camera-battery">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, or recently announced laptops like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24025680/razer-blade-14-16-18-cpu-ai-display-updates-usb-c-dock">Razer Blade 16</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030533/lenovo-ces-laptops-legion-thinkpad-thinkbook">Lenovo Legion 7i</a> to take full advantage of those speeds. None of the current crop of gaming consoles support Wi-Fi 7.</p><p>The Archer GE800 also features a pair of 10Gbps ethernet ports and four 2.5Gbps ports, with one serving as a dedicated gaming port that prioritizes network traffic from a connected console, although the Xbox Series X / S and PS5 only include gigabit ports. And because every piece of gaming hardware needs to put on an elaborate light show, the GE800 features multicolor lighting that can be controlled from a desktop app panel that also provides insights on router performance and the status of the network.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> launched last year to dismal reviews, due to bugs and features from Payday 2 that were absent in the sequel. One such piece of missing functionality was the ability to play alone or offline, but an update coming today makes some progress towards fixing that with the addition of "Solo Mode".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Solo mode lets people play any of Payday 3's heists alone by hosting the match on their own computer. Y'know, like all games used to let you do. The downside is that Payday 3's solo mode still requires an initial internet connection to access, so it's not a completely offline solution. Not yet, anyway - Starbreeze describe the mode as a "beta".
</p>
<p>Payday 3's servers are offline for around eight hours in order to implement the feature, which is just one part of a larger set of changes in what's called the Boys In Blue update. It also includes bug fixes, art improvements, and both free and paid items including weapons and cosmetics.
</p>
<p>The 'always online' nature of Payday 3 was an issue right from launch, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3s-launch-is-another-great-advert-for-not-making-your-game-always-online">players faced long waits to connect to servers</a>. Starbreeze immediately made changes to make it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-to-go-offline-temporarily-as-starbreeze-work-to-make-it-less-dependent-on-online">less dependent on those overburdened servers</a>. Unfortunately players didn't much like what they played of the game when they did connect, from its enemy AI, gun feel, level design, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starbreeze-will-rework-payday-3s-progression-and-xp-system-after-player-backlash">and especially its progression system</a>. Starbreeze formed a strike force to begin working through those issues, as part of a series of updates <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3s-first-operation-medic-bag-patch-includes-300-fixes-and-an-unready-button">they've been calling Operation Medic Bag</a>. Alas, sales have been lower than expected, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-have-switched-ceo-six-months-after-disastrous-launch">the CEO of the studio has been replaced</a>, and its Steam reviews remain mostly negative.

So naturally, I wasn’t all too thrilled when it suddenly kept crashing before it even reached the main menu and nothing seemed to fix it.

Turns out, the problem for me and many other players was that we were using Nvidia driver 555.99.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,195840,196163" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Released on June 4, 2024, Nvidia Game Ready and Studio Driver 555.99 caused quite a bit of havoc for many fans of <em>Halo Infinite</em> as it rendered the game unplayable for most who had an Nvidia card and were timely with their driver updates. The workaround, of course, was to roll back to driver version 555.85. <em>Halo </em>developer 343 Industries acknowledged the issue early on. It released a statement via the official <em>Halo</em> Support X account stating that it was working with Nvidia to be sure the issue wouldn’t persist into the next driver update. Thankfully, driver version 556.12 was released on June 27 and lets <em>Halo Infinite</em> launch and run without issue. </p><h2 id="h13843"><a id=""></a>How to update your Nvidia driver to play <em>Halo Infinite</em></h2><p>Odds are if you found your way to Nvidia driver 555.99, you probably know how to update your system to the latest version to get back into some <em>Halo</em>. If not, you can download the driver via Nvidia’s GeForce Experience app (which is how I prefer to manage my drivers), or by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloading the driver directly from Nvidia’s website</a></span>.

But now that 556.12 fixed the <em>Halo</em> issue, I have a can of Monster energy, an aggressively frantic metal playlist, and endless rounds of Husky Raid with my name on them.   </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And according to the developer, all of that couldn’t be included in a short debut trailer. </p><p>“You’ll start to fall in love with the depth of the characters,” said Kreines. “That’s something that you learn week to week. Their personalities will unfold, their relationships will unfold for you, their backstories. None of that is something you can get in a tiny little slice.”</p><p>Still, she was excited that people watched the trailer and that there was a reaction to it, adding: “ I can’t wait for them to see more. To see everything that is there.”</p><p> Jon Weisnewski, lead character designer on <em>Concord</em>, seemed less interested in the initial reaction to the trailer and thinks players will be won over by the combat and gameplay. </p><p>“We have a team that is uniquely skilled at building very immersive and fluid gameplay that just feels tremendous in the player’s hands,” said Weisnewksi. </p><p>“The second they pick up the controller the game just comes to life. Like every action is responsive. And I’ve been a player of these games my whole life, these games are what I love to play, and I know that it’s all about how does it play, right.

            <p>I’m getting into the bad habit of posting just after the end of work. In this case, I’m doing it because the whole affair might be over and done with when I return to my desk. New York-based Nolen Royalty, creator of <a href="https://eieio.games/">impish experimental games</a> about bouncing DVD logos and staring contests, has made another one that consists of <a href="https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/">a website with one million checkboxes</a>. It's the best thing I've played all year, possibly.</p><!--more-->
<p>You are free to check and uncheck any box you please, and any box you check will appear checked for any other visitor to the site, with the game keeping a running total of checked boxes in the top-right corner. There is no reward for your efforts. The whole thing is entirely pointless, an idle clicker without even the gratification of unlocking a picture of a cookie or similar. And yet. And yet. Look at all those strangers on the other side of the internet, busily checking boxes, working their way down the page like locusts munching through a massive ream of bubble-wrap. Now, notice how that running total shoots up and down at the behest of an opposing army of uncheckers. Which are you?</p>
<p>In the course of five minutes with One Million Checkboxes, I have deduced the existence of several broad classes of checker or unchecker. Firstly, there are the Frontliners, fighting tooth and nail over every square, clicking on each other's clicks as though treading on heads in the scrum. Then there are the Artillery Checkers, who use the search field in the bottom right to punt themselves way ahead of the running total, crashing down into an unspoilt fastness of unfilled boxes.</p>
<p>Their counterparts among the uncheckers are the Saboteurs, who use the search functionality in reverse, burrowing back through the landscape of checks, opening up seams of white in the middle of all that slanted blue as though bleaching out the heart of a coral reef. And fourthly, there are each side’s Clean-up Crews, who follow behind the frontline polishing off stray squares here or there, as though knifing the wounded. It’s a brutal business, truly, the checking of squares.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24187156/forza-horizon-4-delisted-best-forza-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="w6uaKI">Playground Games and Microsoft <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting">have announced</a> that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/forza-horizon-4-2/40436"><em>Forza Horizon 4</em></a> will be delisted on Dec. 15. From then on, the 2018 open-world racing game and its additional content will no longer be available for purchase from the Xbox Store, the Microsoft Store, or Steam, and it’ll be removed from Game Pass. It will remain playable for people who own a digital or physical copy, and online features will still be available.</p>
<p id="IvLywm">Delisting older games is an increasingly common practice, and a worrying one for game preservation. In the world of racing games, however, it’s nothing new. The genre depends heavily on licensing deals with car manufacturers (and often music publishers). These deals typically have a built-in expiry date that requires the games be removed from sale after a set period of time. Indeed, Playground noted that <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>’s delisting was “due to licensing and agreements with our partners.”</p>
<p id="WN6pV6">There’s not much to be done about that, but it still sucks that many historically important or just plain brilliant racing games are difficult to buy and play today. It particularly sucks that this fate has befallen <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>, which is generally considered the high point of Playground’s freewheeling racing series.</p>

<p id="Q4Ze71">In truth, there’s no such thing as a bad Forza Horizon game. I’m fond of all of them — including the current, Mexico-set entry, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22762645/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-game-pass-series-x-pc"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a>. Forza Horizon started as a spinoff of the Gran Turismo-style circuit racing series Forza Motorsport but has now fully eclipsed it. That’s thanks to the Horizon games’ joyful festival vibe, and the inherent accessibility and fun of exploring large, beautiful maps based on real-world tourist destinations in a range of cool, exotic, and even eccentric cars.</p>
<p id="RUogai">But there’s one reason why the fourth entry sets itself apart — or rather, one reason that feeds into many others. <em>Forza Horizon 4 </em>is set in Britain. As a Brit, perhaps I’m biased. But the point is that Playground Games is also British, so it’s biased, too. You can sense that added level of familiarity with and love for the British landscape and British car culture in every corner of the game.</p>
<p id="ZnCWew">The game’s gorgeous map is a compressed tour of the island of Great Britain that transitions smoothly from the honey-colored villages of the Cotswolds, through the eerie moorland and coastal castles of Northumberland, to the majestic Scottish highlands, stopping to take in the granite spires of the Scottish capital, Edinburgh — making its first appearance in a racing game since Bizarre Creations’ excellent <em>Project Gotham Racing 2</em>. (<em>Horizon 4</em> creative director Ralph Fulton, now leading development of the new <em>Fable</em>, is a proud Scot, which is evident from playing the game.)</p>

<p id="qbqWW2">The changeable British weather also led to the inspired addition of seasons, which transform the map (and the terrain physics and vehicle handling) through spring, summer, fall, and winter. You’ve never seen overcast British skies, or the sun wanly shining through spring showers, rendered so well in a video game. Seasons returned in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, but although the Mexican climate allows for some spectacular weather effects, it doesn’t allow for whole-map transformations as effective as <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>’s blanket of snow.</p>
<p id="a7Pgol">The U.K.’s proud automotive history is on full display in <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>, too, highlighted in some of the game’s story events in which you get to drive the likes of Minis, London black cabs, Land Rovers, sleek 1960s Jaguars, and the unstoppable, supercharged 1931 Bentley.</p>
<p id="Md7FSL"><em>Forza Horizon 4</em> marked a shift toward ongoing, live-service-style content in the series, and Playground has come up with a reasonable plan for winding this down now that the game is being delisted. The game’s final Festival Playlist series will begin July 25 and end on Aug. 22. Some daily and weekly challenges will continue after this date, and all previously Playlist-exclusive reward cars will be made available via the Backstage Pass system. A few Festival Playlist-themed achievements will be impossible to earn after Aug. 22.</p>
<p id="Ou600X">Unlike some other racing game series, where content accumulates over time and tracks are recycled from one entry to the next, the open-world map for each edition of Forza Horizon lends it a unique flavor. For that reason alone, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> is well worth having in your library — where else are you going to get to blast down Edinburgh’s Royal Mile and up Arthur’s Seat at 100 miles per hour? </p>
<p id="61KD5x">Microsoft will be offering deals on the game through its eventual delisting in December; it’s currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/">80% off on Steam</a>, with the Ultimate Edition coming in at just $19.99. If you’ve any interest in racing games, you should snap it up while you still can. </p>

Plus he’s got that wombo combo, that not only does physical damage (specifically piercing damage, which is the best type of physical damage in the game) but a lot of fire damage too. I think he’s a lot harder to try to heal off of.”</p></blockquote><p>While Messmer is universally considered to be a tough-as-nails fight, not everyone agrees that he’s more challenging than Malenia.

No hit: Messmer harder,” iBlack92O said. “For someone like me who spends my first dozen attempts learning a move-set, bosses that have far too much visual clutter will always be much more of an issue.”</p></blockquote><p>One other challenger for the throne is Promised Consort Radahn.

Certain builds are more effective than others at handling enemies that fight at close range vs. long range. Some can take a few more hits if they don the right armor or have spec’d into defense and survivability. Not to mention that summoning other players to take on a boss alongside you and using Spirit Ashes to bring an AI-controlled companion into the fight can tip the scales in your favor. But sometimes there are just universally challenging foes that have a response to any strategy you might have up your sleeve. It sounds like that hasn’t changed in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Hopefully, FromSoftware will release stats that show us who is killing players the most in the coming weeks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After getting a full reveal during the PlayStation State of Play at the end of May, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer Firewalk has announced</a> the dates for the Concord beta in July.</p>



<p>Starting July 12-14, those that pre-order the game will get beta access along with four extra codes to provide to friends to try the game. After the early access period, there will be an open beta for Concord from July 18-21.</p>



<p>The beta will be available to players on both PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC. Those who play on PC will need a PlayStation Account in order to play.</p>



<p>As far as what’s in the Concord beta, players will have access to all 16 Freegunners to play as well as four game modes across five maps. The four game modes coming to the beta are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Trophy Hunt:</strong> Kill members of the other team to collect bounty cards and earn points. Similar to Kill Confirmed.</li>



<li><strong>Cargo Run: </strong>Work with your team to retrieve the “Blue Buddy robotic package delivery system”. There are no respawns.</li>



<li><strong>Clash Planet</strong>: Another no-respawn mode, this mode sees your team fight to control a single zone on the map.</li>



<li><strong>Area Control: </strong>Releasing during the open beta, this mode has you fight to control multiple zones on the map.</li>
</ul>



<p>Concord launches on August 23 for PS5 and PC. Firewalk also promises updates to the game post launch that will see the game grow “at no additional cost”.</p>
