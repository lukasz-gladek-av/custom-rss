                <p>In 2022, Epic Games agreed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-finalizes-order-making-fortnite-dev-pay-245-million-in-refunds/1100-6510151/" data-ref-id="1100-6510151">a massive $520 million settlement</a> with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that Fortnite violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting info about players under the age of 13 without their parents' permission, as well as allegations that Epic "tricked" players into making unintended in-game purchases. The signup period for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-your-chunk-of-the-245-million-fortnite-ftc-settlement/1100-6517854/" data-ref-id="1100-6517854">the initial distribution of funds</a> ended in February 2024. But now, the FTC is once again opening the opportunity for players to claim their piece of the Fortnite settlement.</p><p>If players already claimed and received a payment from the FTC during the previous dispersal round, then they won't be eligible for any further claims. Everyone else has until July 9, 2025 to to file their claim with the FTC at <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the agency's official site</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">FTC sends $126 million in refunds to Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted items, reopens claims process.

However, this refund is limited to US citizens. Players under 18 will need their parent or guardian to fill out the paperwork, but anyone older doesn't need any special permission to fill out the form. Domestic players can qualify for the refund if any of the following descriptions applies to them.</p><ul><li>You were charged in-game currency for items you didn’t want between January 2017 and September 2022</li><li>Your child made charges to your credit card without your knowledge between January 2017 and November 2018</li><li>Your account was locked between January 2017 and September 2022 after you complained to your credit card company about wrongful charges</li></ul><p>Outside of this settlement, Epic Games has done quite well for itself in legal conflicts.

<figure><a title="fantasy life i changes pre-launch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24c2c40240c75/fantasy-life-i-changes-pre-launch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Level-5 has certainly been riding quite the high of late with the release of its very well-received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>. We gave the game a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">9/10 in both its Switch and Switch 2 forms</a>, so we can confirm it's a bit of a banger.</p>
<p>Now, straight off the back of all this success, Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino has revealed that a huge aspect of the game’s positive reception is actually due to some crucial and very clever changes the dev team started implementing into the adventure just a year ago!</p><div><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179zsylgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>During a chat with YouTube talk show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAKdDS6N0SE">Denfaminicogamer</a>, and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-owes-its-success-to-critical-game-design-changes-made-only-1-year-before-launch-level-5-ceo-says/">reported by Automaton</a>, Hino, who's also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/level-5-ceo-sees-ai-as-tool-for-communication-and-efficiency-improvement">chatting about AI recently</a> said that that at one point during its development, the team felt as though the game played in a very "suffocating" manner, in that it was "trying to extend playtime at the expense of making things stressful,” and so his team, very late in the day, decided to “practically remake” the whole game, as he puts it. Cools as cucumbers.</p>

<p>Hino highlights that the game's map and original movement system were of particular concern, which had previously consisted of just a small world map without any parkouring. Thankfully, this was then replaced with the large open world and slick traversal we now have, as the team “thoroughly removed anything that made the game feel stressful.”</p>
<p>Amazingly, Hino also says his team managed to create the finished open world map in just two months, which seems ridiculous - and it would have been, if the team hadn't created its own bespoke system to turn 2D artwork into 3D terrain.</p>
<p>As the Level-5 boss says, “In the final version of the game, you can chop a tree, climb up somewhere high, chop a three while you’re up there, climb back down, run around – and just performing these simple actions feels good and comfortable." Yes, we have to agree with you there, mate.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i faced many challenges throughout development, with previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/fantasy-life-i-development-was-restructured-in-2024-as-keiji-inafune-left-company">producer Keiji Inafune leaving the company in 2024</a> and Hino having to step it. It seems like many of these changes were as a result of that departure, and we're glad things worked out for the team!</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Glad that Level 5 decided to make some drastic overhauls before it launched Fantasy Life i? Make sure to let us know how you're finding the game, too!</em></p>

            <p>
I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nuclear-throne">Nuclear Throne</a> is one of those games that will always be at least just a little bit relevant, in some shape or form. There are other indie games I'd rather play more than it from its era, but it kind of feels like the best representation of that period in indie games too. Throwback pixel art, a unique spin on both bullet hells and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, a bangin' soundtrack, it's got the right mix of things to help it stand the test of time. And here we are now, the game approaching its 10th anniversary, arriving with a new update.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
To be specific, it's a new beta build, so it's only there if you want to try it out, but it is available right now. Don't go expecting massive features or additions or anything though, this is a quality of life update. To that end, here's what it includes! For starters there's now 60 or 120fps support, for those of you that care about that sort of thing (look, most games just don't need 60fps, alright). 
</p>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
There's also new aspect ratios, and a new controls menu too, but to find out the exact changes there you'll have to take a look for yourself. "Oh, and a new Melting loading screen tip", the post rounds off, alongside a very cool emoji wearing sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
If you want access to this update, your steps are pretty simple: right click on Nuclear Throne in your Steam library, click properties, then betas, then select "openbeta_win64", and Bob's your uncle, the update is ready and waiting for you.
</p>
<p>
Vlambeer explain in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/242680/view/528724684296945991?l=english">Steam post</a> announcing the update that they plan to add all these improvements into the main game too, as well as more than what's mentioned above, so don't feel like you have to rush for it.

        <p>OK, but please do a martial art now and then, Sloclap</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sloclap’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-foot-to-ball-visualisation">foot-to-ball</a> game Rematch is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rematch-review">very good</a>, and has been doing very well, with over three million sales to date, but some of us yet grieve for a time when kicks were reserved for torsos and limbs. Which is to say, some of us have been hoping that Sloclap might return to the martial arts realm in which it has hitherto made waves.</p> <!--more-->
<p>If it happens, it will not happen in the form of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> 2 or even a sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/absolver">Absolver</a>, Sloclap’s chain-punching debut. For you see, creative director Pierre Tarno is of the opinion that “chasing safe bets is a death sentence” and that "gamers are on the lookout for new, original experiences." He’s got better things to do than develop sequels, and I’m sure no video game publishers brandishing huge sacks of rubies will persuade him otherwise.</p>
<p>That’s from a new Edge interview sliced into sandwich-sized slablets by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/as-rematch-fires-past-3-million-players-devs-say-they-werent-planning-to-follow-up-their-cult-kung-fu-game-sifu-chasing-safe-bets-is-a-death-sentence/">Gamesradar</a>. According to Tarno, he pitched Rematch after Sloclap finished Absolver, but the studio were too small at the time to handle more than one project, and Sifu won the coin toss. Still, Sloclap were already prototyping the football game almost a year before Sifu’s release.</p>
<p>Again, Rematch has done very well. Extraordinarily well, for a game braving a sports genre dominated by essentially one series, the artist formerly known as FIFA. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of it – you can feel the dev’s past games in the tuned-up leather-walloping SFX, which make EA Sports FC seem anodyne. I also enjoy that, for all the souped-up holographic stadiums, each match is basically a neighbourhood kickabout with loosened rules and no referee.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn’t mind playing another Absolver, or some other, very stylish experience in which feet are a means of speedy jaw removal rather than being used to abuse innocent, air-filled orbs. Hmm, what other things can you kick? I do kick this computer now and then when I'm doing my tax returns, but I'm not sure you could get a whole game out of that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sifu-2-says-rematch-dev-because-chasing-safe-bets-is-a-death-sentence]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Shrimp Industries has released a brand new trailer for Roll The Bones, which is described as dice rolling action roguelite in a fantasy setting. Oh, and there is some bullet hell mixed in there for good measure too. You can see all of this chaos in the trailer below which also shows some of the dice action that makes up the core of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Roll The Bones - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hDAL7Gjm1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Roll The Bones players can use customisable spell dice, which can have a different spell on each face, to take on the hand crafted dungeons alongside the challenge floors. The dice can also be upgraded with new materials which will alter spells and their impact on critical rolls. Additionally, certain combos will trigger the Artifacts which can further alter how a run goes in Roll The Bones. Artifacts can add burn effects or trigger meteor strikes.</p>
<p>Shrimp Industries is aiming to release Roll The Bones later this year for PC, with PS5 and Xbox Series XS ports expected further down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-need-our-studios-to-believe-they">The Game Business</a> also provides data from Ampere Analysis, which includes player numbers for June's more notable releases like MindsEye, FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">Dune: Awakening</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>.</p>
<p>MindsEye's launch has been a very public mess, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">players getting refunds on PlayStation</a> over the major technical issues the game has, and developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">Build a Rocket Boy confirming it has begun the process of laying off potentially 100 employees</a>.</p>
<p>According to Ampere Analysis, MindsEye has just under 250K players, with approximately 150K of those players on PlayStation. On Steam, however, the only platform where MindsEye's player creation platform is available, Ampere reports only 35,000 players.</p>
<p>MindsEye currently has the distinction of being the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst-reviewed game of 2025 so far</a>, and while Build a Rocket Boy has been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mindseyes-second-hotfix-is-now-live-as-its-developer-races-to-fix-its-disastrous-launch/">pushing out hotfixes as fast as it can</a>, it's currently unclear if there is a true path to redemption for the studio's debut game. Especially if what's supposed to be its main source of growth, its user-generated content platform, is playable only to the smallest portion of its player base.</p>
<p>The Game Business also designates FBC: Firebreak as the other game that's struggling at launch, even though its total player base across platforms is approximately 1.3 million players. A little less than 800K players on Xbox, 541K players on PlayStation, and only 54K players on Steam.</p>
<p>For a multiplayer-focused game, those are admittedly not the kinds of numbers developers want or necessarily need to see, and the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus means many of those players also don't equal direct game sales. That said, this is Remedy's first major foray into multiplayer games, and in its <a href="https://x.com/ControlRemedy/status/1938250909093663145">message acknowledging the 1M+ players milestone</a>, the studio stands firm in its commitment to supporting Firebreak.</p>
<p>"<em>We know there is still a lot of work ahead of us, and we are super motivated about it. We have a lot of exciting things cooking for Firebreak players! More about that soon,</em>" Remedy writes on X.</p>
<p>The other games mentioned in The Game Business' report are classed as successes for their June launches, including Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-suprasses-1-million-units-sold-and-3-million-unique-players/">Rematch</a>, and Aggro Crab and Landfall's indie hit, Peak, which <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1936734056089100646">sold over 1 million copies in its first week</a>.</p>
<p>Ampere Analysis's updated player counts for Dune: Awakening have it at over 1.2 million following <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">Funcom's report</a>, while Peak has now reached more than 2.2 million players, according to Ampere.</p>
<p>Ampere also reports that most of Rematch's player base is, unsurprisingly, on Xbox due to its availability on Xbox Game Pass, with 1.58 million players. On PlayStation, Rematch sits just under 800K players, while the PC version has reached more than 1.1 million players. When Sloclap is able to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support</a>, it'll be interesting to see how the game grows from its strong start without it.</p>

Eventually, Stitch sees a “2" on a building and decides he wants that, too. He then does donuts in the parking lot. The camera reveals that his tire tracks spell out “<em>Lilo and Stitch 2,</em>” with Disney adding an “is in development” on the screen after that. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-and-stitch-2-live-action-movie-sequel-1236300074/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-and-stitch-2-live-action-movie-sequel-1236300074/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announcing it on Thursday wasn’t random</a></span>. It was June 26 or 6-26, aka Stitch’s ID code in the movie. The  news of a <em>Lilo and Stitch</em> sequel isn’t really surprising, considering most film industry experts and reporters expected a follow-up to this year’s extremely successful remake to be revealed soon. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">The recently released live-action adaptation of the original 2002 animated film was a massive box-office hit</a></span>. It made over $920 million globally on a budget of just about $100 million. That’s a big return on investment in an era when a lot of blockbusters cost upwards of $200 million. </p><p>For Disney, the <em>Lilo and Stitch</em> remake’s success comes at a time when it’s been struggling to consistently produce big hit movies. <em>Elio </em>is floundering. Recent Marvel movies have failed to perform as well as past installments. And it’s years away from a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie. So <em>Lilo and Stitch</em>’s runaway success at the box office has likely been a big deal for the company, especially considering its small budget. The remake was originally planned for release on Disney+, but the Mickey Mouse empire’s leaders decided to give it a shot in theaters, and it paid off. </p><p>No information about the sequel’s plot or characters has been revealed, and we don’t have a release window yet, either. But Stitch is back. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-nani-jumba-controversy-1851782507?_gl=1*1ymu8n0*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-nani-jumba-controversy-1851782507?_gl=1*1ymu8n0*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">Hopefully, he and Disney figure out a way to improve on the remake’s lousy ending</a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/lilo-and-stitch-2-sequel-announced-teaser-disney-626-1851785144]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Peak has officially become a sleeper hit with gamers. The co-op climbing game recently reached over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">one million sales in under a week</a> and is in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 40 of the most-streamed games</a> of the past few months. The game was created as a partnership between Another Crab's Treasure developer Aggro Crab and Content Warning creators from Landfall, with most of the development taking place during a month-long jam session.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman talked about the making of the game and being jealous of Landfall's whirlwind method with Content Warning that he felt "turned everything we know about game development upside-down."</p><p>At the time, Aggro Crab was about to launch its biggest game ever, Another Crab’s Treasure, an intense three-year-plus-long project that he felt burned out his team. "While it was a success, Content Warning was a much bigger one made in much less time," Kaman said via email. Lucky for Kaman's team, there was already an established friendly relationship between the studios, so when he asked if they could join the other team in Seoul, they got an enthusiastic yes.</p><p>"We brought our computers to an Airbnb in Hongdae and locked tf in for a month. As soon as we landed, we beelined straight for the nearest IKEA and spent the day assembling office chairs and desks," Kaman added.</p><p>It should be noted that Peak wasn't built entirely from scratch during those four weeks, as Aggro Crab creative director Caelan Rashby-Pollock had already pitched the idea a year ago in Sweden. "The concept was a lot more vague then and much closer to an open-world survival thingy, but we all quickly got excited about being a group of lost scouts on an island, and the macabre slapstick that can come from that." From there, it was all systems go.</p><p>"Basically, any given moment was either working on Peak or getting food while talking more about Peak," Kaman continued. "While it was pretty intense, it was also the most fun I've ever had working on a game. On a silly multiplayer game like this, the player experience often mirrors the development," Kaman said. "Most of the design was driven by the question: 'Wouldn’t it be funny if <em>this</em> happened?' And now every TikTok I've seen of a great moment in Peak reminds me of the great moment we had while implementing it."</p><p>Peak is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>And it completely changes the look of some of the images</p>
</section><div><section>

<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a> is finally out today, 26th June 2025, and it should be a day of celebration for fans of the PS1 original, right? Well, sadly not, as it looks like the remake has replaced many of the games 2D art assets with AI-generated and AI-upscaled versions. And some of the results are pretty awful.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/17799-you-need-to-see-front-mission-3-remakes-redone-network-graphics-photograph">RPGSite's Cullen Black</a>, who also reviewed the game for <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/front-mission-3-remake-review/">Nintendo Insider</a>, has put together a piece comparing many of the game's backgrounds, in-game landing pages, and character portraits from the 1999 original and the 2025 remake from Forever Entertainment and Megapixel Studios.</p>
<p>All the results in the article are from the beginning of the game, and the results speak for themselves. As Black states, it seems that the publisher and developer — who also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/front_mission_1st_remake">Front Mission 1st: Remake</a> — "decided to feed all of the game's original 2D art assets into some form of upscale algorithm to clean them up".</p>
<p>Some of the images look completely different from the originals, which you can see for yourselves below.</p>

<p>Hands look contorted, shadows appear in places where they look out of place on buildings, and in some instances, entirely new assets have been added that look out of place. There's even one image where it looks like a car and a plane have merged together.</p>
<figure><a title="Front Mission 3: Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/57b23186f4932/front-mission-3-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>You can't <em>quite</em> see it here, but the gun the soldier is holding looks... weird. And those helicopters are blending in together a little. — <em>Image: Forever Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fans are understandably not happy about this, especially given that the original game is beloved by many, <em>and</em> there were various issues with both Front Mission 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/front_mission_2_remake">2's Remakes</a>; the former was criticised for control issues, RNG, and being a bit too "straight" or a remake, while the latter (developed by a different studio) received a bad localisation.</p>
<p>Just... look at this plane. It doesn't look flight safe, does it?</p>

<p>We're currently working on our own review of Front Mission 3: Remake, so we'll report back when we have the full verdict. But this isn't a great look. And, as a reminder, the publisher here — Forever Entertainment — is the same studio that worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> on Switch.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft’s “This is an Xbox” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing campaign</a> in November always felt a little too early. If you ask a friend or family member what an Xbox is, the response is likely going to be “it’s a game console.” Xbox is ingrained in popular culture as a box under your TV that you play games on, but Microsoft’s ads over the past six months have been attempting to redefine the Xbox as a platform that spans across phones, laptops, TVs, handheld gaming PCs, and even VR headsets. </p><p>The ads did a great job of drawing attention to the platform, but the perception of the Xbox brand as just a console is still a huge challenge that Microsoft needs to overcome if its latest strategy is going to be successful. I can already sense some trouble ahead. </p><p>Ever since Microsoft unveiled its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> earlier this month, I keep hearing from friends that are asking about an “Xbox handheld.” YouTubers with millions of followers have positioned these handheld gaming PCs as “the first Xbox handheld,” which is true if you believe in Microsoft’s marketing, but false in reality because they don’t natively run Xbox games, only PC versions.</p><p>Microsoft’s answer to this potential confusion is that the Xbox Ally devices will be able to stream your library of Xbox games from the cloud or another Xbox console. That’s not the type of experience I want when I’m spending hundreds of dollars on a piece of hardware that’s capable of running games without an internet connection. In reality, I get the sense that Microsoft is willing to gamble on the potential confusion here, because what it really wants to do is turn Xbox into Steam.</p><p>The Xbox Ally devices are the beginning of a next-generation gaming platform — a platform that looks increasingly like it will revolve around Windows. Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">confirmed last week</a> that Microsoft’s next console is “not locked to a single store,” just like Windows isn’t. Bond went even further, revealing that Microsoft wants to ensure “Windows is the number one platform for gaming.”</p><p>Microsoft has also started calling the Xbox app on Windows simply “Xbox PC,” in a clear bid to position it as a Steam competitor or alternative. This Xbox PC branding has appeared in trailers for games in recent weeks, but even Microsoft can’t decide whether it’s “Xbox PC” or “Xbox on PC” as it has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/">used both recently</a>. Either way has risk: Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827140/microsoft-pc-game-pass-naming-rebrand">rebranded</a> its Xbox Game Pass for PC subscription to just PC Game Pass four years ago because people were getting confused, so Xbox PC feels like it could be another source of confusion.</p><p>Bond’s video also shed some light on how the Xbox PC initiative will allow you to play Xbox games. While Bond largely talked about an AMD partnership for co-engineering silicon, she also confirmed that this next generation of Xbox devices includes “maintaining compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games.” That’s a promise that Microsoft hasn’t been able to deliver for the Xbox Ally devices, and it makes it seem like the company is confident it will deliver some form of Xbox game emulation on Windows for its next generation of devices.</p><p>Bond’s video wasn’t the only interesting Xbox release last week. AMD CEO <strong>Lisa Su </strong>also appeared in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kprpRvsOua0">short video</a> and essentially laid bare Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox strategy: “Moving forward, AMD will go beyond building custom chips for Xbox consoles to designing a full roadmap of gaming-optimized chips, combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud,” Su said.</p><p>That sure sounds like AMD and Microsoft are co-engineering chips for Microsoft’s own next-gen Xbox console, as well as third-party devices that will also be branded as Xbox consoles. Su also specifically revealed these chips will include the hardware support needed for backward compatibility, which suggests that you’ll need one of these chips for whatever emulation solution Microsoft is working on. I fully expect these next-gen chips will also form the basis for how Microsoft plans to license the software powering this Xbox experience to OEMs.</p><p>It feels like this future work with AMD is really what Microsoft means when it says, “This is an Xbox.” It’s an ambitious vision where Xbox games can be played across multiple devices, all with cloud saves so you can pick up where you left off. It’s also a clear reaction to SteamOS and the fact that OEMs are starting to show interest in Valve’s efforts to span its game library across console-like devices.</p><p>The challenge for Microsoft is making its own vision a reality and learning from its mistakes of challenging Steam in the past. In 2006, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2006/05/09/bill-gates-declares-10-million-unit-head-start-for-xbox-360-and-outlines-future-of-interactive-entertainment/">outlined a similar vision</a> for Xbox dubbed “Live Anywhere,” where Xbox experiences would come to Windows-based PCs. It was a response, at the time, to Valve’s launch of Steam a few years prior.</p><p>Microsoft launched its Games for Windows Live initiative with Windows Vista in 2007, designed as a way to unify the gaming experience across PC and Xbox 360 with achievements, online multiplayer, a friends list, and marketplace. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/16/4627194/games-for-windows-live-marketplace-shuts-august-22nd">shut down the service</a> six years later, after lackluster ports of Xbox titles and DRM mechanisms left PC gamers building up their library in Steam instead.</p><p>Nearly 20 years later, a lot of what Microsoft is saying today sounds like Bill Gates’ vision for Windows and the Xbox 360. The big difference this time around is that Microsoft isn’t in a position of strength in the console market like it was with the Xbox 360. That means it has to take a more open approach to overhaul what an Xbox is, like embracing rival stores on its next-generation devices or allowing OEMs to build their own Xbox devices. Microsoft’s opportunity here is to boot millions of Xbox devices into its own Xbox PC store and try to sell games and subscriptions directly to people instead of them turning to Steam.</p><p>There’s a clear revenue benefit to Microsoft here, especially if it can convert even a small percentage of Steam users into buying games from its own store instead of handing over a 30 percent cut to Valve. It will all come down to the console-like experience, with the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">Xbox full screen experience</a>” on Windows being a big first test.</p><p>If Microsoft can pull off this big bet of changing what an Xbox is, then these “This is an Xbox” ads will look like a prophecy. If it fails, then Microsoft risks damaging its last successful consumer brand, potentially beyond repair. The stakes for Xbox couldn’t be higher.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is planning “major” Xbox layoffs next week. </strong>I hinted that more Microsoft layoffs were coming earlier this month, and some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft-xbox/691967/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-job-cuts-rumor">major cuts are going to impact Xbox</a> next week. Some managers have been briefed about the plans, and I keep hearing there will be significant layoffs impacting Microsoft Gaming. There’s <a href="https://x.com/georgebsocial/status/1938051752223232193">online speculation</a> that entire studios could be closed, and I’ve heard from sources that Turn 10, the studio behind <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, is bracing for cuts.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows is getting rid of the Blue Screen of Death after 40 years. </strong>Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it was overhauling its Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error message in Windows 11, and it has now confirmed that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692648/microsoft-bsod-black-screen-of-death-color-change-official">soon be known as the Black Screen of Death</a>. The new design drops the traditional blue color, frowning face, and QR code in favor of a simplified black screen. I think that means we can still call it a BSOD, but it’s going to look a lot more like a regular Windows update screen than before.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft makes Windows 10 extended security updates free, but there’s a catch. </strong>Microsoft originally wanted to charge people $30 for an extra year of Windows 10 security updates, but now it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/691811/microsoft-windows-10-free-extended-security-updates">offering a free option</a> — with a catch. If you’re willing to enable Windows Backup, which syncs your Documents folder and settings to the cloud, you can get Extended Security Updates for Windows 10 until October 13th, 2026. The only issue is you’ll need to ensure your Documents folder isn’t full of files, otherwise you’ll go over the 5GB of free OneDrive storage — and I’m sure Microsoft would love to sell you more space.</span></li><li><span><strong>Discord is working on a Windows on Arm app. </strong>Great news for Qualcomm Copilot Plus PC owners: a native Arm64 version of Discord is on the way. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692551/discord-windows-on-arm-app-arm64-version-development">Discord confirmed its plans </a>to <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week, but it’s not clear exactly when the Windows on Arm version will be released. The current app is very slow and laggy through emulation; I’ve been testing the native version of Discord on a Surface Pro 12-inch, and the difference is night and day. I’m still waiting for a native version of Premiere Pro, but Discord moving to Arm64 plugs another hole in the Windows on Arm universe.</span></li><li><span><strong>A week in Xbox VR with Microsoft and Meta’s new $399 headset. </strong>I’ve spent the past week testing out an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/690978/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-release-date-pricing">Xbox-branded Quest VR headset</a>. It went on sale for $399.99 earlier this week and comes bundled with an Xbox wireless controller, matching Touch Plus controllers, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. While it’s not a true Xbox VR experience, the Xbox Cloud Gaming app is good enough if you really want to play Xbox games without a screen and dedicated console. This is yet another device that’s part of Microsoft’s “This is an Xbox” initiative.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows 11’s indicators for volume and brightness can soon be moved out of the way. </strong>Microsoft has started testing a new feature in Windows 11 that will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/691779/microsoft-windows-11-hardware-indicators-customization">let you move hardware indicator pop-ups like volume and screen brightness</a>. At the moment, they’re stuck at the bottom-center of a screen, but you’ll soon be able to move them to the top-left or top-center positions. It’s part of an update that also includes a new Recall homepage, which lists the top three apps and websites you’ve used in a 24-hour period.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s new small language model is Mu. </strong>Microsoft has introduced a new <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/23/introducing-mu-language-model-and-how-it-enabled-the-agent-in-windows-settings/">on-device Mu model</a> this week, and it’s going to power Windows 11’s new Settings AI agent. “Mu is fully offloaded onto the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and responds at over 100 tokens per second, meeting the demanding UX requirements of the agent in Settings scenario,” says <strong>Vivek Pradeep</strong>, vice president and distinguished engineer at Windows applied sciences.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s Xbox UI update lets you pin games and customize your homescreen. </strong>Microsoft is rolling out a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/691287/xbox-home-ui-pin-favorite-games-apps-rolling-out">new update to its Xbox Home UI</a> that allows Xbox owners to pin apps and games on the homescreen. You can also customize the Xbox Home UI even further to hide system apps and reduce the number of apps and games listed. This should make it easier to see more of those Xbox Dynamic Backgrounds.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft adds Steam games to its Xbox PC app on Windows. </strong>Microsoft is starting to test its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">aggregated gaming library in its Xbox PC app</a> on Windows. Xbox Insiders will be able to start testing this single launcher experience on Windows this week, and it will be identical to what ships on the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds later this year.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is blocking Google Chrome through its family safety feature. </strong>Microsoft’s Family Safety feature, primarily used by parents and schools as a set of parental controls and filters, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690179/microsoft-block-google-chrome-family-safety-feature">started randomly blocking Google’s Chrome browser</a> from opening on Windows earlier this month. Microsoft has now acknowledged the issue and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2">provided a workaround</a> while it works on a fix.</span></li><li><span><strong>Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds meet for the first time. </strong>Microsoft cofounder <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and Linux kernel creator <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> have surprisingly never met before. Sysinternals creator <strong>Mark Russinovich</strong> hosted the pair and <strong>Dave Cutler</strong>, Microsoft technical fellow and Windows NT lead developer, at a dinner party recently. Cutler and Gates both got to meet Torvalds for the first time, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markrussinovich_i-had-the-thrill-of-a-lifetime-hosting-dinner-activity-7341857033932914691-f5Kw/">Russinovich joked</a> that “no major kernel decisions were made.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft struggles to sell Copilot as businesses want ChatGPT instead</strong>. <em>Bloomberg</em> has taken a deep dive into the reality of Microsoft 365 Copilot and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/chatgpt-vs-copilot-inside-the-openai-and-microsoft-rivalry">which businesses are actually paying to use it</a>. Some have switched to OpenAI’s ChatGPT instead, putting Microsoft salespeople on the back foot in an increasingly complicated relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft starts to move antivirus providers out of the Windows kernel. </strong>A faulty CrowdStrike update took down 8.5 million Windows machines nearly a year ago, and now Microsoft is taking some big steps to make sure that never happens again. It’s starting to preview <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692637/microsoft-windows-kernel-antivirus-changes">new Windows changes that will move antivirus</a> (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) apps out of the Windows kernel. It’s going to take some time to get this right, and Microsoft says it’s working closely with security vendors to make sure that the APIs it develops work well for these third-party solutions.</span></li></ul></div><p>There won’t be a Notepad issue next week as I’ll be out on vacation, but I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.</p><p>If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/soK8N9/6J1KVh2/ZZblbDEGXHNH1gK0Q+RaxJQ7vUxDDTYvxX8hARqMZfjuz3Egj">I’m tomwarren.01</a>.

            <p>This article on a free update for train factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> Railgrade is the absolute height of presumption, for we have never actually covered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/railgrade">Railgrade</a> before, even though it came out ONE MILLION YEARS AGO in October 2023.</p>
<p>I cannot hear your cries of outrage and scorn, however, for my ears are filled with the otherworldly whistle of speeding locomotives. The locos wail to me of a brand new campaign encompassing 11 missions and nine hours of playtime. Did you play Railgrade? Do you wish there were more of it? Well, stop carping about our spotty coverage and get this patch down your trousers, then.</p><!--more-->
<p>The campaign in question is Rapid Repo Rescue. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1355090/view/803443087671039134?l=english">detailed on Steam</a>, it takes you to a brand new colony planet except that, oops, it turns out the colony ship accidentally landed on a planet owned by a rival corporation. As such, you'll now need to rush-develop a factory network in order to recharge your space launcher before the legal goons arrive and suitcase the entire site from orbit.</p>
<p>The new campaign is the work of a Railgrade player, Mortiz, who is currently studying at university. Railgrade devs Minakata Dynamics commissioned him - in the form of cash, scandalously enough, rather than the standard creative industry currency of exposure - in light of his past work for the mapmaking community. A few Discord group members have pitched in with playtesting, seemingly for free. I frown upon devs who enlist their players as unpaid testers, but in fairness, this appears to have been a more informal community production.</p>
<p>If you own Railgrade, you'll find Rapid Repo Rescue on the bonus campaign menu. "We gave Mortiz access to every yet-unused asset in the game," lead programmer Daniel Dressler notes. "This meant new trains, new industry, and new resources." The latter bits include "a Natural Gas &amp; Hydrogen set of energy production chains", a new Gas Powerplant, and Offshore Gas Wells.</p>
<p>If you never played Railgrade, because you think trains are the work of the Devil, you may be more interested in the developer's forthcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">Whiskerwood</a>. It's about building factory-colonies of mice and sending shipments of goods to villainous cats overseas - a pleasantly concussed reimagining of European colonialism, plus jolly pirate ships. We'll try to write about that one when it actually comes out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cool-train-strategy-game-railgrade-gets-a-free-campaign-about-escaping-a-rival-corporations-planet]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the last couple of weeks, <em>Adventure Gamers</em>—a beloved game site dedicated to point-and-click adventure gaming since 1998—has become a cruel pastiche of its former self. The site, primarily run by volunteers and enthusiasts, has fought for the much-maligned adventure gaming genre through thick and thin for almost three decades, but visit today and you’ll find more “reviews” of gambling sites and slot machine games than the latest adventure releases. And for an extra kick in the shins, the new owners wiped twenty years of forum posts without warning. How did any of this happen?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Adventure Gamers</em>, originally launched as <em>Adventure Fan</em> in 1998, has long been a bastion for the point-and-click genre. Beginning just as the adventure game began to hit its doldrums (losing favor as one of the primary PC formats to the ever-booming FPS and RTS and the burgeoning MMO), the site stood firm and continued to dig out every single adventure game that appeared, no matter how obscure, and no matter how utterly awful. It was doing god’s work.</p><p>To briefly share its history, <em>Adventure Gamers</em> was owned and run for its first 18 years by Marek Bronstring, with Jack Allin brought in to work as the editor-in-chief. In 2016, Bronstring sold the site to Ivo Teel, with editing duties continuing under Jack Allin. Come 2022, Allin was no longer editor, and Teel took over editorial duties. That is, until recently. While there has been no official announcement, Ivo Teel recently sold the site to new owners, and the result has been an overhaul to twist it into a festival of gambling affiliate ads.</p><p>In amongst the dominating tabs for casinos, betting and poker, all articles are now credited to “AG Staff” rather than their original authors, and they’re buried beneath reviews of god-awful-looking slot machines that contain lines like, “The Da Vinci Diamonds slot machine is a work of art. It draws players in with its beautiful visuals and fun gameplay.” We have no way of knowing for sure, but given the site’s new peculiar use of “In summary” midway through articles and a weird reliance on incongruous bullet point lists, it sure <em>looks</em> like the work of an AI. It’s a sad sight.</p><p>After digging through Reddit threads and social media posts, I discovered that the split in 2022 was not a happy one. One former writer, Will Aickman, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/aickmanwill.bsky.social/post/3lrkmhmu3pk27&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/aickmanwill.bsky.social/post/3lrkmhmu3pk27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alleged on BlueSky</a></span> last week that Teel fired Jack Allin “because he didn’t want to pay him anymore,” which caused an exodus of writing staff. Another <em>AG</em> alumni, Joshua Cleveland, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/comment/mxow2s8/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/comment/mxow2s8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed on Reddit</a></span> that around the same time, Teel had tried to sell the site to him for “six figures,” to which he responded, “I almost fell off my chair. We just wanted ownership of our own work.” So, to try to work out what actually happened here, I got in touch with both Ivo Teel and Jack Allin to find out more about what had happened in 2022, and the circumstances that led to the popular site becoming what it is today: gambling promotion. It seems that no one is happy about any of it.</p><figure id="" data-id="0da38b7bd45565b5697800828adcc913" data-recommend-id="image://0da38b7bd45565b5697800828adcc913" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The logos for the two rival sites." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The logos for the two rival sites." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adventure Gamers / Adventure Game Hotspot / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0da38b7bd45565b5697800828adcc913" data-recommend-id="image://0da38b7bd45565b5697800828adcc913" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The logos for the two rival sites." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h16027"><a id=""></a>The beginning of the end</h2><p>March 2022 was the moment everything went wrong. Jack Allin, the site’s main editor, had been working for what he described as “a rather laughably small amount” to organize the team of mostly volunteers who wrote for the site, and to edit the articles that were posted. However, he saw hope this was about to change after Allin “spearheaded” a Patreon for the site that he called “very successful.” The goal was that, with more money coming into the site, he would be able to be better compensated for his work. However, Allin claims that this isn’t how things worked out. “Imagine my disgust when my deposit that month was for far <em>less</em> than before, followed only by radio silence for weeks.”</p><p>Allin recalls that when he was eventually able to get in touch with Teel, the site’s owner responded with what he called “nebulous nonsense,” saying that after that round of fundraising expired his pay expectations wouldn’t be met, and that the two had “different ‘visions’ for the site.” He was told he would be let go at the end of that month, which was three days away, and asked if he could write a farewell article. In the end, Allin ended up continuing on for two more weeks, and provided what he describes as “a month’s worth of finished article content beyond that.” He was compensated for this extra month. And then he was gone.</p><p>“There was no raging firestorm, no bloody war,” says Allin. “Just a back door pink slip as my reward for 18 years of blood, sweat and tears.” Clearly still very upset by how things went down, Allin added, “If he’s uttered a single word of public appreciation for my efforts to this day, I’ve never seen it.” Hopefully he’s about to.</p><p>Ivo Teel also recalls how finances were tight at the time. After he acquired the site from Bronstring, Teel says he never took any compensation and “consistently invested my own capital to keep the site running.” He adds that “Jack received payment for his editorial work based on our limited resources and his original agreement with Marek.” However, the most recent owner saw the results of the fundraiser very differently.</p><p>“After years of trying to reach break-even and regularly supplementing the budget myself,” Teel told me in response to some questions over Reddit DMs, “we faced a challenging situation. When we had a rare revenue windfall that could cover about three months of operations, I felt we should preserve that capital as reserves rather than continuing the cycle of me adding personal funds.” He adds, “Jack, understandably given his significant contributions over the years, felt he deserved increased compensation.”</p><p>Despite this, Teel told me, “I felt we couldn’t continue if there wasn’t mutual understanding of the financial constraints.” He reflects on the situation saying he thinks both were right, in that Allin deserved fair compensation, and that Teel couldn’t continue to sustain losses. He adds, “Though the parting likely wasn’t mutual, I still have great respect for Jack and his contributions to both our site and his work now with <em>AGH</em>.”</p><h2 id="h16028"><a id=""></a>And then there were two</h2><p><em>AGH</em> is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://adventuregamehotspot.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://adventuregamehotspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Adventure Game Hotspot</em></a></span>, a site set up by Jack Allin and other former <em>Adventure Gamers</em> contributors in the wake of this split, and the organizer of the annual convention <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://adventuregamefanfair.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://adventuregamefanfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure Game Fan Fair</a></span>. Seen by many as the continuation of the spirit of the original site, given the recent dramatic changes at <em>AG</em>, it’s certainly now the de-facto spiritual successor. However, for three years the two sites ran side-by-side.</p><p>After working on some other projects for a few months, Allin approached former <em>AG</em> friend Joshua Cleveland with the notion of starting a new site, because “there was still…a giant hole in my life where <em>AG</em> was.” Many writers joined the new site, although the editor stresses he didn’t set out to poach. “They all came willingly and eagerly,” he adds, saying that he never insisted anyone not write for both sites. “This was never about revenge; it was only ever about starting something worthy of the work we’d be doing previously.”</p><p>Meanwhile for Ivo Teel, no longer paying Allin’s (undisclosed) salary meant he was able to remove advertising from the site but for occasional “integrated campaigns,” adding that he continued operating the site this way for years, “while figuring out how to maintain quality without Jack’s valuable editorial contributions. The reality was challenging, though some excellent volunteers helped fill certain gaps.” However, what Teel describes as a combination of “my high-stress job, raising three children, declining web traffic and AI search results” led to his considering a sale. At one point he explored selling <em>Adventure Gamers</em> to <em>PCGamesN</em>, and briefly listed it on Acquire.com.</p><p>Teel says his goal through this was to sell to buyers who would want to “continue operating the site as-is and work with existing review staff,” which is what he says he believed of the site’s new owners. “I was mainly relieved that a larger, professional team would focus on it—something I could no longer provide.”</p><p>However, soon after the sale, the new owners talked about converting the site’s back-end to Wordpress, which Teel insisted wouldn’t work “given the site’s complexity and integrated forums.” But communication went quiet, Teel still running the site day-to-day, when one morning he discovered the site had moved to a new platform and that a lot of content was missing. Also, multiple sections had disappeared, and the site was suddenly filled with gambling content.</p><p>Teel says he’d never imagined this would happen. “I originally learned the company was primarily SEO-focused, acquiring sites much larger than ours. I had anticipated they might use it for occasional guest posts or content tied to their other properties, leveraging the site’s established reputation and link authority while maintaining the original operation.” But this proved to be entirely wrong.</p><p>When I ask Allin how he feels, seeing the site he’d worked on for decades so desecrated, he told me, “Apart from just a little bit of schadenfreude (I am still human, after all), I’m obviously appalled. And shocked, but not surprised, if that makes sense.” Contrasting Teel’s position that the site had less advertising, Allin contends that in its last few years it had been “out the wazoo,” including paid content, and what he suspects could be AI-generated posts. “So the site was already a shell of its former self. But I don’t think anyone imagined that it would ever be turned over to a gambling outfit.”</p><p>Another change that occurred via the new ownership is that the author’s names have been removed from every article, going back to the start. Suggesting that, while he’s not opposed to responsible gambling, he’d be “horrified if anyone got sucked in on the back of decades of my hard work,” Allin adds how the removal of bylines is a whole new conflicting factor. “I’d say I would never want my name associated with that kind of unethical deception,” he says, “but I guess the new owners have taken care of that, as <em>none</em> of the content is attributed to the original authors. Which makes me a whole other kind of angry.” He notes how awful he feels for the many writers who can no longer get credit for the work they contributed.</p><p>“It’s all disgraceful,” Allin says. “I’ve heard even Ivo is surprised by how thoroughly the new owners have destroyed it, and I believe he didn’t do this out of malice. But really, you don’t get to sell your house to Bob’s Demolition and Tenement Co. and then act surprised when they turn it into a slum.”</p><p>Allin is right that Ivo Teel was surprised. Admitting that he had not seen where <em>Adventure Gamers</em>’ new owners were heading, he explained, “Now it’s become clear that our expectations for the site’s future were quite different.” His hopes of a continuing of the legacy were dashed, and Teel is contrite about it. “In hindsight, I should have done more thorough due diligence on their other properties and long-term strategy. It’s genuinely sad to see something I’d poured a decade of my life into transformed so drastically from what it was meant to be.”</p><h2 id="h16029"><a id=""></a>A small glint of hope</h2><p>As mentioned above, the <em>Adventure Gamer </em>forum was collateral damage in this whole fiasco. It’s perhaps hard for those who have grown up in the years since forums were an internet community’s main means of connection to understand just how integral and important such boards were, and indeed still are. Decades of conversations, discussions, arguments, friendships, fallings out and much more are contained within, along with unique vocabularies, memes, jokes and memories. To have that just vanish can be devastating.</p><p>Allin wasn’t willing to go into details about this possible hope when I pressed him about this, but explained that “fortunately, it seems the new <em>AG</em> owners don’t care about the forum content existing elsewhere, so both <em>Adventure Game Hotspot</em> and another website I’m not at liberty to disclose have been in touch with Ivo about possibly hosting an archived version.” This endeavor will likely take weeks, “if not longer,” to get the archive back online. “If needed,” Allin adds, “the <em>Hotspot</em> will step in and help where we can, as it’s just not right to have so much history wiped out of existence.” I’ve confirmed with Ivo as well that this is going ahead.</p><p>The loss of any long-term site is always incredibly sad, but it’s especially the case when we’re talking about decades of incredibly hard work by legions of volunteers, passionately sharing their enthusiasm for an under-represented faction of gaming. And to see such a site exploited for gambling affiliate ads is just galling. No one has come out of this situation happy, apart from perhaps the mysterious new owners. The site acknowledges no owning company, has removed all the links from its Contact Us page, and its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://adventuregamers.com/about/history&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://adventuregamers.com/about/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">History page</a></span> had its last update in 2022.</p><p>However, despite this shyness, I have managed to dig up who it is. A company called ClickOut Media, which says it offers to “help brands gain exclusive access to the world’s top crypto, finance, and tech publications—without the hassle.” The company is currently advertising the position of a “Gambling Editor.”</p><p>It’s fair to say the spirit of <em>Adventure Gamer</em> lives on through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://adventuregamehotspot.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://adventuregamehotspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Adventure Game Hotspot</em></a></span>, but obviously that site’s archives only go back to 2022. This whole situation is all very sad. But with hope of saving an archive of the forums, there’s at least a chance the original community won’t be completely shattered.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/adventure-gamers-forums-gambling-ads-jack-allin-1851784764]]></content:encoded>

News that developer Funcom would be making a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-pvp-heavy-endgame-is-about-to-get-a-huge-pve-shift/1100-6532645/" data-ref-id="1100-6532645">big shift to the survival MMO's endgame</a> came just a few days ago in a blog post from the game's creative director, Joel Bylos, who said Funcom's goal was not to "force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in." That news was followed by a public test client build for the game's 1.1.10.0 patch that listed the Deep Desert changes (among many others).</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dune: Awakening — Bene Gesserit Mentor Class Gameplay Trailer | Schools of the Imperium</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">However, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1172710/announcements/detail/546739082808525244?snr=2___" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotfix</a> released today makes it so the southern half of the Deep Desert is now open for PvE business, though there are still pockets of PvP to be found. Shipwrecks and control points found within the southern half of the region will still be PvP zones. Funcom notes that it rebalanced the distribution of Dune: Awakenings coveted endgame resources around this change, making it so that "loot overall is more valuable and plentiful in the northmost PvP zones." PvE players will still be able to find the highest tier of resources in the southern regions of the zone, just not as much of it.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will continue monitoring how this plays out and continue iterating when and if needed," Funcom states in the patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">The hotfix also brings previously announced changes to Ornithopters, currently a menace in PvP despite having already been nerfed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-notes-fix-frustrating-endgame-pvp-problems/1100-6532538/" data-ref-id="1100-6532538">no longer cause damage when ramming into other players</a> on the ground. Using a rocket launcher module for the Scout Orni now decreases its top speed by 20% (or 10% for those using the more unpopular Assault Ornithopter). Funcom states it has more changes planned around Ornithopters and PvP.</p><p dir="ltr">In one other major change as part of the hotfix, players can now visit other Sietches and claim land. Dune: Awakening's servers are broken down into Worlds, which are made up of multiple smaller servers called Sietches. While players can now claim land in other Sietches, the number of bases a player can have is still locked to three. The hotfix also introduces a player reporting feature, allowing players to report text chat or messages from other players.</p><p dir="ltr">You can read the full Dune: Awakening update 1.1.0.17 patch notes below. Funcom recently announced Dune: Awakening is already its fastest-selling game to date, having sold more than 1 million copies since its launch in early June.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening Update 1.1.0.17 Patch Notes</h2><h2>FEATURES AND CHANGES</h2><h3>Deep Desert:</h3><p>As outlined in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fduneawakening.com%2Fnews%2Fa-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp%2F">A message from the Creative Director on PvE and PVP » Dune: Awakening</a>, this hotfix will see the first iteration of the changes to the balance between PvE and PvP in the Deep Desert. Rest assured that we will continue to listen to your feedback and make adjustments in the future.</p><ul><li>The PvE area has been adjusted to encompass the entire southern half of the Deep Desert map.  <ul><li>This means that players who have no interest in PvP should be able to find what they want without engaging in PvP. Imperial Testing Stations, caves, and so forth found in this area are thus now PvE.</li><li>Control Points and Shipwrecks will, however, continue to be PvP throughout the entire map, which means you will find localized pockets of PvP within the PvE section still. Similar to how Shipwrecks are PvP in Hagga Basin.</li></ul></li><li>To retain the Risk vs Reward setup for the Deep Desert:  <ul><li>The density of resources increases the further north you go. This includes high-density clusters of valuable resources.</li><li>The largest spice fields will also spawn in the north.</li><li>The majority of Control Points will exist in the northern part.</li></ul></li><li>As part of these changes, we have made some balancing adjustments in the Deep Desert:  <ul><li>The lower half of the Deep Desert now offers PvE loot that is balanced toward shared loot and PvE activities. You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a "first come, first served" basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest.</li><li>Plasteel plates can only be found in PvP zones. This line was inaccurate, since Plasteel plates can be obtained from crashing ships.</li><li>The amount of active medium spice fields has been reduced from 8 to 5.</li><li>The number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22.</li><li>The spawn rate of Titanium and Stravidium has been reduced in the PvE areas so that large quantities only spawn in the far-out PvP areas.</li><li>The number of nodes in resource hotspots in the PvE part of the map has been reduced.</li><li>The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has increased from 30 to 45 minutes.</li></ul></li><li>Some Imperial Testing Stations are still in the PvP region, and players who want all schematics available each week will want to visit both the PvP and PvE Imperial Testing Stations. Keep in mind the loot in them rotates each week, so even if you're not interested in PvP, you could obtain it at a later date if you're not able to trade for it or buy it off the Exchange.</li></ul><h3>Vehicles:</h3><ul><li>We have begun work on the outlined changes to the Scout Ornithopters.  <ul><li>Equipping a Rocket Launcher Module will now decrease the top speed of your Ornithopter.  <ul><li>For Scout Ornithopters, the reduction is 20%.</li><li>For Assault Ornithopters, the reduction is 10%.</li></ul></li><li>Infocards for the modules now reflect this change.</li></ul></li><li>Exiting ornithopters mid-air will now cause them to drop straight down instead of gliding away. This should decrease the chance that you lose your ornithopter upon disconnecting from the game or exiting by accident your ornithopter mid-air (yes, we have seen the videos).  <ul><li>Known issue: There is an edge case that if your vehicle ends up in the quicksand you might not be able to interact with it if you are in the quicksand. The workaround is to try to get on top of the vehicle to interact with it. This will be fixed in the very next patch.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Visiting:</h3><ul><li>We removed the restrictions when visiting other sietches.  <ul><li>Before this change, players had their “home” sietches, and could visit other sietches in their world but couldn’t claim land. Now, any player can go to any sietch in their world and claim land wherever they want.</li><li>Players can also place respawn beacons on any sietch in their world.</li></ul></li><li>As a result of this change, the home icon on the server selection screen, which previously indicated your home server, now indicates on what server you have a base. Similarly, a vehicle icon shows where you have vehicles.</li></ul><h3>Technical and stability:</h3><ul><li>Increased game stability.</li><li>The latest NVIDIA driver was added to the GPU driver check at the game launch.</li></ul><h3>Other</h3><ul><li>We have introduced Player Reporting, allowing players to now report other players' messages from the text chat or report players from the Inspect menu on players.</li></ul><h2>FIXES</h2><h3>Technical and stability:</h3><ul><li>As a continuous effort, we have closed several exploit vulnerabilities.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a specific type of network issue would cause players to be stuck in an infinite loading screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some players could experience a client freeze when traveling between Deep Desert servers.</li></ul><h3>Combat:</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players performing a melee attack could get obstructed by corpses lying on the ground.</li></ul><h3>User Interface:</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the guild faction alignment was not localized on the Guild Overview tab.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could encounter a black screen if they skipped the cinematic at “The Wreck of the Hephaestus”.</li><li>Fixed an issue where several Sandbike research schematics failed to mention the Imperial Testing Stations as the primary source.</li></ul><h3>Travel:</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could use an ornithopter pilot service to fly from the cities to Hagga Basin if they had arrived in a city with their ornithopter.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous:</h3><ul><li>You will no longer lose learned emotes when respec'ing your skill tree.</li></ul>

            <p>Don't Nod - the developer behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-review">Jusant</a>, and the recently-announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nods-next-game-sends-us-out-of-this-world-with-a-little-help-from-european-space-agency">Aphelion</a> - is laying off staff from its Montreal office. The number of impacted staff is undisclosed.</p>
<p>This wave of layoffs comes from select developers who've been struck by the cuts, who posted about them publicly on Linkedin. Eurogamer has contacted Don't Nod for comment as to how many staff have been affected, as well as the reasoning for the layoffs.</p>
<p>Senior game and level designer Mathieu Tremblay posted: "I am saddened to say I was part of yet another wave of layoffs affecting the video game industry."</p>

<p>Tremblay continues: "I am incredibly proud of what the team at Don't Nod Montreal accomplished with Lost Records: Bloom and Rage and shipping the game with this level of quality was nothing short of a miracle in the circumstances. I wish for all others affected by this wave of layoffs to land on their feet quickly, as they are truly exceptional people."</p>
<p>QA lead Sandra Comier also bid farewell on LinkedIn, writing: "Unfortunately, I was part of the layoff at DontNod Montréal and today was my last day. These past 3 years, I've learned a lot as a Lead QA but also as a part of a wonderful QA team ❤️ I will never stop saying how much I am proud of my colleagues."</p>
<p>Last September, a Don't Nod financial report stated Jusant and Banishers: Ghost of New Eden failed to meet company expectations. It then set its sights on Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, which it stated "received a particularly positive reception" at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> when played by members of the press.</p>
<p>In this report, Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert said: "We are obviously disappointed by our recent performance in an extremely competitive and selective market."</p>
<p>"Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap."</p>
<p>The following month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-lost-records-studio-dont-nod-says-69-jobs-at-risk-as-part-of-reorganisation-project">Guilbert put forward a redundancy plan</a> for the company which put 69 employees at risk of losing their jobs. In response, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/workers-at-dont-nod-to-strike-in-reaction-to-studios-recent-redundancy-plan">developers are Don't Nod went on strike</a> at the developer's Paris headquarters.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-records-and-jusant-developer-dont-nod-is-laying-off-staff]]></content:encoded>

		<p>You might think that every genre fusion and mash-up has been figured out by now, but Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road is the latest game to defy that. Blending together city building, tower defence, rougelites, bullet heaven and more, this is the kind of game that can immediately grab you and not let go for run after run after run.

<p>At the heart of Monsters Are Coming is the city. This bastion of civilisation is under siege by swarms of inky black spider-like monsters, but it’s not going to take this assault lying down. No, the city can move, lifting up from its foundations and rolling forward implacably on wheels to make a slow escape.</p>


<p>While you’re in charge of the city’s survival, you don’t actually play as it, or even have that god-like omniscience and control that most strategy games would give. Instead, you’re the Peon, who runs around in the wastes surrounding the city, hurriedly gathering resources to restore and improve the city, scooping up the gems and racing to aid in its defence from any enemies that start to get too close.</p>


<p>Through your combined efforts, fighting back the waves of enemies is initially not that taxing, but as you progress, eternally going from top to bottom, the enemies get tougher, their waves larger, and you need to improve your defences and Peon’s abilities. This taps into the Vampire Survivors style of levelling up to earn upgrades. Gather enough of the teardrop-shaped crystals that monsters leave behind and deliver them to the city, and you’ll gradually gain XP to level up.</p>
<p>This triggers a choice between different towers and buildings to add to your city, zooming in to a grid view where you can place structures freely. Put a tower out in a corner and it will happily be connected back to the main structure with a walkway, truly giving you full freedom to strengthen different sides of the roving fortress. However, that also means it’s potentially more difficult to have them in range of buildings that buff damage or elemental types, making every unlock a tricky little conundrum to consider for a few moments. Towers can be levelled up by plonking the same type of tower on top, but there’s no way to rearrange the layout through a run, so do try to choose wisely?</p>
<p>My run handed me a lot of ice elemental damage, whether it was setting off icy explosions, or spouting gouts ice to freeze and slow enemies. At the same time, a whirling buzzsaw would both hit monsters that came into range and gather up any wood that it could as well.</p>

<p>You can also find and earn upgrades to the Peon, adding up to four offensive abilities that automatically trigger and fire at nearby enemies, as well as bringing more passive buffs to them. I really enjoyed the Vampire Survivors vibe that this gave, but the Peon is still inherently quite squishy. Thankfully, the Peon dying is merely a momentary setback, and you’ll respawn very quickly.</p>
<p>Heading down the monster-filled track eventually brings you to a Shelter, providing a brief respite from the never-ending hordes, as well as a little conundrum. This always provides two paths for you to explore with the Peon, each featuring a specific minigame challenge and a resource reward for your efforts. It could be pushing a cart down track, destroying a particularly tough enemy on your own, or a number of other things that have yet to be revealed. Whatever your choice, the other path is then locked away from you, and you’re forced back to the main safe harbour within a minute or so.</p>
<p>Shelter itself lasts as long as you want it to, but will always end once you’ve visited the shop –&nbsp;it’s labelled as “Shop &amp; Go” for a reason! This gives you a chance to spend the gold coins that you’ve gathered on new towers and districts. If you’re flush with cash, you can buy all five buildings together, giving the next stretch of your run a serious boost.</p>
<p>It naturally all builds up to a boss battle which, in this case, was a hefty brute that stomped circles around my city, constantly attaching itself to scenery in the surrounding world to gain invulnerability. It’s only by scuttling across with the Peon to batter a few trees or rocks that it had linked to that this could be removed and a brief window of opportunity to deal damage revealed. Thankfully, I clung on long enough.</p>

<p>We also got to see a tantalising glimpse of some of the other cities, biomes and challenges that will await. One of the key things that Ludogram wants to address is how easy it is to fall into a rut of relying on that one build you know that works –&nbsp;leaning in on fire, time and again, for example. To that end, the starter city provides a 20% boost to defence, aiding survivability for newcomers, but there’s some truly wild city types that you’ll unlock and that will completely change how you play, in addition to switching biomes having different leanings in enemy types and resources. However, there’s also just the general expansion of possibilities that will come from the roguelite metagame, unlocking new options that grow the pool of possible drops, adding more complexity and choices for you to consider.</p>
<p>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road,&nbsp;to use its full title once more, is absolutely the kind of game I can see myself losing hours and hours to. Tower defence and bullet heaven survival games are already so satisfying in their own right, and their progeny promises much the same. I’m definitely very keen to play more, with Ludogram currently holding a closed beta test to refine it even further.</p>

			<p>Legendary RPG designer and writer Chris Avellone is joining Republic Games, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in late 2024 by former Quantic Dream writer Adam Williams. Their project is a dark, mature fantasy RPG, which sounds like the perfect game for Chris Avellone to work on, given that his credits include Fallout 2, Planescape: Torment, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Neverwinter Nights 2, Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wasteland 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyranny</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/torment-tides-numenera-review-tides-shifted-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torment: Tides of Numenera</a>, Prey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Divinity: Original Sin II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-kingmaker-review-carving-your-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wasteland 3</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird West</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alaloth-champions-of-the-four-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms</a>.</p>
<p>The news was <a href="https://x.com/adamwilliam_/status/1938233299442249816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> on X by Adam Williams, who commented:</p>
<p><em>Chris has written, created, and designed for some of the greatest RPGs of all time. He’s a master of interactive storytelling. On our list of people to work with, he was at the top.</em></p>
<p><em>Chris was at the forefront of the golden age of RPGs. We are creating a dark fantasy story with immersive gameplay and a rich interactive narrative which aims to recapture that magic -- and take it to the next level. Everybody at the studio is very excited – we’re building a dream team.</em></p>
<p>In a statement shared with a press release, Avellone said:</p>
<p><em>When Adam shared his vision and design for his upcoming title, I asked if I could collaborate, and Adam was more than willing to bring me on board as part of the team. I love the design principles he’s outlining for the game, and even better, I love the narrative construction he’s implementing as well. To be a part of it on the ground floor is pretty amazing, and it’s a rare opportunity in the industry.</em></p>
<p>In the press release, it was also confirmed that player choices will heavily influence the story and alter the destiny of the player character and the world. The story will also feature multiple endings.</p>
<p>Chris Avellone was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-accused-of-sexual-harassment-misconduct-several-studios-cut-ties-with-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject</a> of sexual harassment/misconduct allegations in June 2020 by two women. Consequently, Techland, Gato Salvaje, and Paradox Interactive cut ties with him; at the time, he was working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-waylanders-harsh-life-celtic-warrior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Waylanders</a>, and Vampire: The Masquerades - Bloodlines 2 (before Paradox replaced Hardsuit Labs with The Chinese Room).</p>
<p>A year later, Avellone <a href="https://chrisavellone.medium.com/ending-silence-c48e86f7c523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a lengthy response to the allegations on Medium and also filed a libel suit in a California court. The case <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-case-has-been-resolved-sexual-allegation-claims-have-been-retracted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended</a> two years ago, with the two women retracting their claims and paying Avellone a seven-figure compensation.</p>

        <p>It's every bit as fun as it looks</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, so, you've read the headline. There's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> mod that adds a rubbish chute to Megabuilding H10 with full animations and everything, so that you can exit V's default flat via a big slide down to ground level.</p>
<p>It's a totally unnecessary thing for someone to have spend time adding to a video game. It's a totally unnecessary thing for a person to download and add to a video game they've bought. It's also totally glorious, to the point that none of that other stuff matters a jot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's called (clears throat) <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22334?tab=description">"Weeee"</a>, and is the work of prolific Cyberpunk modder Phil 'Deceptious' Wright. If you've modded Cyberpunk at any point over the years, odds are you've given any number of their more advanced works a look, with these including <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/11590">revamped romances</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7833">custom quests</a>, and a whole new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/18223">intro/backstory option</a>.</p>
<p>All of that stuff's really impressive, especially given that most of it relies on community-developed tools that modders have made to let them bend a game with notorious bug potential to their will without breaking it. At the same time, as a mod user, I get just as much of a kick out of seeing all that expertise turned on something that's just for a laugh.</p>

<p>Enter the trash slide. It's a very simple and goofy premise, but it's been put together like the Mona Lisa of gags. There's a full animation that plays just as seamlessly as any of the base game's every time you slide down from the atrium of the Megabuilding, and transitions into a satisfying thunk as you land in a pile of binbags. There's a ladder neatly tucked away to get you down to street level from there, so you aren't limited to jumping down and breaking your cyber ankles.</p>
<p>For a big yellow slide tacked to the side of a building, the chute's not so in-your-face as to take you out of the wider Cyberpunk experience. It's goofy in practice, but I could easily see myself incorporating it into the backstory of a quirky character who doesn't like lifts.</p>
<p>CD Projekt could add an exact copy of this to the game in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">their next patch</a> and you'd not feel like their standards had slipped one bit. I love jank in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">jokey modding antics</a> as much as anyone. It's often a huge part of the charm, knowing for sure that a human had a laugh making this because they've cocked it up a bit. However, there's something to be said for tomfoolery that's executed with the deft touch and elegance of the finest Shakespearian knob gag.</p>
<p>If you want to try the slide, you'll need to grab its requirements, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, because as I stressed, this is advanced modding at its finest.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-literally-called-weeee-lets-you-leave-your-flat-via-a-big-slide-like-a-bin-batman]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix’s Password Sharing Crackdown Is My Own Special Trolley Problem]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/netflix-password-sharing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-password-sharing-crackdown-is-my-own-special-trolley-problem.1229163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a Netflix account. Maybe you have a Netflix account too. For years, I have given it money, and it has given me movies and TV. For years, I have also paid for its highest tier; in exchange for more money, I have been able to give my sister and parents profiles on my account so they can watch movies and TV too. This has all been fine for basically forever, until now.</p><p>In the old days, password <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/840276073040371712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing</a> on Netflix involved literally giving someone your email address and password and just trying not to use the account at the same time. In <a href="https://flixed.io/netflix-price-hikes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2013</a>, the company introduced a plan that let multiple users watch Netflix on different devices through one account, which felt like a more formal codification of how everyone was basically using the service anyway. Where password sharing before felt like something you weren’t <em>really</em> supposed to be doing, this felt above board and, to me, like a fair exchange; once I could afford it, I was happy to pay extra to provide Netflix to my family members without having to do some clandestine song and dance.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix started <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/netflix-announces-password-sharing-crackdown-rollout-us/story?id=99551562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cracking down on password sharing</a> in 2023, to much <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/netflix-password-sharing-rules-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backlash</a>, so I can’t claim surprise that it’s finally come for me. But when it did, I was baffled by what a shitty job it did of the whole thing. In April, I went to log into my Netflix account on my laptop from my home in Brooklyn, only to learn that Netflix no longer considered me part of my “household,” despite the fact that it seemed to recognize I was the owner of the account. What’s a “household?” Well, it requires <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/124925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owning a TV</a>, which I never have. According to Netflix, “If you don’t watch Netflix on a TV or don’t have one, you do not need to set a Netflix Household for your account.” Except that explanation didn’t address the fact that Netflix had made its own determination of my “household” and decided I wasn’t part of it, rendering me an intruder into <em>my own account</em>. I ultimately had to request a code to grant myself temporary access to the account I pay for, which Netflix was keen to remind me would expire.</p><p>Who, exactly, did Netflix consider the account’s “household?” My guess is that it’s my twin sister and her kids, many states away. I can understand how Netflix came to this assumption, especially with its new vision of account sharing as multiple devices in one physical location–which is literally not what it meant for years and frankly is weirdo behavior. While I did find it incredibly funny that it felt like Netflix basically stole my account and gave it to my sister because she has the most TVs, I also knew this was going to be a problem.</p><p>But then, for a few months, it wasn’t! I was counting down the days until the temporary code expired, curious to see what would happen next, but when the day came, nothing happened. We all went on using my Netflix as normal, and while I knew it was too good to last, I put the whole thing out of my mind.</p><p>Until this week, when I received flurries of alerts asking me to verify that my parents were part of my non-existent “household” when they tried to use my account in a different state from both my sister and me. This raised a problem; I wanted to approve the alert so they could use the account, but would telling Netflix that they’re the household mean my sister and I weren’t? The whole thing became some kind of weird Trolley Problem: Do I give Netflix to my elderly parents, my single-mom sister and her four kids, or to myself? From a utilitarian perspective, my sister’s family should get it: there are more of them, and real talk they’ve been through hell these last few years and shouldn’t have to add losing Netflix to the mix. My parents don’t use it often, but then again they’re <em>my parents</em>. Paying for an account I can no longer use is very like me, but <em>I pay for it</em>!</p><p>Netflix itself provides a solution: In addition to the $27.21 a month I pay for the “premium” tier ($24.99 a month, plus tax), I can pay an <em>additional</em> fee to buy my parents and my sister “slots” on my account, making them “<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/123279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extra members</a>.” Extra members can only use one device and only have one profile, which is very much not how my sister’s family is using the account, but it would still be the closest approximation to our current setup. Extra member slots <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost</a> $6.99 with ads (oh yeah, Netflix has ads now) or $8.99 without, and only the premium tier I’m currently on lets you have two extra members. All this means that I would practically double what I currently pay in exchange for a lesser version of the thing I’m currently paying for.&nbsp;</p><p>This is such frustrating naked bullshit that I subjected my family group chat to a furious critique of it, which weirded out my parents and which my sister politely ignored. But it’s garbage! As I told my family, I can afford it, but it’s the <em>principle</em> of the thing. I don’t want to have to pay more for a worse service! I hate how Netflix is acting like this has always been the case, or is putting the blame on me for doing the thing it let me do for years. It’s apparently been going well for Netflix, which reported <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/business/netflix-earnings-first-quarter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an increase in subscribers</a> after the crackdown. But this fact just makes me <em>less</em> prone to wanting to give the company more money. I don’t want to fall for this shit! Don’t bully me, Netflix!</p><p>The most obvious answer is probably for my family members to get their own accounts, which would let me downgrade <em>my</em> account and thus rob Netflix of some of my money but still ultimately netting it <em>more</em> money while juicing its subscriber numbers. Or I could downgrade and pay for just one extra slot, asking me to choose between my parents and my sister; Mom and Dad don’t look but I would probably choose my sister, which would <em>still</em> give her a worse version of Netflix with its limited profiles and devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit uncomfortable with how much TV I watch for a while, so maybe cancelling the whole thing wouldn’t be the worst outcome, and it would feel like a moral victory over Netflix to boot. But it would still have a negative effect on my family, who have <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered enough from my unhealthy consumption habits</a> over the years. All of this is way too much to have to deal with in exchange for <em>Bojack Horseman</em> marathons and working my way through the US version of <em>Shameless</em>.</p><p>My current plan is to… just keep ignoring it until it becomes thoroughly unavoidable, while also worrying about the variety of other accounts I share and when enshittification will come for them too. But if you’ve found some way to deal with this that doesn’t cost you a ton of money or let Netflix humiliate you, let me know. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/netflix-password-sharing]]></content:encoded>

<p>Onto hardware now, and it has been another big one for the Switch 2, with an additional 140,026 units under its belt after surpassing the big one milly last week. Interestingly, the Switch Lite and OLED models follow behind in second and third, meaning that the Switch 1's combined sales (12,769) are once again higher than the PS5's (6,006) across the consoles' respective SKUs, after Sony took the lead last time.</p>

			<p>Dune: Awakening developer Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/">released the latest update</a> for the new large-scale survival game, which adds the changes that creative director<a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/"> Joel Bylos recently announced</a>, including changes to ornithopters, the removal of restrictions for visiting sietches, and most significantly, making areas of the Deep Desert PvE zones, to help improve the endgame experience for solo players and those who don't want to engage in the intense PvP gameplay the Deep Desert has become known for.</p>
<p>The entire southern half of the Deep Desert map is now a PvE zone, allowing players who don't want to engage in PvP to harvest and look for high-value resources without having to venture further into the Deep Desert.</p>
<p>That said, there is a greater density of high-value resources if you do venture further north into the Deep Desert and PvP areas. The high risk of engaging in PvP will always grant the highest reward for those willing to take on the risk.</p>
<p>Plasteel plates, for example, can still only be found in PvP zones. The number of active medium spice fields has also been reduced from 8 to 6, while the number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22, and the largest spice fields will still only be found in the north of the Deep Desert.</p>
<p>The Titanium and Stravidium spawn rate has also been reduced in PvE zones, which means that the only way to find large quantities of either will once again be to travel to the PvP regions of the Deep Desert. The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has also been increased from 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Regarding vehicles, the major changes are for the Scout Ornithopters, which now have their speed and maneuverability decreased, should you decide to equip yours with rocket launchers. It's a 20% speed decrease for Scout Ornithopters and a 10% decrease for Assault Ornithopters.</p>
<p>The last few notable aspects of this patch are the restrictions on visiting other sietches being lifted, with any player now able to go to any sietch in their world and claim land wherever they want, and a slew of bug fixes and stability improvements. Beyond that, the last notable aspect of this patch is what it lacks - the changes to the Landsraad that Bylos mentioned in his previous statement.</p>
<p>All of these changes to Dune: Awakening have been met with a mixed reception from players. Some, notably those who have been engaging with PvP, think Funcom already had the right balance. Others, namely those who don't want to engage in PvP, think these changes are for the better. Either way, Funcom has been clear that the team will continue to adapt and balance the game per player feedback. It'll be interesting to see how it evolves over the course of the year, especially when Funcom reveals the<a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/"> first major content drop in a few months time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Two Point Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds</em>, the first major DLC expansion for museum management sim&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, and it's heading your way next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://community.twopointcounty.com/two-point-studios/two-point-museum/blogs/89-two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-coming-17th-july" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>site,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will launch on July 17th across all platforms on which the game is currently available, and it'll bring a ton of extra stuff for you to enjoy, all of it fantasy-themed.</p>

<p>First off, you can look forward to 40 new exhibits "with magical properties to hypnotize guests with", and that's not necessarily a figure of speech, either. You'd better watch your guests around some of the more esoteric oddments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/two-point-museum-dlc-fantasy-finds-gnomes.jpg?itok=47nUXFxD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/two-point-museum-dlc-fantasy-finds-gnomes.jpg?itok=rYpSmJPY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC has weird stuff galore for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new exhibits,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will also introduce a new Expert type, a new map to explore, and plenty of "exclusive decorations, items, and utility items" for you to fill your museum up with.</p>

<p>More interactive displays will also be introduced in the DLC, as well as a new helicopter paint job and three new guest archetypes for you to keep happy. You'd better make sure they don't get hypnotized!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, it's a management sim, and you'll never guess what you get to manage. That's right: your very own aquarium. The clue's in the name, I guess.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-museum-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, Two Point Studios' latest lets you manage a museum, oversee its exhibits, and try to keep its guests happy, all while acquiring your own artifacts and trying to thwart the efforts of enterprising thieves.</p>




<p>The game is the latest management sim from Two Point Studios, who, as the name suggests, can also count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">2018's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">Two Point Hospital</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">2022's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">Two Point Campus</a>&nbsp;</em>as feathers in their cap.</p>

<p><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3592600/Two_Point_Museum_Fantasy_Finds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on July 17th, and the base game is currently available on all of those platforms as well.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>, the troubled sequel to dino husbandry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, will "hopefully" launch into early access by 2027, according to Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz. The key question appears to be when to shift the focus away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, the original Ark's Unreal Engine 5 revamp, which launched in early access in 2023. Also, designing a Soulslike combat system is hard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update">PCGamesN</a>, Stieglitz explained that Studio Wildcard had a vertical slice (loosely defined, a demo that shows off all aspects of the final game) for Ark 2 prior to Survival Ascended's launch. But the devs "felt that as a team, it would be very difficult to follow that all the way through to a complete game with both our experience level and [our scope] as a company". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz says the developers needed to get their heads around Unreal Engine 5 before taking a swing at Ark 2, and in particular, its new Soulslicorice combat system. "It's very difficult to do soulslike combat in a multiplayer PvP context," Stieglitz went on. "You could probably count the number of games on one hand that have even attempted that in an actual PvP context."
</p>
<p>(FromSofties may be in uproar over this last claim - in his defence, Stieglitz is presumably referring to games like Ark that allow dozens of players per public session. Still, by all means count up the alternatives and prove him wrong. I'd do it but I need both these hands to type with.)</p>
<p>
Right now, "a small portion" of Studio Wildcard are working to "refine" the mechanics of that old Ark 2 vertical slice. Stieglitz reckons it'll take "18 months of hardcore team focus to [turn] that vertical slice into an early access game, when we get to put the vast majority of our team back on it." He thinks Ark 2 will launch into early access "hopefully within the next two years", but it all depends on when Studio Wildcard decide to shift their efforts away from Survival Ascended.
</p>
<p>
Aside from dancing the Soulslike Fantastic with the new brontosaurus-punching mechanics, Studio Wildcard intend to feature proper NPC antagonists in Ark 2, "because that's been implied by the trailer and has been part of our design for quite some time as an opposing force, so to speak". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz wants to "add a lot more threat level to the environment and the feeling of being able to enjoy a PvP-like experience, even without [fighting against other players]." He's also gunning for a user-generated content system that works more "seamlessly under the hood while you're playing the game", rather than being presented as a menu.
</p>
<p>
Survival Evolved players may not be too tickled to hear of the present commitment to Survival Ascended. The Unreal Engine revamp launched in October 2023 with some new creatures and structures, but without much of Survival Evolved's expansion content. In the process, Studio Wildcard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-evolveds-official-servers-switch-off-in-just-a-few-hours-paving-the-way-for-remake">took the original game's servers offline</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As the developers have hitherto made plain, Ascended exists in large part to fund Ark 2's development, not just help them cut their teeth on a new engine or git gud at parrying. Initially, they were planning to launch it in a bundle with a $50 Ark 2 pre-order, but players swarmed the comms like testy oviraptors, and the developers ultimately released Ascended by itself for $45, before launch discounts. It now has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascendeds-first-expansion-recruits-the-studio-behind-jujutsu-kaisen-for-some-flashy-anime-cutscenes">a DLC roadmap that runs till end of 2026</a>.
</p>
<p>
The bad blood continues to swirl. Steam user reviews for Ascended remain <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/#app_reviews_hash">mixed</a>, and the original Ark <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">has more players on Steam right now</a>, despite the loss of official server support. Still, I'm sure Studio Wildcard will keep plugging on with it, because after all, confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as...
