              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-yoshi-birdo-baby-2000662854"><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a> <span>is coming out in April, and naturally it’s getting novelty popcorn buckets like every other movie in theaters these days.

And my guy looks like he is zooted out of his goddamn mind.</span></p> <p><span>Images of the popcorn bucket started circulating today ahead of any official announcement. You can see Yoshi holding one of his trademark eggs, but he also is giving the kind of thousand-yard stare usually reserved for people who ate an entire bowl of brownies without realizing they’re loaded with pot. He’s staring into the </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span> and holding onto that egg like it’s grounding him to reality. It’s currently rumored that this container will be available at AMC, Cinemark, and Regal theaters, but we’re still waiting on an official announcement.</span></p>

We still don’t know who’s voicing Yoshi in the sequel, but he sounds pretty much as cute as you’d expect him to in the trailers. Other newcomers include Brie Larson as Rosalina and Benny Safdie as Bowser Jr. Birdo appeared in one of the more recent trailers as well, but we haven’t heard her speak yet.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-devs-know-safeguard-has-problems-and-are-looking-into-it-2000668703</link>
            <guid>1435834</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over a decade ago, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em> introduced a new multiplayer game mode to the franchise: <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Safeguard_(game_mode)">Safeguard</a>. This team-based mode had players pushing and defending a walking robot from another team tasked with stopping it. It was very good. But the mode’s last appearance in a main game was in 2018. So I was over the moon to see the mode return as part of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s second season. And while I have some issues with it, Safeguard is still a lot of fun in 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Booting up Safeguard in the new season of <em>COD: BLOPS7</em></a> was like returning to an old friend’s house after years away to hang out. Something I’ve always appreciated about the mode was how it gave the defense a way to fight back that wasn’t just “Kill the other team.” You can instead focus your damage on the robot, and if you do enough, it will stop moving and have to reboot. This gives less skilled players a way to help without having to hunt down highly skilled <em>COD</em> pros each match. It also leads to an interesting dynamic where a defending team can over-focus on taking out the bot and let the attackers flank them and wipe them out. But focus too much on the attackers, and the bot will walk its way into the checkpoint, and you’ll lose before you realize it.</p>

  <p>This time around, the robot you are defending is a four-legged Boston Dynamics-like mechanical dog. The bots were previously bipedal humanoids, which was fine, but I’m far more into guarding a robo dog than a random mechanical man. But it felt to me as if this robot dog might be moving faster than the past bots had in Safeguard. So I talked to the devs behind the mode, and they confirmed that, no, the bot is moving at a “pace consistent with previous” versions of Safeguard.</p> <p>However, “<em>BO7</em>’s tighter map layouts, updated pathing, and the new animation set can make its movement feel faster, even though the underlying speed hasn’t changed much,” said a Treyarch spokesperson. They also confirmed they are looking at data to decide if the bot should move a bit slower.</p>

 <p>Another issue with the current version of Safeguard in <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that you can sometimes win, but still lose. Basically, the game mode is built around how fast you get the bot to the checkpoint. Each team gets a shot at pulling this off. If the first team does it in let’s say two minutes, then the other team goes, and if they get the bot there in two minutes and three seconds, <a href="https://youtu.be/LegP5qViODY">they’ll lose despite the bot making it to the checkpoint</a>. This feels bad, and Treyarch tells me they are looking into this.</p>

 <p>“We’re evaluating options to end the second round early in situations where the attacking team hasn’t pushed the Robot far enough in time,” Treyarch told <em>Kotaku</em>. “And we’re looking at this alongside the broader UI improvements already in progress. Our goal is to make the rules and win conditions as clear and intuitive as possible for all players.” The team is also open to bringing back overtime, which isn’t included in Safeguard right now.</p> <p>Besides those issues, and an odd bug that let people knock the bot out with a combat axe that has already been patched, I’ve really enjoyed playing Safeguard again. I think it’s a great example of how <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s gunplay can be incredibly successful in modes that aren’t simply about killing each other.</p>

 <p>I hope the mode sticks around past season two and, like Kill Confirmed and other fan favorites, return in future <em>Call of Duty</em> games. You don’t even have to have a robot for this mode to work. If the next <em>Call of Duty</em> isn’t set in the future but instead WW2 or something, fine, use a jeep. That would still let me enjoy this mode with my friends, even those who aren’t great at FPS games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Rovio's performance "fell significantly short of initial forecast"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a8a7a553b8c1b"><a title="Sonic Angry Birds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8a7a553b8c1b/sonic-angry-birds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA Sammy has published its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf">Q3 2025/26 financial report</a>, and it's a pretty mixed bag for the multimedia giant, with losses reported in multiple different areas.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest piece of news comes from Rovio's side of the business. Sega acquired the Angry Bird developer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/its-official-sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio">in 2023</a> Sega reports has fallen "significantly short of initial forecast due to rapid changes in the market environment and other factors".</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_forecast_e.pdf">reported an impairment loss</a> of ¥30.4 billion ($198.6 million), citing increased competition and the rapid deterioration of user bases. This meant that "Rovio found it difficult to advance its initially planned business development".</p>
<p>A number of titles haven't met Sega's own internal targets, with development delays and cancellations also a factor. <strong>Sonic Rumble</strong>, the mobile game which Rovio co-developed, also fell short of expectations, particularly around customer acquisition.</p>
<p>It's not just with Rovio, though — while net sales remain steady and are 4% up year-on-year, operating income and ordinary income are both down, 54.6% and 51.8% respectively. Entertainment Contents has also dropped 31%.</p>
<p>Sega only reports two full game releases for the third quarter: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on Switch 2, and <strong>Football Manager 26</strong>, the latter of which needed "a series of updates to address post-launch bugs, etc. and improved the gameplay environment". And in general, full game titles have reported "stagnant growth".</p>

<p>It's not all bad news, though: Sega is planning to release "four major new titles for mainstay IPs" next financial year, with a continued focus on expanding the trans-media business (movies, TV shows, merch, etc.). Daniel Svärd, once King's head of live game studios, will be appointed as Rovio's COO.</p>
<p>All in all, not a great showing for the company, and Sega has revised its net sales expectations to rise slightly — ¥490 billion / $3.2 billion, up from ¥475 billion / $3.1 billion — while operating income expectations have been lowered to ¥40 billion / $261.5 million, from ¥53 billion / $346.6 million.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> has <em>just</em> launched, and that will be included in the final report for the fiscal year ending March 2026. So that may help turn the tides a little. And 2026 marks the 35th anniversary for the Sonic series, so the future should be blue — in a good way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Adds the Ability to Attach Your PC Specs to Steam Reviews]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-adds-ability-attack-pc-specs-steam-reviews/</link>
            <guid>1435807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that user-submitted <strong>Steam Reviews</strong> have often been <strong>quite controversial</strong>, especially during so-called "<strong>review bombings</strong>". In these instances, specific games have been targeted with a deluge of negative reviews, thus <strong>crashing the overall user review score</strong> on Valve's platform.</p>



<p>One of the earliest scenarios was the review bombing of <strong>Firewatch</strong>, <strong>Campo Santo</strong>'s acclaimed adventure game released in 2016. The following year, YouTuber <strong>PewDiePie</strong> <strong>racially insulted a player</strong> during a livestream in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (<strong>PUBG</strong>), and Campo Santo's founder <strong>Sean Vanaman</strong> asked YouTube to remove all of PewDiePie's videos from the platform. However, in retaliation, PewDiePie's legion of followers went en masse on Steam to <a href="https://wccftech.com/firewatch-negative-reviews-pewdiepie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leave negative reviews on Firewatch</a>.</p>



<p>Just a week after the controversy, Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-histograms-help-review-bombing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added histograms to user-submitted Steam Reviews</a> to help them make sense of these situations. However, review bombings continued:</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2018, SEGA's <strong>Total War: Rome II</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/tw-rome-ii-review-bombed-female-generals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got review bombed</a> <strong>due to the presence in the game of too many female generals</strong></li>



<li>In 2020, CAPCOM's <strong>Monster Hunter World</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-world-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-racist-joke-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a temporary blast of negative reviews</a> from Chinese players following what they perceived to be <strong>a racist joke in the Monster Hunter movie</strong></li>



<li>In 2023, Blizzard's <strong>Diablo IV</strong> was <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-is-already-being-review-bombed-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately review bombed when it launched on Steam</a>, with many user reviews blatantly criticizing the studio <strong>without even touching the game's actual content</strong></li>



<li>In 2024, Sony Santa Monica's <strong>God of War: Ragnarök</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was briefly the target of a review bombing</a> when Sony still required users to register for a PlayStation account to play single player games</li>
</ul>



<p>That said, in some instances, negative Steam reviews <strong>can be helpful to the developer if they point out actual problems with the game</strong>. One such scenario is whenever there are performance issues. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">With the latest Steam Client Beta</a>, Valve has introduced the "<strong>option to attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page</strong>", which could be really useful for developers as they diagnose performance problems mentioned in their game's Steam reviews. </p>



<p>The new Steam Client Beta also introduced another option: to send "<strong>anonymized frame rate data</strong>" to Valve. This data will be stored "without connection to your Steam account, but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on." Valve claims <strong>it will help them improve Steam and overall game compatibility</strong>, with a focus on devices running <strong>SteamOS</strong>.</p>

From rhythm games where you wiggle around on </span><a href="https://scrape.nugget.fun/"><span>a real skateboard</span></a><span> to games where you smack </span><a href="https://www.dachu-interactive.com/how-to-pet-your-cat"><span>a giant stuffed animal cat butt</span></a><span>, the world of weird controllers is awesome and underrated. Luckily, a brand new type of alt control is getting some well-deserved love.</span></p> <p><span>Streamer Perri Karyal is </span><a href="https://youtu.be/rIbfNUA5pWk?si=ZHmAQQDUcdhWQfk2"><span>known</span></a><span> for making alt controls that allow her to play games using her brain—but what if it were the other way around? What if a game could control a player?</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, Karyal </span><a href="https://x.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?s=20"><span>posted</span></a><span> a video showing off exactly that. Using a process called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), which basically sends signals to the part of your ear canal that’s responsible for your sense of balance, Karyal was able to hook up her own body to a controller.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can control your balance</p> <p>I made a device that sends DC current through my head to stimulate my vestibular nerve (called galvanic vestibular stimulation or GVS) and, in doing so, can make me feel completely destabilised. By changing the direction of the current, it can make me… <a href="https://t.co/XNH0EtRow6">pic.twitter.com/XNH0EtRow6</a></p> <p>— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“By changing the direction of the current, it can make me fall in that direction,” she explains. The video shows Karyal running in a straight line — until a person shifts a joystick to the left, which causes her to veer to the left, too.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Karyal proceeded to use the tech to simulate G forces while playing Ubisoft’s 2020 racing game </span><i><span>Trackmania.</span></i><span> In the video, she sways from side to side in tandem with her digital car, to dizzying effect. She also reports seeing “flashing lights,” which doesn’t sound too good. The official </span><i><span>Trackmania</span></i><span> Esports account </span><a href="https://x.com/TMesports/status/2022169923741741070?s=20"><span>took notice</span></a><span> of Karyal’s experiment, calling it “awesome.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The technology that makes this possible is actually quite old. In an NBC article from 2005, journalist Yuri Kageyama </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna9816703"><span>tries out GVS</span></a><span>: “I found the experience unnerving and exhausting: I sought to step straight ahead but kept careening from side to side. Those alternating currents literally threw me off.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perri Karyal stresses not to replicate this experiment at home, as GVS isn’t very well-researched and can cause adverse effects. It’s very cool to watch someone else do it, though!</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After some teasing last week, Stern Pinball has officially unveiled its pricey <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-themed tables with a snazzy trailer. The question now is: Are you willing to pay $7,000 to fling steel balls at Meowth’s face?</p> <p>On February 13, Stern Pinball released a new trailer showing off its $7,000 <em>Pokémon</em> table, which features a large HD screen that plays clips from the anime series as well as a highly interactive playfield that includes a moving Pikachu and a Meowth balloon. Here’s the video:</p>  <p>Stern says players will be able to capture Pokémon while playing this pinball machine. And if you have a Stern account and log in via the app while playing, you’ll be able to collect Pokémon and check them out later on the app. As you’d expect from a modern pinball machine, the playfield is jam-packed with spinners, ramps, and targets to hit, all of which will cause Pikachu to react to how you’re playing.</p>

 <p>“Today we’re proud to finally deliver the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball machine,” <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">said Stern Pinball president</a> and CEO Seth Davis in a press release. “This game is a true celebration of nostalgia, craftsmanship, and the enduring adventure of Pokémon – brought to life in a whole new way through immersive pinball gameplay, thrilling battles, and the timeless excitement of catching <em>Pokémon</em>.”</p> <p>This all sounds cool, and if you find one at your local arcade or bar, it will likely be a lot of fun. However, if you want to buy one of these machines to stick in your basement or gaming room, you’ll need to drop at least $7,000 on the base model. There’s also a premium model that features different artwork, enhanced audio and visuals, and a fancier backglass, among other bonuses. Those don’t come cheap. This upgraded version will cost $9,700. Meanwhile, a limited-edition version of the table will set you back $13,000!</p>

 <p>If you can afford to grab this <em>Pokémon</em> table, first off, congrats on doing well in life. <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">And also, Stern is taking orders for its newly revealed <em>Pokémon</em> pinball machine right now on its website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Highguard </strong>is the latest free-to-play first-person shooter to hit the market, and if things keep going the way they are now, it'll also be the latest free-to-play first-person shooter that was shut down after being unable to break through as a massive hit right at launch. After its trailer at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards</a></strong> failed to land with players, and the weeks of silence that followed did nothing to help, when it arrived, before players even made it through the tutorial, <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">they were leaving negative reviews</a> on Steam.</p>



<p>Even though it had over <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/"><strong>97K</strong> concurrent players</a> on Steam when it launched, those numbers quickly dwindled, and now, barely two weeks after it launched, developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> confirmed that it had laid off several members of its staff, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">those impacted confirming that "<em>most</em>" of the studio had been cut.</a></p>



<p>One of those impacted developers, <strong>Josh Sobel</strong>, a technical artist who worked on Highguard, took to X (formerly Twitter) to write an extended reflection on how the game's launch went, what happened, and how he and several of his former colleagues are now out of a job and back looking for work in this volatile market.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After starting by discussing just how much everyone at the studio believed in the game, and how high its praise was from internal feedback, Sobel began digging into when things turned sour.</p>



<p>"<em>But then the trailer came out, and it was all downhill from there</em>," Sobel begins. "<em>Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they’ve got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not.</em>"</p>



<p>Sobel went on to discuss how he and some of his colleagues were directly targeted after making celebratory posts about the game's reveal and its subsequent launch, with a slew of hate and vitriol sent towards them. </p>



<p>"<em>They laughed at me for being proud of the game, told me to get out the McDonald’s applications, and mocked me for listing having autism in my bio, which they seemed to think was evidence the game would be 'woke trash.'"</em></p>



<p>On the topic of the game's poor marketing in its lead-up to launch, Sobel didn't directly comment because he felt it was not his place. He also made the point that we can never know if Highguard would have been received the same way, or more positively, if it hadn't gone ahead with its Game Awards trailer, or even if it had submitted a different trailer to the show. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_6tjMvckZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It should be noted that not long after user reviews on Steam began piling in, Wildlight's chief executive officer, <strong>Dusty Welch</strong>, apologized for the game's marketing up to that point and took responsibility for its "<em>poor</em>" trailer at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>"<em>Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better. Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback</em>," Welch said in an interview. "<em>I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think The Game Awards was about. We could have made something that did a better job of highlighting the unique loop of the game. So that's on us. We take that, but the team is resilient.</em>"</p>



<p>Sobel continued, digging into how the public's response to Highguard was to judge it before they had even touched it. "<em><strong>We were turned into a joke from minute one</strong>, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact</em>."</p>



<p>"<em><strong>Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival,</strong> and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and 'Titanfall 3 died for this.' </em><strong><em>At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial.</em>"</strong></p>



<p>Sobel does add that Highguard's current state is not fully the fault of the players who decided the game sucked before giving it a shot, or the subsection of the content creator economy that has been built off of negative content. But he does say that it played a role.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. <strong>All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Sobel concluded by remarking that if we keep seeing new multiplayer games get beaten out of the space by pre-conceived notions based on a bad trailer, we'll stop seeing new multiplayer projects like Highguard even get their chance. Developers will stop taking the chance on a new upstart studio looking to try something new in the triple-A space, because it's too much of a risk to put their livelihoods on the line. "<em><strong>Innovation is on life support</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Even if Highguard had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight…deserved better than this. <strong>We deserved the bare minimum of not having our downfall be gleefully manifested</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>Nothing is going to stop players from making snap decisions based on a trailer. If a game doesn't resonate with them in an instant, many are quick to categorize their feelings for that game as negative and move on, sticking with what they already know. Especially when it comes to free-to-play games, where it's understood that these games don't just want your money for cosmetics, they want to consume as much of your gaming time as possible.</p>



<p>It's up to developers to catch your eye and convince you that their game is worth investing that kind of time in. But it's also fair to say that leaving a negative review before you've finished the tutorial should not be a weight placed on any game. You might have made up your mind about the game in seconds, but that doesn't mean you can speak on its quality with any real authority. No one would pay someone any attention if they tried calling themselves a 'critic' or 'reviewer' after only playing five minutes of a game.</p>



<p>But even if Highguard didn't get lambasted with negative reviews right off the jump, it's difficult to say that it would have found success. For as big as free-to-play live service shooters are, there's a great deal of fatigue players are feeling around these games, and ones trying to enter the genre are facing the brunt of that fatigue.</p>



<p>We'll never be able to pin down one single reason Highguard's launch has gone this way, but Sobel's comments do provide insight into how developers see these launches play out from their end, and how hurtful it is to see people decide they've failed before they even started.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maestro Media has announced an official card game based on James Cameron's<em> Avatar</em>. The new game, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em>, pits players in a fast-paced battle for control of the alien world of Pandora.</p><h2>The <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> Card Game Announcement</h2><p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/61628/maestro-media-licenses-avatar-new-tabletop-game" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is an asymmetric card game designed for two players. Players take on the role of either the RDA or a faction of Na'Vi as they battle across various locations on Pandora. The core gameplay isn't a deckbuilding experience but lane-battling, similar to a MOBA. The first person to reach 30 points is declared the winner.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Maestro Media's CEO Javon Frazier explained the more asymmetric elements of the card game.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"The RDA and the Na’vi do not play the same game, and they should not. One side is focused, aggressive, and extractive. The other is adaptive, interconnected, and rooted in the land. The asymmetry is the experience. Every match becomes a tense, strategic story about control, resistance, and what it means to fight for a world worth protecting.”</p></blockquote><p><em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is the latest Maestro Media project adapting popular and beloved media properties. Their past work includes the Kickstarter campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-afternoon-rewind-kickstarter-campaign-blows-up-with-millennial-nostalgia" rel="nofollow"><em>Disney Afternoon Rewind Collection</em></a>, a board game adaptation of the mobile title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/maestro-media-announces-clash-of-clans-epic-raid-board-game-based-on-hit-mobile-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>, a tabletop adaptation of the Stanley Kubrick film, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2001-space-odyssey-board-game-tasks-you-with-outsmarting-hal-9000" rel="nofollow"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a>, and a board game based on <em>The Smurfs</em>.</p><p>Curiously, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is one of few board game adaptations of James Cameron's blockbuster films. Despite spanning three feature films dating back to 2009, Avatar has very little multimedia presence outside of a few tie-in comics. The last board game release was <em>Avatar: The Board Game</em> released by Mega Games in 2010, which currently sits at 4.8/10 on Board Game Geek.</p><p>At the time of writing, there is no release date or MSRP for <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the new tactical RPG roguelike about cat breeding, has come under a bit of fire during its launch week for its long list of voice cameos. Among </span><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/252481/mewgenics/credits/windows/"><span>the eclectic group</span></a><span> of people who do the various “meow”s in the game are a fair number of content creators, including husband-and-wife podcast hosts Ethan and Hila Klein, both of whom have expressed </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qidsNawR9TE"><span>pro-Israel views in regards to its ongoing conflict with Palestine</span></a><span>. Hila was born in Israel and was required by law to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytOl5hbTrCY"><span>serve in the Israel Defense Forces at 18,</span></a><span> albeit not in a combat role. After some criticism of their presence in the game on social media, the developers have responded.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate"><i><span>Rock Paper Shotgun</span></i></a><span>, developer Edmund McMillen explained that the giant list of meowers was accumulated over several years, with Ethan Klein’s contribution coming together four years before the game launched.</span></p> <p><span>“I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games,” McMillen told </span><i><span>RPS</span></i><span>. “As some probably noticed I was [pretty] all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This counterbalancing, as McMillen calls it, means recruiting people with different views, such as iDubbbz and Anisa Jombha, who have </span><a href="https://x.com/overzealots_/status/2018074085964575102"><span>publicly supported Palestine</span></a><span>, to balance out people like Klein. iDubbbz and Klein have been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyB85pVw-v4"><span>publicly feuding</span></a><span> after the former released a video criticizing the latter’s stance on Israel. McMillen says he contacted both parties before </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ launch to make sure they knew the other would be in the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now that </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mewgenics-has-some-problematic-meows-ethan-klein-hila-klein.1431916/"><span>gotten pushback for including Klein</span></a><span>, he says it’s “sad” that some might be “</span><span>so put off by the idea of an inclusion of someone they don’t like so much that they will never play the game,”</span><span> though he doesn’t engage with the fact that at the heart of this disagreement is a literal genocide.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial…” McMillen said, “but it felt interesting so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well, probably any of the people we included. If I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>McMillen says that someone who was bothered by a “problematic meow” would probably not enjoy </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>anyway, though he says that if you do still play the game, you can simply throw any offending cat in the trash and go about your way. </span></p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/13/konami-promises-numerous-new-castlevania-products-for-40th-anniversary</link>
            <guid>1435717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>An unexpected publisher stepped into the spotlight during <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/everything-announced-at-the-february-playstation-state-of-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2341a4a8-a8a9-4b6a-b81a-622fd5e9d7be" data-entity-substitution="canonical">yesterday's PlayStation State of Play presentation</a>. That publisher was Konami, a once-prominent developer and publisher of video games that, in recent years, has come under fire from gamers for largely neglecting its multiple iconic franchises. Yesterday's State of Play served as a reemergence party of sorts for the publisher, as the company announced multiple projects, including the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-guns-of-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3bdf4820-12c3-42a2-b7b0-cd57df1ba12d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/castlevania-belmonts-curse-made-by-konami-and-the-dead-cells-devs-launches" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f6ac4864-5c64-4c84-94d3-3d3870af84fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</a>. Fans expressed excitement after learning these iconic franchises still have pulses, and today, it would seem Castlevania may not only have a pulse, but potentially a new lease on life.</p><p>Following its block on the State of Play, Konami updated its <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/#games">Castlevania Portal Site</a> with the following message regarding Castlevania's 40th anniversary:</p><div><p>The doors of Castlevania open once more.</p><p>This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original ‘Akumajō Dracula’ first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, “Castlevania” will be revived.</p><p>First up is this title: ‘Castlevania: Belmont's Curse’.</p><p>We couldn’t think in other studios to work together rather than Evil Empire and Motion Twin, studios brimming with talent and passion, to deliver a new exploration-based 2D action game that captures the essence of Castlevania while bringing fresh innovation.</p><p>This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania.</p><p>Look forward to the return of the magnificent “nightmare” lurking in the darkness.</p><p>- Castlevania series Production Team</p></div><p>In addition to this message, Konami also released a YouTube video featuring the official Castlevania 40th anniversary logo, which plays off the key art from the original Castlevania. It also features a ton of Castlevania imagery, which could potentially hint at what's next for the franchise. You can view that video below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsIye_bWY_8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsIye_bWY_8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The last true Castlevania release arrived in 2014, with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. Since then, Castlevania has crossed over with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Vampire Survivors, and Dead Cells, but the series has been largely dormant outside of retro collections, re-releases, and cameos in other games. That will change later this year when Castlevania: Belmont's Curse arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/13/konami-promises-numerous-new-castlevania-products-for-40th-anniversary]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/diablo-iv-blood-pc-contest-interview/</link>
            <guid>1435711</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Back in 2023, a (slightly) more innocent time before Microsoft <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report/"><u>ravaged its games studios</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox/"><u>with layoffs</u></a> and made itself into <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism/"><u>a BDS priority target</u></a>, Blizzard held <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/a-gaming-pc-infused-with-real-human-blood-crowns-diablo-4s-most-unhinged-pr-stunt-yet-a-666-quart-blood-drive/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a competition</u></a>: To promote <em>Diablo IV</em>’s second season, it raffled off a PC "infused with real human blood in its liquid cooling" as part of a blood drive seeking 666 quarts of the red goop that keeps us all alive. I was desperate to know more. How much blood? Whose blood? Can blood reliably and sustainably cool a PC? And, again, <em>whose blood</em>?</p><p>At the time, answers proved elusive. Blizzard PR failed to reply to my requests for additional details, and a person I reached out to at Corsair – an expert, albeit not with regard to this particular PC – did not seem interested in discussing the infernal blood engine’s more theoretical aspects. So, dejected, I called off the hunt. But then, last week, via the replies to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jaymcastello.bsky.social/post/3mcxhgglmb22a?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a Bluesky post</u></a> by freelance writer (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/jay/"><u>occasional Aftermath contributor</u></a>) Jay Castello, I learned that the winner of the competition had semi-recently surfaced on Reddit. Once again, the game was afoot.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1krp8jo/i_won_the_blood_pc_yes_the_one_from_season_2_ama/?ref=aftermath.site">I Won The Blood PC (Yes, The One From Season 2) AMA!</a><br> by

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/?ref=aftermath.site">diablo4</a>
</blockquote>
</figure><p>Turns out, Blizzard’s diabolical blood PC went to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/storms888?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a streamer who goes by the handle Storms888</u></a>. He received it at the tail end of November 2023, and – despite or perhaps because of the blood – it’s still going strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The PC is virtually perfect,” Storms888 told Aftermath. “I haven't seen any drops in performance since the day I got it. … It’s incredible for streaming/recording. Right now I've been streaming<em> Battlefield 6 </em>at ultra settings with easily over 200+ [frames per second].”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given that pure, thick, coagulation-prone blood seems like it’d be an awful coolant, there’s probably some smoke and mirrors happening here.</p><p>“It appears that the coolant is mostly regular standard coolant and that they had added red blood cells inside of it,” said Storms888. “They did not specify what the ratio was, but it's dark red.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Storms888</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whose blood, though? Sadly, that, much like blood, is unclear.&nbsp;</p><p>"There is not [information about who exactly the blood came from]," Storms888 said. "There was a donor slip that specifically said it was a confirmed blood sample/donation, but that was all."</p><p>But OK, say something goes wrong, or the blood-tinged coolant loses its luster, as all things do with time? Don’t worry: Blizzard thought of that.</p><p>“[Blizzard] did not specify any need to replace it,” said Storms888, “although they did give me a replacement vial/bottle of blood. ... This did leak a ton though. I had to put the bottle in a separate bag.”</p><p>For reasons that probably should be obvious by now, upgrading the blood PC is out of the question.</p><p>“I have not upgraded it,” said Storms888, “and yes, the custom nature of it does play a role. I don't want to change any aspect of it for the novelty factor – would love to give this to my future kids some day – as well as the technical limitations, since the CPU and GPU have custom water blocks mounted on them, and I'm not experienced with messing with those.”</p><p>But Storms888 also doesn’t think he’ll need to start thinking about buying a boring, bloodless PC any time soon.</p><p>“I will keep using it until a [Nvidia] 4090 [graphics card] and [Intel] 14900k [processor] are no longer serviceable for modern games. So I assume at least for the next 7-10 years,” he joked. “Overall I am still shocked to this day that I won it. The majority of my life I've had absolutely terrible computers. … This genuinely has been a life-changing experience, and it's opened up so many doors for me professionally with streaming.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs/"><div><p>Diablo Devs Unionize Following Layoffs And Dissatisfaction With AI, Pay - Aftermath</p><p>Workers on Diablo are the latest arm of Blizzard to unionize, joining the teams behind Overwatch and World of Warcraft before them.</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

 <h2><b>Domina</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Barrier Array</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Barrier Panel Health reduced from 250 to 225</span></p> <h2><b>Anran</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Zhuque Fans</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Impact damage increased from 20 to 22.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Fan the Flames</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Impact damage now uses beam damage against armor mitigation (Only reduced by 30% when used on armor).</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Inferno Rush</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Can now be canceled with quick melee.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ignition – Passive</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Burning build up linger time increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</span></p> <h2><b>Emre</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Synthetic Burst Rifle – Take Aim</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Falloff range increased from 30-45 to 35-50 meters.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Cyber Frag</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Explosion damage minimum radius increased from 1.25 to 2 meters.</span></p> <h2><b>Jetpack Cat</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Frenetic Flight</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Regeneration rate reduced from 30 to 25.</span></p> <h2><b>Mizuki</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Spirit Glaive</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Cast time reduced from 0.1 to 0.025 seconds.</span></p> <p><span>Recovery time increased from 0.7 to 0.75 seconds.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Healing Kasa</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Range increased from 25 to 30 meters.</span></p> <p><span>Default soft targeting range increased from 8 to 10 degrees.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ultimate</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Ultimate cost increased by 7%.</span></p> <p><span>Now heals for 100 instant healing on cast.</span></p> <h2><b>Vendetta</b></h2> <p><span>Siphoning Strike – Minor Perk</span></p> <p><span>Lifesteal reduced from 40% to 30%.</span></p>

<p>Head back to the spooky Nitemare Island and check out the Friday the 13th-themed skins that have returned to Fortnite for the weekend.</p>



<p>Fortnite announced on social media that Nitemare Island would return to Reload, the Battle Royale-themed mode that launched in 2024. Along with that, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers are back in the game, in skins for the time being.</p>



<p>Nitemare Island originally debuted in October 2025 and was the fifth Reload map. Epic says that you have until 9:00 a.m. ET on Monday, February 16, to jump back into the Halloween-themed map. What a great weekend for Valentine’s Day.</p>

<h2 id="h-news-on-future-fortnite-collabs">News on Future Fortnite Collabs</h2>



<p>Just like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Fortnite has collaborated with numerous IPs to create a truly unique, if not outright bizarre, gaming experience. Right next to Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, you can also purchase SpongeBob SquarePants. Looking for a Jam track? There are plenty of choices from Chapell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, but you can also choose Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz.</p>







<p>Recently, it was announced that Overwatch, which is undergoing a resurgence, would be part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-overwatch-crossover-brings-genji-tracer-d-va/" id="175954">a future Fortnite collaboration</a>. Kingdom Hearts is also planned for release on the popular free-to-play game.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/girls-frontline-2-exilium-announces-strong-new-dolls-and-free-rewards-coming-in-next-patch</link>
            <guid>1435684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Girls Frontline 2: Exilium recently revealed the new content that’s coming in its next patch on February 19, and there’s a lot. The headliners are two new T-Dolls, Alva and Voymastina, the latter of which is the strongest Doll in the game. Alva will arrive on February 19, and Voymastina will arrive on March 12. On top of that, there’s new story content, limited-time outfits and events, and lots of free rewards.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New T-Dolls Join the Fray</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Alva, the dependable leader of Task Force DEFY, is the first new Doll to join the roster. Though reserved in demeanor, she is fiercely protective of her squad. She’s a Support-class Doll and excels at providing powerful shields and enhancing team survivability, making her a natural fit for shield-focused teams. With her signature weapon, 6P33, she increases the critical damage of Freeze-based allies and further amplifies the damage of shielded units, turning defense into offense. She synergizes particularly well with Robella, creating a 1+1&gt;2 effect, and her arrival marks the full realization of shield-centric Freeze teams.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/alva-kv-update-1770923971757.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new story content, called Corposant, will be released in three parts on February 19, February 26, and March 12. It features CG animations and delivers an experience comparable to a visual novel, with more than 100,000 English words. When the final chapter launches on March 12, it will also introduce the highly anticipated new Doll Voymastina, who is officially recognized as the strongest second-generation Doll in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Codenamed “White Mastiff,” Voymastina is a physical-team core damage dealer who specializes in defense-ignoring capabilities, delivering massive physical damage through both active and support attacks. Her exclusive effect, Predator’s Principle, boosts burst damage, while Eye of the White Mastiff enables sustained offensive pressure. Debuting alongside her is the Elite assault rifle 6P71 (Medium Ammo), Voymastina’s imprinted signature weapon, designed to complete her combat profile and reinforce her role as a top-tier damage dealer.
</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/voymastina-kv-available-on-12-march-1770924024983.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Free Goodies on the Way</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch will add lots of new free rewards, led by the ability to earn 55+ pulls, 11,000+ Collapse Pieces, an Elite Doll (Balthilde), and a Commander outfit during the themed Corposant event that launches February 19.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, there are multiple upcoming log-in events that can score you additional goodies. Starting February 19, you can log in to receive 10 Targeted Access Permissions (which are used to pull for characters) and sign in to receive another 10. And another event starts March 12, where you can get an additional 10. Also starting February 19, you can get one reward mail every week, each containing one Access Permission, 100 Collapse Pieces (which can be used to get more Targeted Access Permissions), and 100 Next-Gen Memory Sticks (which can be used to increase your affinity with individual Dolls).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From February 19 to April 1, the limited-time Splash Bash event introduces a PK-style gameplay mode featuring interactive matchups between Dolls and players. There’s streamlined gameplay guidance and stage-clearing tips, making the mode a light but competitive change of pace. And you can unlock the exclusive Commander outfit Leisurely Heat by participating.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/splash-bash-gameplay-1770924061482.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of all this, the upcoming patch will also add limited-time discounts on three new outfits: Alva - Antje, Lenna - Flying Phantom, and Nikketa - Night on the Silver Bay. And there will be a new permanent gameplay mode called Ashen Tales in Artifact Recovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, Girls Frontline 2: Exilium will continue to release more new content in the future. In the next six months, you can expect extensive story updates, new gameplay modes, new Dolls and outfits, and collaborations with other major IPs.
