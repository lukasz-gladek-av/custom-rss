            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, during the <strong>Embracer Group</strong>'s <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q3-october-december-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-528-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q3 FY 2025/26 report</a> (October-December 2025), it was revealed that <strong>Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong> game has sold <strong>more than five million units</strong> <strong>in its first year on the market</strong>.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II originally debuted on <strong>February 4, 2025</strong>, so it's been roughly a year and eight days since its release. The historical first-person open world action roleplaying game enjoyed an excellent reception; on Wccftech, reviewer Chris Wray <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awarded it a rare perfect score</a></strong> and waxed plenty of praise upon the latest work of the Czech studio:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>



<p>The game also <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to beat Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> in the Best RPG category of the Wccftech Awards '25</strong>, with our staff and readers aligning on this view.</p>



<p>Throughout the year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <strong>was updated with free patches and three premium DLCs</strong>, the last of which, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mysteria Ecclesiae</a></strong>, did particularly well, helping the game perform <strong>"well ahead" of the Embracer Group's expectations</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the financial report, the <strong>Dead Island</strong> and <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> IPs also performed better than estimates in the quarter. Even so, net sales <strong>decreased by 26%</strong> year-over-year, and organic growth <strong>also decreased by 8%</strong>. This decline was primarily driven by negative foreign exchange effects and the divestment of Easybrain within the Mobile segment. </p>



<p>Still, Embracer Group CEO <strong>Phil Rogers</strong> stressed that the company is going in the right direction: focusing on its core IPs (Tomb Raider, Dead Island, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and, of course, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-needs-to-be-turned-into-one-of-gamings-biggest-franchises-says-embracer-coo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings</a></strong>) while targeting a reduction in both opex and capex and completing its consolidation goals (they recently <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold Arc Games and Cryptic Studios</a></strong>). Let's just hope this doesn't mean new layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’ve almost made it to the end of the week, but let us know in the comments how your NYT Connections streak is keeping up. Are you in double digits? Triple? Regardless of where you’re at, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need below to keep pushing that count up!</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections answers as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<li>FAST</li>



<li>FORM</li>



<li>DRAG</li>



<li>FIRM</li>



<li>MOLD</li>



<li>TIGHT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Ways to build things</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Stuck in place</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Abbreviate MLB teams and players</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that could go before ‘queen’</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 12:</p>

<p>Very well!</p>

            <p>Just weeks after release, an unspecified number of Wildlight's Highguard development team has been laid off.</p>
<p>The studio's live-service hero shooter will not be shut down, Wildlight has confirmed to Eurogamer, but instead be given to a "core group of developers" to keep the game going.</p>

<p>In the statement shared with Eurogamer this morning, Wildlight wrote: "Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game."</p>
<p>The Highguard studio added it is "proud of the team, talent, and the product" it had created. "We're also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community," Wildlight concluded.</p><p>While Wildlight did not say how many members were affected by today's layoffs, posts on the likes of LinkedIn suggest it was the majority of the team. "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">level designer Alex Graner wrote</a>. "This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard."</p>
<p>Tech artist Josh Sobel was also impacted by the Wildlight layoffs. "It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before," <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097">Sobel wrote</a>. "I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ yrs for anything."</p>
<p>In a follow up post, Sobel said they had "LOVED working at Wildlight", and it is now "hard to envision going up from here", likening today's news to the end of a romantic relationship. "You can't think about dating right after a breakup. It wasn't just a gig to me. 2.5yrs of working towards a promising, rose-tinted future, with the most passionate and efficient devs on the planet. We fucking MADE THAT SHIT! Fast."</p>

<p>"I don't think gamers really understand just how special this group of talented devs was. There were stumbles, as any new team would face, but our ability to execute on goals and pivot at a moment's notice was unmatched. I am devastated that this team as a complete unit can no longer be," Sobel continued.</p><p>"We accomplished a lot, and I couldn't be more proud. But it's hard to believe it's over. Hard to believe that this was the result of all our efforts. I wish the best of luck to everyone who remains at Wildlight.</p>
<p>"If the numbers climb, I'll be the first in line to apply again."</p>
<p>"I join my incredible Wildlight teammates in having been laid off," Highguard's social and community lead <a href="https://x.com/alex_frostwolf/status/2021745874435813748">Alex Frostwolf also shared</a>. "Highguard is the story of us: a group of talented, like-minded folks on an adventure into the unknown. Much like our Wardens who get back up after losing a fight, we too will rise again for our next adventures."</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Since its slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

<p>"Pokopia was a huge surprise"</p>

<figure data-uuid="5880f3ba02a93"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5880f3ba02a93/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>This March, Pokémon is expanding beyond its usual battle roots with a brand-new game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> that seems to include a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>If the information and trailers shared about the game haven't already sold you, maybe the previews will. Here's what our staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say about this upcoming Pokémon title, and below this, you can see what other sites said, based on their own hands on impressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, despite going in with the lowest of the low expectations, Pokopia was a huge surprise... It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvjuzqs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57586-hands-on-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-the-series-coziest-game-yet">GoNintendo</a>: "It’s hard to predict whether or not a Pokémon spinoff will turn into something beloved or have a real lasting impact, but I think Pokopia has what it takes to get there. It provides an opportunity for fans to interact with some of their favorite creatures in a very different, more relaxed way, without a battle in sight. Die-hard Pokémon fans and anyone who’s become enamored with cozy life sims over the last few years should keep Pokémon Pokopia"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/90-minutes-with-pokemon-pokopia-convinced-me-this-could-be-the-biggest-cozy-game-since-animal-crossing-and-im-already-eager-to-spend-hundreds-of-hours-in-it/">GamesRadar+</a>: "90 minutes. That's all it took to convince me that Pokemon Pokopia is going to take over my life. This cozy, Animal Crossing-flavored take on my favorite creature-collecting series is packing a real punch – moreish exploration, building, and collection mechanics combined with delightful personality and a generous dose of feel-good: even from a short preview session, this is a game I can see myself sinking hundreds of hours into."</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a>: "Put simply, this is <em>Pokémon</em> meets <em>Minecraft</em>, with a delightfully goofy premise and the potential for lots of town-building fun to be had either by yourself or with a group of friends via online play."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-preview-hands-on-best-entry-years-731895-20260211">Gamingbible</a>: "I barely feel as if I’ve scratched the surface of discovering what <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> has to offer and yet, I’m entirely sold on its vision. This isn’t simply a formulaic cosy game with a Pokémon overlay. It’s a really wonderfully considered creation that’s as accessible to diehard fans as it is to complete and utter novices. I haven’t stopped thinking about <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> ever since I heard the dreaded words “time’s up”, so I certainly know what I’ll be picking up come 5 March."</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/11/gotta-house-em-all">Game Informer</a>: "Pokémon spin-offs are very hit or miss for me, but after playing a bit of Pokopia, my gut says this one will be a hit. It balances the aesthetic and accessibility of Pokémon with open-ended, relaxed mechanics found in cozy simulation games, and it does so without feeling boring or overly simple. I'm looking forward to playing the final product when it launches in just a few weeks."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“They’re Gonna Freak Out at BlizzCon”: Blizzard Road to BlizzCon Starts by Adding Warlocks to Diablo IV, Immortal, and Diablo II: Resurrected]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-diablo-ii-resurrected-diablo-immortal-warlock-class-blizzard-blizzcon/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> hosted its final spotlight announcement in its <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">flurry of spotlight showcases</a> over the past two weeks with the <strong><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243862/catch-up-on-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight?_gl=1*1cph9zv*_gcl_au*MzgxMDg5NjM0LjE3NzAyMzQyMjQ.*_ga*MTM2NDczNzMwMi4xNzY4MjM1Nzgw*_ga_VYKNV7C0S3*czE3NzA4NzAyMDgkbzUkZzEkdDE3NzA4NzEyNzYkajU2JGwwJGgw">Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight</a></strong>, a peek into everything coming to the <strong>Diablo</strong> franchise in the coming milestone year. Like previous spotlights for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-dropping-the-2-overwatch-2-is-now-just-called-overwatch-moving-forward/">Overwatch,</a></strong> and <strong>Hearthstone</strong>, plenty was left off today's agenda to be revealed at <strong>BlizzCon 2026</strong>. But we now know of one major element that's coming to <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, <strong>Diablo Immortal</strong>, and <strong>Diablo II: Resurrected</strong>: <strong>Warlocks.</strong></p>



<p>The Warlock class is being added to all three aforementioned titles, the most significant of which perhaps is its inclusion in Diablo II: Resurrected, since this is the first new playable class Diablo II has gotten in <strong>25 years</strong>. Each game is getting its own version of a Warlock class, though the only version that's currently playable right now, is the one in Diablo II: Resurrected. That update was shadow-dropped as part of today's spotlight, which you can check out in full below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnAsWN-6hvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It was a tight <strong>39 minutes</strong> of news and reveals for the long-running action RPG franchise, capped off with Diablo IV game director <strong>Brent Gibson</strong> teasing that players will <em>"freak</em>" when they reveal more of what's coming at BlizzCon 2026, though the video comically cuts before he spoils the surprise.</p>



<p>As for what is coming to the franchise, starting with Diablo II: Resurrected, which saw its Warlock go live today, this remaster of one of the most beloved action-RPG titles ever doesn't just get a new class for the first time in over two decades. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Diablo II: Resurrected | Warlock Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vKwWWzC5iQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That change is why Blizzard will still keep the vanilla, sans-Warlock version of Diablo II: Resurrected available for those who want it. That means when you boot up Diablo II: Resurrected, you'll be given the option of jumping into the game that Blizzard released in 2021, or <strong>Diablo II: Reign of the Warlock</strong>.</p>



<p>Reign of the Warlock is a new paid expansion for Diablo II: Resurrected, which will cost you <strong>$25</strong> if you want to check out the first new class to arrive in Diablo II for 25 years. At least several of the updates mentioned in the spotlight today aren't behind a paywall, with the main draw being the new class.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Diablo IV | Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3HIeWxW2sJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Players can also enjoy updated terror zones, the introduction of <strong>Colossal Ancients</strong>, new quality-of-life updates like new loot filters and updated stash tabs, the introduction of The Chronicle to keep better track of your loot, and new items and runewords.</p>



<p>Diablo Immortal players will have the wait the longest to get their hands on the Warlock class, as it's not scheduled to arrive until sometime in <strong>June 2026.</strong> For now, the studio did reveal a roadmap for the full year, with new quests, gear, bosses, new endgame PvE challenges, zone events, subzones, and more, all set to arrive before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Lastly, Diablo IV players also have some waiting to do to learn more about the Warlock they'll be getting to play as when the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred-expansion-release-date/">Lord of Hatred</a></strong> expansion arrives on <strong>April 28, 2026.</strong> Blizzard will host another spotlight event on <strong>March 5, 2026,</strong> which will be digging into the Warlock class, showcasing its strength and abilities in action.</p>



<p>The new expansion will also include a reignited endgame experience with the introduction of <strong>War Plans</strong>, which lets you decide what kind of endgame you want. You'll be able to create a playlist of activities based on what you want to do, choosing from six endgame modes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Pit</li>



<li>Infernal Hordes</li>



<li>Heltides</li>



<li>Nightmare Dungeons</li>



<li>Lair Bosses</li>



<li>Kurast Undercity</li>
</ul>



<p>Depending on what rewards you hope to return with and what kind of experience you want, you'll curate your endgame between five of those options, earning progression points in a unique endgame skill tree. Diablo IV will also get a new "<em>hyper-rare</em>" endurance event, <strong>Echoing Hatred</strong>, which bombards you with enemy waves until you die, earning more and better loot the longer you can survive.</p>

            <guid>1433191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's happened again. <strong>Highguard</strong>, the latest free-to-play live service first-person shooter to enter the fray, this time from developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment,</strong> a team made up of former <strong>Apex Legends</strong> and <strong>Titanfall 2</strong> developers, launched just two weeks ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/">January 26, 2026.</a></strong> Today, <strong>February 11, 2026,</strong> a little more than two weeks since launch, the studio confirmed it had a round of <strong>layoffs.</strong></p>



<p>Individual developers across multiple branches, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427501095955914752/?ref=aftermath.site">principal</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427500304054693890/?ref=aftermath.site">senior</a> members of staff, shared the news on their LinkedIn accounts before the studio made a statement of its own on the official Wildlight Entertainment X (formerly Twitter) account.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game</em>," the studio's statement begins. "<em>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful for our players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be part of our community</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful…</p></div>— Wildlight Entertainment (@WildlightEnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Though Wildlight doesn't provide an exact figure, at least two of the developers who shared they had been impacted described it as "<em><strong>most</strong></em><strong>"<em> </em></strong>of the team getting cut, with all of their statements really driving home the tragedy of the situation.</p>



<p>"<em>Today I was laid off from my job at Wildlight along with most of the staff</em>," writes lead tech artist, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427497173774225409/?ref=aftermath.site">Josh Sobel</a></strong>. "<em>It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before. I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ years for anything. <strong>I'm still spinning</strong>, and I won't be in a place to start thinking about the future for a while, but please keep me in mind if, in the near future, you're looking for a senior or higher level rigger</em>."</p>



<p>It's clear that Highguard did not land how Wildlight wanted it to. The studio leadership's decision to slot it into <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> with a trailer that, unfortunately, did not properly convey what the game is to players, followed by complete silence, into an attempt at making it a shadow-dropped hit left players with nothing but confusion going into it and a skeptical approach when servers were turned on.</p>



<p>Once the game was live and a few of the game's more glaring cracks were shown, those who tuned in at launch dropped it like a lead balloon. The studio's leaders <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">apologized for how the launch was handled</a> while players on Steam were relentless, showering Highguard with negative reviews.</p>



<p>To the studio's credit, it acted quickly to try and address player feedback, <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412">adding a 5v5 mode</a> to ratchet up the intensity as players complained about boring matches, but that hasn't turned things around fast enough for Wildlight's leadership and bean counters. The only thing that has changed about Highguard in an instant is the size of the team working on it, which ultimately only makes it more difficult for the studio to try and put a better foot forward than what they brought to launch.</p>



<p>Sobel isn't the only one who describes their team or their time at Wildlight with such high praise, and it all makes you wonder why this keeps happening. Why studios are spun up and formed in a way that is continually deemed to be unsustainable without serious cuts to the only thing of real value a new studio has: its team.</p>



<p>It's not impossible for Wildlight to turn things around. We've seen studios do it before. But it is now beyond tiring to still see studios invest so much effort, time, and money in games where everything rests on the hope that it'll be the next <strong>Fortnite</strong>, and if it doesn't hit that mark right away, cut to plan B of laying off as many people as possible and hope you can become the next <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-remnant-update-adds-gravity-manipulation/">No Man's Sky</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Diablo 4’s Lord of Hatred DLC overhauls skill trees, adds talismans, the Horadric Cube, and introduces long-awaited loot filters.</p>



<p>During the 30th-anniversary Diablo presentation on February 11, it was announced that the Warlock class was coming to 3 Diablo games, including Diablo 4.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was announced that major updates would overhaul parts of Diablo 4, with the Lord of Hatred update coming in April. One of those updates is a major change to how skill trees work.</p>



<p>The team even joked about hearing players call skill trees “skill twigs,” but that is coming to an end.</p>



<p>“We’re adding new customization options to every single skill across the entire tree,” they revealed. “It isn’t just a small tweak, it’s a major disruption to the current class system.”</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-skill-tree-updates-are-coming-to-every-class-in-diablo-4">Skill Tree Updates Are Coming to Every Class in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>It was stated that every class will receive skill tree updates with more than 40 choices and over 80 additional options. Those who purchased the Lord of Hatred DLC will have 20 additional transformative skill options.</p>



<p>Plus, they’re introducing talismans, which will add even more adjustments to your characters. The DLC is also introducing the Horadric Cube, another way to continue shaping your endgame journey. They also excitedly announced that loot filters are finally being added to give players more control over their items.</p>

<p>If you plan on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> on the Switch 2 this week, be ready for a day one update bumping the new software up to Version 1.0.1.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68671">official patch notes</a> on Nintendo's support page, the development team has apparently addressed "several issues" to "improve the gameplay experience". However, it doesn't specify what exactly has been updated. If we find out what has changed, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Perhaps, more importantly, this launch update is required to access the game's Switch Online features. Once you've updated to this version, you'll no longer be able to play locally or via LAN with older versions of the game - so make sure you are running the same update when playing together with family and friends.</p><div><figure data-videoid="R703wKSF5X4" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytR703wKSF5X4" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8b0932wmzqpk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As our reviewer PJ O'Reilly mentioned in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever review</a>, the main adventure mode is a bit of a letdown, and solo players don't have a lot of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come. So you'll want to get online play up and running!</p>

<p>As part of this launch, Nintendo has also released a new set of Mario Tennis Fever Switch Online icons today. New waves will be available every week until <strong>11th March 2026</strong>. These icons will set you back <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong> each, and as usual, the borders and backgrounds go for <strong>5 Platinum Points</strong> each.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/love-and-deepspace-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virtual-dating-game</link>
            <guid>1433134</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace is a virtual boyfriend game (also known as an otome game) where you play as a character who fights monster aliens while five men fight for her love. It's available to download on iOS and Android and works on the old free-to-play, gacha mechanic. The ultimate aim is to build your relationships with one, two, or all of the men (we listen and we don't judge) by interacting with them, fighting alongside them, texting them, completing their storylines and even… playing with claw machines to collect plushies. It was developed by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/papergames"><u>Papergames</u></a>, which is also the studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-review"><u>Infinity Nikki</u></a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What's the plot of Love and Deepspace?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You know how it goes, a Deepspace Tunnel opens up and suddenly alien monsters are causing havoc. As the main character living in 2034, in the fictional Linkon City, it's your job to battle these alien monsters as part of an organisation called the Hunters Association. The Hunters all wield a special ability called an Evol and yours is Resonance, one that works alongside other Evol wielders' to boost their skills. Throw in a shady biotech company called EVER, an organized crime syndicate called Onychinus, the Farspace Fleet, medical experiments and secrets a plenty, and you've got the storyline that makes the average love story look like child's play. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Who are the men of Love and Deepspace?</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Men of Love And Deepspace</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five potential love interests in Love and Deepspace. Each has a different personality and storyline, but the one thing they all have in common is being obsessed with you. You can choose to focus on just one or play the field, and while they are mentioned in each other's storylines, they don't interact directly. Each has a specific Evol (think superpower) and multiple storylines that take place in both the modern day and in different lifetimes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Light spoiler warnings ahead, although the non-linear way in which you unlock memories means piecing the storylines together is more of a puzzle than a straight path. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Xavier</strong> - Fights alongside you as a Hunter, gentle and caring, is actually a time traveller from the future. His Evol is light. </li><li><strong>Zayne</strong> - A cardiac surgeon with a grumpy outer shell but a sweet toothed gooey middle. His Evol is ice. </li><li><strong>Rafayel</strong> - A sensitive, pouty artist who hates cats and is actually one of the last survivors of an ancient race called the Lemurians. His Evol is fire. </li><li><strong>Sylus</strong> - Powerful and strategic, with distinctive silver hair and red eyes, Sylus is the leader of the crime syndicate called Onychinus. His Evol is Energy.</li><li><strong>Caleb</strong> - The main character's adoptive brother, and a Farspace Fleet pilot. Protective and possessive, he was one thought dead, but returned as a Colonel in the Farspace Fleet. His Evol is Gravity.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What are the mechanics in Love and Deepspace?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a whole bunch of mechanics in Love and Deepspace, and all of them contribute to your relationship with the different male characters. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Combat</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You take on different combat challenges in the storyline to progress, and regular activities like bounty hunts or Hunter training to earn rewards. You're always paired with one of the male characters, and your choice of special attacks will depend on their Evol. Players have the option to set combat to an auto mode where the battle plays out without your input.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Texts and phonecalls</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll receive texts from each of the men at various points, and you're giving a selection of dialogue options to reply with. As your relationship increases you'll also get phone calls from them to discuss various events or check in. You can also comment on their posts on a Facebook like feed, send them emojis, and poke them.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Physical Interactions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You interact with each of the men in a setting called the Destiny Cafe. You can touch various parts of their body to elicit reactions, feel their heartbeat, or blow on your microphone.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Conversation</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Destiny cafe you can also prompt them to have different types of conversations with you. You can get them to introduce themselves to your family or friends (a great way to weird your parents out over lunch) or to suggest what you should have for breakfast. Again, the dialogue options are heavily guardrailed so this isn't going to head into AI sexbot territory. Sorry. You can also use the notebook function to ask them to set reminders for you, everything from important dates to tracking your period. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Quality Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically the world's most handsome Pomodoro timers. You can choose to Work, Workout, Study or Sleep for a set amount of time with any of the guys, and you can even do it in AR mode, so that you can reach new heights of comforting delusion by framing them in your real surroundings. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dates</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With Love and Deepspace dates you can go with the guys to try and grab plush toys at a claw machine, play a game called Kitty Cards against them, and go to a photo studio to get video or snapshots with them, or of them. You can style them, change the poses and backgrounds, and they have way more patience than any real life love interest would. In this section you can also update a personal journal with stickers and notes and photos, listen to audio recordings starring them, or access 'Falling for You' videos and visual novels content telling the story of your relationship.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Home </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent addition, this mode brings a bit of The Sims to Love and Deepspace. You have a house to decorate with new rooms unlocking as you complete activities in the home, and each of the men can spend time with you there. It's kinda cute to see badass Sylus dusting bookshelves because you've told him to do chores. There's a gardening element too, where you can grow flowers that can be used in flower arranging without or without the boy's input, and new blooms can be unlocked by hybridizing the plants. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/1-1-1770854296968.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How do the gacha mechanics work in Love and Deepspace?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genshin-impact"><u>Genshin Impact</u></a>, you can buy or earn wishes to speed up your progress in Love and Deepspace, and there's a number of in-game currencies which can be earned or bought. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here the wishes represent memories with the men of Love and Deepspace, with different rarities and values attached to each. Five star memories, for instance, can be used to experience Each memory can be upgraded with Heartsand and crystals which can be earned by taking part in bounty hunts, or completing tasks and protocores, which are collected through combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some memories are only available during special events, though those events are repeated sporadically to allow you more than one chance to grab specific wishes. Previous events have included a Star Wars style Throne of Eros storyline and Mortality's Tenderness, which has a classical Chinese theme. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, Red Dead Redemption 2, and her Love and Deepspace boyfriends. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/love-and-deepspace-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virtual-dating-game]]></content:encoded>

They’ve been shambling around, unseen, for who knows how long. And quite frankly, it gets boring down there! Do you have what it takes to help them turn eternity into something a little more exciting? That’s the question at the heart of <em>Ghosts Galore</em>, a new board game by Michael Luu! Asmodee USA sent along a copy for me to check out, so ride along for my <em>Ghosts Galore</em> review!</p><h2><strong>What Is </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Ghosts Galore </em>is a tile-laying board game for two to five players, with an estimated run-time of about twenty minutes. In our play testing, some games (between two players) went even faster than that!</p><p>In <em>Ghosts Galore</em>, you’re here to help those ghosts have a less-boring afterlife, by laying down mine cart track tiles filled with gems and various ghosts. Each type of ghost scores differently, and you’ll want to make clever connections on your tracks to rack up points.</p><p>Comprised of two-sided player boards, a stack of track tiles, a score pad, and mine cart tokens, it’s a quick little game that doesn’t take up much shelf space at all.</p><h2><strong>How Do You Play </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>After creating piles of track tiles, you’ll begin each round by drawing a token and either claiming it for your board or sending it to the general supply. Once there’s only one player left who hasn’t claimed a tile, all of the tiles in the stack are revealed and that player has their choice of the leftovers.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Points are awarded for completing tracks (the entire edge of the board is filled with mine shaft doors), with two special doors granting extra points for connecting them.</p><p>But the real point-scoring shindig happens with all the different ghosts on your board. The term “ghost” is a little fluid here, as you’ll find tiles with floating ghosts, werewolves, dragons, bats, and more. Maybe it should have been called Monsters Galore, but points for the <em>Ghosts Galore</em> alliteration.</p><p>These scoring mechanisms all interact with each other in interesting ways, and scores are tallied at the end of the game on a handy score sheet. The skeletons score based on the number of diamonds on your board, each bat scores 5 points if its tile is adjacent to at least one tile with another bat, and dragons score based on the number of dragons on your board (but you get -5 points if you don’t have any dragons).</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-tracks.jpg?itok=GEgh97yk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>This creates an in-depth, interlocking scoring mechanism that encourages thoughtful tile placement and leads to the game feeling deeper than it should for its short run-time.</p><h2><strong>How Does The Gameplay Feel In </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>One of the things I think is most intriguing about the game is that tile selection mechanic I’ve mentioned above in the How to Play section. You can either snatch up that one key piece you need, or hold out to see if something better comes along. This creates a nice little tension you don’t normally see in a game like this.</p><p>One note I have, however, is that - at least in our initial plays, keeping track of how all of the different ghosts scored was a little overwhelming. It ended up being more of a case of us saying “Ehhh… let’s just try to connect tracks, and then see how we score our ghosts afterwards.”</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-ghost-scoring-sheet.jpg?itok=2N627-NP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>This is in no way an overly complicated game, mind you, but for those first few plays discerning the scoring of nine different monsters was daunting - just because of how much referencing back to the rules was needed. I’m happy to report, however, that after two or three plays, we had a good sense of what most ghosts did, and gameplay flowed even quicker.</p><h2><em><strong>Ghosts Galore - </strong></em><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Ghosts Galore</em> is a fun, think-y little tile laying game that plays fast once you know what you’re looking for on your tile track. As mentioned above, the complexity of placing the perfect ghosts on your board for the kind of scoring you’re going for could leave players with a bit of analysis paralysis, but I’ve found in our playing of the game that it’s more fun to go with the flow.</p><p>Art-wise, the style in <em>Ghosts Galore</em> may not be everyone’s cup of tea, as it leans into a cutesy, almost chibi-like character design for the ghosts. For players looking for something a little more down to earth (even though we <em>are</em> talking about fantastical creatures here), this design might not quite hit what they’re looking for.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>All in all, if you’re looking for a fun, fast game that encourages thoughtful tile-placement without being too in-the-weeds (especially once you understand how all the ghosts score), <em>Ghosts Galore</em> is definitely worth checking out.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Ghosts Galore<em> used in the creation of this review was provided by Asmodee USA.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Warlocks have come to the world of Diablo 2 as the game has received its first major update in a quarter of a century.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard Entertainment</a> announced the Reign of the Warlock DLC during a presentation spotlighting 30 years of Diablo. The trailer featured actor Rahul Kohli from Midnight Mass. Kohli narrated the trailer from the Warlock’s point of view in the update that is now available for Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p>

<h2 id="h-warlocks-are-coming-to-multiple-diablo-games">Warlocks Are Coming to Multiple Diablo Games</h2>



<p>In addition to coming to Diablo 2, the Warlock class is also coming to Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal. The Immortal update will be available this summer, and the Diablo 4 update will be available in April 2026.</p>



<p>As another teaser, the Blizzard staff featured in the presentation teased a major announcement coming for BlizzCon this September.</p>







<p>Along with the update, the game is now available on Xbox Game Pass and PC on Steam. The announcement of the new class on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2536520/view/490465019074445508?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam </a>came with a note from the development team that they are aware of issues impacting players:</p>



<p>“We are aware of an issue impacting Diablo II: Resurrected Infernal Edition bonus incentives for Diablo IV and World of Warcraft, where some players who purchase on Steam may not see these items unlock immediately. Our team is actively working on a fix, and eligible rewards will automatically unlock once resolved,” the statement reads.</p>

Loads of people are now reportedly out of a job, and whatever reasons people can offer or accept for it, none of it seems sane or sustainable.&nbsp;</p>

Initially, at least, it resulted in a wave of positive comments from fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">🛠️Attention, Raiders!<br>We've just deployed a new hotfix to address additional reported issues:<br>• Fixed an inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch<br>• Fixed an infinite ammo weapon glitch<br>• Fixed an issue where some quests were missing from the Headwinds update<br>• Fixed an… <a href="https://t.co/xv0k1dIQ1t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xv0k1dIQ1t</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2021602130323227105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Say what you want about embark,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r1zvfy/comment/o4t6g0y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>, “but this was QUICK!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Dude I was literally in firing range, tried it (successfully), went back to Speranza to grab a bobcat and give it a 100 round mag in practice range, and it just stopped working,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r1zvfy/comment/o4t953g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Insane work Embark, I didn't even restart my client.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders has suffered from those looking to take advantage of dupe exploits since its launch in October, and Embark has played whac-a-mole with cheaters and exploiters since. This was the case earlier this week, when the Stockholm-based studio launched <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-pve-focused-event-and-new-rewards-as-embark-squashes-duplication-bug-in-new-update"><u>an update</u></a> fixing the latest dupe glitch only to find reports of a new one cropping up shortly after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an annoyance for players, who are often forced to confront Raiders who have earned their items and in-game currency through illegitimate means, and it’s apparently keeping Embark up at night, too. As players – and even popular streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theburntpeanut/clip/KnottyFineSwallowSaltBae-7izWpIHRKvqiEVO6?filter=clips&amp;range=24hr&amp;sort=time" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheBurntPeanut</u></a> – began showcasing examples of the latest glitches, the developer launched the new hotfix, bringing adjustments just one day after its last patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to fixing the inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch and infinite ammo weapon glitch, the update tackles two bugs related to quests. Embark says it is “dedicated to investigating and squashing exploits” in Arc Raiders and will “keep you in the loop” regarding future issues. The problem is, these issues are already here, with what appears to be hundreds of players already taking to various Arc Raiders social media accounts to share that they’ve been impacted by a new problem.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨BREAKING 🚨 Since today's hotfix to fix the infinite ammo glitch, there are many reports of Raiders losing their loot when they extract. Be careful out there!</p><p>🎥u/hellfire13 <a href="https://t.co/zyO56MAydV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zyO56MAydV</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders PVP (@ArcRaidersPVP) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersPVP/status/2021659705484226879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Reports related to a separate glitch, which seemingly robs players of their topside inventory when extracting, appeared moments after today’s hotfix went live. It’s unclear if this is an ongoing issue or if the lost loot bug is only affecting those who were mid-raid while the hotfix was published. The confusion has been enough to see fans directly ask Embark for their loot to be returned, while others worry a new topside run could result in them losing their gear, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Embark,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r20hlf/since_the_infinite_ammo_hotfix_players_are_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player said</u></a>, “come on guys.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Damn, they fix one thing and break something else entirely,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r20hlf/comment/o4tekrs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>. “Good lookin out!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how the Embark team plans to handle the latest Arc Raiders glitch. For now, at least, it seems some of its community managers are working with fans to determine the cause.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders team can’t catch a break, at least when it comes to cheaters and exploits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment tied a bow on its Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight after showing off how the Warlock class will take over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-ii-resurrected">Diablo 2: Resurrected</a> in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 40-minute presentation came to a close after giving fans a sneak peek at a dungeon’s worth of updates across its three Diablo pillars. Highlights include the reveal that the Warlock is coming to Diablo 4 and Immortal in April and June, respectively, and it’s out for Diablo 2: Resurrected with The Reign of the Warlock DLC right now. While new content definitely stole the show, the Blizzard team still made sure to offer deep dives into some of the quality-of-life updates players have been expecting, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you’re looking to learn more about the Lord of Hatred expansion or revisit a beloved early 2000s action RPG, we’ve gathered all of the highlights from today’s show. You can see everything announced at the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The Warlock Class Is Coming to Diablo 4, Diablo Immortal, and Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players expected the Warlock to come to Diablo 4, but they didn't expect this. In addition to Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred, the Warlock is coming to Diablo Immortal and, yes, even Diablo 2: Resurrected. It's an unexpected update that brings the class to all three of today's games, with the full spotlight detailing how each offers different playstyles for different kinds of action RPG fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Is Summoning the Reign of the Warlock for Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021721334435205162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s 2021 reimagining might be a mostly faithful remake of a classic game, but that doesn’t mean it can’t add to it. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise, Diablo 2: Resurrected is getting a new expansion called Reign of the Warlock – and it’s out today for PC (including Steam), PlayStation, and Xbox for $24.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The content adds the demon-summoning Warlock as an all-new class not present in the original experience. It allows players to summon, bind, and devour demons, shaking up the Diablo 2 formula for the first time in 25 years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Talks Terror Zones in Diablo 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Reign of the Warlock comes a few tweaks to Terror Zones. Specifically, players can now be stalked by hunters called Heralds of Terror when playing on Hell difficulty. Terrorized bosses beaten on the same difficulty mode also now unveil statues, with players encouraged to combine five of them to access new endgame bosses called the Colossal Ancients.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Quality-of-Life Adjustments Add Loot Filers, Advanced Stash Tabs, and More to Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The new quality of life changes in Reign of the Warlock give you sharper tools for even the darkest of journeys. <a href="https://t.co/yOWzcZ9my6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/yOWzcZ9my6</a></p>— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021717067406487856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, time for what most fans expected when they heard Diablo 2: Resurrected would be featured at the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight: quality-of-life changes. Blizzard now allows players to create, share, and check out community loot filters, all without the use of mods. The update also comes with the ability to stack stash items alongside the addition of dedicated tabs for materials, gems, and runes. Finally, The Chronicle is an item tracker for players who like their Diablo experience to be nice and organized.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A First Look at the Warlock in Diablo Immortal</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/diablo-immortal-warlock-1770852504435.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo Immortal Warlock Class. Image courtesy of Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This June, Blizzard is bringing the Warlock to Diablo Immortal. This version of the summoning class utilizes demon skull, a sacrificial blade, and a beast known as the Soulgorger. The Warlock will get her own origin quest explaining her backstory at an unspecified point in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lut Gholein Joins the Warlock in Diablo Immortal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That previously teased location coming to Diablo Immortal is none other than Lut Gholein. Players will find the iconic location has been split between its Common Ward and High Ward districts, with Blizzard explaining that it pulled inspiration from real-world Moroccan cities when bringing it back to life.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Return of the Demon Queen Andariel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo Immortal's next "big bad" is the Maidan of Anguish, Andariel. She's sporting a new look, too, with associate art director Emil Salim describing her as "domineering, equal parts regal, and sadistic," adding that "she's driven by nothing less than a desire for dark godhood."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Diablo Immortal Roadmap Sets Fire to 2026</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/diablo-immortal-roadmap-1770852022171.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo Immortal Roadmap 2026. Image courtesy of Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo Immortal team has big plans for 2026. A roadmap shared during the 30th Anniversary Spotlight showed off just a few of the updates players can expect in the coming months, with some examples including a new battleground event and updates to classic zones. Expect a new subzone, along with new monsters and bounties, every quarter, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yes, the Second Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred Class is the Warlock</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the leaks and rumors weren’t enough to give it away, the Warlock is officially confirmed to join the Paladin when Lord of Hatred launches for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox April 28. Blizzard plans to share more about the new Diablo 4 class during a developer update that’s set to take place March 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lord of Hatred Is More Than Just a Class Expansion</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight gave fans a first look at how Lord of Hatred expands on Diablo 4 with Skovos and its many mountains and temples. Today’s presentation focuses on Temis, the location’s capital city and an area that holds more information about the Askari, the Prime Evils, and the origins of Sanctuary.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Skill Trees and the Talisman System</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Forge a brand new path through Sanctuary with the all-new skill tree system coming to Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred 🌳 <a href="https://t.co/UBMf4gX5wl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UBMf4gX5wl</a></p>— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021718519596097808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Major changes are coming to Diablo 4, regardless of whether you choose to pick up Lord of Hatred. Referring to a running joke that has seen players calling the game’s skill trees “skill twigs,” associate game director Zaven Haroutunian unveiled a closer look at the skill tree rework launching with the expansion this April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blizzard team says it’s about giving players “meaningful choices and options” from the get-go, calling it a “major disruption to the current class system.” One example shown during the presentation highlights the Sorcerer’s Hydra skill, which players can fine-tune to increase attack speed, launch explosions, and even use frost projectiles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Talisman, meanwhile, is a new itemization system with Lord of Hatred that brings back charms and sets. Footage of the foundational update teases more ways for players to customize their builds to their playstyle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">“They’re going to freak out…”</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Game director Brent Gibson closed out the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight with a tease of what’s to come. In a tongue-in-cheek moment just before the event reached its conclusion, Gibson says, “Oh, my god. They’re going to freak out at BlizzCon when we announce—.” There’s no telling what exactly Diablo fans have to look forward to, but it at least sounds like Blizzard has plans to pull back the curtain when BlizzCon takes place September 12 - 13.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
