<p>Final Masterpiece Edition is coming this year</p>

<figure data-uuid="1bc9826b0b856"><a title="Layers of Fear" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1bc9826b0b856/layers-of-fear.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has announced that it is releasing a new version of <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> on the Nintendo Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Dubbed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a>, the game was announced as part of the company's <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/2025/10/09/bloober-team-ujawnia-aktualny-kalendarz-wydawniczy-swoich-projektow/">latest financial report</a>, in which it describes the release as "a complete edition of the iconic Layers of Fear series".</p>
<p>With this in mind, it's not completely clear what this actually is. Bloober launched the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a> in 2016 and followed up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">a sequel</a> in 2019. The original was re-released on the Switch in 2018 as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear: Legacy</a>, and Bloober then created a remake/sequel in 2023 that was also called <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>. Yeah, not confusing at all.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kvszrl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Our assumption is that the Final Masterpiece Edition will be an enhanced port of the latest Layers of Fear, and not another re-release of the original 2016 game. This means it'll take full advantage of Unreal Engine 5 on the Switch 2 while combining stories from the first two titles.</p>
<p>We're certain Bloober will be sharing more details soon either way, so we'll be sure to update you as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>In addition, it's also been confirmed that the isometric title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a> has been delayed into the new year and will now launch on <strong>29th January 2026</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Games industry analyst firm MIDiA Research has published a new report titled “The winning formula for Grand Theft Auto VI” where they explain why Take-Two Interactive should price GTA VI at $69.99.</p>



<p>To reach this consensus, the analysts used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor%E2%80%93Granger_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabor-Granger method</a> and surveyed more than 2,000 United States consumers. According to their findings, the rumored $100 launch price (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocated by Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter</a> but <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed by Alinea Analytics analyst Rhys Elliott</a>) would reduce both unit sales and overall revenue. In contrast, the industry-standard price of $69.99 would maximize the sales potential and align with consumer expectations.</p>



<p>The study found that 79% of consumers interested in GTA VI said they would “definitely” or “probably” buy the game for $49.99, compared to 16% at a theoretical $149.99. Among superfans, the willingness to purchase at $149.99 was nearly twice that of the average consumer (9% versus 5%), but it was not enough to offset the overall loss in demand. </p>



<p>At the suggested optimal price of $69.99, MIDiA Research reckons approximately 8.6% of the U.S. adult population would purchase the game, for 22.9 million copies sold and $1.6 billion in revenue.</p>



<p>Perry Gresham, Head of Data at MIDiA Research and co-author of the report, said:</p>



<p><em>Our research suggests that GTA VI will generate more revenue at a standard $69.99 price point than the much-discussed $100. A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table. Below the optimum price, increasing price increases revenue, but prices above the optimum can result in loss of both unit sales and revenue. This is because the revenue increase from those who still purchase will be less than the lost revenue from those who do not.</em></p>



<p>Brandon Sutton, Games Analyst at MIDiA and co-author of the report, added:</p>



<p><em>Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA VI, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game. This notoriety also makes GTA VI the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, Grand Theft Auto VI was originally scheduled to launch in Fall 2025 but <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed to May 26, 2026</a>. Fans are hoping there won't be any more delays, but with Rockstar, it's hard to say.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/absolum-review.1320763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">They say “insanity” is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result, but if I believed that, I wouldn’t play video games – and I certainly wouldn’t be playing roguelikes. They are, by definition, doing a lot of the same things over and over again and expecting that this time, <a href="https://youtu.be/6TMOMTtAMBI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>this time</em></u><u>, Steve, shall be different</u></a>. This time, I am going to bash my head against that boss until that mother goes <em>down.</em> <em>This time</em>, I’m going to make it to the end of the run, and I’m going to look fabulous doing it. <em>This time</em> will be different. Those are the things I tell myself as I die for the umpteenth time in Absolum, a roguelite beat ‘em up that’s fun enough to convince myself it just might be true every single time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, of course, the undeniable possibility that I’ve gone ‘round the bend, full on cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, lock-me-in-a-padded-room, Looney-Tunes-finger-on-lips bonkers. I’ll leave that up to you. The point, reader, is that if you’d put a gun to my head five hours into Absolum and demanded that I score it on the spot, it’d be a lot lower than the score you see on the bottom of this page. But I’m a professional, and you don’t turn the movie off halfway through. There are large parts of Absolum’s fusion of genres that don’t work, and those growing pains are most obvious early on. But if you push through that weak start and get to the point where you’ve got some permanent rewards, have opened up the map, and runs end with you operating with a full kit and making good progress, it comes together quite nicely, even if it’s still never quite the game I wanted it to be.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Roguelite beat ‘em up” is a combination of words that I never expected to see, much less put in a sentence, but here we are. Because it’s a roguelite, you need a reason to die, and a reason to come back. The reason to die is simple: the land of Talamh, broken by a magical cataclysm (bro, what is it with mages and magical cataclysms? Why can’t they ever bumble their way into magical utopias?), has been taken over by Sun King Azra. Wizards are enslaved, and the general populace, still a bit miffed by the whole “breaking the world” thing, are understandably not super upset about it. You play as one of the rebels using that forbidden magic in an attempt to bring him down. That’s the “how you’ll die” part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The “why you’ll come back” part is because you’re working for Uchawi, the last of the Root Sisters, and as you bite it, she swoops in and saves your ass from being condemned to a permanent end. Live, die, get saved by Uchawi, repeat. The Sun King must die. And you gotta kill him.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story goes to some cool places eventually, but it takes a while to get there.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, don’t get me wrong: I love a good ol’ fashioned “somebody done somebody/a lot of somebodies/society/the world at large wrong and now that somebody gotta die” story as much as the next guy, but Absolum’s problem is that the story isn’t that interesting for a good chunk of its runtime, especially early on. Yeah, there are some compelling character moments, the general history of the world is cool, and some conversations enticingly imply more questions than they answer. There’s more going on here than meets the eye, but a lot of it is couched in a fairly generic fantasy setting. Dwarves live underground, they delved too greedily and too deep (figuratively), bad things happened; elves have a mythical, lost land; the strong rule in many places so you can gain entrance by beating up The Current Big Boss, blah blah blah. The story does go to some cool places eventually (and, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades</a>, you really gotta play it to completion multiple times to see everything), but man does it take a while to get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s good, then, that the playing part of Absolum <em>rules</em>. In a lot of ways, it’s a standard beat ‘em up with four different characters to pick from (though you only start with the first two listed here): Karl, the bruiser dwarf with a gun; Galandra, the elven knight with a massive sword; Cider, a nimble thief who is almost more machine than woman; and Brome, the frog-shaped spellcaster. Each character has a standard combo, a throw, a strike unique to that character – Galandra uses her sword, Cider pulls herself to enemies, and so on – a couple of unique special attacks tied to a meter, and an Ultimate Attack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real sicko stuff comes when you combine everything to form long combos, bounce enemies off walls or each other, and chain moves together in a symphonic beatdown that would make the deepest action game aficionado blush. Absolum was made by the teams behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streets-of-rage-4-review">Streets of Rage 4</a>, and, as you’d expect, it absolutely has the sauce. I particularly loved the way so many moves paid homage to the greats: Cider’s Gyro Drop is essentially Ryu Hayabusa’s Izuna Drop, many of Galandra’s moves recall Devil May Cry’s Dante, and so on. If you know, you know. If you don’t, they’re just cool moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big thing separating Absolum from its beat ‘em up brethren, aside from the whole “man, can you get lost in this sauce and it <em>tastes good</em>” combo-mad gameplay, is its focus on defense. You can dodge, which is pretty normal for a modern beat ’em up, but if you dodge toward an enemy at the right time, you can deflect their attacks, potentially opening them up. If you’re feeling particularly spicy, though, you can time your strikes with an enemy’s attack to cause a clash and stun them for a hot second, allowing you to lay into them with a sweet, sweet punish combo. This is harder, but the payoff is huge. And it feels great when you land it against a boss who was kicking the crap out of you and then the timing clicks and they can’t hit you no more. On a moment to moment gameplay level, Absolum’s bona fides are unimpeachable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Absolum's combat bona fides are unimpeachable, but problems stem from its roguelite structure.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Its problems instead stem from its structure as a roguelite. Unlocking new rituals that power up your attacks, deflects, clashes, dodges, and so on each run is fine. I particularly like the ones that spawn throwable knives and allow you to extend combos by locking dudes into a bubble or hitting them with chain lighting. Finding a mount to help you out? Awesome. Buying or finding some trinkets to boost your stats or hiring a mercenary (or finding a chicken) to follow you around and help out in combat? That stuff is great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What sucks is that parts of each character’s kit have clearly been chopped up and segmented into upgrades called Inspirations for you to temporarily acquire during your runs. Galandra’s dive kick? Amazing. Life-changing. The same is true of her three-hit sword combo. She should always have it. She doesn’t only because this is a roguelite and we have to have something to upgrade, a reason to choose that path that you know will end in an Inspiration. When you go from that one hit sword attack to the three-hit combo, it’s like being struck by lightning. The same is true of Cider’s Legally Distinct Izuna Drop or her ability to dash through enemies. “Oh,” I said, after getting them once. “This is how it should <em>always </em>be.” These are core parts of these characters’ identities and kits. They shouldn’t <em>all</em> be locked behind random upgrades. Like, give me <em>something </em>here that I don’t have to unlock besides my strikes and special attacks, y’all. Just a little bit of fun, as a treat. Admittedly, once you learn what paths lead to upgrades (Absolum is a roguelike, but its map does not change), you’ll quickly learn what the optimal path is, and likely never deviate from it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other problem is the persistent progression. Absolum isn’t a game you’re meant to beat on the first run. You’re supposed to die – a lot – while you build up the currency needed to acquire permanent upgrades (and find new paths full of rewards) to get you through future runs. Yeah, sure, if you’re really good at Absolum, you might be able to progress faster, but the margin of error early on is very, very small. In both solo and co-op, I often felt like I was dying because my numbers just weren’t high enough. It doesn’t help that Absolum is pretty stingy on health pickups. This structure might work in a game like Hades, but there’s very little narrative meat to chew on between runs, and in a beat ‘em up – a genre where you’re traditionally able to get by on sheer skill – it feels bad to be a slave to the Evil God of Numbers. I genuinely hate it when RPG elements get in the way of my action game, and that happens a lot in Absolum’s early hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the beginning, runs feel like you’re going through the motions. You always start at the same place, and you have very limited paths to choose from. That means seeing the same enemies, environments, and bosses over and over and over again with very little room for change. Yes, there are quests, and exciting new things do pop up from time to time – I’ll never forget the first time I went to [redacted] (trust me, you’ll know when it happens) – but there is a lot of repetition here, and Absolum doesn’t handle it the way the best roguelikes, like FTL, for example, do. In the early hours, I often felt like a broken record, testing that definition of insanity. Even the joy of finding a secret chest is dulled by the fact that it’s <em>always there</em>, in the same place, every time. While the stuff you’ll get changes and new things do get added, the map itself never fundamentally changes. There’s not enough Rogue to this roguelite. It can’t just be a progression system. It has to be everything around that, too, and implementing that clashes with the way beat ‘em ups work.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Action Games</h3><p>Rise of the Ronin is Team Ninja's latest foray into the action genre. Here's how it stacks up against my favorites.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It does eventually click; around 8 hours in, my mastery and Having Enough Numbers dovetailed, and I started to make more and more progress on each run. The jump was pretty substantial, and once that happened, I began to enjoy myself a lot more. On the one hand, yay, less repetition! On the other hand, I think there’s something to be said for games using mechanics and structure to reinforce their narrative. Dying over and over again while you work to take down a tyrant would suck! It would wear on you! I think that decision helps Absolum’s story, but I don’t think that story is strong enough, especially initially, to earn that. It doesn’t feel intentional; instead, it feels like padding out a runtime that could (and should) be much shorter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sucks to feel that way, because so much of Absolum is so good. When it hits, it <em>hits</em>, kids. It’s beautiful, the soundtrack is wonderful, the combat has the sauce, there are cool build opportunities, and on and on it goes. But man could I have gone without the repetition. There’s a better version of this game somewhere that’s about half of the 20 or so hours it took me to see the conclusion of the main story. Unfortunately, it’s not the one we got, and if I wasn’t reviewing Absolum, I probably would have bowed out before it ever clicked. My co-op partner did, and I can’t blame him for it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Absolum is an excellent beat ‘em up let down by a roguelite structure that doesn’t serve it. I hate being limited by numbers instead of skill in action games, and in the early hours here, it feels like you’re a slave to them. Once you get to the point where each run has you making substantial progress and the story picks up, Absolum is very compelling. But it took me a long time to get there. Gorgeous artwork, an excellent soundtrack, and smart combat spread out among several distinct characters do a lot to carry it, but they can’t fix the feeling of dread when I died, again, and realized that I would have to do some variation of the same exact thing once more. I’m not against failure; I just wish there was more variety to it, and Absolum doesn’t find that until a good way into its runtime. That it manages to emerge as an exciting beat ‘em up in spite of that is a testament to the skill and work of its developers. But it would be a lot better if it just got on with it. Unlike Absolum’s heroes, I’ve only got one life to live.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/absolum-review]]></content:encoded>

Together, the companies created Neural Arrays, which allow GPU compute units to process larger portions of the screen at once, enabling faster and more capable rendering with better FSR, better ray regeneration, and new machine learning-powered features.</li><li><strong>Ray Tracing</strong> – The companies have introduced Radiance Cores, dedicated hardware that handles ray and path tracing in real time. This frees the CPU for geometry and <a title="Genres > Simulation [847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> work while allowing the GPU to focus on shading and lighting, resulting in a cleaner, faster, and more efficient rendering pipeline.</li><li><strong>Universal Compression</strong> – A new Universal Compression system compresses all GPU data, not just textures, dramatically reducing bandwidth use and enabling more detail, higher frame rates, and greater efficiency with lower power consumption.</li><li><strong>Looking Forward</strong> – While these technologies currently only exist in simulation, they are planned for inclusion in “a future console in a few years’ time.”</li></ul><p>Watch the video below.</p><h2><span>From Project Amethyst to the Future of Play: AMD and Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Shared Vision</span></h2><p><iframe title="From Project Amethyst to the Future of Play: AMD and Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Shared Vision" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LCMzw-_dMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Netflix has announced that it's adding a bunch of party games to its catalog, and unlike many of the streamer's other games, these are playable directly on your TV with your phone as a controller.</p><p>"We're creating a completely new way to play games--one that's as easy as streaming a show on a Friday night," Netflix said in a <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/level-up-your-holidays-with-party-games-coming-to-netflix-on-tv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>Five games are being added to the Games tab on Netflix, including Lego Party, Boggle Party, Pictionary: Game Night, Tetris Time Warp, and Party Crashers.

The company cited an example of a family or friend group gathering for a holiday party to watch something and then transition to playing a game, without having to leave the Netflix platform. It sounds like Netflix is going after the market that the Jackbox games popularized, as those titles are also playable on a TV with phones as input devices.</p><p>"This is just the beginning--stay tuned for more news and get ready to play, connect and have fun together on Netflix," the company said.</p><p>Beyond the games playable on your TV, Netflix offers a variety of mobile games, including Civilization VI, GTA: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition, Solitaire, Farming Simulator 23, Oxenfree, Street Fighter IV CE, Sonic Mania Plus, Football Manager 24, and more.</p><p>In July,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263"> Netflix said it would "ramp up" its gaming efforts</a>. Netflix was at one point working on a AAA game and hired big names, including Halo veteran Joseph Staten, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">that project has been shut down</a> because it didn't align with what Netflix wanted.</p><p>In other news, Netflix is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-hiring-a-new-genai-gaming-boss-with-a-huge-salary/1100-6535200/" data-ref-id="1100-6535200">hiring a new generative AI boss to help come up with systems and strategies for using generative AI in its future games.</a></p>

<p>The first creation from Nintendo Pictures</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ad41a3823b1ca"><a title="Close To You" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad41a3823b1ca/close-to-you.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-updates-animated-short-film-close-to-you-with-some-familiar-faces">'Close To You'</a> <strong>Pikmin</strong> short was created by its newly-established company, <a href="https://nintendo-pictures.co.jp/">Nintendo Pictures</a>.</p>
<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992">X</a>, Nintendo simply said, "These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>
Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content". As such, it seems reasonable to assume that the videos are nothing more than that – videos.</p>
<p>So don't expect 'Close To You' to lead into some new game announcement or update, because it sounds like this was merely a one-off for Nintendo Pictures; a proof-of-concept, if you will, to demonstrate the studios talents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We hope you enjoyed the two “Close to You” videos released on October 7 and 8.<br>
The second video is available on Nintendo Today!, a free app available on your smart device.<br>
These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>
Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, it was a nice little distraction in what has otherwise been a fairly quiet week so far. It's also a nice indication of the sort of quality we can expect from Nintendo Pictures going forward – it was really good!</p>
<p>We'd love to see a new Pikmin game, of course, but we're not expecting one anytime soon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> was released in 2023, a whole <em>decade</em> after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/pikmin_3">previous entry</a> on Wii U. We did recently theorise, however, that it would make for a really good Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Make it happen, Nintendo.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online SNES Lineup Gains Mario, Wario, and...Bubsy]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-snes-october-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-snes-lineup-gains-mario-wario-and-bubsy.1320727/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced three more SNES games making their way to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're looking for more opportunities to spend time with some of the most iconic platforming mascots around (and Bubsy), then this one's for you.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forsaken-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">N64</a> games, SNES titles are available for everyone who subscribes to Nintendo Switch Online, regardless of whether you pick up an Expansion Pack addon or not.</p>

<p>The first game being introduced to the SNES lineup for Nintendo Switch Online this month is&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Wario</em>, a puzzler that has never been released in the West before. This one, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">like <em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>before it</a>, comes complete with Joy-Con 2 mouse support as well (in fact, it's required to play).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-and-wario-nintendo-switch-online-october-2025.jpg?itok=JcLryI_H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-and-wario-nintendo-switch-online-october-2025.jpg?itok=u4v548cJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario &amp; Wario&nbsp;</em>is leaving Japan for the first time this month.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not in a puzzling mood, however, there are two more games being added to the Switch Online SNES lineup this month, so don't worry.</p>

<p>The first of these two is the pun-tastic&nbsp;<em>Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</em>, a side-scrolling platformer which stars a mascot who, with the best will in the world, apparently refuses to die despite the industry's best efforts.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;<em>Bubsy&nbsp;</em>games go, this one probably isn't quite as offensive as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bubsy-paws-on-fire-review-stop-making-bubsy-games" rel="nofollow">some of the little bobcat's other offerings</a>, which isn't a ringing endorsement, but hey - if you've exhausted all of the other Switch Online platformers, this one might kill an hour or two.</p>

<p>Finally, the last game to be added to the SNES contingent of Nintendo Switch Online this month is&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury Special</em>, a one-on-one fighter that features the cast of&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury 2</em>, plus new fighters to get to grips with.</p>




<p>It looks as though all three of these games are available to check out via Nintendo Switch Online right now, so if you're a member and you're interested, just fire up your console and you should be able to play them all.</p>

The company <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/level-up-your-holidays-with-party-games-coming-to-netflix-on-tv">just outlined</a> a quintet of multiplayer games that will be available to subscribers some time this holiday season. According to Netflix, to play you need to choose a game from a new tab and then connect your phone to use it as a controller. The company claims the process is “as easy as streaming a show on a Friday night.”</p><p>The initial lineup of games looks fairly strong, and includes the recently released <em>Lego Party</em>; a title called <em>Party Crashers: Fool Your Friends</em> that sounds a bit like <em>Among Us</em>; and takes on <em>Boggle</em> and <em>Pictionary</em>. Rounding out the list is <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, which appears to be the same minigame that came in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox">Digital Eclipse’s excellent <em>Tetris Forever</em> collection from last year</a>.</p><p>While Netflix has been dabbling in games for years, it has primarily been in the realm of mobile gaming. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350690/netflix-cloud-gaming-plans-co-op-party-games">It was only at the beginning of 2025</a> that company made it clear that these kinds of cloud-based party games were a priority.</p><p>At the Game Developers Conference in March, Netflix’s gaming CEO Alain Tascan listed multiplayer games as one of the four pillars of the company’s current gaming strategy, which also includes narrative titles, kid-friendly games, and mainstream experiences like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game">Squid Game: Unleashed</a></em>. “We’re starting with those,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">Tascan told <em>The Verge</em> at the time</a>. “Down the road we might add more if it makes sense, but I think starting first from these four is already a lot.”</p><p>There’s no specific launch date for the initial wave of multiplayer TV games, but Netflix says they’re “coming soon.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/streaming/797589/netflix-tv-party-games-boggle-tetris-lego-party]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The word choom gets on my nerves a bit, to be honest. Probably because it feels like it's said every five minutes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. There's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> which might persuade me to reverse my stance, though. It's called Gonkle and allows the game to serve you daily Wordle-style puzzles which might improve your Cyberpunk vocabulary.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"GONKLE brings daily word puzzles to Night City," modder MisterChedda wrote of their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/24847?tab=description">latest creation</a>, which you can find in the dairy aisle of Nexus Mods. "Every 24 hours (specifically midnight UTC), you'll get a new puzzle delivered as a text message on your phone - same word for everyone, so you can compare results with others." Yep, Wordle, but for Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>As such, the modder's made sure the terms you'll have to guess if you sign up to the in-game text service which delivers these little puzzle boxes to you daily are suitably Cyberpunk, having thumbed through the game's sourcebooks to add a bunch of universe-specific lingo to a manually-collated eligible word list. That means <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Streetslang">streetslang</a> and jargon like chromed, eddies, ripperdoc, and of course choom can pop up as the thing you've got to guess. Gonkle'll automatically track your correct solve streak and progress auto-saves, meaning each daily puzzle will be ticked off as done across all of your saves when you complete it in just one of them.</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="GONKLE!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fe0Qe858LhY?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>To get a bit more in-depth as to how the mod works, its application programming interface-based innards sound similar to one MisterChedda previously set up to serve <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20381?tab=description">daily cat facts</a> in Cyberpunk. "The mod makes a single API call to fetch today's puzzle (the word, date, etc), but it doesn't send any personal data back. There's no tracking or telemetry. Your guesses, stats, and progress are saved locally on your machine," MisterChedda outlined.</p><p>"One GET request is sent to a <a href="https://misterchedda.com/api/wordle">custom API endpoint</a> I made for this mod when you open the game," they continued. "This retrieves information about today's puzzle. Nothing about you, your game, or your V leaves your computer. The mod uses an open source http client called '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14192">RedHttpClient</a>' to execute this, so anyone can verify the source code. The API endpoint is also open source."</p>
<p>As well as RedHttpClient, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14139">RedData</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13378">RedFileSystem</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">redscript</a> are all requirements to get Gonkle up and running.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the puzzles are something that'd stay a priority in any Cyberpunk playthrough of mine once the initial novelty wears off. If nothing else they're an optional roleplaying aid for folks who go all-in on netrunning, but quickly realise the cyborg boffin they've created is far too cool to be accepted into the wider deckhead community. Deckhead, of course, being a bit of cyberslang I've accidentally ended up reminding myself of while writing about embiggening cybervocabularies. Also, an alternative netrunner term for the real world is apparently to dub it 'the meatspace', which somehow feels less appropriate to deploy in serious situations than choom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Hyper Light Breaker are ending development on the game and laying off a number of employees at the studio.</p>



<p>First reported by Game Developer, Heart Machine has confirmed its plans to wrap up the game’s development. However, they didn’t confirm how many people would be losing their jobs. </p>



<p><strong>“As we wrap up our work on&nbsp;Hyper Light Breaker, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members,” </strong>a Heart Machine spokesperson <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a>. <strong>“This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“While this path will include a conclusion on the project, it reflects broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as that “conclusion on the project” is concerned, the studio says it still has something planned for the game in January that will be “meaningful and as polished and complete” as they can. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re doing our best to refine what we can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point,” </strong>they said. <strong>“Given our limited resources with team members rolling off the project, we won’t be releasing any more updates or hosting any Q+As for the rest of this year. We want to make sure the team can focus fully on getting this next release into the best shape possible.”</strong></p>



<p>Hyper Light Breaker, a prequel to 2016’s critically acclaimed Hyper Light Drifter, launched in January 2025 in Early Access to generally mixed reviews. </p>

        <p>The story begins when mercenary Cloud Strife joins the anti-Shinra resistance group Avalanche on a mission to destroy one of their mako-siphoning reactors. It’s meant to be a one-time gig, but before long Cloud is sucked into an <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,621 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> that puts him on a collision course with a dark figure from his past: Sephiroth.</p><p>It’s a fast-paced tale that combines action and spectacle with powerful character moments. The iconic party of Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Aerith are portrayed in greater depth than ever before—and by the time the credits roll, you’ll love them like friends.</p><p>The action’s pretty great too though. The combat system fuses intense real-time action with menu-based commands—in other words, the exhilarating action of a modern <a title="Genres > Action [3,119 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> with the deep strategy of a <a title="Genres > Turn-Based RPG [1,320 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/turn-based-rpg">turn-based RPG</a>.</p><p>As well as the main <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> story, the <em>Intergrade</em> edition of the game also includes “EPISODE INTERmission.” This two chapter tale takes place concurrently with the main campaign and stars fan-favorite ninja Yuffie Kisaragi.</p><p>With a new character to control, new parts of Midgar to explore and the endlessly entertaining Fort Condor minigame, it’s an essential play before you head into the next game in this pack…</p><p><strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong></p><p>The second game in the remake series follows Cloud and his comrades as they step out of the city of Midgar and into the wider world in pursuit of their enemy, Sephiroth.</p><p>This globe-trotting tale is full of amazing stories and unforgettable places—the war-torn region of Junon, the glitz and glamor of the Gold Saucer, the verdant forests of Gongaga and much more.</p><p>New playable party members join the team too. You’ll take control of Red XIII, Yuffie and Cait Sith, each offering new playstyles and abilities in battle. In battle, you can use new Synergy abilities that let characters team up to deliver powerful attacks.</p><p>The world of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> also provides plenty of diversions and opportunities for a talented mercenary. You can take on side jobs, scour the world for valuable intel, battle powerful fiends, play a few hands of the card game Queen’s Blood, become a chocobo jockey in fast-paced races, take on the many challenges of the battle simulator and much more.</p><p>In short, it’s an incredible game—there’s a reason it won more than 40 Game of the Year awards in 2024!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-rebirth-twin-pack-ps5-physical-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Controversial billionaire <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elon Musk made a bold claim</a> this week that his xAI game studio will deliver a "great" AI-generated game by the end of 2026. The comment was soon met with a wave of criticism from industry professionals, and publishing director Michael "Cromwelp" Douse from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios didn't mince his words in response to Musk's plans.</p><p>"Genuinely, what this industry needs is not more mathematically produced, psychologically trained gameplay loops, [but] rather more expressions of worlds that folks are engaged with, or want to engage with," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975327370924994657" rel="nofollow ">Douse posted online</a>. "AI has its place as a tool, but we have all the tools in the world, and they aren't compensating for the incredible lack of cogent direction. AI isn't going to solve the big problem of the industry, which is leadership and vision."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975328682680914329" rel="nofollow ">In a series of follow-up posts</a>, Douse explained that he believes the human factor and connecting with audiences are the keys to success. "Those who will succeed are those who are people building something for people," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975329606602248386" rel="nofollow ">Douse added</a>, while also decrying how the technology sector had fallen victim to "cash-grabs" led by venture capital firms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Absolum may have its issues, but combat is definitely not one of them. This Rogue ‘em up by Dotemu, Guard Crush Games and Supamonks offers the best 2D side-scrolling fisticuffs I’ve ever experienced. Slick, responsive, kinetic, and satisfying, the combat in Absolum is utterly beguiling. If I could just have the walking and punching, and not all the roguelite stuff wrapped around it, then Absolum would be my perfect game. As it is, there is a whole lot of roguelite shenanigans, and they’re not always that successful.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum | Available Oct 9" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0QWQ8L1HRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world of Absolum is generic fantasy hokum. Arrogant wizards caused an apocalypse, and the resulting chaos and instability helps create the opportunity for a populist figure to take power and rule with absolute control. I’d like to say the plot was far-fetched, but recent world events would suggest otherwise – other than the wizard bit, obviously. Whilst the text-based storytelling and character dialogue manages to be both boring and oddly difficult to follow – thankfully, you can speed it up or skip it outright – the visual storytelling is an absolute masterclass. The world of Talamh and its inhabitants are a joy to behold. Rich detail fills every 2D environment, autumnal forests painted in rich shades of red, creepy undead realms oozing in atmosphere, forgotten mines which somehow manage to make dark caves visually interesting, this is one good-looking game.</p>


<p>The character design is phenomenal, offering an innovative take on a who’s who of fantasy classics. You’ll battle goblins, sentient mushrooms, skeletons, and surprisingly futuristic evil soldiers. Each enemy type is a delight to take on, offering a steep challenge as they seek to surround you, dishing out damage with their varied attacks. The player characters are wonderfully distinctive too, offering a Geralt-inspired Dark Elf, a burly boxing dwarf, butt-kicking marionette and a wizardy anthropomorphic toad. Each character is e, some preferring ranged attacks, others speed and agility, or tanking it up in close combat. As such, there’s someone for everyone.</p>


<p>And good grief, that combat! It’s like Devil May Cry and Streets of Rage had a particularly angry baby. It’s all about breaking through an opponent’s defences, using varied attacks to do so, then you can follow up by juggling the enemy in the air, often batting them between your co-op partner (whether local or online), sending your foe bouncing from the screen borders to hammer them again. By the time you’re knocking ten foes around, the screen filled with rebounding destruction, you know you’re playing something special.</p>
<p>Too often, side-scrolling beat ‘em ups feel too basic, a few simple inputs and little else. Not so with Absolum, which has combat with so much depth, so much nuance, that it is frankly astonishing how accessible it remains. Bosses are superb, offering a genuine challenge, each one being a memorable experience. Particularly The Underking, who my partner and I both grew to hate, until we figured out how to beat him that is. The cheer that went up as he finally fell was one of my most memorable experiences from an entire year of gaming. Lob in all the side-scrolling extras, such as mounts to ride and throwables to pick up, and this is one of the best side-scrolling beat ‘em up experiences available.</p>

<p>But, and it’s a big but, the roguelite elements drag the overall experience down for me. Things start off promisingly enough. The game offers multiple routes at the end of each stage, the choice of which results in a genuinely different game experience. Go one way and the human village you encounter has fought off a goblin assault, go another and the same village is filled with burning buildings as the inhabitants flee in terror. These visual and mechanical differences certainly keep each run fresh in the early going. The addition of secret routes is most welcome too, offering a new exciting path to explore, usually with a previously unseen boss to take on, once you’ve grown bored of traipsing through the same routes. New enemies to vanquish or characters to help also liven up the proceedings of repeated runs, and, over the first few hours of play, I really felt the developers had nailed the roguelite experience.</p>
<p>Of course, you could have had all the above with a more traditional side scrolling beat ‘em up structure. It’s towards the latter stages of the game, once you’ve made it to the big bad boss only to be easily dispatched, that Absolum seems to run out of ideas. Each run lasts around an hour now, and there’s nothing new to encounter. You’ve unlocked all the abilities, levelled up your character, explored all the side-routes, but you’re still going through all the same encounters, again and again, just to have another crack at the final boss. It’s here, ten hours in or so, that Absolum becomes something of a repetitive chore. You stop exploring, as there’s nothing new to find, and instead just grind the optimum route to reach the end boss in the best possible shape.</p>
<p>Matters aren’t helped by the abilities you collect on each run often being totally useless. A handful are fantastic, summoning skeleton allies or a floating sword to do your fighting for you, but far too many are complete pants, providing inconsequential buffs, access to throwable weapons which aren’t nearly as good as the weapons you can readily find in the environment, or are so fiddly to activate that you never use them. The balance of the drip-feeding of these collectibles seems off too, many runs are rendered pointless as you just don’t get any decent drops to reach the final boss with enough health remaining to have a chance.</p>

<p>More problematic are the plentiful glitches. Some issues have been patched out, but others remain for us at the time of writing. There’s routes that can malfunction and prevent you from progressing further, forcing a restart, and there’s certain abilities and buffs that don’t seem to work at all, the game assuring you that you’ve been boosted despite the fact you most certainly haven’t. The AI of allies you can gather on each run leaves something to be desired too. A super powerful barbarian you can hire for a vast sum of gold is mostly useless and spends a lot of her time frozen, furiously not attacking but still looking badass whilst doing so. Meanwhile, other allies will steal your mount, only to not do anything whilst sat upon the creature and, like a toddler on a swing, refusing to get off and let anyone else have a go. Also, the health of your allies inexplicably goes up and down from screen to screen, as if the game can’t remember how many health points they have remaining. That’s problematic in the latter stages when allies are crucial to your success, but suddenly die despite having a full health bar. Most irksome indeed.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that there are such issues. The game is still an absolute joy to play, but the roguelite structure limits longterm enjoyment, and a patch is wanted to polish out unintended issues.</p>

<figure><a title="Absolum Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159398/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> is the brainchild of Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, and Supamonks, collaborators largely responsible for bringing about the renaissance of the scrolling beat 'em up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a>.</p>
<p>Dotemu’s first original IP, Absolum is a 'rogue 'em up' inspired by Capcom’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/dungeons_and_dragons_tower_of_doom">Dungeons and Dragons</a> arcade games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/golden_axe">Golden Axe</a>, and, most prominently, Vanillaware’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/dragons_crown">Dragon’s Crown</a>. Set in the world of Talamh, you're out to thwart the tyrannical reign of Sun King Azra.</p>
<p>You begin with a choice of two warriors, Galandra the Elf and Karl the Dwarf, who are killed in the prologue and revived in The Hearth, a sanctuary that acts as your starting point and hub for character levelling. The story is subtly implemented, much of it dictated during play through brief exchanges, points of interest, and narration. An action game, ultimately, combat is at the forefront of all you do.</p>
<figure><a title="Absolum Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159396/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In The Grandery, the first of four lands, your goal is to defeat the Underking, but unless done so early by some fascinating feat of skill, this objective takes time. Initially, there are only two paths - either along the seafront or through the forest, and at the start of each run you equip an Arcana (super attack) from those you’ve unlocked. During your journey, new map points and alternate routes open up, tied to various sub-mission opportunities.</p>
<p>Absolum is a game where you make some headway, die in battle, and repeat from scratch incrementally strengthened. It requires you to travel its paths over and over again, accruing gemstones and points to be spent in The Hearth on upgrades. Before long, assassin Cider joins the party, and then Brome, a staff-wielding warrior frog. Each character has a unique style: sword-wielding Galandra is slow but balanced; the powerful dwarf fielding a ranged special; Cider, weaker but deadly fast; and Brome with aerial capabilities.</p>
<p>Each is finely balanced to allow you to get the most out of them, and you can choose to focus on one or all to work out the pros and cons. Your entire group benefits from permanent upgrades like increased power, health, special move stocks, and additional Arcana attacks.</p>
<figure><a title="Absolum Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159403/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>To increase your chances in each run, you collect Rituals, Trinkets, and Inspirations - randomised pickups that grant effects and boost your character's strength. Rituals bolster combat with fiery rings, electric charges, or damaging waves; Trinkets offer physical advantages like reduced damage and improved speed; and Inspirations can grant entirely new combat manoeuvres, normally appearing after a boss fight. When you die, all of these bonuses are wiped, but the quality of Rituals improve with progress, increasing in power, rarity, and function from the outset.</p>
<p>Combat-wise, Absolum is as smooth and enjoyable as one would expect, further evolving a genre that was once thought played-out. The battling is furious, combo-rich fun, and full of variety. Breakable and throwable objects are scattered all over the place, from arcing axes to hefty grenades, and Golden Axe-style beasts can be ridden into crowds or positioned to spit fireballs.</p>
<p>Cash, too, plays a part, allowing you to buy Trinkets from vendors in towns. You can't store any usable or consumable items in a menu, ridding the action of pauses; this, however, makes the discovery of food in scattered book mounds or leafy bushels all-important, increasing the challenge somewhat.</p>
<figure><a title="Absolum Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159401/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of mechanics, you can dash and engage with light and hard combo mix-ups, jump in to start a volley or lead with a knee, juggling enemies effortlessly. There’s a dodge that can be timed to create a knockback, and a Clash, which requires a timed strike to repel. Both leave the enemy open to punishment, but can be tricky to pull off in the heat of battle. Nailing the timing against bosses is risky but can create huge advantages, especially if the repel effect is tied to a Ritual that produces a damaging secondary property. It's worth noting that some characters have a better window for pulling off Clashes than others, but their combat motions are slower overall.</p>
<p>Absolum is extremely well-defined. It’s a project where the combat processes and progression were clearly structured long before the first code was written. It may not be as immediately accessible as Shredder's Revenge, but it's twice as clever and — by design — far more replayable. The roguelite elements offer subtle background randomisations and rearranged enemy formations, and a one-eyed rabbit in the background denotes hidden areas to find, usually revealing treasure.</p>
<p>The Grandery feels initially restrictive - a grinding area where you learn combat, levelling, secrets, map expansions, and the functions of the game’s myriad passive power-ups. Yet, levelling up your team and acquiring increasingly interesting combat augmentations fosters encouraging, addictive momentum, even after countless runs. Exploring the map is enjoyable despite the repetition, mostly thanks to the superb combat, and by the time you fell the Underking and cross the sea to the swamplands of Jaroba, it suddenly starts to fly - in some cases so quickly the pacing can feel slightly lopsided.</p>
<figure><a title="Absolum Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159399/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the difficulty does scale with progression throughout, it's always just enough behind your levelling that it's more a test of skill than an impediment, and eventually you will have all you need to one-life clear the campaign and defeat Azra. For those who do, a surprise awaits.</p>
<p>The developer’s greatest success here is in taking the existing framework of several titles and honing it into something wonderfully graceful. Fighting is fun, levelling is rewarding, and incremental progress is encouraging. The most dazzling aspect, though, is the broadness of its Rituals and Trinkets and how these pickups shape a run. You can go all fire, all the time, or splice electric properties with those of water. Rituals can bolster Arcana with secondary attacks or off the back of successful dodges. Trinkets, too, can be stacked in power, allowing you to fortify your defence so you barely take damage, or make even the slowest characters blazing fast. In one run, after collecting Trinkets that tripled any throwable, and then boosting their power several times, The Underking was almost completely destroyed by a collection of lobbed rocks.</p>
<figure><a title="Absolum Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159400/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s this kind of malleability and unpredictability that makes Absolum so interesting to return to, and far deeper and more varied than the likes of Dragon's Crown. A single run in The Grandery is approximately 15 minutes, and you can reach the Underking quickly and lose just as fast. By the time you’re in Jeroba’s fearsome Arena or the hidden mists of Yeldrim, this run-time is more than doubled, and a total playthrough takes around an hour.</p>
<p>Raw combat skill won’t always grant a victory until you’ve sufficiently levelled up, and, unlike the beastly lairs, vampiric castles, and set-piece events of Dragon's Crown, Absolum’s world is more general, joined together through familiar paths and backdrops that stay fast to their theme. Depending on your mileage, this is either a plus or a minus.</p>
<p>Absolum is a great game in single-player, allowing you to pay to recruit help along the way and giving you plenty to see and do, while the multiplayer experience (either local or online) really excels. Finely tuned with rollback net code and allowing you to configure your own frame delays from the options, joining up with another person is quite the adventure.</p>
<figure><a title="Absolum Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159405/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing that's difficult to fathom, though, is why there isn't a four-player option. There are points when you can recruit multiple hired hands into a busy arena, the screen ablaze with sprites, and the processing is completely unfussed.</p>
<p>Graphically, it’s beautiful end to end, with a distinct, bold cartoon style and a stable 60fps frame rate. It's clean in its visual nature, opting for picture-book-flat over shaded fantasy grit, but this works well in busy screens with multiple battling sprites. Its clash effects, critical hit slowdown, and magical elements all look great, too.</p>
<p>Musically, it’s very impressive, with a Ye-Olde-English-style set of flute-backed motifs scored by Mick Gordon of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a> fame. It swells nicely at boss encounters and is very cinematic, seamlessly building from the soothing to the thunderous.</p>
<figure><a title="Absolum Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159402/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the only things that irks is the voice acting. It’s all English, all the time, in keeping with elements of medieval fantasy. Some, like the Dwarf and certain NPCs are all acceptable, but other primary characters seem lacking in professionalism. It could be that, being an Englishman myself, I’m more prone to nitpicking, but Cider occasionally drops lines like a bored receptionist that had me mocking them out loud, and the odd American character and principal NPC give it all the effort of an unwilling teacher roped into reciting lines for the school play.</p>
<p>This isn’t a major issue, just one that could have benefited from more direction. While some character actors are working to fit within the medieval period, others are delivering dialogue like it’s a present-day exchange over a coffee.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Absolum is an on-par experience to Dragon’s Crown, but a superior game in terms of its key metrics. Its combat, collectible augmentations, and planning are exceptionally well-formulated, ensuring no run is ever quite the same and its strategic options and play-styles are ever-deepening. It’s incredibly impressive in its reconstitution of arcade, role-playing, and roguelike formats, evolving them into something fresh and exciting.</p>
<p>To that end, it’s one of the best of its kind, whatever that kind may be. If you don’t enjoy the idea of repetition and grind, you may not fall in love with its initial five hours, but the momentum for one-more-go becomes so compelling after a while that it’s impossible to relinquish the pad.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another week, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-battlefield-6/">another batch of games entering</a> the NVIDIA GeForce NOW library of games available to be streamed over the cloud service, including another title being added to the list of games streamable through NVIDIA's RTX 5080 graphics cards. More areas will also be able to take advantage of those 5080 graphics cards, as NVIDIA is adding Ashburn, Portland, and London to the list of places where streaming with RTX 5080 cards is available "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>The big title this week is Battlefield 6, which we knew was heading<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-battlefield-6-arc-raiders-bloodlines-2-and-more-in-october/"> into the cloud service since the beginning of this month</a>, and will be available to stream at launch tomorrow using NVIDIA's RTX 5080 cards.</p>



<p>Other notable titles entering this week are King of Meat, the brawler that is a cooking show and a death arena where chaos is really the reigning king. It launched in early access this week on October 7, and is available to stream on GeForce NOW.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares III is another interesting title joining the library this week, both because it's the continuation of the Little Nightmares <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">series that has grown in a full-fledged franchise</a>, and because it's the first game in the series not developed by Tarsier, but by Supermassive Games.</p>



<p>Beyond what's new, GeForce NOW is also adding a bit of something old, with The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - Game of the Year Edition joining the library of GeForce NOW games this week.</p>

<p>NVIDIA is also adding more than just games this week, as its new integration with Discord, <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">which was shown off at Gamescom 2025</a>, arrives this week with Fortnite as the first game on the list of available titles. Essentially, you can go from talking to your friend on Discord, to playing Fortnite with them over GeForce NOW, even without a GeForce NOW subscription at up to 1440p and 60 FPS.</p>



<p>More games are going to add support for this new integration, but for now you'll be able to try it out with Fortnite to see how easy it can be to go from talking to your friends about playing some games to actually playing some games, without even having to move away from your conversation on Discord.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games entering the GeForce NOW library this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deathground (October 7)</li>



<li>King of Meat (October 7)</li>



<li>Seafarer: The Ship Sim (October 7)</li>



<li>Little Nightmares III (October 9)</li>



<li>Battlefield 6 (October 10)</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - Game of the Year Edition</li>
</ul>



<p>With regards to adding Portland, Ashburn, and London to the list of available regions for using RTX 5080 cards with GeForce NOW, Portland is on dock to be added next, with more information about Ashburn, London, and every other new area after that <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/server-upgrade/">coming soon from NVIDIA's website</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-as-dev-suffers-layoffs.1320673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>developer Heart Machine has announced that it's ending development on the game, and that several of its staff members will be laid off as well.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, Heart Machine says it intends to "wrap up" work on the open-world roguelike action game, and that as a result, the studio will be "part[ing] ways with a number of talented team members".</p>

<p>According to Heart Machine, this outcome was "the only one available given the circumstances". The developer puts the layoffs and&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s development closure down to "shifts in funding, corporate consolidation, and the uncertain environment" faced by many studios of a similar size to itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs-attack.jpg?itok=hL6QoUPq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs-attack.jpg?itok=Mg-C2zMG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s development is coming to a close.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not quite over for&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>just yet, though. Heart Machine also told Game Developer that it intends to leave the game in as "meaningful and as polished and complete" a state as possible prior to ending work on it.</p>

<p>As such, an update for the game is set to arrive in January, which the studio says will attempt to "refine what [it] can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point".</p>

<p>However, Heart Machine doesn't clarify whether&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>will be getting a 1.0 release or whether it'll essentially remain an Early Access game in perpetuity. The studio simply says there won't be any more updates or question-and-answer sessions for the game this year.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched in January this year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">mixed response from its players</a>, who cited the game's performance, accessibility issues, and gameplay imbalance as drawbacks. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update" rel="nofollow">roadmap arrived in February</a> promising to address many of those issues, but it doesn't seem to have turned any fortunes around.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/absolum-review-streets-of-rage-4-impressions-beat-em-up-2000633646</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-streets-of-rage-4-team%E2%80%99s-new-fantasy-beat-em-up-breathes-fresh-life-into-the-genre.1320667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As great as beat-em-ups can be, it’s also pretty easy for them to become repetitive and dull. The genre has its roots in the arcade, where upon death, players were encouraged to pump more coins through the slot for a chance to get back in the ring and continue smacking fools around. They can be challenging, but the gap between that and mindlessness can be pretty slim, at least in lesser examples of the genre. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-previews-sonic-resident-evil-play-days-1851784271"><i><span>Absolum</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> the fantasy beat-em-up from </span><i><span>Streets of Rage 4 </span></i><span>co-developer Guard Crush Games and Supamonks, clears the gap so effortlessly that it’s skyrocketing to near the top of my favorite beat-em-ups I’ve ever played. It takes a genre that, when in the wrong hands, can be monotonous, and puts a roguelike spin on it that keeps it fresh and challenging, even as you beat your head against the wall in repeated runs.</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/absolum-golden-axe-beat-em-up-rpg-rogulike-fantasy-1851767831"><i><span>Absolum</span></i></a><span> takes obvious influence from other roguelikes like </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> in that it uses death as both a teaching tool and a narrative crux. Much of it is a pretty standard fantasy fare, with four rebellious wizards repeatedly fighting their way through angry villagers, monsters, and tyrants, and each time they die in battle, they’re revived so they can start at the beginning and do it all over again. Maybe, with the right loadouts and abilities, they’ll make it to the end this time. Or perhaps, they’ll be dealt a bad hand, meet an early end, and go right back to the starting line.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Roguelikes are all about chance and making the best of what you’ve been given, and </span><i><span>Absolum</span></i><span>’s fantasy dressings make even the most mundane fights a spectacle. After most encounters, you’ll be granted one of two “rituals,” which are modifiers whose benefits can be as simple as increased power, or as transformative as new attacks. I played primarily as Cider, a speedy, masked assailant who wields handaxes and uses a hookshot to pull herself into enemies to close the distance with ease. Without any rituals equipped, she’s already a vicious, combo-centric fighter who can take most foes down without breaking a sweat. With rituals, she can trap enemies in a bubble at the end of her combos, leaving them open to further assault, or burn them by leaving a trail of flames behind her as she dashes on the battlefield. I wasn’t thrilled with every option I was given, but </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>feels so good and snappy to play that I was always more than willing to see a bad run through to the end.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>The beauty of beat-em-ups is the almost rage-room-like catharsis of slogging crowds of baddies who would do you harm, and </span><i><span>Absolum</span></i><span>’s tools to do so are so vast, varied, and destructive that even the smallest scraps feel like a choreographed setpiece full of happy accidents. I’d often start whaling on a dude, only to have forgotten the passive buffs I’d given myself until they triggered a chain reaction of combos on multiple foes at once. </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>is a delight to watch unfold thanks to its slick animation and gorgeous, hand-drawn art. Its characters move in an expressive, flowing dance of violence, and every effect that flows from their weapons is eye-catching, but never veers into the kind of sensory overload that would make its precise combo-driven fights harder to read.</span></p> <p><span>I’m still chipping away at runs and cracking the foundations of </span><i><span>Absolum</span></i><span>’s world, but my short few hours or so with it have been more than enough to keep me banging my head against its stone gates. It is one of the most rewarding spins on both the beat-em-up and roguelike genres I’ve played all year.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-watch-series-10-is-still-going-at-prime-days-lowest-price-as-if-amazons-clearing-out-leftovers-2000633308</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-watch-series-10-is-still-going-at-prime-day%E2%80%99s-lowest-price-as-amazon%E2%80%99s-clearing-out-leftovers.1320664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you think of an “out of date” product, you tend to think in years or even decades, not months. So, technically, the Apple Watch Series 10 is “previous-gen” now that the Series 11 has arrived. But the darn thing just debuted a year ago, so it’s hardly out of date. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4666/">But that’s how it’s being priced right now at Amazon in an awesome post-Prime Day deal</a>.</p>
<p>The Series 10 release in September 2024 hailed the smartwatch’s screen, 30% larger than previous models, and this is the 46mm model, so the screen size is indeed ample and very easy to read, day or night. The health and fitness features are terrific, including heart and respiratory rate tracking, irregular heart rhythm detection, sleep level and menstrual cycle tracking.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4666/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Who You Calling Old?</h2>
<p>The Series 11 is over 20 percent more expensive than the Series 10, so it begs the question, what are the actual differences? The Series 11 boasts more-durable glass, a longer battery life, and a couple more health features. But the Series 10 is hardly fragile, since it was designed as a fitness-oriented smartwatch for active-lifestyle enthusiasts. It’s crack-resistant, IP6X-certified dust-resistant, and water-resistant down to 50 meters. Try it — there are water depth and temperature sensors built in, too.</p>
<p>The 18-hour battery life is definitely nothing to sneeze at. It’s still one of the best wearable health trackers on the market, with fall detection and crash detection that could literally save your life if you’re in an accident and unable to call for help. So that extra 20-plus percent for the Series 11? You might just be paying that extra money to cure your FOMO.</p>



<h2>Big-Time Score</h2>
<p>We’re admittedly previous-gen bargain hunters, but the Series 10 overdelivers in this new price in a huge way. Three of the model colors are covered by this post-Prime Day deal, including the often-elusive Rose Gold mode that usually demands a higher price.

<p>SEGA recently filed for a new trademark for Shadow the Hedgehog, sparking widespread speculation in the community. </p>



<p>Shadow the Hedgehog is one of the most popular characters from the franchise, and SEGA could be well on its way to using the character again in a new title. The last game featuring Shadow was Sonic x Shadow Generations, which sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-already-surpass-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1 million copies</a> on launch day. </p>



<h2 id="h-a-new-shadow-the-hedgehog-trademark-has-been-filed">A New Shadow the Hedgehog Trademark Has Been Filed</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://sonic-city.net/2025/10/08/sega-files-new-trademark-for-shadow-the-hedgehog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SonicCity</a>, SEGA filed a new Shadow the Hedgehog trademark in September, which players can see in Japan’s public trademark <a href="https://chizai-watch.com/t/2025112443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">repositories</a>. The trademark is for clothing, toys, education, and more. However, further down in the filing, players will find home video game consoles and more. There is no official confirmation of a new Shadow the Hedgehog game, but many players have begun speculating that it could be a remake. </p>



<p>While we wait for some official announcement to arrive from SEGA, players can check out the latest multiplayer racing title from the series, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. It is a new title that features races across land, sea, air, and space, where players can use Travel Rings to transport themselves into new dimensions. The game features 24 tracks, and players can warp to 15 CrossWorlds with Travel Rings. It also featured 45 unique original vehicles, 70 different gadgets, and&nbsp;23 iconic Sonic characters at launch, one of which is Shadow the Hedgehog. </p>



<p>In other news, earlier this year, SEGA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-accidentally-makes-sales-data-public-for-11-major-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accidentally</a> made sales data for 11 major games public.

			<p>Nintendo of America is seeking over 4 million US dollars in damages from James C. Williams, a known Redditor who moderated a now-closed subreddit focused on pirating Nintendo Switch games.</p>



<p>On October 3, the American branch of the Japanese company submitted <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">a filing at the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> requesting $4.5 million in damages following a legal battle against James C. Williams, also known as Archbox, that began in March 2024. </p>



<p>In the filing, Nintendo of America highlights how Archbox's activities have <em>"substantially damaged NOA’s overall business and intellectual property rights, as well as the business and intellectual property rights of NOA's development and publishing partners, and further has caused harm to the many artists, game designers, programmers and others whose livelihoods depend upon the sale of authorized Nintendo products."</em></p>



<p>The company's $4.5 million claim is<em> "nowhere near an amount that would compensate NOA for the seriousness of Defendants’ conduct,"</em> the filing continues, as the actual amount of money sufficient to remedy the injury.</p>



<p>Although James C. <em>"Archbox"</em> Williams is one of the two individuals targeted by Nintendo in its July 2024 lawsuit, they aren't the only member of the SwitchPirates subreddit the publisher has looked into. Last year, it was confirmed that the Japanese publisher was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-piracy-members-subreddit/">seeking the go-ahead from the court to subpoena business records from internet domain companies</a> NameCheap, GoDaddy, Tucows, Cloudflare, GitHub, Discord, Google, and Reddit to identify anyone who helped Archobox with their illicit activities, which were made explicit in the now-closed subreddit.</p>



<p>Nintendo has always held a very strong stance against piracy, a stance that only hardened ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 this year. In 2024, the Japanese publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">shut down the Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx Nintendo Switch emulators</a> to prevent Switch games from being played on PC without the system and mandatory purchase of official game releases.</p>

            <p>Following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this year, a group of former ZeniMax developers have formed a worker-owned studio dubbed Sackbird. Made up of folks who worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">cancelled MMO codenamed Blackbird</a>, the studio have confirmed they're working on an unnamed original game that'll hit PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Zenimax's Blackbird project was one of numerous games cancelled as Microsoft laid of around 9,000 staff in July, with the ZeniMax Online Studios United union left <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">fighting for the jobs of members affected</a>. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">subsequently reported</a> that Blackbird was a sci-fi noir-ish third-person shooter with looty bits and lots of vertical movement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to the <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">formation of Sackbird Studios</a>, who've already won this year's award for most wonderfully tongue-in-cheek branding. The "independent, employee-owned game studio that is self-funded for multiple years" have adopted a roaming avian armed with a sack of belongings as their logo, and have <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/home">a website</a> which invites folks to "seek the sack" or "drop a sack" as a means of getting in touch.</p>
<p>Given how badly beaten most folks in and around the games industry are with the layoff truncheon at this point, it's lovely to see Sackbird having fun with what's happened. They're also very up front about using it to inform their new approach to game-making. "After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets," Sackbird COO David Worley, an ex-ZeniMax principal tools engineer, said. "We’re fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games."</p><p>"We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people," Sackbird's CEO Lee Ridout, a long-time director of ecommerce for The Elder Scrolls Online, added. "When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable."</p>
<p>Sackbird are currently made up of a "tight, senior team" of fewer than ten devs, and have confirmed that they're actively developing a currently unannounced "original project for PC and consoles". They plan to share more info about this first game when they're ready.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of the post-Prime Day deals we’re seeing on Amazon are making us wonder whether it’s actually really over at all, or if somehow we’ve been time-warped straight to Black Friday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/">Why else would the Seagate 2TB Storage Expansion Drive for Xbox Series X and Series S be showing up for a huge 44% discount all the way down to just $200</a>? It’s normally a $360 investment, but now it’s a $200 bargain.</p>
<p>There are a ton of expansion drives on the market that claim they’re compatible with the Xbox Series X and Series S, and many of them probably are. But this Seagate 2TB Storage Expansion Drive is the one and only one that has Microsoft’s official stamp of approval, because it was designed specifically for the Xbox. It runs on the same platform, and unlike the USB models, it fits directly into the console’s expansion port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">Ver en Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plug and Play</h2>
<p>Portable SSDs are pretty okay for console use, but let’s look at the hazards. That USB cord connection can be tenuous, always just one jiggle or curious cat swipe away from popping out of the console, and always at the worst possible time. Then there’s the formatting, which may be a decent fit, but it won’t be&nbsp;<em>the</em> perfect, seamless fit with your Xbox, because that’s proprietary software, and Microsoft gets touchy about that.</p>
<p>The Seagate Expansion Drive has that proprietary software, because it’s officially licensed by Microsoft. That makes a huge difference when you’re mid-game, because the speed of the Seagate is not compromised ever by the translation that has to occur between other expansion drives and the Xbox. It might as well be an internal storage drive, because it’s essentially part of the Xbox. And there’s no USB cable, or any cable at all. It plugs into the expansion port at the rear of the Xbox, and sits there firmly, with a low profile so ensure it’s not knocked askew.</p>



<h2>The Space You Need</h2>
<p>It’s just a reality that as video games get more complex, more detailed, and more immersive, the file sizes grow along with it. New games can be downright huge, like&nbsp;<em>Forza Motorsport</em> weighing in at 132GB or <em>Halo Infinite</em> at 91GB. If you have an Xbox with 512GB of built-in storage, that’s going to vanish almost instantly. Plug in the 2TB Seagate Expansion Drive and you instantly quadruple that space.</p>
<p>The time — and the price — are right for you to ensure your Xbox Series X or S has all the space it needs ahead of the holiday season, because you know there will be hot new games dropping like crazy. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/">The Seagate 2TB Storage Expansion Drive is just $200 right now at Amazon, a 44% post-Prime Day bonanza you do not want to miss.&nbsp;</a></p>
