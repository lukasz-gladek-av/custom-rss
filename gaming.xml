		<p>Nintendo has released Nintendo Switch system update 20.0.0 today, laying some of the foundations for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2’s release in June</a>. With version 20.0.0, the Nintendo Switch now has the new Virtual Game Card DRM system, support for GameShare, a system transfer utility for Switch 2, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-announces-virtual-game-card-overhaul-for-switch-switch-2-digital-games/">Virtual Game Cards</a> are an overhaul for the way that digital game licenses are managed on Nintendo Switch systems, turning every purchased game into a, well, a virtualised game card. This system formally lets you load and eject games on an individual basis across two consoles, sharing out offline access in a way that was not possible under the previous system, as well as allowing you to lend games to other members of your Nintendo Account family group.</p>


<p>This does now remove the game sharing loophole of letting to people play from a single game license by using a Primary Switch for one person and then online authentication for the other. There is also a limitation that game cards can only be shared by a single used between two Nintendo Switch consoles, though an Online License check option is also available for those who own and use 3 or more systems with one account.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the unrelated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">GameShare feature is now added</a>. The Nintendo Switch 2 is able to share multiplayer games to other consoles in certain titles and situations, so all players can play on their own systems. This can be used to share back to the Nintendo Switch when playing locally, and is a Switch 2-only feature when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">sharing online via GameChat</a>.</p>
<p>And a new System Transfer feature has been added. This can perform a direct transfer from a Switch to Switch 2 using local networking, but for those who will be selling or trading in their Switch before activating a Switch 2, you will also be able to temporarily upload all your data to Nintendo’s cloud and have that downloaded to the new console.</p>

<p>Oh, and the News icon is now green and the eShop icon is now red, which will break the brains of anyone who was used to them being red and orange, respectively.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Nintendo Switch version 20.0.0:</p>
<h3>Ver. 20.0.0 (Released April 29, 2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following icons for new features have been added to the <strong>HOME Menu</strong>:
<ul>

<li><strong>GameShare</strong>
<ul>

<li>This feature cannot be used between two Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and/or Nintendo Switch Lite systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User-Verification Settings</strong> has been added under <strong>User &gt; User Settings</strong>.

</li>
<li><strong>Online License Settings</strong> has been added.
<ul>
<li>When turned on, you can play downloaded software or DLC you’ve purchased while the system is connected to the internet, even if you don’t have the virtual game card loaded.</li>
<li>For more information, please refer to the details about the option on the <strong>System Settings</strong> screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>For users that will lose access to their Nintendo Switch before receiving their Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, there is an option to upload system transfer data to a dedicated server which can then be retrieved on their Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2. After you upload your system transfer data to the dedicated server, the Nintendo Switch system will be initialized to factory settings, so only perform this transfer if you’ll be able to complete the transfer on Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2.</li>
<li>If you want to continue using your Nintendo Switch until you have a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, we recommend completing the system transfer using local communication after you have acquired a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An internet connection and Nintendo Account is required to complete both local and the server-based system transfer service.</li>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will not launch this year in Central America or the Caribbean, the Japanese company confirmed with local distributors.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.teletica.com/gamer/nintendo-confirma-que-no-lanzara-la-switch-2-en-centroamerica-ni-el-caribe_383685">Teletica</a>, Nintendo confirmed their next-generation console, alongside games and peripherals, will not hit the two regions this year during a meeting held with local distributors yesterday. The company reportedly decided to delay the console's launch as Central America and the Caribbean are considered too small markets to justify an official release. As such, those living in the two regions won't have any other option other than importing from the United States or other regions for a much higher price than what would have been the around $610 price that was expected for the two regions.</p>
<p>Considering the high demand for the Nintendo Switch 2, it will be very difficult for players living in regions where the system won't officially launch to get their hands on the system, unless they are willing to pay exorbitant prices. While the console is priced a little higher than most expected, the wealth of features it offers and the solid launch lineup have made the Nintendo Switch 2 an extremely enticing purchase. You can learn more about what the system will offer when it releases on June 5th in Nathan's hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>

It also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>eliminated 50 jobs at BioWare</u></a> in 2023 and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs"><u>unknown number more at Codemasters</u></a>, and in 2024 a larger restructuring that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work"><u>670 workers</u></a> laid off company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions"><u>around two dozen workers at Respawn.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-worked-on-titanfall-3-for-10-months-before-pivoting-to-apex-legends-ex-dev-reveals">Respawn Entertainment worked on Titanfall 3 "in earnest" for 10 months before ditching it for Apex Legends</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mohammad Alavi, who became narrative lead designer on Titanfall 3 before it was cut, told <a href="https://youtu.be/bIZXzkDpto4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Burnettwork</a> that much work on the sequel had been done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Titanfall 2 came out, did what it did, and we were like, ‘Okay, we’re gonna make Titanfall 3,’ and we worked on Titanfall 3 for about 10 months, right? In earnest, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had new tech for it, we had multiple missions going, we had a first playable, which was on par to be just as good if not better than whatever we had before, right? But I’ll make this clear: incrementally better, it wasn’t revolutionary. And that’s the key thing, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And we were feeling pretty decent about it, but not the same feeling as Titanfall 2 where we were making something revolutionary, y’know what I mean?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what happened? According to Alavi, it was a combination of the multiplayer team having issues making an experience that didn’t burn players out quickly, and the explosion of the Battle Royale genre with the release of PUBG in 2017.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The multiplayer team was having a hell of a time trying to fix the multiplayer, because a lot of people love the multiplayer. People love Titanfall 2 multiplayer,” Alavi said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But the people who love Titanfall 2 multiplayer is a very small number of people. And most people play Titanfall 2 multiplayer and think it’s really good, but it’s just too much. It’s cranked up to 11, and they burn out a bit fast. And they’re like, ‘That was a great multiplayer, that’s not something I continually play a year, two years,’ right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we were trying to fix that. We were trying to fix that from Titanfall 1 to 2, trying to fix it from Titanfall 2 to 3, the multiplayer team was just dying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then PUBG came out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Respawn developers were seemingly more interested in playing a Battle Royale map with Titanfall 3 classes the team had put together, than any of the standard Titanfall multiplayer modes they were working on. This prompted a realisation: ditch Titanfall 3, which may or may not have ended up a better game than its predecessor, to create a Battle Royale that was wonderful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And at the time, I had just literally become [the] narrative lead designer on Titanfall 3. I had just pitched the story, the whole game, that me and Manny [Hagopian] had come up with. We made this big presentation and then we went off at break, and came back from break, and we talked about it and we were like, ‘Yeah, we need to pivot. And we need to go make this game.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We literally canceled Titanfall 3 ourselves ’cause we were like, ‘We can make this game, and it’s going to be Titanfall 2 plus a little bit better, or we can make this thing, which is clearly amazing.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And don’t get me wrong, I will always miss having another Titanfall. I love that game. Titanfall 2 is my most crowning achievement, but it was the right call. That is a crazy cut. Such a crazy cut that EA didn’t even know about it for another six months until we had a prototype up and running that we could show them!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

GTA 6 is currently still down to launch in the fall of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There was also talk that Borderlands 4 might have moved due to a clash with Bungie’s Marathon, a co-op focused extraction shooter. Marathon is a crucial game for Bungie, which is owned by Sony, and was set to go up against Borderlands 4 by releasing on the same day, September 23, 2025. Borderlands 4 is getting its own PlayStation State of Play broadcast today, April 30, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Pitchford denied any game’s release date influenced the decision to bring Borderlands 4 forward, insisting it had to do with “confidence” and “development trajectory.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Borderlands 4 shipping early is 100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates,” Pitchford said. “Our decision is literally 0% about any other product’s actual or theoretical launch date.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many games have brought their release dates forward, it remains an unusual occurence (delays are more likely). Chris Dring, Editor-In-Chief and Co-Founder of The Game Business, said that if other games' release dates really did have nothing to do with bringing Borderlands 4 forward, then the decision is "a bit odd."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They’ve gone out with a date," <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1917461525175980361" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dring tweeted</a>. "It’s on calendars, market materials, social assets... Put ‘Borderlands 4 release date’ into Google and it still says Sep 23. There’s surely got to be a good commercial reason to shift a date."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a video message apparently published early yesterday, Pitchford revealed the surprise Borderlands 4 release date news. “Everything is going great, actually,” he said. “In fact, everything is going kind of the best-case scenario.

This never happens you guys! This never happens! We’re moving the launch date forward! You’re gonna get Borderlands 4 earlier!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Borderlands 4 is published by 2K Games, which is owned by Take-Two. Gearbox itself and the Borderlands IP are also owned by Take-Two. Meanwhile, Take-Two is the parent company of GTA developer Rockstar. At a high enough level, right up to CEO Strauss Zelnick, there will be a knowledge of all the company’s games, where they’re at in development, and a desire to give them all the best chance of success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN in February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">Zelnick said Take-Two is planning its releases to avoid a risk of cannibalization</a>, insisting launch timing is driven by a desire to “respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, I think we will plan the releases so as not to have that be a problem,” Zelnick said. “And what we found is when you're giving consumers hits, they tend to be interested in pursuing other hits. In other words, I've said this many times, even when the hits aren't ours, they're a good thing for the industry. In this case, we hope that the hits will largely be ours. So we feel really good about it and I think that we will time our releases so as to respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this speculation is of course the prospect that GTA 6 will be delayed either into early winter, or at some point in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar would hit fall 2025 for GTA 6.

It is a player base hungry for significant new features, reworks, and fresh ways to play the near two-year-old game, and it’s not shy about letting Blizzard know how it feels. Yes, Diablo 4 is more than its core community, with a significant number of casual players who just like to blast monsters without too much thought on how they’re doing it. But the foundation of Diablo 4’s community is made up of veteran fans who play week in, week out, fuss over meta builds, and want Blizzard to give them much more to think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-blizzard-tells-ign-whats-coming-to-diablo-4-in-2025-and-2026-including-new-expansion-new-ranking-system-and-finally-leaderboards">Diablo 4’s recently released 2025 roadmap</a> — the first Blizzard has released for the game — suffered a backlash. In the wake of the roadmap’s release, Diablo 4’s community expressed concern about what's coming up in 2025, including Season 8, and questioned whether there’s enough new content to keep them coming back.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/d4-roadmap-r7-fp01-1-1743949275184-1745959814620.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo 4's 2025 roadmap touches on 2026. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate online got to the point where a Diablo community manager <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1juiw91/comment/mm3yj10/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>stepped into the main thread on the Diablo 4 subreddit to address the complaints</u></a>: “We added fewer details to the later parts of the roadmap to accommodate for things the team is still working on,” they insisted. “This isn't all that's coming in 2025 :)” Even Mike Ybarra, former president of Blizzard Entertainment and corporate boss at its parent company, Microsoft, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-2025-roadmap-hasnt-gone-down-well-with-hardcore-fans-and-even-the-former-president-of-blizzard-isnt-sure-where-the-game-is-going">waded into the debate with a few choice words</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 8 launches not only with all this in mind, but with a number of controversial changes of its own. Chief among them is a significant change to Diablo 4’s battle pass to bring it more in-line with Call of Duty’s, offering players the chance to unlock items in a non-linear fashion. But the battle pass now pays out less virtual currency than before, leaving players with less currency to put towards subsequent battle passes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this sweeping interview with IGN, Diablo 4 lead live game designer Colin Finer and Diablo 4 lead seasons designer Deric Nunez respond to the reaction to the roadmap, confirm plans to update Diablo 4's skill tree (something players have wanted for some time now), and explain those changes to the battle pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How is the team feeling about the rollout of Season 8? Are there any challenges you're predicting that you might have to tackle?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> Season 8, we're feeling really good about it. The thing we're really looking out for is anything crazy that happens in the first week. We're looking to see if there's anything that's gonna be underperforming as part of the boss powers, which is the big marquee seasonal thing that we've introduced in this season. So anything that might be underperforming, we're looking to make buffs. To anything that's massively overperforming, that's just breaking the game in terms of, you get one boss power and now everything is easy, we're probably gonna be toning down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's nothing that we’re too scared about. We find on Diablo the harder something is to balance, the more fun it is. So I think it's in a pretty good spot. We're excited for this season to come out and really have players become bosses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/dia-div-s8-content-infographic-enus-1920x1080-gg01-1745959897748.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Everything new in Diablo 4 Season 8. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Has the team's philosophy around buffing and nerfing following a season rollout changed over the course of Diablo 4’s lifetime?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> Absolutely has evolved and changed, and a lot of it has been revolving around what we try and uphold and respect, which is player time investment and where players are having fun and meeting them there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So just to give a history on it, in the very first season of Diablo 4, we made a bunch of changes, sweeping nerfs to the game because we wanted it to fit more within our launch vision of the game, where combat was a little bit slow and methodical, and you're gonna take monsters one-on-one, and bosses are gonna be really challenging and difficult. Obviously, that didn't go super well because it felt like were defining what the fun of the game was for the players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over time we've become a lot more hands off once a season goes live. We don't want to necessarily make any big changes in the middle of a season, for example, to nerf or do big buffs to classes, because we again want to respect player time investment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a while we had a thought after Season 1 where it was like, ‘OK well, we won't nerf at the start of a season, but we will make big nerfs in the middle of a season, or will make big buffs in a season.’ As we saw progression became more deep and we added more ways to min-max your characters, we felt like doing big sweeping changes in the middle of a season would disrespect player time investment. You might work your way up to a really powerful Necromancer build with tons of minions, you've tempered your gear, you've masterworked it, and then if we found that it was too powerful in the middle of a season, it was way overperforming, if we nerf that, that meant all that time you put into that character was essentially being thrown away. So we didn't like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we didn't like the other part where we were going to massively buff a class, for example, in the middle of the season, because you might have wanted to play that. But now, now that you haven't invested in that build, now it presents this obnoxious challenge where it's like, ‘Well, I wanted to play this, it wasn't strong at the start of a season, and now it's this big climb to get to that point where you've unlocked this new build for me.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Season 8, what we're really looking at now is being a little bit more reactive early into a season and then taking a step back. What that changes now in terms of our philosophy is if we see something in the start of a season that is crazy or overperforming — and how we define overperforming is that it's just short-cutting a lot of the challenge and progression of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 7, to give you a clear example of that, we felt like Blood Wave Necromancer was doing this, where you get one unique item on the Necromancer, and now all the bosses in the game are falling over. You're one-shotting everything in the game. We like getting to that point. We like when players can become God-like powerful. We don't like when it's cheapened by one item or one interaction that invalidates everyone else's journey to get to that spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we're going to be looking in Season 8 for early outperformers like that, taking S-plus builds to just an S. And if there's anything new that we've added — for example, we've added this really cool unique item on the Sorcerer that allows you to fan out Ice Shards — if, for example, that underperforms we will also be buffing those early into a season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's really just being a little bit more reactive earlier into a season and then taking a step back and letting players have fun with all the stuff that we've added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'm big into Diablo lore, and so it's exciting to see Belial arrive in Diablo 4 as part of Season 8. Why Belial now? And for Diablo lore fans, is there anything meaningful here they should keep an eye out for?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer: </strong>Absolutely. Diablo, the genre and the IP, greater and lesser evils always have a way of somehow coming back into Sanctuary, right? You thought you had banished them, like Lilith was banished to the abyss but she somehow came back. So Belial is another great example of that. In Diablo 3, he took over Caldeum, throughout the Iron Wolves, which you now see in the outskirts of Diablo 4, and they've been cast out. They're sort of outcasts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of why Belial now? In Vessel of Hatred, Mephisto is walking the earth in his human form, all hell has broken loose, and Belial, who's a lesser evil, obviously can't pass up this opportunity to try and wreak havoc, take advantage of the chaos, take advantage of the fact that the gates of hell are open, Mephisto is walking the earth. And this felt like the proper time for someone like Belial, who's such an incredibly cool villain, incredibly cool demon, to want to come in and take advantage of this chaos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So overall, the narrative that we're really pursuing and interested in is that Diablo 4 is evolving with these expansions and the Vessel of Hatred kicked off this... you never know who's going to come back. So we have a ton of big bads up our sleeves who are looking and eager to come back into Sanctuary to take advantage of this madness.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/dia-div-s08-end-game-belial-1745961666217.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Belial is finally in Diablo 4. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You'll obviously be keenly aware of some of the reaction to the roadmap among the core community. I think it's fair to say there's been some mixed reaction there. Were you surprised by some of the reaction about what was coming to the game this year?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> I don't know it was necessarily surprising. You know, if you ask our fans, 'What is it you want more of?' It's more details, more content, more things. So we know we have an obligation and we're in service of the player in terms of really getting them a fantastic experience and adding and evolving Diablo 4 over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we are talking about more on is ensuring that the players understand that this is just a starting point and that it is a conversation with the player base. Part of the seasonal model that we really enjoy is that seasons are a place for us to try really big, crazy, bold new ideas that we then can use community interaction and conversations to validate what's working for them, to then bring it into the eternal game and to evolve Diablo 4 over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So a good example, if you think back to our past, we did this crazy Blood Harvest in Season 2 where all these vampires were running around, it was all hell broken loose on the overworld, and we took a lot of those lessons learned and things that players really enjoyed and pulled that straight into Season 4 with our updates to Helltides. So we're always looking to have a conversation with the community and hearing their thoughts on what's working for them and to pull that back into the broader game of Diablo 4 to make it feel like it's evolving over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of this was, we have Nightmare Dungeons and Infernal Hordes, we have a couple of features called out on the roadmap, and again, it's a starting point. We'd love to hear some of the community thoughts and feedback when they see these things in terms of like, ‘Oh, I wish this thing was changed in Infernal Hordes,’ for example. That gives us a lot of great validation in the direction that we're heading on that particular feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Deric Nunez:</strong> My initial reaction to the reactions of the roadmap, it was all definitely very fair feedback. We see the roadmap as the kickoff for a conversation that we're looking to have with the player base. Obviously things get a bit more obfuscated the further out we get. We're really excited that some element of what the fans are looking for will definitely be revealed as we get further along. When it's all said and done, I think we'll be in an overall very strong place for Diablo 4, as we make the road towards the next expansion and refining that foundation and seeding in the new seasonal fun that we'd like to inject season after season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact we're getting so much feedback from a broad spectrum of the player base, the hardcore blasters and the casuals alike, is definitely all very important for us as we make decisions moving forward, and also validating some of the decisions and directions that we're already taking with the roadmap yet to be revealed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I play a lot of Diablo and I play a lot of Call of Duty, and it looks like Diablo 4’s new battle pass has taken some inspiration from Call of Duty with the way you can now pick what you’re working towards. Can you talk about why you’ve changed it in this way?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> We are updating the battle pass in Season 8 with a new system called Reliquaries. A lot of this was driven by, the battle pass just felt like a pretty long and tedious grind through 150 levels to get the things that you wanted. And we felt like that wasn't necessarily servicing our players in the best way that we could.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo, there's a lot of different ways to target or get chances at the types of loot that you want in the game. There's a lot of control, there's a lot of ways for players to manipulate the odds, or target something they want, just like the Lair Boss system where maybe there's a specific boss you want and you can farm that boss to get the unique item of your dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Reliquary system aims to inject some of that choice and allow players to drive and work towards the things that they actually want out of the battle pass. The high level was, how do we get players more in the driver's seat in terms of claiming some of the stuff that they actually want out of the battle pass? We think it's just a lot more flexible now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’ve seen negative feedback to some of the changes to the battle pass where you get less virtual currency back from it now than before. That won’t have passed you by. Can you talk about the reasoning behind those changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> Yeah, I think it's definitely fair reaction. We're always listening. I think the thing that we think works a lot better as part of the system is, again, you're able to really work towards and pick the things you want out of the system. I believe also the Platinum that you gain out of the entire system is available to everyone now. So you don't even need to buy the battle pass necessarily to gain some of those things back. So it's a net win for everybody overall, in that sense.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/dia-div-s08-season-journey-02-1745960335290.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Diablo 4 Season 8 journey. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: For Season 9, is there anything on the roadmap that people can expect might change either as a result of feedback or because things have become clearer internally? Or is everything on the roadmap that we're seeing now still what people can expect? I'm talking about Season 9 there but that can extend to Season 10 as well.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> At a high level, it really sets the expectation for what is the big major thing that we're gonna work on. But just like Season 8, how it has tons of quality of life changes, tons of updates, tons of details, each future season is also going to have that level of detail, content, and variety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll give you a great example: because it was the Season of Bosses in Season 8, we thought what better time and opportunity do we have to actually update a lot of the bosses that exist in our game? So we took a look at Duriel. He's been in the game for quite a while. We've completely changed the fight. We've added some new attacks. We've added a lot of fun new ways for him to eat you and kill you. Those level of details all coalesce into one really solid, incredible package for a season that the roadmap just isn't really able to capture at this point. Because it's really just trying to say, 'We're going to be investing and looking into Nightmare Dungeons... how do we level up that system and feature?' And there's just going to be so much that goes into it that really is hard to sell with just a few bullet points in terms of telling players where we're actually heading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Deric Nunez:</strong> The devil will definitely be in the details when we reveal more. There's a lot more beyond the veil, the broad stroke of what was revealed.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/dia-div-x1-spiritborn-skill-tree-1-1745960380755.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Blizzard is working on a Diablo 4 skill tree update. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Generally, there is a desire from players for brand new skills and build variety. What's the thinking there about whether or not to do it either way?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> This is a really meaty question, so I'll dive into a couple sections. Our goal every season is to completely refresh the meta and make it feel like there's tons of exciting new ways to play the game. A great example of this is you might have played a Whirlwind Barbarian last season, but you can still play it this season, and our hope that the boss powers that we've added that are unique to this season have ways to actually make that Whirlwind Barbarian feel completely different and get you to care about different things, and to have it change the way you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So a great example is one of the boss powers has essentially a power that when you're channelling, it's going to fire a death laser beam. It's the Wandering Death. If you fought that one, you get to rip the power out of it, and now while you're Whirlwinding it's going to shoot that death laser. So that's a really cool way for you to have a really big impact on your overall build while still having a similar playstyle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as the skill tree changes, I can confirm we are talking about updates to the skill tree, but I don't have any details. It's something the team is taking very seriously, and we are talking about, what is a major change that we think would create more build variety and more build diversity going forward?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason why it's going to take us quite a while is it's kind of a big problem to entangle. So right now, just to dive into some of the details, Legendary aspects are two parts that we consider problematic. It's both customization, which is like, 'I want my — for example, if you played Rogue — Twisting Blades to orbit around me.' We think that's a really cool thing and really cool playstyle customization choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But because it's a Legendary item, it also has what we call power growth, which is, now Twisting Blades deals more damage. And what that means is if you want to play a Twisting Blades Rogue, you have to play with the Twisting Blades orbiting around you playstyle, right? We've just sort of said because there's both power on this as well as customization, this is the only way you're allowed to play Twisting Blades Rogue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we want to separate some of that out. We want to pull more of the customization into the skill tree and allow aspects to be more power growth. That's a lot to entangle and that's why it's a lot of conversations that we're having right now. And it's a lot of work on us to make sure we get it right, so that we release it into a high quality state. That's just like a little insight into the philosophy that we're working towards as part of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The TL;DR to that is we do want to do something to the skill tree, no plans that I can share now, but it's something that we're definitely talking about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Diablo 4 Season 8 is live now.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/gaming-accessory-maker-8bitdo-halts-shipments-to-the-us-due-to-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Popular gaming accessory maker <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/8bitdo">8BitDo</a> is halting shipments to the US from its Chinese warehouses and manufacturing because of the impact that Trump’s tariffs are having. Existing stock within US warehouses will continue to be sold, but there’s no restocks coming until the situation has been resolved or worked around.</p>
<p>They’re joining other companies like gaming handheld maker <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/562454/retro-handheld-industry-retroid-anbernic">Anbernic</a>, PC case maker <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/pc-case-maker-hyte-halts-shipments-to-us-due-to-trumps-tariffs">Hyte</a> and others in halting shipments to the US through the uncertain times for Chinese imports ahead.</p>


<p>Originally known for their retro controller recreations and replacement boards for classic gamepads, 8BitDo’s brand has grown in the last few years as they’ve shipped more general purpose controllers for all modern platforms, whether it’s a full-sized Ultimate 2 controller, a retro-style mechanical keyboard and mouse, or the tiny Micro controller for quick pick-up gaming. They’re among the many accessory makers who have adopted Hall Effect sensors for their analogue sticks, while maintaining comparable or lower prices to first party controllers for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.</p>
<p>The pause in shipping to the US is down to two policies that the Trump administration has put in place, with the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports and an end to <em>de minimis&nbsp;</em>exemptions for shipments valued under $800 coming about as close to a trade ban as you can get without actually putting one in place. While there’s a stay of execution for smartphones and other consumer electronics, video game consoles and accessories are classified as toys by the US ITC.</p>
<p>The full impact of Trump’s tariffs is yet to really be felt, as many companies with Chinese supply chains rushed to get imports through before tariffs would be applied and some of the biggest tech giants have diversified their manufacturing hubs to use other countries throughout Asia – Apple, for example, has built up manufacturing in India, Nintendo is using Vietnam for some Switch 2 production, and so on – and so are able to get the lower 10% tariff rate that is applied to the rest of the world… for now.</p>

<p>There is the looming threat of the higher tariffs for almost all countries that were announced back at the start of April coming back, but given just how much manufacturing is still centralised in China, the US will start to feel the impact of this very soon.</p>

			<p>A big new Nintendo Switch update (version 20.0.0) <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped today</a>, adding several features introduced mostly in preparation for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. The Virtual Game Cards and GameShare features are easily the most important. Here's what Nintendo had to say about how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Virtual Game Card</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>Purchased Nintendo Switch digital software, DLC, and some free software are now virtual game cards and displayed in a list in this menu.</em></li>
<li><em>You can virtually load and eject virtual game cards between up to two Nintendo Switch systems.</em></li>
<li><em>Virtual game cards can be lent to others in the same Nintendo Account family group. For more information, see&nbsp;Virtual Game Card Guide.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>GameShare</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>Compatible software can be shared from a Switch 2 system to other nearby system(s) to play together.</em>
<ul>
<li><em>You can only play together via local wireless, and the Switch 2 system must initiate GameShare.</em></li>
<li><em>This feature cannot be used between two Switch, Switch – OLED Model, and/or Switch Lite systems.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A new User Verification feature has also been added to ensure that access to the Virtual Game Card menu can be restricted via PIN or signing in to your Nintendo Account. Furthermore, with the addition of Online License Settings, users can play downloaded software or DLC they purchased (as long as the system is connected to the Internet) even if they don't have the virtual game card loaded.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the functionality to transfer saves between Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 has been implemented. Users can perform a system transfer using local communication; however, both the local and server-based system transfer services require an Internet connection and a Nintendo Account. Multiple saves can also be selected and transferred at once in the dedicated menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em>For users who will lose access to their Switch before receiving their Switch 2, there is an option to upload system transfer data to a dedicated server, which can then be retrieved on their Switch 2. After you upload your system transfer data to the dedicated server, the Switch system will be initialized to factory settings, so only perform this transfer if you’ll be able to complete the transfer on Switch 2.</em></li>
<li><em>If you want to continue using your Nintendo Switch until you have a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, we recommend completing the system transfer using local communication after you have acquired a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just over a month from its planned June 6 debut in stores. In the meantime, check out our recap article <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, or our hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been so long since the last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty">Starcraft</a> that all I can remember is that Zergs build on creep, the Protoss Void Ray is a glorified Xmas bauble, and Jim Curry went to space. I'm pretty sure at least one of those things is from some other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game universe. Maybe Worms. How long must we wait for a Starcraft 3? A long time yet, but possibly not forever, for Blizzard are apparently handing the rights to the cherished RTS series to Nexon, publisher of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by South Korean finance site <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (via Google translation) and written up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/nexon-wins-the-bidding-war-to-make-a-new-starcraft-as-well-as-distribute-a-blizzard-mobile-game-thats-being-called-overwatch-3/">PCGamer</a>, Nexon have been selected as the "preferred" candidate for Starcraft development rights following a bidding war with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> publisher NCSoft, Solo Leveling: Arise creators Netmarble and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a> outfit Krafton. Nexon are also, it's claimed, in the running to land Korean and Japanese service rights for a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> mobile game, referred to by some bidders as Overwatch 3, but in actuality a MOBA spin-off.</p>
<p>According to MTN, the bidders have pitched several new Starcraft concepts at Blizzard, ranging from spin-off games to "platforms", though it's not known what Nexon specifically proposed. Apparently, the negotiations have been "complicated" by the fact that while making a new RTS game is the obvious choice and doubtless the best usage of the license, nobody wants to go toe-to-toe with Blizzard's own Starcraft 2, which remains a huge hit in South Korea despite <a href="https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/608542-the-death-of-korean-sc2-and-where-we-go-from-here">reports of its "death" as an esport</a>. There's also been talk of a MOBA adaptation, as with Overwatch mobile. Good luck selling that to the Windows 98 diehards.</p>
<p>Why aren't Blizzard themselves making a new Starcraft RTS? Who knows, such a project may exist deep within the company, lost in a trove of Diablo 4 merchandise, but all they're talking about at present <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">is the latest Quixotic effort to make a Starcraft shooter</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To celebrate its fourth anniversary, Housemarque has released a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch for sci-fi shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>.</p>
<p>The patch, out now, promises up to 2.5x the pixels on the more powerful console for a higher resolution experience. Presumably that's aiming for native 4K rather than the upscale solution employed on the base console, though that hasn't been specified.</p>
<p>It's unknown if the patch makes any other tweaks. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-returnals-pc-port-is-good-but-it-could-be-great">PC version of the game</a>, released in 2023, already boosts performance over PS5.</p>

<p>Returnal was released in 2021 and is generally considered one of the best and most unique games on Sony's PS5. The roguelite shooter sees protagonist Selene trapped in an endless cycle on a hostile, alien planet.</p>
<p>A year after its release, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-wins-big-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">won big at the 2022 BAFTA Game Awards</a>, winning the Best Game award and a performance award for Jane Perry.</p> <div>

<p>Following Returnal's release, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">Housemarque was acquired by Sony</a> as part of its PlayStation Studios first-party operation.</p>
<p>At Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play in February</a>, the developer revealed its next project: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">Saros</a>.</p>
<p>It's once again set on a "hostile, shape-shifting planet" and features British actor Rahul Kohli in the lead role. PS5 Pro enhancements for the new game have been promised, so this update to Returnal bodes well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/report-ea-lays-off-more-than-300-staff-and-cancels-rumoured-titanfall-spin-off/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has reportedly cut more than 300 jobs and cancelled several projects, including a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game.</p>
<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, somewhere between “300 and 400 positions” have been cut by the publisher, including jobs at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi studio Respawn Enterainment. It comes a little over a year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/ea-layoffs-hits-5-of-its-employees-mandalorian-fps-cancelled-ridgeline-games-closed/">EA cut 5% of its total workforce in February 2024</a>.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg and EA spokesperson confirmed that layoffs had been made, “As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">Respawn also noted</a> “targeted team adjustments”, admitting that it had “made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects”.</p>
<p>One of those projects, according to Bloomberg, was codenamed R7, an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. While the company has had great success with the other multiplayer FPS phenomenon in battle royale Apex Legends, extraction shooters are a less proven format for massive success, so it’s possible that EA saw the broad reaction toward <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/">Bungie’s Marathon extraction shooter</a>, the broader landscape of live service games, and realised that anything with the Titanfall name that wasn’t a full sequel to Titanfall 2 would suffer massive backlash from fans, so decided to can it instead.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that a Titanfall game has been cancelled in the last few years, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/02/report-ea-cancels-titanfall-single-player-game-being-built-within-apex-legends/">Titanfall Legends reportedly canned back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they find fresh employment and opportunities soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/housemarque-celebrates-4th-returnal-anniversary-with-ps5-pro-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finnish developer Housemarque has <a href="https://x.com/Housemarque/status/1917443799619342788?t=UpfDraahAgVZfbzeHhoBqQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated the 4th anniversary</a> of Returnal with the release of the long-awaited PlayStation 5 Pro patch. The studio didn't go into much detail about the improvements, though they did say the patch offers up to 2.5x higher resolution than the base PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-returnal-absolute-housemarque" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry's analysis of the game on PS5</a>, Returnal originally rendered the game at native 1080p, then used temporal reconstruction up to 1440p, and finally added a checkerboard rendering pass to reach 4K output. So, it sounds like the PS5 Pro version might now output native 4K resolution, although we'll have to wait for a new analysis to get confirmation.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 4, Returnal was so successful that it single-handedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-returnal-has-officially-joined-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convinced Sony to acquire Housemarque</a>. The game earned a 9.3/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again.</em></p>
<p>Despite the game's success, Housemarque is not making a sequel to Returnal. Instead, they are crafting a brand new sci-fi IP <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called Saros</a>. The developers claim this will be the 'ultimate evolution' of their trademark action gameplay when it ships next year on PlayStation 5. The game still uses the roguelike framework seen in Returnal, but this time around, Housemarque will let players keep permanent resources and progression, making deaths more bearable.</p>
<p>Last month, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-housemarque-budget-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> they could never have made a game like Saros if they had remained independent. It reportedly has a budget similar to Alan Wake 2's (around €70 million).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/658511/nintendo-switch-20-0-0-update-virtual-game-card-gameshare-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With just over a month to go before the Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">Switch 2 release date on June 5t</a>h, Nintendo has released a Switch 1 update that will help prepare things for the new console’s arrival. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/989/c/188#current">V20.0.0 update for the original Switch</a> adds a bunch of new features that go along with the Switch 2, like Home menu buttons for the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system"> Virtual Game Card</a> and GameShare features that were announced earlier this month, and a new system transfer feature that can store your data in the cloud until you’re ready to put it on a Switch 2 — just make sure you read the instructions closely before trying it.</p><p>You won’t be able to use the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641334/nintendo">GameShare feature</a> yet, as sharing can only start from a Switch 2 system over local wireless connections — trying to do it between two Switch 1 systems won’t work.</p><p>You can check out the new Virtual Game Cards that collect digital software and DLC for you to “load” and “eject” between two different systems, and lend games to others in your Nintendo Account family group. If you lend a game to someone else, then you can pull it back while they’re online even if they’re currently playing, but if they go offline without returning it or coming back online, you’ll need to wait until the end of the two-week lending period for it to be returned to your library automatically.</p><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891">Virtual Game Card Guide</a> explains all of the ins and outs of the new lending system, like how each Switch can only be connected to one other Switch at a time, how to manage your game cards from the web, and how to hide (or unhide) certain cards.</p><p>To use digital games across more than just two systems or without those restrictions, Nintendo is now relying on the Online License Settings, which are also being added to your Switch 1 in this update. If it’s turned on, it will allow the user to play any of their digitally purchased games and DLC as long as they’re connected to the internet, without relying on virtual game cards.</p><p>But if you’ve already decided to upgrade, then your first stop might be the new option for “System Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2” under the System menu in System Settings. While it can be used for a local system-to-system transfer once your new console arrives, there’s also an option to upload system transfer data to the cloud now, where it will be ready to download to a Switch 2 without requiring access to your old system.</p><p>While that might be good for someone passing their Switch 1 off to someone else, the downside is that it will factory reset your Switch 1, so it’s better to wait if possible, and it will only be stored for a year if not downloaded. Another wrinkle is that it’s possible to set up a Switch 2 cloud transfer, then cancel it and bring your data back to a Switch 1. However, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68432">as Nintendo’s system transfer FAQ explains</a>, while it doesn’t have to be the same Switch 1 you started with, if it started on a Switch OLED, you will only be able to cancel and reload your data on another Switch OLED.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Strong and selfless, Kaser shies away from the label of a hero, feeling the weight of those who depend on his abilities and leadership. Unyielding in his defiance against oppression, he fights for those who cannot stand up for themselves, fuelled by a steadfast resolve to save his home from the cruel reign of brutal tyrants. Now the fate of his beloved sister hangs in the balance as he seeks to exact a terrible revenge on Aramon and the invading Voidrax.</li><li><strong>Arena</strong> – Once a powerful alien-dragon warrior, Arena exudes a commanding aura of authority that demands respect. It was in witnessing the true depths of human love and kindness that he realized humanity was not the evil species he had always believed it to be. Now haunted by the memories of his past actions in conquering innocent worlds alongside his Voidrax brethren, Arena’s future is clouded and his motivations remain unclear. <a title="Games > Beneath [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a> his strong and domineering presence lies a wise and compassionate soul, capable of offering help and guidance to those who need it the most, with a dose of dry humour even in the most dangerous situations.</li><li><strong>Louisa</strong> – Kaser’s sweet-natured younger sister always prioritizes the wellbeing of others and is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her friends and family from harm. Growing up in Slum Harbour left an imprint on the teenager and deeply shaped her character, instilling a great deal of loyalty and empathy for its people who have long suffered under the harsh and oppressive rule of the Empire. Despite her overly protective older brother’s concerns, Louisa joined the GLIMMER resistance group, determined to make Slum Harbour a happier and safer place to live. Her genuine compassion, respect and kindness have earned her the heartfelt gratitude of the townsfolk.</li><li><strong>Aramon</strong> – The ruthless commander of the Voidrax has been imprisoned across alternative dimensions for a millennium—but is executing a meticulous escape plan that threatens to unleash catastrophic consequences. Consumed by an insatiable obsession to dominate all of existence, he intends to seize the planet’s Life Nexus—a move that could grant him nearly limitless power. His vengeance against those who imprisoned him will be swift, brutal and merciless, leaving devastation in his wake. Manipulative, narcissistic and arrogant, he holds others in utter contempt, believing that the time for his ultimate rule has finally arrived.</li><li><strong>Victor</strong> – As the noble leader of the Holy Order, bound by a solemn oath to protect the weak and the innocent, Victor embodies the virtues of a true hero. His unwavering loyalty to the Empire and his firm belief in the Emperor’s vision for a brighter, more prosperous future drive him forward. A paragon of honor, integrity and courage, Victor is unafraid of telling hard truths for the greater good of the country, the people and the Empire he loves deeply.</li><li><strong>Zana</strong> – A natural born leader with extraordinary superhuman abilities, Zana joined GLIMMER upon understanding the oppressive nature and formidable power of the Empire. Now a vital member of the organization, she constantly strives for excellence and manages to display strength, calm and pure emotional control, even when challenged with terrible adversity. Preferring to work alone, Zana often keeps others at arm’s length, making her seem cold and distant, and carefully considers her next move before acting.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight for Everything</strong> – Simple to grasp, challenging to perfect. You have total freedom to fight your way; switching weapons and mixing attack patterns in adrenaline-pumping battles charged with spectacular visual effects.</li><li><strong>Character Evolution</strong> – Earn <a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Points to unlock and choose attributes from the character Skill Tree.

                <p>Nintendo has rolled out a new system update for the Nintendo Switch. This particular update is a hefty one, introducing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-will-let-you-share-digital-games/1100-6530424/" data-ref-id="1100-6530424">Virtual Game Cards</a> feature announced during the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/" data-ref-id="2900-6377">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-game-sharing-for-all-switch-consoles/1100-6530545/" data-ref-id="1100-6530545">GameShare</a> support and other compatibility with the upcoming Switch 2 system.</p><p>After installing the update, digital titles and DLC you've purchased will now be converted to Virtual Game Cards. These function similarly to physical game cards. You can load and share your digital games between two Switch systems, making it easier to manage your digital library. You can also loan out digital games temporarily to other users within your family group.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch - Virtual Game Card Update Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>As mentioned, the new system update also adds support for GameShare. This feature will allow Switch 2 owners to virtually share compatible games with Switch 1 players, similar to the Download Play function the DS offered, giving you the ability to set up or join a multiplayer session even if only one player owns the game.</p><p>Beyond that, the update adds a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-let-you-transfer-system-data-from-switch-1/1100-6530566/" data-ref-id="1100-6530566">Switch 2 system transfer function</a> that will allow you to transfer your Switch 1 data over to the new console. Nintendo has also tweaked the colors of the eShop and News icons, as well as added the ability to transfer multiple save data at once. You can read the full patch notes, taken from <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's support website</a>, below.</p><p>This system update arrives a little more than a month ahead of the Switch 2, which is slated to launch around the world on June 5. Preorders for the console opened in the US and Canada on April 24 but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">quickly sold out</a>, although many games and accessories are still in stock.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's some rising left to be done in the amount of maps, factions, and modes available.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the multiplayer mode of Tempest Rising. For thoughts on the story mode, check out the </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign">Tempest Rising single-player campaign review</a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem with Tempest Rising's multiplayer is that while it's perfectly competent at recreating a slice of the old Command &amp; Conquer multiplayer with a pair of new and interesting factions, it's just that: a slice, rather than the whole pie. With only two factions, nine maps, and the most basic of options for customizing its two or four-player matches, just about everything here screams "minimum viable product." Combine that with the fact that Tempest Rising doesn’t aspire to be anything more than a revival of C&amp;C’s gameplay, and there's not a tremendous amount to get excited about. It may well expand over time – such as whenever the Veti faction arrives – but like a vehicle factory that's only half built, it won't be super useful until you're certain you'll have enough harvested Tempest in the bank to complete it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could try to comment on unit balance, but like with any fresh-out-of-the-gate multiplayer game, anything I say will almost certainly soon be obsolete. My anecdotal experiences with the community's apparent preference for GDF over Dynasty, probably thanks to their self-replenishing drone swarms, is likely to either be nerfed in a patch within a week or proven completely wrong. Soon, I'm sure someone way smarter than I am will figure out a devastating counter that reduces the seemingly unbeatable (and admittedly pretty cool) strategy of loading Skycrane transport helios with drone operating infantry to automatically barrage anything in range to a garbage-tier strategy for fools.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I'll leave that to the folks who are busily hashing out the best build orders and counter strategies for the unique characteristics of each faction, which are mostly remixes of C&amp;C ideas with a few twists to get a hang of. I’m a big fan of the Dynasty’s Scrap Trucks, which let you quickly unfold a vehicle-repairing turret anywhere on the map and start plopping down structures that you can pre-construct at your con yard. Naturally, there's no end to the opportunities for showing off your micromanagement skills by deftly controlling the transforming Trebuchet tanks, picking targets for your long-range artillery and airborne units to clear the way for flamethrowers and armor, activating special abilities to disable groups of enemies and leaving them vulnerable, laying mines, scouting, calling in support abilities, etc. – all while building and protecting your own resource economy and climbing the tech tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of Tempest Rising's retro style and adherence to time-tested tech trees I've found it instantly familiar and easy to slip back into old habits; I've been enjoying going back to the classic engineer-rush where I steal the enemy's construction yard out from under their noses while a handful of infantry distracts them from the opposite flank. (That'll only work for a short while after launch, so I'm getting that trollish thrill while I can.) If it worked in C&amp;C, it'll probably work here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few features that feel like they're built almost exclusively for the hyper-competitive set, such as the Doctrine tech tree that invites you to dump thousands of precious Tempest credits into upgrades that, for the most part, don't get all that good until you're several tiers deep. Boosting my infantry health by 15%, for instance, doesn't seem all that worth it until I have a <em>lot</em> of infantry in play (as opposed to building more infantry). At my skill level – and probably that of most people who aren't hardcore players – the vast majority of my games thus far haven't lasted long enough to build up the kind of excess cash I'd need to invest in that sort of thing, with most of them wrapping up before the 15-minute mark. But I'm sure that plenty of people will find uses for these to get the upper hand with specific builds, so it's good to know there's more depth to be mined if you put in the time to train up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if you <em>are</em> a competitive player looking for your next RTS fix, know that Tempest Rising doesn't have a ton for you to play with at the moment. For one thing, if you play ranked, there are only 1v1 matches available. Even if there were 2v2 ranked matches (it's actively being worked on, the developers promise), there would only be three maps available that support four players in teams or free-for-all. 1v1 isn't much better in that regard, with just six options. Combine that with there only being two factions until whenever the Veti expansion comes along – which could be a while given the lack of a published timeline – and it feels pretty slim compared to a lot of the games that inspired it.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's nothing wrong with the maps that are here – each is a symmetrical layout with areas of high and low elevation, plenty of bottlenecks and alternate routes, all dotted with capturable neutral structures that can give you a "free" (for the cost of an engineer) foothold to build defenses and forward production off of, as well as a few that generate resources. It's simply that there's nothing unexpected – good or bad – at all, and that gives it a very bog-standard feeling. It’s hard to make the argument that Tempest Rising has gone for quality over quantity when there are no big standouts.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tempest Rising’s multiplayer mode is a better looking but anemic version of the same exact style of RTS multiplayer we've been playing for 30 years. There's certainly value in that, since Command &amp; Conquer’s fast-paced strategic action still holds up as well as ever, and matches are quick and tense when you’re up against an evenly skilled opponent. It may be a minimum viable product with only two factions and a handful of maps, but it is viable, and it remains a good time to duke it out as GDF and Dynasty with others or bots.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Tempest Rising Review - Multiplayer</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>Tempest Rising's multiplayer mode replicates the thrills of old-school Command &amp; Conquer-style RTS gameplay, but with just a couple of factions and a handful of maps there's not much meat on its bones.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
