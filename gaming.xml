<p>PlayStation has announced what games were the most downloaded across its platforms for July 2025. The company revealed the most downloaded titles on PlayStation 5 (PS5), PlayStation 4 (PS4), PlayStation VR 2 (PS VR 2), and free-to-play.</p>



<p>The data separates the United States (US) and European Union (EU) downloads.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/08/playstation-store-july-2025s-top-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Leading the way</a> on PS5 in the US should be no surprise as College Football 26 led the way after its July 7 launch. In the EU, the top spot on PS5 was held by Ready or Not, which came in 2nd in the US. In what could be viewed as a surprise to some, Sloclap’s recent soccer title Rematch was the third-most downloaded game in the EU and 12th most in the US on PS5.</p>



<p>Moving to PS4, Read Dead Redemption 2 took the top spot in both regions while Fortnite was the number one for the free-to-play games.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of most-downloaded PlayStation games for yourself below, and let us know which games you picked up in the comments. </p>

<p>According to the former president of Blizzard Entertainment, Call of Duty is going to receive a ‘boot stomp’ from Battlefield 6, which could be a good thing for the FPS genre.</p>



<p>The hype surrounding Battlefield 6 is unreal, with thousands of players flocking to the game’s beta. Before the beta even launched, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-game-servers-full-players-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 200,000 players</a> were waiting in line to play the game. Moreover, BF6 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beaten-almost-every-cod-game-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed</a> almost every Call of Duty game on Twitch. But, is it enough to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7? </p>



<h2 id="h-former-blizzard-president-thinks-battlefield-6-will-force-call-of-duty-to-change">Former Blizzard President Thinks Battlefield 6 Will Force Call of Duty to Change</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-former-blizzard-boss-says-but-the-real-win-here-is-cod-wont-be-lazy-anymore-and-well-all-get-better-fps-games-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, the former president of Blizzard Entertainment, Mike Ybarra, posted about Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty on his <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). Ybarra’s post states, “Battlefield will boot stomp” Call of Duty in 2025. He adds that the “real win” here would be that this competition will stop Call of Duty from being “lazy” and “better FPS” games can come from it. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.</p>— Mike Ybarra 🎮 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Ybarra added in a follow-up tweet that Call of Duty has been going “downhill” for years. The game’s a mess, the former president adds, with issues such as “cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors” and more present. Ybarra hopes that Battlefield 6 could be the game that changes things for Call of Duty. </p>



<p>A recent Insider Gaming exclusive report reveals that Activision is closely monitoring Battlefield 6. Still, leadership is not worried about the upcoming title as they feel Call of Duty is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too big to fail</a>“. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 beta has already been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-hit-by-cheaters-clips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit by cheaters</a>, according to the recent clips surfacing online. Additionally, Call of Duty is relying on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 17-year-old character</a> to drive pre-orders for Black Ops 7.

			<p>You’ve dusted off dinosaurs, you’ve dived into the Two Point sea, you’ve even visited the netherworld and scoured the far reaches of the known universe. Now your helicopter begins to gather dust, and your Experts are stuck in an endless pattern of restoring the same exhibits, over and over again. But just when you think you’ve found all there is to discover, a brand-new adventure falls into your lap with the Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds | OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRgEvhYj1L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fantasy Finds, unlocks a Lord of the Rings styled fantasy expedition map, called Scorched Earth, for you to explore. This location is packed with fun Points of Interest (POI’s), including various fantasy realms to travel through. The map isn’t accompanied with a themed museum, like the other Two Point Museum expedition maps do, which is a little disappointing, but does come with an entertainingly silly storyline and enjoyable, yet challenging, objectives to play through.</p>


<p>And a bonus expedition map means bonus exhibits to discover. You won’t be disappointed by the finds on offer as they all come with quirky fantasy qualities – complete with Two Point’s trademark wit and wackiness – and intriguing magical properties. Some exhibits can be worn by your staff to give them a level-up and others can be combined to unlock different features. I particularly enjoy the winged boots magical gear that send the wearer careening off through the museum waving their arms uncontrollably. Or the enchanted find that turns your guests into chickens. Just keep an eye on your expedition rewards – I found at least one of the same exhibit at two different POI’s (one at a much higher price point!).</p>


<p>This Two Point Museum DLC brings new features across the board. Yes, there are the normal unlockables that you’d get with different themes – new decorative items, gift shop gear and floor/wall panels – but Fantasy Finds doesn’t stop there. You’ll be treated to all sorts of additional add-ons like fortune-teller admission booths, tavern-like café furniture, three fresh guest types and themed receptionist announcements (which, let’s face it, is everyone’s favourite bit!).</p>
<p>Plus, Fantasy Finds comes with the latest Expert type, broken down into four subclasses: wizard, bard, rogue and barbarian. This is a brilliantly smart addition to the game, because each subclass of fantasy Expert has their own individual traits in the form strength, dexterity, intelligence and luck stats. Each subclass specialises in one of these four stats, but you can also upgrade and change these numbers if you need to. There’s a huge advantage to this because some POI’s can only be unlocked when a certain subclass reaches a high scale of speciality. In addition, particular POI events can be added or removed from your expedition if your combination of Experts bypasses a particular stat quantity. This is such a clever way of levelling up staff beyond the regular museum training regime and opens up loads of enticing possibilities for you to explore during your gameplay.</p>

<p>The only thing missing from Fantasy Finds is a themed museum. This seems a bit of an oversight as a fantasy museum would have been an entertaining accompaniment. This becomes a little frustrating if, like me, you’ve maxed out all of the other locations to the extent that they’ve started to become a bit laggy. The options then, are to start a new game – and start from curator class zero – have a play in sandbox or add your DLC loot to the recent free add-on museum, Pointy Mountains.</p>
<p>A word to the wise, if you do decide to use your DLC content in Pointy Mountains, your fantasy guest types won’t be able to visit your museum until you’ve achieved two stars. A few of the Scorched Earth POI’s can only be unlocked with buzz from these guests, so you’ll experience a short delay in being able to send expeditions to these areas.</p>

<p>But for me, reaching two stars in Pointy Mountains was a minor inconvenience if it meant I could start a museum from scratch while keeping my curator class, where I could explore all of the exciting features, quirky additions and clever add-ons that this DLC has to offer.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo My Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c715b5b2a21b9/nintendo-my-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of the big three platform holders, Nintendo is the 'family-friendly' one. <em>Did you know that?</em></p>
<p>Of course you did - you're an intelligent human being. And over the course of the Switch generation, with all the company's eggs now in a single console basket, Nintendo has diversified its business, leaning into non-gaming areas and getting its IP under the noses of a broader audience with mobile apps, movies, theme parks, stores, and all that game. This has been a stated goal for many years, and the monster success of <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> worked as planned, funnelling interest back to its gaming hardware and software, resulting in revenue bumps across the board.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xyqskm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>However, despite its colourful character roster appealing to kids across the age spectrum, the hand-eye coordination needed to operate a 'proper' video game is beyond the abilities of Nintendo's youngest fans. Until we evolve as a species, that's unlikely to change, so it's that demographic — the one-, two-, three-year-olds — that Nintendo is aiming at with this suite of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">'My Mario' products</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app, which is coming to Switch as well as smart devices, looks to be a simple touchscreen toy where you can interact with Mario by bopping him on the nose, tweaking his moustache, and generally poking and prodding at the poor plumber like many of us did on the start screen of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a> back in 1996. It's extremely simple stuff on the face of it, but it's designed to surprise, delight, and snare 'em young with that patented Nintendo charm.</p>
<p>Then there's the wood block set - or set<strong>s</strong>, rather. This is baby toy 101, giving the smallest kids the chance to play around with Nintendo characters without jabbing themselves in the eye with the pointy limb of an amiibo or gnawing on and potentially swallowing a Master Sword.</p>
<p>Looking at the high-res PR pics of these blocks, they appear to have the quality you'd expect from Nintendo. The paint and glaze over the blocks let the woodgrain show through, and they would look right at home next to any number of artisanal wooden block sets on the shelves at your local free-range toddler toy boutique - with prices to match.</p>

<p>Of course, there's the basic three-piece set offering Mario, a Question Block, and a Super Mushroom - that'll only set you back 2,980 yen (around $20 / £15). The characters are also amiibo, remember, so I can see this appealing to people who don't even have kids as a cute little display set.</p>
<p>The full 30-piece set, though — which also includes Luigi, Peach, and Yoshi, plus a wider selection of other items and blocks in a nice little case — comes in at a whopping 19,980 yen (around $135 / <em>£</em>100). There's no word yet on the RRP Nintendo will set for these when they come to the West at a later date, but I can hear the <em>"135 bucks for a bunch of wood?!?!"</em> comments already.</p>
<p>As somebody who has spent more time and money in ludicrously expensive boutique kids' toy shops than he'd like over the past few years, I can confirm that 100 quid for a bunch of glossy wooden blocks <em>isn't</em> unheard of. The NFC tag in the amiibo characters adds negligible production cost in itself, but given the need to embed them in the character blocks and the quality of the paint job and materials...yes, unfortunately, I don't see them coming in much cheaper when they arrive on our shores, either.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo My Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1031157f3afb4/nintendo-my-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, my own kids are a year or two past the point where these would appeal — we're in the steering-assisted-Mario-Kart, giggling-and-shouting-"Ooh, ba-nana!" phase right now — but newer Nintendo (grand)parents may find these irresistible. You know, for the kids. And I feel sorry for amiibo fiends who simply have to have every last one. <em>*glances furtively at the Billy bookcase*</em></p>
<p>Ahem. Then there's the Mario book, with pop-out bits and pieces. Yes, seeing all the promo images of smiling parents indoctrinating their defenceless youngsters into the cult of Nintendo gives off disquieting vibes, even for the biggest Nintendo fans. The Pokémon Company has certainly gone further in this direction, with kawaii plushies and products more specifically designed for the youngest of people, but Nintendo's never <em>quite</em> gone here before, never quite stepped into the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse like this, with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/movie/index.html">a stop-motion animated short series</a> and little romper suits and rattles aimed at tiny humans whose facility with a Joy-Con amounts to chewing on it. The Rosalina &amp; Luma Observatory Cot Mobile can't be far off.</p>
<p>Again, everything presented looks like a quality product, and it makes you wonder why it's taken Nintendo so long to go full Disney like this, targeting the audience fresh from the womb in a way that not even self-driving, self-steering, auto-item-deploying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> can manage. For the past decade or more, the Play-It-Loud generation has been phasing into parenthood, so I guess you can chalk this up to Nintendo's slow-and-steady approach. But, slow starters as they are, they're ready now - and they've got their marketing lasers trained on your toddlers.</p>
<p>And your wallets. But there's nothing new about that.</p>

              <p>Did Tencent just stealthily try to walk itself back from the brink after getting sued by Sony for trying to rush a <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">brazen ripoff of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> to market? Will the PlayStation 6 be Sony’s least important console yet? And do we finally have our first real clue as to when <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will come out? Welcome to the latest Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news, trailers, and other fascinating curios, like how the proprietor of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-BU6keEUw">Mom’s Spaghetti</a> is totally chill with being known as “<a href="https://twitter.com/Shadyind/status/1953257598129717757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953257598129717757%7Ctwgr%5E7f954647bca4ad74de71348ad09444d1288fa6ec%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwatch-eminem-react-to-being-called-that-guy-from-fortnite%2F1100-6533781%2F">The guy from <em>Fortnite</em></a>.”</p> <h2>Tencent tries to pretend the <em>Light of Motiram</em> never happened</h2> <p>The Chinese conglomerate was recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163">sued by Sony,</a> who alleged that Tencent kept trying to license <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> for a survival crafting game and, when Sony kept saying no, turned around and made it anyway. A week later, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/"><em>The Game Post</em> noticed</a> that developer Polaris Quest has quietly been changing out the worst offending images, language, and key art from the game’s Steam page.&nbsp;References to “colossal machines” and “Mechanimals” were stripped from the description and the screenshots and art now focus on generic scenes instead of <em>Light of Motiram</em>‘s Temu version of Aloy. Now that Sony has called Tencent’s bluff, it’ll probably continue to strip out the most egregious <em>Horizon</em> copycat elements from the game. We’ll see if that’s enough to get the PS5 maker to settle.</p> <h2>Sony is moving away from a “hardware centric business model” ahead of the PS6</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony Senior Vice President Sadahiko Hayakawa says they are gradually shifting their gaming business from a hardware centric business model to a community and engagement based platform business model <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayStation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayStation</a></p> <p>“In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric… <a href="https://t.co/8xnKyihMHE">pic.twitter.com/8xnKyihMHE</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The console war is grinding to an end. With <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> on PlayStation and<em> Helldivers 2</em> coming to Xbox, the old rivalries are slowly, if not completely, fading into the background. “In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement,” senior Sony VP Sadahiko Hayakawa said this week. While in line with the company’s previous comments about focusing more on total players and engagement time over unit sales, the remark still raised eyebrows as the PS5 continues to dominate. Former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment of America Shawn Layden responded with a GIF of <em>God of War</em>‘s Kratos <a href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1953706271594397696">putting his head in his hands</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Xbox Rog Ally release date may have just leaked</h2> <p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Dealabs poster billbil-kun</a>, the new PC gaming handhelds aiming to deliver Xbox-like console experiences will come out in Europe on October 16. Neither the date nor the price of the upcoming hardware has been officially revealed yet, though billbil-kun previously claimed it would cost €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the more powerful Xbox Ally X in Europe. We’ll have to wait and see how those prices translate to the U.S. amid Trump’s current tariff war.</p> <h2>A very convincing theory for<em> Silksong</em>‘s possible release date</h2> <p>Xbox fans will remember that Microsoft used <em>Silksong</em> to hype the Xbox Rog Ally reveal back during its Xbox summer showcase. The most wishlisted game on Steam would be “available at launch and in Game Pass when Ally releases later this year,” Xbox president Sarah Bond said at the time. Based on this, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/we-might-actually-have-a-tenuous-silksong-release-date-absolutely-nobody-on-my-team-believes-me-and-i-think-i-can-hear-hornet-in-my-walls/"><em>PC Gamer</em>‘s Harvey Randall</a> speculates that, if the October 16 leak is accurate, that could also be <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch date. That day is also a Thursday, which is when most new Switch 1 and Switch 2 games come out. Hmmm. Or maybe Bond simply meant that <em>Silksong</em> would already be out by the time the Xbox ROG Ally arrives, which, if that’s the case, is even better!</p> <h2><em>Ashes of the Singularity 2</em> is happening</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ashes of the Singularity II  |  Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SV3k4yxWKS0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The real-time strategy game known for its massive armies will return with a sequel nearly a decade later, this time with a human faction. There’s no release date yet and my current PC will just barely be able to run it but as a huge fan of<em> Total Annihilation</em>, one of the series’ influences, I can’t wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is set to add pet-like cosmetic "Companions" to its battle royale, a series of fresh leaks suggest. Initial designs include a range of dogs, as well as a turtle on a skateboard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Datamined images sourced from yesterday's new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> season update show what looks to be a golden retriever, a pair of pugs, a robot dog based on the game's iconic Cuddle Team Leader, and the aforementioned skateboard-wielding aquatic reptile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans have been aware of plans by developer Epic Games to release pet-like Companions for some time, based on bits of evidence dug up and posted online from past datamines. But today is our first glimpse at the Companions themselves, from what look to be user interface icons for them. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If Fortnite having pets sounds familiar, well, that's because the game <em>technically </em>has them already. During the early years of Fortnite battle royale, at least, the game offered "Pets" — animated animals — that you wore as a "backbling", or essentially like a rucksack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around a dozen or so of these Pets were released, usually within battle passes, with later designs becoming slightly more elaborate (a floating mind-controlling alien named Choppy is a personal fave, alongside a licensed Baby Yoda). But more recent years have seen Pets left by the wayside, despite fan calls for their return. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Fortnite Leaks 🕜 (@FortniteFNLK) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteFNLK/status/1953578096960938007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Epic Games is believed to be working on Companions as a far more evolved version of Pets, with the creatures able to scamper around in-game near your player character. Fans expect that these creatures will be visible to you and your squad of allies, though perhaps not to enemy players — so there's no blowing up of your new turtle buddy to be had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Epic Games is yet to acknowledge Companions as being in development, and it's still unclear if they will arrive this season. Whenever they do launch, however, Companions will be the first new cosmetic type introduced to Fortnite since November 2024, when the game introduced Kicks, better known as shoes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's big Fortnite update saw the game launch a new alien bug-infested season for its main battle royale portion, while Fortnite OG shifted into the beloved season where Kevin the Cube first appeared. Although, as we previously reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/something-is-wrong-fortnite-is-doing-something-strange-but-brilliant-with-its-og-mode-which-is-now-no-longer-just-a-carbon-copy-of-the-original">strange things are going on in Fortnite OG</a> — where the timeline appears to be occuring slightly differently this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Earlier this summer, a battle between gaming giants began when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a>, alleging that the latter's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">Light of Motiram</a>, is infringing on Sony's Horizon franchise. Now, Tencent appears to have revamped its presentation of Light of Motiram and downplayed its similarities to Sony's game.</p><p>Tencent has changed several elements on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>), including a new description for the game that drops all references to the mechanimals creatures in the story, which looked and sounded a lot like the ones from Horizon. The new description doesn't have many specific details at all, and instead tells players, "Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land."</p><p>The screenshots for Light of Motiram have also been swapped out on Steam and replaced with new pics that still retain some common elements with Horizon. But the screenshots that had a color palette and backgrounds similar to Horizon have been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546448" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546448"></a><figcaption>Archery is still a big part of Light of Motiram.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg"></figure><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-pitched-sony-on-a-horizon-game-set-in-asia/1100-6533509/" data-ref-id="1100-6533509">detailed in Sony's lawsuit</a>, Tencent pitched a Horizon spin-off that would have featured the game's heroine, Aloy, traveling to Asia and encountering new mechanimals inspired by Eastern mythology as well as a brand-new cast of characters. Sony rejected the pitch and alleges that Tencent and developer Polaris Quest went ahead with the game regardless of the company's wishes.</p><p>Light of Motiram's Steam page gives the game a Q4 2027 release window. However, if Sony's lawsuit is successful, the game's release may be in question.</p>

                <p>The fantasy shooters Heretic and Hexen have been remastered and re-released for modern platforms, allowing longtime fans and new players to experience these cult classics all over again. Originally developed by Raven Software and released in 1994 and 1995, the games stood out for combining fast-paced first-person shooter gameplay with dark-fantasy settings and RPG mechanics--a big departure from the sci-fi and military themes popular at the time.</p><p>The remastered collection, Heretic + Hexen, is now available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. This definitive edition includes new features such as two brand-new episodes, support for community-made mods, and both local and online multiplayer. Players can team up in co-op or compete in deathmatch modes, with up to 16 players supported in online play and split-screen options on all platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnzow2f3Rt4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jnzow2f3Rt4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Heretic featured a long protagonist--the elven warrior Corvus--Hexen introduced a class-based system, giving players a choice between three characters: the strong and fast Fighter (Baratus), the spell-casting but fragile Mage (Daedolon), and the balanced Cleric (Parias). Each has unique weapons, abilities, and ways to use items, adding some level of replayability and variety of gameplay style. This feature, along with the game's fantasy setting, helped set Hexen apart in the early days of first-person shooters.</p><p>One of the biggest improvements is full cross-platform multiplayer, allowing players across different systems to join games quickly using a room code. The remaster also includes access to the Raven Vault, a collection of behind-the-scenes materials from the original development. For music fans, there's the option to switch between the original MIDI and FM Synth soundtracks or enjoy a modern remix by composer Andrew Hulshult.</p><p>If you already own the original versions of Heretic or Hexen, you'll be able to access and download them on the same platform. Players who already own the original versions of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel receive a free upgrade to Heretic + Hexen in their respective game library on the same platforms.</p><p>Steam and GOG versions include these originals as launch options or downloads. The remaster only requires a Bethesda account to access online multiplayer and browse or upload mods, depending on your platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have released a brand new car database for <i>Gran Turismo 7</i>, which contains information on the 500-plus vehicles currently available to drive in the racing sim.</p>

<p>The database, which you can access <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/gt7/carlist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, contains 539 cars for you to peruse, and it looks like new ones will be added when the game gets further updates as well.</p>

<p>A number of different organization methods are available for the new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>car list; you can view cars sorted by manufacturer, by the country or region from which they originate, and even by individual specs like drivetrain, power, and weight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-car-database-racing.jpg?itok=j6ehMQIA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-car-database-racing.jpg?itok=lmSY8HL1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't know what this car is, but I bet the new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>database does.</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking on each car will give you a detailed breakdown of that car's specs, including stats like its displacement, max power (I got it from a hairdryer), and max torque, among other things.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to see a gallery of images of the car from different angles, so this new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>car database really is a gearhead's dream. If you've ever wanted to just chill out and read info about cars, this is the place to do it.</p>

<p>You can view the car list either as a series of images of each car or as a more prosaic text list, so if you're just looking for cars of a particular weight class or max BHP value, then you can simply switch to the text view and find what you're looking for.</p>

<p>Released in 2022,&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates since launching, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">latest of which</a> gives you the chance to drive an incredibly rare car (in the game, of course, not in real life, as fun as that would be).</p>

              <p>Late on August 7, <em>GTA</em> publisher Take Two put out its quarterly earnings report, accompanied by a shareholder Q&amp;A and interviews with CEO Strauss Zelnick appearing on various outlets. Obviously, the big question everyone had is: How much are you going to charge for <em>GTA 6</em>? Zelnick chose to deliver some extra-special corporate gloop instead of actually answering.</p> <p>Rumors have been flying back and forth over the price of next year’s&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>, with a recent round of “industry analyst” nonsense <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/analyst-says-i-expect-a-usd100-price-point-for-gta-6-estimates-rockstars-development-cost-is-over-usd1-5-billion-and-predicts-it-will-earn-usd10-billion-lifetime-and-another-usd500-million-annually-from-gta-online/">declaring that the game will cost $100</a>. However, while something around $70 to $80 seems far more likely, Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick avoided giving a price when speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p> <p>Game prices are in something of a hinterland, with many publishers wanting to follow Nintendo’s lead up to a standard price of $80 but seemingly being afraid to push the button. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">Microsoft recently backtracked on the plan</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">EA has made clear it intends to stick with $70 for the foreseeable future</a>, and perhaps most relevantly here, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">Take Two recently said&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> would be $70</a>, after <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-games-1851781445">Randy Pitchford made a twerp of himself on the subject</a>. Many, however, are predicting that if any game could push prices up, it’s&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>.</p>

 <p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, Zelnick put modesty aside and said of <em>GTA 6</em>, “I do think it’s fair to say that this is perhaps the most highly anticipated property pre-release in the history of entertainment.” Given this confidence, you might think the CEO would be willing to just state the intended price for the game. However, when&nbsp;<em>Variety&nbsp;</em>spoke to him, he instead prevaricated.</p> <p>“Our goal is always to deliver more value than we charge,” Zelnick told the outlet, which are words that <em>look</em> like they should mean something. He continued, “so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever.” Mentioning special editions and so on, the response finished, “I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it.” Yes, but how much will it cost?</p> <p>Zelnick was equally bemusing about <em>Borderlands 4</em> during August 8’s earnings call, responding to a shareholder question about why <em>that</em> game will be $70, “We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing. So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth.” Yes, but why is it $70?</p>

 <p>When 2020 prices were stepping up from $60 to $70 as a console standard, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-interactive-next-gen-software-price-increases-reflect-the-quality-of-the-experience">Zelnick wasn’t nearly so shy</a> about justifying the increased costs. “We think with the value we offer consumers…and the kind of experience you can really only have on these next-generation consoles, that the price is justified,” the CEO told <em>GI.biz</em> at the time. “But it’s easy to say that when you’re delivering extraordinary quality, and that’s what our company prides itself on doing.”</p> <p>So, we still have no idea what Take Two will be charging for May 26’s&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. Presumably there’s a desire to hold off and see which way the wind blows over the next nine months. Given Nintendo is sticking to its guns at $80 for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but then confusing everything by charging $70 for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, there’s no clear indication yet. Certainly Microsoft and Sony appear to be sticking to $70 for the upcoming holiday season, but it seems entirely possible that $80 will creep in during 2026.</p> <p>And yes, sure, Take Two&nbsp;<em>could</em> charge $100 for&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>, but it’d be a bad move that would do reputational damage to both the publisher and the game. Presumably there will be a “premium” version priced at around $100, and possibly another at $130 or more, but it seems vanishingly unlikely the vanilla game will cost more than eighty bucks.</p>

<p>Sales of the Grand Theft Auto franchise have been revealed, and the series is nearing 455 million units sold. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto is one of the most popular gaming franchises in history, having released several iconic titles, including GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, and GTA 5, among others. GTA 5 is one of the longest-running games available today, spanning three generations of consoles and accounting for nearly half of the franchise’s sales. </p>



<h2 id="h-gta-series-has-sold-close-to-half-a-billion-units">GTA Series Has Sold Close to Half a Billion Units</h2>



<p>The new sales details for the GTA series were announced during Take-Two’s latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> (via <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/465433/gta-series-approaches-455m-rdr-series-tops-104m-borderlands-series-tops-94m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>). One of the slides reveals that the Grand Theft Auto franchise has sold “nearly 455 million units”, out of which GTA 5 has sold 215 million units. GTA 5 has also reached $1 billion in retail sales faster than any entertainment release in history and has been the “best-selling title of the past 10 years in the U.S., based on both unit and dollar sales.”</p>



<p>Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption series has also surpassed 104 million units in sales, with RDR2 accounting for over 77 million of those units. The NBA 2K franchise has sold over 162 million units, the Borderlands series has sold over 94 million units, and Sid Meier’s Civilisation has sold over 77 million units. </p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two CEO has dodged a question on whether GTA 6 will be priced at $80, stating that the upcoming title will have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fair-price-80-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a ‘fair price’</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lazlow-doubt-gta-6-longest-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">longest-serving actor</a> in GTA doubts he will be included in GTA 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher Kalypso Media announced Disciples: Domination, a new installment in the dark fantasy turn based strategy RPG franchise. This is the direct sequel to 2021's Disciples: Liberation (currently 65% off on Steam), though the developer has changed. Whereas Liberation was made by Canadian developer Frima Studio, Domination is being developed by French developer Artefacts Studio.</p>



<p>The narrative of Disciples: Domination begins fifteen years after the ending of Liberation, when Avyanna freed Nevendaar from the gods' tyrannical grip. Players will step on Queen Avyanna’s throne and attempt to hold together a crumbling kingdom.</p>



<p>The fire of doubt burns within the Queen, sparked by the weight of the Yllian throne and stoked by dreams of becoming the monsters she once defied and destroyed. Paralyzed by fear and haunted by her own power, her rule begins to crumble, with allies disappearing and abandoning her just as an unknown force spreads strife and madness throughout her realm.</p>



<p>Players' choices will shape the future, whether for salvation or ruin. As they chase the truths behind the ceaseless conflicts, dark magic, and conspiracies infecting the empire, they must also face betrayal, strife, and shadowy schemes. </p>



<p>Over the course of Disciples: Domination, they'll get to choose their companions. They can be consulted for guidance on the many choices that will shape the faction's reputation and impact how others react to Avyanna's rule. In combat, players will lead their army in tactical, grid-based battles with faster pacing, dynamic events, and richer interaction. New skills, faction abilities, and unit synergies deepen the strategic options available, along with the unique system of strengths and weaknesses.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sega Sales and Profit Fall Due to "Weaker" Back Catalog]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-q1-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sales-and-profit-fall-due-to-weaker-back-catalog.1265550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released its financial summary for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and things aren't looking too good for the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>studio, although the outlook for the rest of the year is a little rosier.</p>

<p>As revealed in Sega's latest financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250808_q1_presentation_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, sales and income for the company's core gaming segment have fallen when compared to the same period last year. Sega puts this down to "repeat sales", i.e. sales of games from its back catalog, performing "weaker compared to expectations".</p>

<p>Indeed, across the board, Sega's sales are down by around 23%, with income also falling significantly. Despite this, Sega says its first quarter "exceeded expectation", with the company's pachislot and pachinko machine segment getting "off to a good start" this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-financials-q1-2025-raidou-remastered.jpg?itok=y_Rk1x5n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-financials-q1-2025-raidou-remastered.jpg?itok=_fKB5D03 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sega's first-quarter releases haven't made up for a shortfall in back catalog sales.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sega, its releases for this quarter, which include titles like June's&nbsp;<em>Raidou Remastered</em>&nbsp;and a remaster of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine</em>, performed "as expected", as did the company's existing free-to-play offerings.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, a free-to-play game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked" rel="nofollow">released in the West</a>&nbsp;in June, has gotten off to a steady start, according to Sega. Unfortunately, these games weren't enough to make up for a shortfall in back catalog sales for Sega.</p>

<p>The company's forecast for the rest of the year is looking a little more optimistic, however. Sega reckons it'll do better this year than last when it comes to sales, driven largely by the release of new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>titles later in 2025.</p>

<p>Indeed, Sega's first quarter may have been a little more lucrative had the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">not canceled&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">Football Manager 25</a>&nbsp;</em>in order to focus on its successor earlier this year, but from a quality perspective, that was likely the right decision to take.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode has been given a Fall 2025 release window, indicating it won’t be available at launch. </p>



<p>The remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 is all set to release on August 28, 2025, bringing players back to their beloved stealth action title. The title will feature the same story and world, with brand new visuals and audio, improving on the core experience of the original. The title was also going to receive a brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-reveals-fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer game mode</a> called Fox Hunt, but it seems that will be available post-launch.</p>







<p>Konami has posted a new update on its <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, which provides a release window for Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode. The post only states ‘Fall 2025’ without giving an exact release date. As the MGS 3 Remake is set to release at the end of this month, it seems players will have to do without the Fox Hunt multiplayer mode for some time. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode is a hide-and-seek-based online experience. Here, players will utilise elements unique to Metal Gear, including camouflage and survival. The game mode features sneaking gameplay elements iconic to the Metal Gear series, and the new visual enhancements help make the experience that much more immersive. </p>



<p>Worry not, as the other two game modes of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be available at launch. PlayStation and Steam players will receive ‘Snake vs Monkey’, where you have to round up all the escaped apes as Snake. Xbox Series X/S will receive ‘Snake vs Bomberman’, where you have to blast these bombermen across different stages. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forza Motorsport Video Review In Progress</p>
      </div>
<p>The studio says that it has <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-21-featured-tours" rel="nofollow ">several events planned for Forza Motorsport</a> throughout August and September, starting with the return of Track Toys Tour as a permanent feature in the game. At the start of each month, an additional Tour will be added to the game until all of these have returned.</p><p>Layoffs at Turn 10 come at a time when the Forza franchise is experiencing positive growth on PS5. Since Microsoft shifted to a multiplatform strategy for its first-party games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-biggest-game-of-2025-is-a-former-xbox-exclusive-analyst-says/1100-6533368/">Forza Horizon 5 and several other former Xbox exclusives</a> have been some of the best-selling games on PS5. Forza Motorsport hasn't been ported to the console yet, but it could only be a matter of time until it does, given the success of other Xbox games on the Sony platform.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Microsoft reported a net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">for its latest quarter</a>, and a few months later, statements issued by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-tries-to-defend-shutdown-of-award-winning-hi-fi-rush-studio/1100-6523342/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> about the staff cuts weren't well-received. </p>

<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157925/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest misses for me personally with the original Switch is that none of the more popular sports games of our time, and I mean these big EA and 2K efforts like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a> here, and the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_24">FC 24</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">25</a>, aren't up to standard seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>There have been decent enough<em>-ish</em> attempts, some of those footie games mentioned will do in a pinch (and they're leagues ahead of the awful legacy FIFAs which preceded them), but if you're someone who plays on Switch exclusively, you've been missing out on some fluidity, responsiveness, clarity of image, and a bunch of other stuff wot makes fancy modern sports games play good, innit.</p>
<p>And so, Madden 26 on Switch 2 is absolutely a triumph in most regards. It plays well, it runs decently, and it looks not too far removed from other console versions. I'm also playing the game on my PS5 in early access at the moment (forgive me, Mario), and so I can tell you that existing menu issues, long loading times, and/or a persistent issue that's locking me out of Madden 26 because the servers are busy, well, that's all happening on both systems.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157921/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's lucky that I'm comparing it to PS5 here, actually, because I probably would have, and did initially, think it was all just too much, once again, for a Nintendo console to handle. However, this is not the case. Early access is just a little messy right now, pals.</p>
<p>Indeed, for a Madden effort that's really been impressing me thus far with its new additions (and a slick new overall look and vibe to its menus), it's a real shame that, if the servers are having any issues at all, the game is booting you out of whatever you are doing. Sort it before launch, folks, pretty please.</p>
<p>These teething problems aside, I think we've got a banger on our hands here; this is the best Madden I've played in a good few years. Now, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/madden_nfl_25">Madden 25</a> was no slouch either, and in terms of its on-field action, it had got everything feeling better than it had done in years. Offensively, there was more time and room on the ball, runs felt easier to pick out, the AI was smarter in making them, and tackles with the hit stick had never looked or felt more impactful and powerful. We were already in a decent spot with this franchise, even if the modes on offer were getting a little stale.</p>

<p>With Madden 26, we've got improvements that make last year's effort immediately redundant to anyone who spends much time playing these things. And for newcomers, this is a fantastic Madden to get started on your gridiron journey with, because they've juiced the hell out of the tutorials. Oh yeah. The new training games and skill challenges here blow the old ways of learning out of the water. You earn some cool rewards, the challenges are actually fun, and the game does a much better job of pointing you towards things.</p>
<p>This refresh on the training front really does make it much easier to get to grips with, and it's worth old heads having a look around, too, and not just for all the rewards, coins, and all that nonsense. You'll probably also find yourself learning little things you didn't know. It's deep and it covers all bases (wrong sport, but whatever) with regards to taking you from how to run or pass, when to run or pass, how to make up yards, and all that basic core stuff, right through to fancy skills and strategies and things that my brain refuses to listen to.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157923/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the field of play, it looks better than ever, which is no surprise, and although there's plenty of weird limb and funny collision moments going on thanks to the fancy new physics model, it plays a better game than last year, and you can feel that immediately.</p>
<p>Now, the first and really only issue with the Switch 2 version crops up here as the game is running at what I'm <em>guessing</em> is 40fps in both docked and handheld modes. In handheld mode, this feels absolutely 100% fine. The game also looks very, very close to other consoles when played on the Switch 2's LCD screen. I've given this the biggest test I could, playing games whilst alternating between a PS5 Pro and a Switch 2, and honestly, give it five minutes — ten minutes if you're grumpy — and you get used to the slight drop in slickness.</p>
<p>I should note here that there is a more important sticking point with the lowered frame rate, and that is cross-play being ditched on Switch 2. It's a shame, for sure, but an understandable measure given you'd be fighting an uphill battle against lots of Captain 60fps opponents.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157924/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, in docked mode on your TV, it's a bit more noticeable. The resolution drop makes the play-arts and other things that appear in-game look a little less refined, and the reduced frame rate takes a little longer to bed in with. Again, I've been switching between this and a PS5 Pro in 4K, so it's a harsh test, and for me the Switch 2 version of Madden 26 passes it pretty easily. This is a version of the game that I will very happily play when I can't get to my other console, and for gamers who only have a Switch 2, there's nothing in terms of performance or quality of the port that should stop you from picking this one up. Hooray!</p>
<p>Moving on, Franchise has been the one mode that I reckon long-time fans have felt needs a reboot most, and in this year's game it's definitely much better. This time out, you choose a coach philosophy to get you started (so you may choose to run with an aggressive, strategic, defensively-minded character - all based on real coaches and real data, apparently) before jumping into an improved character creation suite to make your manager look how you like. There's still not a devastatingly terrible widow's peak to make my guy look just like me yet, but I've found one close enough that I'm willing to let this slide - for now.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157920/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything about Franchise mode feels tidier this year. It's much more addictive to play, too, thanks to lovely things like new equippable abilities that can be unlocked with skill points and will change depending on what coach philosophy you are coming from. Franchise this year also has brand new presentation packages, with fresh halftime shows and presenter bits to camera, primetime TV-styled stuff, and lots of other bells and whistles, making for a game that feels way, way closer to watching NFL on the telly. Heck, teams even have their own entrances and pre-game presentations, and the jumbotrons and hoardings in stadiums are more exciting.</p>
<p>Weather now plays a factor in games, with hot climates making your little smashers tired more quickly - and while we're on that topic, the snow games look great. Yes, even on the Switch 2!. This is also a much faster game in general, and the new animation system (which I don't understand, but apparently it's got more branching so it can be more reactive in any given moment) makes it feel much closer to EA's other American footie game.</p>
<p>Indeed, I have also been playing lots of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ea_sports_college_football_25">EA Sports College Football</a> of late, and last year it was better than Madden. It was zippier and fresher, and it just felt like the more fun game to play. On the pitch it was more...expressive, let's say, and it blew Madden out of the water with its presentation, honestly.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157926/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, you can feel how both games are much closer, sharing lots of UI features and gameplay similarities, not just on the field, but in how all of the modes work and flow. And this is a good thing! It's much tighter this year, with both games offering a very high standard of action, and I can't say I can pick a favourite just yet between the two.</p>
<p>Away from Franchise mode, Ultimate Team is still an incredibly, dangerously addictive thing to get involved in. It took me about an hour to have my first actual match, as there are so many packs to open starting out. But I can't help myself with this kind of thing and I'm fully involved in the yearly grind for all the best cards. You already know if this mode is for you and — if you can control yourself — it's a blast, with a ton of ways to play both on and offline with your team of superstars. Team-themed rewards are also a nice touch here, with my Las Vegas Raiders getting lots of bespoke gear and profile items that match my fave team, which keeps me hooked way better than getting lots of random crap. Note, there is still lots of random crap, if that's what you are into.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157922/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Across the rest of the game, well, it's business as usual in terms of the crazy amount of modes there are to toy around with, all the usuals are here, with an almost endless array of offline and online ways to play. I do loathe how progression and rewards in some modes require an online connection, but at least you can create your franchise and whatnot at the outset so that you can have it work offline.</p>
<p>When playing online, it must be noted, there's also a world of difference here in trying to get a match. It all works just like it should - there's no Switch slowdown or waiting for an extra ten minutes because the images aren't loading in.</p>
<p>And so, overall, we've got a port that scared the bejeezus out of me initially. I really thought those early server issues and laggy menus were just more of the same for Switch 2 owners coming from a bevvy of bad ports on Switch 1. However, this is not the case. Madden 26 on Switch 2, once you get used to the drop in frame rate compared to elsewhere, is a perfectly good way to play this excellent outing - a version I'll happily play alongside others on more powerful hardware.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Server issues at launch aside, and with the loss of cross-play noted, Madden 26 is a very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory. Yes, you'll need to get used to a drop in the frame rate to 40fps on Switch 2, but it's a reasonable downgrade in order to get this type of game running as well as it does on a portable machine. It really is a very close match in all other ways to other consoles.</p>
<p>For newcomers, this is one of the best Madden games I've played in terms of teaching you the ropes, and for the returning hardcore, the improvements on the pitch, and with regards to presentation, should impress where its predecessor felt a bit lacking.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Take-Two reported outstanding results for its first fiscal quarter of 2026, delivering total net bookings of $1.42 billion, up 17% compared to the $1.22 billion registered during last year’s fiscal first quarter. Net bookings from recurrent consumer spending (virtual currency, add-on content, in-game purchases and in-game advertising) also grew 17%, accounting for 83% of total net bookings. The most significant contributors to the record net bookings were NBA 2K25, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Toon Blast, Match Factory!, Color Block Jam, Empires &amp; Puzzles, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words With Friends, and Toy Blast.</p>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was understandably bullish, especially since the publisher has arguably its strongest games lineup on the horizon. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a> ahead of the financial report, the executive listed a series of games coming next year, and in doing so also included Ken Levine's next game, Judas.</p>



<p><em>We have a number of releases coming in the next 12 months – it's probably our most robust release schedule ever. Obviously, Mafia: The Old Country is available on Steam and console. We have NBA 2K26 coming, Borderlands 4, which I'm really excited about, and WWE 2K mobile for Netflix. We've got WWE 2K26, then of course, GTA 6.</em></p>



<p><em>We have CSR 3 coming from Zynga, Judas coming from Ghost Story Games, and Project Ethos coming from 2K. It's the most robust lineup I've ever been able to talk about this far in advance.</em></p>



<p>The concept behind Judas, the so-called narrative LEGOs, has been in the works for over a decade. Levine famously hosted a GDC presentation about it in 2014 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed it again in late 2015</a>. The game itself was <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> about fifteen months later. Just last month, Levine <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-creator-glad-allowed-design-judas-no-live-service/">thanked Take-Two</a> for not forcing Ghost Story Games to add live service elements.</p>



<p>That Judas is coming in the next twelve months is great news for the publisher, especially since the actual BioShock successor is <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-reportedly-development-hell-failed-review-narrative-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly in development trouble</a> and may not materialize for quite a while yet.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the GI.biz interview, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick expressed his strong confidence that Mafia: The Old Country would be successful:</p>



<p><em>I feel great about it. It's a wonderful premium title, it's priced right and it's really beautiful.</em></p>

			<p>Physint, Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/">return</a> to the stealth action genre, is not going to be shown anytime soon, as work on the game is still in a very early phase.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/">IndieWire</a> in a fresh interview, the legendary game director was asked about what he is working on following the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, confirming that work is proceeding on the mysterious <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">OD project</a>, and on Physint, although Kojima-san is working by himself on the latter as it's still in the conceptual phase. While this doesn't come as a surprise, considering it was made abundantly clear back in May that the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/">five or six years away</a> by Kojima-san himself, it's still a little disappointing to hear that even a first look at the game is really far away.</p>



<p>With Physint still in the conceptual phase, the mysterious OD project will undoubtedly be Hideo Kojima's next project to see the light of day. Following its announcement, very little has been said about the project in development with Microsoft, making some fear that it was cancelled alongside many other projects, including high-profile games like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot</a> and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">MMO from the developers of The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. Thankfully, the project seems to be safe, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/">work is continuing.</a></p>



<p>Though not a stealth action game in the capacity Physint will likely be, Hideo Kojima's latest game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, does have <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-make-stealth-and-combat-way-more-enjoyable-with-this-one-game-changing-trick/">a few mechanics</a> that bring the Metal Gear Solid series to mind, including some significant improvements for stealth and combat mechanics.

            <p>Waiting's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">a bit of theme</a> during the early stages of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta, which has otherwise been earning a lot of thumbs up from FPS heads. If you've recently run into an never-ending loading screen while trying to jump into a Conquest match, the good news is that the devs have been working to solve those issues.</p>
<p>While EA reckon the problem's specific to that game mode and the Siege of Cairo map, that doesn't look to have stopped plenty of players from running into it over the past 24 hours. Cue a number of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mkcz0j/infinite_loading_screen_glitch_in_beta/">frustrated</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mko40z/bug_as_of_this_morning_i_cant_get_into_a_game/">Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mklzer/need_infinite_loading_screen_fix_asap/">posts</a> that boil down to the word 'stuck' being yelled so loud it could bring down a helicopter.</p>

<p>"Our team has been investigating reports of an infinite loading screen sometimes occurring when matchmaking into Siege of Cairo while playing Conquest," the official Battlefield Comms account tweeted this morning. "We've identified the cause and are performing server restarts to resolve this. These restarts will not affect players currently in-match. Thank you for your patience."</p>
<p>While waiting for EA to address the issue, folks had been trying stuff like verifying the game's files on Steam or restarting it to solve their problems.</p> <div>

<p>With those server restarts, hopefully Cairo conquesters'll no longer keep getting stuck staring at some soldiers' shapely posteriors in perma-load, and be back to staring at a soldier's shapely posterior because they've decided to use someone else as cover mid-match. It's a strategy. A crap one, but hey, some of us aren't blessed with Alexander the Great's tactical nous.</p>
<p>For those waiting until this weekend to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-early-access">jump into the Battlefield beta</a>, first of all congrats on likely missing the longest queues.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fair-price-80-dollars/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-dodges-question-on-gta-6-costing-80-or-more-says-it-will-have-a-%E2%80%9Cfair-price%E2%80%9D.1265505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has said that GTA 6 will have a “fair price” when the game releases in 2026.</p>



<p>Following a question from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> ahead of Take-Two’s recent quarterly earnings report, the outlet asked Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick about $80 games and what that means for GTA 6.</p>



<p>According to Zelnick, that announcement will come from Rockstar Games, the developer behind GTA 6, in due time.</p>



<p>“Our goal always is to deliver more value than what we charge, so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever. As you know, the approach of the industry is to launch at a premium price, sometimes with special editions, and over time, typically to reduce the price to enhance the overall size of the market. We do the very same thing. I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it,” Zelnick said.</p>



<p>So to put it bluntly, Zelnick dodged the question pretty perfectly (hurrah for training), diverting the question from the actual price point to the value to customers.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-release-at-the-80-price-point">Will GTA 6 Release at the $80 Price Point?</h2>



<p>Frankly, I find it hard to believe that GTA 6 won’t release at $80. Nintendo has already got the accolade for being the first publisher to make that plunge, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-cuts-prices-of-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-holiday-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft recently pulled back on their price increase</a>s, Take-Two won’t want to miss out on another 14% increase, especially for a game like Grand Theft Auto that is going to sell at that price point regardless.</p>



<p>Will other publishers follow suit with $80 games after GTA 6? I’d argue yes, and while Microsoft’s decision to revert their price points suggests otherwise, I believe it was a strategic move based on their current game pipeline and the issues the company is currently facing.</p>



<p>Another common rumor floating around is that GTA 6 will launch at $100, and while I don’t think that will be the case, they’ll almost certainly have an edition to tempt us, and likely go beyond that price point. </p>



<p>What do you think of GTA 6 costing $80 is a fair price? Do you think it will be justified, and what do you think of other games following suit?

            <p>
Retro fans rejoice! Raven Software's legendary (or at the very least, fondly remembered) fantasy FPS twosome Heretic and Hexen have risen from the grave and received the remaster treatment on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, courtesy of retro specialists Nightdive.
</p>
<p>
Heretic, for those too young to remember, originally released in 1994 while its sequel, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, released one year later, with Raven Software - these days best known for its work on Call of Duty - creating both using a modified version of the Doom Engine. But while the titles had much in common with id Software's seminal shooter, they managed to bring something new to the still-fledgling genre with their medieval fantasy setting; beefy guns and demonic hordes making way for swords, spell-casting, character classes, and the likes of monstrous spiders, golems, gargoyles, and the undead.
</p>
<p>
Both games have garnered plenty of fans over the years, and have gone on to inspire the likes of developer Indefatigable's superb 2018 retro-shooter throwback Amid Evil, but the originals are now set to enjoy a new lease of life thanks to Nightdive Studios.

<p>
Nightdive - the team responsible for many an acclaimed remaster, including the recent upgrades for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-review">System Shock 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-is-another-nightdive-triumph">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a> - announced its new Heretic + Hexen release ahead of this year's QuakeCon. Both games have now been finessed for modern machines and rereleased, alongside a whole bunch of extras, in one reasonably priced bundle.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Heretic + Hexen gathers together Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders (combining both the original 1994 game and its expansion), Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen's Deathkings of the Dark Citadel expansion. That's alongside two new episodes, Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur.
</p>
<p>
Multiplayer fans have a variety of options too. There's split-screen local multiplayer for up to four players on all platforms (that's increased to eight players on Xbox Series X/S and PC), as well as cross-platform online support for co-op and deathmatch - the latter accommodating up to 16 players. There's also community mod support, the option to toggle between the original midi/FM soundtracks and a new version by composer Andrew Hulshult, new accessibility features, plus a "vault" containing a collection of behind-the-scenes development materials.
</p>
<p>
Switch supports up to 720p/60fps in handheld mode or 1080p/60ps when docked (there's no native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> support, sadly), while 1080p/60fps is available on PS4 and Xbox One. PS4 Pro and Xbox One X shunt that up to native 4K/60fps, and you can expect native 4k/120fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. PC resolution and framerates are, obviously, dependent on hardware.
</p>
<p>
Heretic + Hexen is available now on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam, GOG, and the Windows Store), and costs £13.49/$14.99. It's also available as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Anyone considering purchasing it should check out the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes">accompanying FAQ</a>, as players who own certain earlier editions are eligible for a free upgrade.

              <p>It’s time for your monthly reminder that your Amazon Prime subscription also comes with a bunch of free games. And in many cases, while that “free” perhaps deserves scarequotes for falling under a subscription fee for a monstrously evil corporation, they’re actually yours to keep forever, with no DRM, and no requirement to keep up your sub. That’s true for eight of this month’s offerings, including&nbsp;<em>Civilization III </em>and&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition.</em></p> <p>The reason for this proper, actual ownership is Prime partners with GOG for a lot of the games it includes in the subscription, meaning that you’re getting a code that allows you to download a DRM-free version of the game that boots from an .exe, rather than requiring any launchers or proprietary software. So while you may observe that&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> is a 24-year-old game, and as such perhaps not quite matching the sorts of games added to services like PS Plus or Game Pass, in this case you’re getting&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> to&nbsp;<em>keep</em>. You could also point out that the game is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">currently available on GOG for $0.75</a>, which is approximately 185 times cheaper than an annual Prime subscription, and there I couldn’t argue back.&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em>, however, is $25, so that’s definitely a sweeter deal. And, you know, as much as that game definitely shouldn’t have been called “<em>Thief</em>,” and as embarrassing as its <em>The Crow</em> cosplay may have been, it’s actually a pretty decent game in its own right.</p> <p>Amazon Prime likes to make it as confusing as possible to acquire your freebies, releasing the games in four separate batches across the month, guaranteeing you to forget at least some of them. It also removes other games from the selection at the same times, really keeping you on your toes. But the two headline games for August are <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">both there to grab right now</a>, along with big names added in July like&nbsp;<em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> and&nbsp;<em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em>. Also coming later this month are&nbsp;<em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em>–an expandalone entry in Travis Baldtree’s legendary&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like series–and last year’s deckbuilding roguelite&nbsp;<em>Necroking</em>. Here’s the full list of games for August:</p> <p><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>The Academy: The First Riddle</em> (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 14</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Filthy Animals – Heist Simulator</em> (Epic Games Store)</li> <li><em>Tin Hearts</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Necroking&nbsp;</em>(GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 21</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective&nbsp;</em>(Amazing Games App)</li> <li><em>Silver Box Classics</em> (GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 28</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Heroes of Loot 2</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Fantasy Empires</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>City Legends: The Ghost of Misty Hill Collector’s Edition</em> (Legacy Games)</li> </ul> <p>You also get a bunch of games via the Amazon cloud gaming doodad, Luna, which rotate in and out. It currently contains&nbsp;<em>Saints Row: The Third</em>,&nbsp;<em>SkateBIRD</em>,&nbsp;<em>Overcooked! 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, among others.</p>
