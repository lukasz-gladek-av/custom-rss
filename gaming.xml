            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arc Raiders </em>sales have soared past another huge milestone, according to developer and publisher Embark Studios, and there's a lovely free gift waiting for you to claim by way of a thank you.</p><p>As <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> on social media earlier today, <em>Arc Raiders </em>has now sold 12 million copies, which means that in the time between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mid-November</a> and now, the game has racked up a whopping eight million more sales for itself. Not bad at all.</p><p>The free gift in question is available until 11:59pm CET today (that's around 5:59pm Eastern), and it was originally prepared for <em>Arc Raiders </em>hitting 10 million sales, but as Embark says, players "blew straight past [that milestone] over the winter break".</p><figure role="group">

            <p>Be very, very quiet. I'm hunting bugs. Or so will say the folks who don the gear of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s next warbond. It's dubbed Redacted Regiment and it's all about looking stealthy in a tactical fashion. As opposed to simply trying to hide in a corner because you're a coward, as I've unashamedly done numerous times while serving Super Earth.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491587748125214428">next gear pack</a> for the shooter's set to arrive on January 20th, and marks the first proper new addition its gotten since the calendar flipped over in 2026. So, what sort of kit is it delivering in return for hard-earned super credits? Well, in two words, sneaky shit.</p>
<p>Both of its primary weapons - the R-72 Censor and AR-59 Suppressor - are rifles with integrated quietening tech. I mean the latter's literally named after said quietening tech, so you probably guessed that. The Censor's aimed at taking down targets at medium range, while the Suppressor has a longer reach. The armour sets which accompany these armaments are similarly sneaky. The RS-89 Shadow Paragon set's your standard light tactical infiltrator getup, complete with 15 million pockets, while the RS–67 Null Cipher set provides medium protection thanks to angular metal planting designed to ditch radar detection.</p><p>They come with a "Concealed Insertion" booster, which whacks up a smoke screen to emerge through when your hellpod touches down, completing the hushed hitman ensemble. Rounding things out are a sidearm in the P-35 Re-Educator pistol, which shoots dart that make enemies delirious. Then, there are a couple of explodey things in the form of a backpack full of C4 as a stratagem and a mine which lures foes to it before enboomening.</p>
<p>It all looks decently fun, but I'd say it's a bit too dry to mirror the wackier warbonds which I reckon are where Helldivers 2's slapstick shootery really shines. No <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">wormhole teleportation packs</a> to be seen here, though I suppose if every set of new gear had one, it wouldn't be as special.</p>
<p>Odds seem good that once this warbond's live, Arrowhead might start cracking into whatever regimen of new battle scenarios or galactic threats they have planned for the game's unending war this year. Things have been fairly quiet since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/giant-new-bug-worms-of-helldivers-2-i-will-find-you-and-i-will-watch-someone-else-kill-you">Into the Unjust update</a> and subsequent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-install-size-reduction-effort-yields-131gb-in-cuts-and-you-can-try-the-slim-build-right-now">technical tweaks</a>, so it feels like Super Earth's finest are due having another big twist flung their way soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Prime Docking Station (14-Port, 160W) Crashes to Lowest Price of the Year, Now Cheaper Than During Last Holidays]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-prime-docking-station-14-port-160w-crashes-to-lowest-price-of-the-year-now-cheaper-than-during-last-holidays-2000659243</link>
            <guid>1404604</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anker’s Prime Docking Station is a 14-port hub that can power your laptop and accessories and drive dual monitors from a very small footprint. It comes in a sleek, vertically oriented case that can be placed on your desk. Up front, it has ports for charging your devices, and on the back side, ports for data, video, and networking access. There is also a small LED screen that shows which ports are currently active and how power is being distributed. The device can handle both power and data transfer simultaneously, with a maximum of 160W of power distribution and 10 Gbps of data speed, making it a powerful tool for organizing your various accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Click here to purchase the Anker Prime Docking Station for $170 on Amazon, discounted from its regular retail price of $270. This is a savings of $100, or 37% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A quick and easy way to perform cable management with all your devices</h2>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station includes four USB-C ports, five USB-A ports, dual HDMI ports, an Ethernet jack, and audio jacks. The two USB-C ports on the front of the dock can deliver up to 160W of power and charge up to two devices simultaneously. Each port can provide up to 100W to a single compatible laptop, allowing you to charge your laptop while working. The rear USB-C and USB-A data ports support transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, enabling faster transfers of large files between external storage devices and your computer. Since all your peripherals are attached to the docking station via a single upstream USB-C connection, you don’t have to unplug any peripherals when you disconnect your laptop.</p>



<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station features dual HDMI outputs for connecting multiple external monitors to your laptop. For example, you can connect two separate 4K monitors at 60 Hz, giving you ample space to spread out multiple applications across both. Alternatively, if you prefer a simple layout, you can connect a single monitor and still have the second HDMI port available for a television or projector.</p>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station is compatible with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt laptops that support DisplayPort Alt Mode and USB-C Power Delivery, including but not limited to: many Windows 10, Windows 11, and Chrome OS laptops. Mac laptops can also use the dock; however, the two external monitors will mirror each other instead of providing a traditional three-monitor desktop environment. Note that the dock is not compatible with Linux laptops, and some gaming laptops may require their own chargers to operate at optimal levels. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">At a discounted price of $170, down from $270, the Anker Prime Docking Station is an effective way to convert a single USB-C port into a powered 14-port desktop configuration.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-documentary-chatgpt-reddit-2000659351</link>
            <guid>1404601</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Given the very loud fallout from </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>series finale</span></a><span> and a portion of the horror show’s fandom descending into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>a mass hysteria</span></a><span> in believing that a secret ninth episode </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>might fix the whole season</span></a><span>, I have to wonder if there were any conversations at Netflix about not releasing the </span><i><span>One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5 </span></i><span>documentary that went live on the streaming service yesterday, January 12. Already, every word that series creators the Duffer Brothers had been uttering in interviews </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>was being picked apart</span></a><span>, and now the conspiratorial mindset fueling that scrutiny has been given a lot of new wood to burn by the documentary.</span></p> <p><span>The two-hour documentary includes behind-the-scenes footage of the writers’ room and table readings, as well as the set of the show during shooting. In a world where </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>hadn’t been combed through by fans looking for any proof that a secret episode was coming, it could have been viewed as a surprisingly honest look at all the moving parts a production of this scale has to contend with. But there’s a segment of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans looking for any explanation as to how it all went wrong, and the documentary sure has a few moments that fans are latching onto.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the things people are pointing out are mostly speculative. In one section, the Duffer Brothers are shown with what fans believe to be </span><a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/2010896631034707994"><span>ChatGPT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/SThingsMeme/status/2010679300282871909"><span>Reddit tabs</span></a><span> open on a computer while writing the script for a season five episode. The Reddit logo is pretty clear in one shot, but the ChatGPT one is more contested. Even so, these tabs being open doesn’t actually confirm anything, but detractors are running around with accusations that the Duffers used ChatGPT or relied on fan discussions on Reddit when making important creative decisions, all based on…open tabs? Let’s be serious.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>As for more substantial stuff, a few scenes in the documentary have caught the eye of people critical of the season, and more specifically, of the Duffer Brothers. At one point during filming of the finale, Montana Maniscalco, the key production assistant on the show, says that the episode isn’t completely written yet, with the presumptive takeaway being that the Duffer Brothers must still be trying to figure out how the season is going to end this late into production.</span></p>

   <p><span>Other scenes of note include a moment in the writers’ room in which writer Paul Dichter said that there should be more monsters in the finale’s climactic battle, even going so far as to name the Demogorgon from season one as a potential foe for the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>crew to face in the final fight. He says it would be “crazy” if there was nothing there. Well, if you saw the finale, you know that’s exactly what happened, and it seems Dichter’s feedback was “ignored.”</span></p>

   <p><span>In another clip, Maya Hawke is seen discussing a moment her character shares with her girlfriend Vickie. Their relationship is a secret at this point in the story, and we see Hawke is saying she wants to have this conversation “in a whisper.” This, too, is being read in the most bad faith way, with the narrative being that Hawke is having to “remind” the crew about things the writers “forgot” about characters, rather than actors sharing ideas on how things should be played because they’re a part of this process, too, and might have opinions.</span></p>

   <p><span>I don’t mean to be dismissive of people who didn’t like the ending, but I have “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asthkXjWWQ0"><span>played these games before</span></a><span>.” I know what it’s like to be searching for any justification for your disappointment and projecting narratives onto some pretty normal interactions in a creative space. I can’t speak for why they ignored Dichter’s note about the monsters, but Hawke’s point about tweaking that scene? That shit happens all the time in movies and TV. We had this same conversation when James Gunn and David Corenswet </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/auz1txQ5WVc"><span>had a debate about some lines in the </span><i><span>Superman </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. People reacted to it as if it was a “fight,” but this is literally just something that happens when you’re collaborating with someone else on a creative project.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I know the confirmation bias is too embedded in the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fandom right now, with people still holding out hope that there’s another finale locked away in a vault somewhere waiting to fix everything. Y’all can keep fighting ghosts, but I do hope that the people who are still caught up in this conspiratorial cycle find their way out of it.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 is getting a new Warbond called Redacted Regiment on January 20, 2026; here’s what you need to know about it. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios is back again with a new Warbond for players to try out. The last few Premium Warbonds saw developers introduce features such as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2s-next-premium-warbond-will-introduce-a-minigun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minigun</a>, the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-returns-as-a-legendary-warbond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killzone collaboration</a>, and more. The latest Premium Warbond will focus on suppression technology and spec ops fashions. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Weapons and Stratagems</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Premium Warbond will introduce two primary weapons for players to try out. The first is a mid-range precision rifle with an integrated suppressor called R-72 Censor. The other is a fully automatic assault rifle with a non-removable suppressor called AR-59 Suppressor. There’s also a dart-firing P-35 Re-Educator, which releases “a chemical agent that induces delirium in organic targets and delirium-like malfunction in inorganic ones.”</p>



<p>Coming to the Stratagems, first up is the B/MD C4 Pack, a backpack that comes with six adhesive C4 charges and a wireless detonator. The other is the TM-01 Lure Mine, a throwable anti-personnel mine that attracts enemies by producing sounds and flashing lights. The mine will detonate when the target enters its proximity. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-cosmetics">Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Cosmetics</h2>



<p>First up are the Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment, and players get two of them this time. First up is RS-89 Shadow Paragon light armor, which comes with “multitudinous pads and pouches to hold all your tactical EDC items”. The other is the RS–67 Null Cipher medium armor, which has been coated with “a radar-absorbent polymer and null-signature heat baffle to turn you into a real sensor ghost.” Both armours feature Reduced Signature passive, which results in reducing the player’s noise level and also the range the enemy can detect them in. </p>



<p>There are two new capes as well, the Pillar of the Abyss and Triangulation Veil capes. Additionally, a new victory post called Target Sighted and a new player title, [Redacted], have been added as well. Lastly, there’s a new booster called Concealed Insertion, which deploys a smokescreen from your Hellpod in impact, allowing you to enter stealth mode as soon as you land. </p>

            <guid>1404595</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has addressed the long wait for Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe, insisting that Amazon is in control of the delivery of the adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Superman actor and Warhammer 40,000 lover Henry Cavill is set to star in and executive produce the live-action Warhammer 40,000 adaptation for Prime Video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe is shrouded in mystery, and Games Workshop itself has cautioned fans not to expect to see anything of it for some time. But it is now over three years since Games Workshop’s deal with Amazon was announced, and fans have yet to see anything of it, or hear anything tangible about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its latest financial results (the long and short of it is that Games Workshop is doing tremendously well and making loads of money), CEO Kevin Rountree addressed the elephant in the room: just what is going on with the Amazon stuff?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We continue to work on some exciting projects that will bring Warhammer to screens like never before,” Rountree said, keeping his cards close to his chest. “Our live action endeavour is still in development with our partners: Amazon MGM Studios, Henry Cavill and Vertigo. It is the nature of these things to take several years, and while we wish we could tie down a release the way we can with our core business, the reality is that, as with any licensing deal, delivery is not in our control. We leave it to our partners to manage their own businesses.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t help fans much, to be honest. But at least we know the project is still in the works and hasn’t been lost to the Warp. Fans have spent the last few years in a state of enduring excitement about the prospect of finally seeing Warhammer 40,000 brought to life in live-action form across films and TV shows — and with Cavill steering the ship, they’re confident it will be done right. Hopefully we'll get some details, including who Cavill himself will play, soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, condensing the vast scope of Warhammer 40,000 into films and TV shows while sticking to a reasonable budget may prove a challenge. Warhammer 40,000 is a highly detailed setting with multiple factions, thousands of years of war played out on a galactic scale, and, at the heart of it all, enormous Space Marines who often fight against even bigger monsters. We’re talking space battles that can last hundreds of years, gargantuan land battles that can consume entire planets, and the Warp, a place so unknowable that it can be pretty much anything you can imagine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that context, what story will Cavill tell? Does it need to be more grounded than a big galactic epic? We’re left with scraps to mull over, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-mere-mention-of-an-nda-by-a-games-workshop-author-has-sparked-all-sorts-of-speculation-about-what-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-might-be"><u>recent comments from Dan Abnett about NDAs and upcoming books</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-says-hes-enjoying-the-challenge-of-creating-the-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-it-is-a-tricky-ip-and-a-very-complex-ip-and-thats-what-i-love-about-it"><u>Cavill himself touched on the “complexity” and “trickiness” of adapting the Warhammer 40,000 IP</u></a>. But, he insisted, he’s loving the challenge, which for fans will be great to hear. Bringing Warhammer to life "is a dream come true," Cavill said, "but it's different from what I've done before, in the sense I haven't had my hand on the tiller of things before. It's wonderful doing that. It is a tricky IP, and a very complex IP, and that's what I love about it. The challenges that come with putting this on the page in a way that is doing justice to that complexity, that trickiness, and that nuance, is a challenge I'm enjoying enormously."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Rountree did have one solid bit of news to deliver: a standalone Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode is in the works. Age of Sigmar is the fantasy portion of the Warhammer universe, as opposed to Warhammer 40,000's far future setting. This new episode follows on from the hugely popular Warhammer 40,000 episode for Amazon’s animated anthology series Secret Level, which starred Titus from Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like there’s more to come from a potential Secret Level Season 2. “After a successful collaboration with Amazon MGM Studios and Blur for Secret Level (a high-end animated anthology show), we are now meeting with writers to determine our next step to continue the momentum gained from that episode,” Rountree said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the meantime, work is almost complete on a standalone Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode. Again, for Prime Video. We will update you further when we have more significant milestones to share.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

He said GW staff are barred from using it to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop owns and operates a number of hugely popular tabletop war games, including Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar. Its core business is selling miniatures and box sets that are used by fans to play these games, but there are a number of other creative aspects of the hobby that Games Workshop invests in, such as book selling, art sales, and animation production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">Displate was forced to deny that one of its pieces of official Warhammer 40,000 artwork was the product of generative AI</a>, insisting “red flags” spotted by fans were the result of human error.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature"><u>The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</u></a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/13/ow852ulpdo731-1751405677082-1766411683253-1768309174083.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The God-Emperor, by John Blanche.

            <p>Oh, Funko Pop. What have you done? Well, unless my eyes are deceiving me, I think you may have let slip a yet-to-be-aired and potentially pivotal plot point for the second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers (past and perhaps future) for Fallout season two below.</strong></p>

<p>Images of an <a href="https://x.com/AmusementTimeYT/status/2010966559385329789">all-new</a> <a href="https://x.com/FunkoPOPsNews/status/2010946498477928916">Funko Pop</a> based on Amazon's Fallout series have started making the <a href="https://pops.today/television/1915-caesar">rounds online</a>, and correct me if I am wrong, but they appear to show Macaulay Culkin's character Lacerta Legate as Caesar. That is to say, the head of the Fallout faction known as Caesar's Legion.</p>
<p>Caesar's Legion plays a not insignificant part in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, which large parts of the show's second season is based on.</p>
<p>In the show, we meet Caesar's Legion when naive and trusting vault dweller Lucy gets captured by the faction, and popped up on a crucifix to think about what she has done (which was answer a cry for help, damn this wasteland!). We also discover that the Legion is in the midst of a civil war, following the death of the faction's founder. There are now two members who are vying to be the heir, or the new Caesar.</p><p>However, neither of the two potential faction leaders look anything like the upcoming Caesar Funko Pop, which you can see below. Instead, this model looks a lot more like Culkin's high-ranking Lacerta Legate. So, I am going to hazard a guess that something is going to go down at some point during the series' next four episodes, and Lacerta Legate ends up as the man on top.</p>
<p>To compare to the games, in Fallout: New Vegas, players who follow the Legion questline all the way through the end can either cure Caesar of his illness, or kill him. If he dies, Lucius - the leader of the Praetorian Guard - takes over, at least until the finale.</p>
<p>So, do you hope Lacerta Legate becomes the leader of Caesar's Legion in the Fallout show?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> will be laying off <strong>55 people</strong> at its <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong> studios, a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-laying-off-55-roles-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-as-cost-cutting-continues">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> has revealed. It's the second cost-cutting move from the company this month, after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">shut down its Halifax-based studio, which saw <strong>71 people</strong> left without a job</a>.</p>



<p>According to the report, the news was delivered to staff through an internal email that cited the move had nothing to do with the developer's performance at either studio, and had all to do with Ubisoft believing the cuts to be necessary after a "<em>mapping of the future roadmap</em>" for the company.</p>



<p>The email added that the "<em>long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged</em>," as Massive continues to work on several <strong>The Division</strong> projects, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">The Division 3</a>, </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/"><strong>The Division 2: Survivors</strong> and <strong>The Division: Resurgence</strong></a>. There's also a potential fourth project (besides more The Division 2 expansions) with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-definitive-edition-seemingly-leaks-ubisoft/">The Division: Definitive Edition</a></strong>, though it's not yet clear what exactly that project will look like.</p>



<p>These cuts are also hitting Massive and Stockholm despite the fact that the email also reportedly states the studios are working on an "<em>unannounced innovative tech project</em>" that will "<em>play a central role in the development</em>" of the Snowdrop Engine, the game engine built by Massive Entertainment that's been used for recent titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-demo-this-year/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Last year, Ubisoft kicked off 2025 by laying off <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/"><strong>185 people</strong> and shutting down its Leamington-based studio</a>. It then followed that up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">cuts at Massive Entertainment</a> and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Ubisoft RedLynx Studio</a>. It's beginning 2026 in a similar fashion, with <strong>126 people already cut just 13 days into 2026.</strong> Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">recently closed a deal with <strong>Tencent</strong> to establish a new venture, <strong>Vantage Studios</strong>,</a> which will now house the company's biggest IPs, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>

<p>Level-5 will no doubt be pleased with <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>'s performance, especially given what a long road it's been to get here (and not one with a guaranteed chance of victory, either).</p><p>Originally known as <em>Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Great Road</em>, the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="291efc63-1f35-4892-bcb7-01502230543a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous times, and a Western release was by no means guaranteed until Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c93004cd-65c8-4edc-afb5-782c92344e4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced one in 2023</a>.</p><p>Just like its predecessors, <em>Victory Road </em>is an RPG that combines tactical soccer battles with overworld exploration. It takes place around 25 years after the original <em>Inazuma Eleven </em>and follows a new protagonist, Dustin Billows (Sasanami Unmei in the Japanese version).</p><p>Billows isn't capable of hitting the field himself, but he can recruit other students to join his team, and so he serves as their commander, building a team of unconventional soccer heroes to take on all comers.</p>
<p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>forms part of what is arguably a big comeback for Level-5, with cozy RPG <em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time </em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-sales-1-5m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4638dd4a-d2d1-40e8-b386-03f485297eeb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">doing pretty well in the sales stakes</a>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/9NVX87ZG7WSC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950552.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-2950387.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a> right now.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dysons-carboat-handheld-vacuum-drops-to-a-record-low-now-priced-like-a-budget-cleaner-2000659256</link>
            <guid>1404550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you have a car or boat, it can be difficult to keep things tidy if you don’t have an appropriately sized set of tools. A handheld vac is just what you need to save the day. We’ve found one that you’ll absolutely love using, and it won’t break the bank. The Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum delivers strong cordless suction in a compact form factor that’s perfect for tight spaces, using Dyson’s digital motor and cyclone technology to maintain consistent performance from start to finish. This handheld vacuum weighs about 4.2 pounds, making it easy to maneuver around vehicle interiors, storage compartments, and other confined areas without strain.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6749/">Head over to Amazon to get the Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum for just $229, down from its usual price of $299. That’s a discount of $70 and 23% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6749/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact Design With Serious Suction</h2>
<p>Designed specifically for mobile environments, the vacuum has super strong suction as well as a mini motorized tool that uses a rotating brush bar to lift dirt and hair from upholstery and carpets. A Crevice tool helps reach narrow gaps between seats or along trim lines, while the Combination tool transitions between a wide nozzle and soft brush for dusting hard surfaces.</p>
<p>These attachments connect directly to the vacuum body, so you don’t lose them somewhere else. Plus, the bin holds about 0.14 gallons of dirt and debris and uses Dyson’s point-and-shoot mechanism to get rid of extra dirt.</p>



<p>Cordless operation plays a major role in how this vacuum fits into real-world cleaning routines, eliminating the need to manage cords or find nearby outlets. The balanced handle design keeps weight centered in the hand, which helps during longer cleaning sessions across multiple surfaces. Two power settings let you prioritize either maximum runtime or increased suction depending on the mess you are dealing with. That means the vacuum is super flexible. It can handle loose dust, sand, pet hair, and embedded debris with confidence.</p>
<p>Battery performance remains consistent throughout the cleaning cycle, with fade-free suction designed to deliver steady airflow until the charge is depleted. Recharging is handled through the included charger, and the vacuum is ready for repeated use without complex setup. Plus, it has washable filters so you don’t have to keep spending money on things like that.</p>
<p>Beyond cars and boats, the vacuum adapts well to stairs, furniture, shelves, and other areas where larger machines feel cumbersome. The compact body makes storage simple, and switching attachments is quick when moving between different surfaces. Dyson includes a two-year warranty, adding reassurance around long-term reliability and support.If you want an easy to use vacuum that’s perfect for keeping your car or boat (or other vehicle or small space) tidy, this is a great choice to get started with.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>1404544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale coming back from the dead has revitalized an expectant community and is sure to bring in a lot of players. However, it’s not ideal if the Hytale servers aren’t cooperating, and this guide has the latest.</p>



<p>Servers, servers, servers, you both love them and hate them. Without them, you don’t get to play online games, but with them, there’s the constant headache of relying on them <em>to</em> work. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale’s early access</a> is very much a game in its infancy, and initial player count figures are expected to be high.</p>



<p>If you’re struggling to get on Hytale, here’s the latest on the game’s servers and potential issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-the-hytale-servers-working-right-now">Are The Hytale Servers Working Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of January 13, the servers are working and operational, but it might take you some time to get into the game.</strong></p>



<p>Launch day for any new, hyped online game is always a wild one. Having the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale Launcher</a> installed is one thing, but your place in the game’s servers rests entirely on Hypixel’s server’s shoulders.</p>



<p>It was never expected to be plain sailing on day one, and it will take time to iron out the kinks and see just how many people log in at first.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-access-hytale-servers">How To Access Hytale Servers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quite simply, you need to be patient and wait for your chance to access the Hytale servers, as they are overloaded with players and likely working at, or beyond, capacity.</strong></p>



<p>Check for developer updates and comments on X. The <a href="https://x.com/Hytale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale X</a> page is a great source for new updates and announcements on the game, and you should also check founder <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simon Collins-Laflamme</a>‘s X page, as they post regularly about the game.</p>



<p>You should also keep checking back with this Insider Gaming server status page, as it’ll be updated with new tweaks if there are any outages or significant changes to the game’s servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-download-the-lastest-update-or-patch">Why Can’t I Download The Lastest Update Or Patch?</h2>



<p><strong>Again, the reason you can’t download the latest patch is that the servers are overloaded, making it difficult for you to get the required space and memory to download the contents.</strong></p>



<p>Are you having any difficulties accessing the Hytale servers? Have you experienced any unusual error messages or login issues? Share your thoughts and scenarios through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, where you can communicate with other Hytale players to see if there are solutions to be discovered.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Duckov and Tarkov Collab Could Be Coming Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/</link>
            <guid>1404541</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Extraction shooter fans everywhere are preparing for a collaboration that writes itself. Recently, the Escape from <strong>Duckov </strong>team posted a cryptic image and message on social media talking about the game’s <strong>first </strong>collaboration event. The image was decoded quickly enough by fans, and it looks like <strong>Escape from Tarkov characters </strong>will be headed into the duck-themed extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Escape from Duckov was released in October 2025 and quickly sold millions of copies, soaring to a peak concurrent player count of 301,000 users on Steam. It’s a satirical, tongue-in-cheek stab at the unwelcoming extraction genre, and it parodies Escape from Tarkov, the hyper-challenging shooter, in multiple ways.</p>







<h2 id="h-are-tarkov-and-duckov-joining-forces">Are Tarkov and Duckov Joining Forces?</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Escape from Duckov folks from Bilibili and Team Soda posted an image showing one of the game’s duck-like characters studying a whiteboard.</p>



<p>On that whiteboard, we see two perfectly normal ducks turn into something threatening. One is wielding a large hammer and wearing an armored vest, while the other has rippling muscles and a large rifle.</p>



<p>The post was accompanied by a message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>【Two ……. interconnected memory …… bloodline …… exceptional combat …… instability.】</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is almost a direct reference to <strong>Tagilla </strong>and <strong>Killa</strong>, two of Escape from Tarkov’s most iconic boss characters. They’re brothers (interconnected memory and bloodline), and one has exceptional combat skills, while the other is somewhat unstable.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>【Two ……. interconnected memory …… bloodline …… exceptional combat …… instability.】</p><p>QUACK! 🦆 Our FIRST in-game collab is coming! Guess what will arrive in Duckov. </p><p>Comment with your prediction — a weapon, an object, a crossover character… anything​ — and get… <a href="https://t.co/oOD86cYMlX">pic.twitter.com/oOD86cYMlX</a></p></div>— Escape from Duckov (@GameDuckov) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameDuckov/status/2010653800777081200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The collaboration effectively writes itself, and it means we could see these two characters emerge in a game <strong>other than </strong>Escape from Tarkov for the first time.</p>



<p>On October 22, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, praised Escape from Duckov’s successful launch and one million copies sold in just a few days. Little did we know that would be a precursor for things to come (or potentially come, at least).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Duckov has maintained a relatively solid player base on Steam, standing at around 11,000 peak players every day. Escape from Tarkov is primarily played via Battlestate’s proprietary launcher, so it’s hard to tell how many people are playing it, but 26,000 or so were playing at the time of writing <strong>on Steam alone</strong>.</p>

                <p>When Mushy relogged onto her Animal Crossing: New Horizons island after years away, she expected the weeds, cockroaches, and angry villagers. She didn't expect a blast from the past when she checked in on her ex-partner's room, which was designed like a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1pxaxut/forgot_my_ex_made_his_home_into_a_jail_sell_over/" rel="nofollow ">jail cell.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"He had a weird sense of humor and once he saw that there were jail items in the game--jail bars, wallpaper, toilets-- he thought it would be hilarious to turn his island home into a jail cell," she told GameSpot. "I helped him gather the items too."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons – 3.0 Update and Switch 2 Edition Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">She hadn't remembered helping him after New Horizons launched in March 2020, but everything came rushing back when she logged on for the first time to prepare for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/animal-crossing-new-horizons-everything-new-in-update-3-0/2900-7399/" data-ref-id="2900-7399">3.0 update</a> coming on January 15.</p><p dir="ltr">"After a little roaming around I came upon my ex's old island home and I remembered how it was decorated. This was extra hilarious and ironic since a few months after our break up, he ended up in jail in real life and is still there to this day," Mushy said with a laugh. "So, all in all, my ex manifested his future in jail on my Animal Crossing island."</p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing: New Horizons doesn't reset when you stop playing. It doesn't erase past decisions or smooth over absences. Instead, it waits. Returning years later means confronting creative choices, emotional baggage, and memories left exactly where they were. As players log back in ahead of the January 15 update, many are realizing their islands have been holding onto more than furniture layouts.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633819" data-ratio="0.56203703703704" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633819"></a><figcaption>Mushy hadn't visited her island in 3 years and 7 months | Credit: Mushy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players who stepped away years ago are reopening save files and running headfirst into the past. They're pulling weeds and repairing relationships with villagers, but they're also revisiting islands built during the pandemic and the years that followed. These spaces function as digital time capsules, preserving routines and aesthetics from a period when Animal Crossing felt essential.</p><p dir="ltr">For many players, Animal Crossing wasn't just a game during 2020 and 2021--it was a coping mechanism as the COVID-19 pandemic raged. Islands were structured around daily check-ins, online meetups, and familiar rituals when the outside world felt unstable. Logging back in now means rediscovering those habits without the context that made them necessary. Bulletin boards still display old messages. Homes remain decorated for long-passed events. Villagers comment on absences measured in years.</p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing makes time visible in a way few games do. Villagers acknowledge your absence. Weeds accumulate. Neglect leaves a mark. That design choice turns returning into something more personal than simple nostalgia. It's not just about remembering how things were--it's about seeing proof that time moved forward without you.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time, Animal Crossing: New Horizons never truly went dormant. A dedicated community has continued to play daily, decorating seasonally and maintaining relationships with villagers they've known for years. For those players, the January update isn't a return--it's just the next step.</p><p dir="ltr">That divide became especially visible at the start of 2026. While some players were reopening old islands, others rang in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-years-eve-games/2900-7374/" data-ref-id="2900-7374">new year</a> standing in their town square, counting down the final seconds with their villagers. Screenshots of midnight celebrations spread online, showing islands that never stopped evolving. For these players, Animal Crossing remains part of their daily routine.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633885"></a><figcaption>Players are revisiting their custom landmarks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The upcoming update has brought both groups back into the same conversation. Lapsed players are cautiously reopening save files. Everyday players are preparing their islands for new content. Both are engaging with the game from very different emotional places, shaped by how long they've been away.</p><p dir="ltr">For some, returning has been especially difficult. Over the years, players have used Animal Crossing to build <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-players-are-remembering-loved-ones-in-game/1100-6482592/">memorials</a>, preserve important moments, and create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/letters-and-flowers-how-games-memorialize-loved-on/1100-6473761/#comments-block-33482638">spaces tied to people they've lost</a>. Revisiting those areas ahead of the update has been both painful and meaningful. Gardens remain untouched. Homes stay frozen in time. The game offers no prompt to move on--only the option to continue.</p><p dir="ltr">That's what makes this wave of returns feel significant. Animal Crossing isn't just drawing players back with new features, and these islands aren't just neglected towns--they're records of who players were when they last logged off.</p><p dir="ltr">As January 15 approaches, players are reopening digital spaces filled with memory, grief, comfort, and growth. And in doing so, they're discovering that Animal Crossing didn't just wait for them to come back--it remembered everything.</p>

While a big Game Awards trailer <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/leon-kennedy-takes-the-stage-in-resident-evil-requiem">finally confirmed the rumors that Leon S. Kennedy would be playable</a>, there's still plenty fans don't know about this game. We'll be getting some more news soon, however, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/residentevil.capcomusa.com/post/3mcbhyqjx3s2l">Capcom has just announced</a> a Resident Evil showcase for later this week, January 15, at 2 PM PT/ 5 PM ET.</p><p>The stream will be available on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/capcomusa">Capcom's Twitch channel</a>. You can also view a short teaser for the event below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Tune in on January 15 at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for the Resident Evil Showcase and be one of the first to see brand new gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem," the YouTube description for the trailer reads. Capcom's website also reveals that the stream will be <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/twelve-minutes/twelve-minutes-review-stuck-in-hell">12 minutes</a> long. The event is technically just called "Resident Evil Showcase," implying there might be room for non-Requiem related announcements, but 12 minutes doesn't quite feel like enough time to cover multiple games. We'll know for sure when the showcase airs this Thursday.</p><p>For more Requiem, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/12/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-grace-and-leons-sections-are-almost-equally-split-detail">read about how protagonists Leon and Grace share the spotlight</a>, check out our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/27/capcom-doesnt-think-of-resident-evil-7-8-and-9-as-a-trilogy">interview with the developers at Gamescom</a>, and then see what we thought about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/11/back-to-raccoon-city">how the game feels to play</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/capcom-sets-resident-evil-requiem-showcase-for-thursday]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions' closure last year</a> remains one of the hardest gut punches the Western games industry has seen recently. From iconic shooters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-fear-pc">FEAR</a> to the inventive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">Shadow of Mordor</a> &amp; Shadow of War, the studio always excelled, no matter the genre. Now, unearthed materials allegedly recovered from a discarded HDD used at the studio have revealed work done on a non-Arkham Batman game for Warner Bros.</p>
<p>MrTalida, a renowned "video game enthusiast and archivist," shared their findings <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social">via Bluesky</a> on 13th January. Moreover, an Internet Archive upload was made available for anyone curious about the unmade project. Needless to say, those files should only be accessed at your own risk.</p>
<p>According to the user, the materials go back as far as April 2009 and up to January 2010. It all seemingly belongs to a game that never came close to being anywhere near done. The info and videos mostly deal with isolated gameplay ideas, audio systems, concept art, and development schedules.</p>
<p>There are, however, fragments which present an aesthetic closer (if not the same) to Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. If we also take the time frame into account, we can theorize this could've been a tie-in of sorts, or at least a title which existed outside of the continuity started by Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Arkham Asylum</a> in 2009.</p><p>This isn't the first time we've seen footage of Monolith's cancelled Batman game. In 2024, more substantial clips of an advanced build of the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-game-that-became-shadow-of-mordor-footage-surfaces-online">popped up online</a>. However, this new batch of materials gives us a closer look at the studio's overall plans, as well as the iconic tank-like "tumbler" Batmobile from the Nolan movies.</p>
<p>Eventually, the project was scrapped and gave way to what became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, a refreshing take on the Lord of the Rings IP that borrowed more than a few tricks from Rocksteady's Batman playbook, so in the end, the studio's slightly different approach to the Dark Knight survived… kind of.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to work through some issues I have with the way I approach playing &amp; beating video games. For the longest time, I’ve felt like I need to make sure I see every possible piece of content in a playthrough of a game – and that drive to avoid missing anything often leads to me turning games into a checklist of tasks and a monotonous guide-assisted slog. Sometimes, missing out on an item or a boss in a game can be punishing – but punishment and frustration aren’t bad things to experience when gaming. Like any piece of art, entertainment might not always be the goal. Like real life, you’re always bound to miss out on something, somewhere. Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered has ended up becoming the perfect exposure therapy for me to remind myself of and embrace these qualities, and enjoy this one-of-a-kind open-ended RPG experience with no hesitation or remorse.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1pisy3s/romancing_saga_minstrel_song_remastered/">[Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered International] Now out Physically and Digitally on PS4, PS5, and Switch. New localization options (French, German, Italian and Spanish), and option to select the Japanese dub with Eng subtitles. No save transfer from the previous release.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VashxShanks/">u/VashxShanks</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/">JRPG</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I love a non-linear story, and I love a story with an ensemble cast who slowly come together in unexpected ways. Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered is built on both those qualities – you have eight different protagonists to choose from who each start in a different part of the massive world of Mardias. You have vague knowledge of the fact that there is a massive evil stirring somewhere in the world, and that there are ten mysterious objects scattered across Mardias that could potentially be gathered to fully revive this evil. </p>


<p>When you pick your starting hero, though, you aren’t given any immediate quest related to this or any clue on how it all connects back to you. You’re simply thrust into a living world, and given the opportunity to explore it and take things one step at a time until you come across companions, and clues, and quests, and eventually an ending.</p>


<p>I love this so much. It can be a little daunting at first, but it really gives you the tools to tell yourself your own story as you play the game – there is no consistent pacing, or expected encounters, and it all kind of plays out like a tabletop RPG campaign. I especially loved the feeling of unexpectedly encountering characters that can be recruited to the party. Alongside your eight primary heroes, dozens of other characters live in the world who can join your quest. Sure, there are probably some incredibly optimized playthroughs you can put together if you follow a guide on where to recruit the best party members. For me, though, it was so rewarding to stumble upon each of them, and even sometimes lose some of them, in a natural way.</p>
<p>The combat encounters and gameplay that tie these moments of immersive and emergent storytelling together are, admittedly, pretty basic. Battles are standard turn-based RPG encounters, with the most unique wrinkle being the fact that you’ve got weapon durability to be concerned about as you adventure. There are a lot of new abilities and skills for your characters to learn as you progress through the game, and plenty of equipment options for putting together specific character builds and battle styles. Honestly, though, it wasn’t the thing that kept driving me to play the game. If you happen to feel otherwise and have a passion for the battles, though, there are a wealth of optional bosses and extra challenges to dig into.</p>
<p>There’s also a lot of new content in this remaster compared to the original PlayStation 2 release. A huge amount of it is quality-of-life stuff that makes the simple act of playing way, way smoother. Almost all of the extra non-QoL content is relegated to endgame and additional playthroughs. As a newcomer to the game, this didn’t stand out to me much. Reading about the content in detail, though, it seems like the kind of thing only a minority of players will ever encounter. </p>

<p>One element is an expanded story arc for a particular newly recruitable character, Aldora. Seeing that content to it’s conclusion, though, requires making specific choices across three playthroughs. There’s also a set of new ultra-difficulty bosses that, similarly, you’ll need to be pretty deep into your first or 2nd playthrough to be prepared to fight. It’s definitely a significant amount of new content, but the main game doesn’t feel any kind of lacking despite all of these elements being so deep into the game.</p>
<p>There’s a few elements of Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- that I wish were remastered just a bit better, though. For one thing, the lack of camera control is a frequent issue. Without full control over the direction of the camera, it can be a headache to navigate the more complicated dungeons of the game – especially when the camera ends up moving on its own and muddying my sense of direction even further. </p>
<p>The visuals of the game are also just a pinch away from perfect. I appreciate the weird, almost bobblehead aesthetic of the character models, even though I’m sure some people will end up fully disliking them. There’s a weird disconnect though, where the high-fidelity and resolution combined with the stylized models and just-slightly-blurry textures don’t all fully come together too well. It’s mostly the kind of thing where I imagine the fuzziness of the original version and the CRT you probably would have played it on tie the magic of the art style together.</p>

<p>Flaws aside, Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- is an incredible experience. It bucks traditional game design ideas that seem like no-brainers or bare minimums. However, the lack of a traditional main quest or even a standard linear story make for the kind of game that you end up falling so deep into that it ends up being your own story that you end up crafting, instead. Hopefully this remaster helps this game get seen as the classic it deserves to be.</p>

<p>A demo will also be available "soon"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across The Unknown</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>18th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Daedalic has shared a "Combat Deep Dive" (above) from developer gameXcite to mark the occasion. Pre-orders are available now, and it's also been confirmed that a demo — which is up now on Steam, PS5, and Xbox — will make its way to the Switch 2 "soon". The demo is inspired by the pilot episode 'Caretaker' and contains roughly one hour of gameplay, including a guided tutorial.</p>
<p>A Deluxe Edition will also be made available for pre-order, containing the following additional content that will be integrated into the main campaign: "new missions, new recruitable heroes, and powerful technologies drawn from pivotal alien encounters in the Delta Quadrant".</p>
<p>According to the official description, Across the Unknown "blends exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices. Experience crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe — with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities."</p>
<p>It sounds like it might be the perfect thing for fans of the series, but we'll have to wait and see for sure when it launches next month.</p>

            <p>Minecrafty fantasy sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> will finally launch into early access today, a few months after being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">rescued from cancellation</a> by Hypixel server co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme. In development for over a decade, it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-devs-hope-to-redefine-the-block-game-genre-with-their-world-generation-and-theyve-now-explained-how-it-works">a bid to “redefine the block-game genre”</a> that features procedurally generated biomes and RPG-style dungeon delving. Unlike the earliest instalments of Minecraft, it will also ship with some pretty fleshed-out lore.</p>
<p>In a post on the official site, the dev’s lore meister “Joe” has shared a few thoughts on the game’s flexible ideas about canon. Naturally, a lot of the chat invites comparison with other games with mighty codices, from The Witcher to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a>. I’m indifferent to much of Hytale, I confess - I have exhausted my lifetime's supply of enthusiasm for blocks, and in any case, I prefer the drearier tone of <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/">Vintage Story</a> - but on this count, I’m quite intrigued.</p>
<p>Joe <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/a-look-at-hytale-s-lore-and-philosophy">begins by noting</a> that Hytale had a lot of concept art, earlier in development, much of which has been dropped over the years in the course of narrative redrafts and other changes of direction, including the discarding of entire factions. However, “since the re-acquisition, many of these changes have been rolled back or re-incorporated in different ways”. This is partly because the developers “have made the conscious decision to return to an earlier draft - one that's far more compatible with the engine we're shipping and the vision we have for the game as a whole.”</p>
<p>In general, the chaos of past year has obliged a hard-headed approach to the narrative convolutions. Certain bits of lore have been shelved, some of them for good, while other materials are being revived. Take various initially “divisive” redesigns for the insectoid, desert-dwelling Scaraks – “with the timeline we're shipping on and the fact that the new designs aren't usable in-game, we can't exactly throw out the old ones anymore,” Joe writes. The devs are working on a method of “bringing both into the lore and making them work”.</p><p>In general, the new draft of the narrative retains “the major aspects of the lore the community has come to love over the years,” Joe goes on. “Characters such as Gaia and Varyn are still very much a part of our canon, and Tessa and Kyros are coming back as well”. The devs also intend “to revisit the concept of Alterverses”, these being parallel planets or dimensions – the main one is Orbis, which looks a lot like Earth.</p>
<p>In general, Hytale’s developers want “to maintain a consistent and coherent narrative while also allowing experimentation. Joe argues that “lore should not be a strict set of rules that everyone on the team is required to follow when designing content”, but “a set of guardrails to ensure we don't get too far off track”.</p>
<p>Hytale has certain fixed “canon foundations”, and the forthcoming Adventure mode will impose more of a narrative. But as regards the initially released Exploration mode, they’re leaving it pretty open. The game will encourage a degree of player “archaeology” that “gives us the flexibility to tell stories from different perspectives, many of which may not share the same understanding of Orbis and its nature”. As you might expect, these clashing perspectives may be faction-based.</p>
<p>As for when Adventure Mode might arrive, Joe cautions that there are currently “no systems in place to support such an endeavour, and there has never been a version of the game that had anything close to a narrative implemented. Even the details of the story itself have never truly been finalized.” So it’ll be up to you dig up the roots, for the moment. There is “a narrative of sorts” in Exploration Mode, tethered to a change in the world generation – Joe ends this section by dropping hints about something called Cursebreaker.</p><p>While a lot of the language here is too fluffy and promotional to get your teeth into, I think Hytale’s evolving lore could be fun to analyse. The early days of Minecraft were a series of improvisations and occasional mishaps <a href="https://archive.org/details/Minecraft_IRC_Logs_2009">discussed on IRC</a>, with minimal suspicion of the massive financial success that would follow – according to Notch, the game’s now globe-straddling Creeper mascot began life as a botched attempt at making a pig.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Minecraft is an absurdly bulky narrative universe, albeit a whimsical one that is rather less supportive of pedantic overreactions than, say, Star Trek. Hytale is sort of trying to follow the same trajectory, surfing the chaos wrought by last year's almost-cancellation, but with the more explicit hope of becoming a behemoth, and I think that puts the backstory writing under interesting stress. What do you reckon?</p>
<p>If you're sold on Hytale, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">how and when to buy and download it</a>. The game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-on-steam-right-away-as-its-devs-want-to-avoid-overindexing-on-negative-reviews-from-players-who-arent-as-well-informed-yet">won’t release on Steam for the moment</a>, because Hypixel are worried about negative reviews from people unfamiliar with the choppy development history.</p>

              <p>At the very end of 2025,&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3</em> developer CD Projekt Red announced it had sold its long-running PC gaming store GOG to CD Projekt and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński. And while Kiciński launched GOG with its anti-DRM ethos, he’s been away from both companies for the last 13 years, and it was unknown if he might take the now independent storefront in a new direction. According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, there are no fears of GOG backing down from its bold stance, even if it means missing out on lucrative AAA gaming sales.</p> <p>Then known as Good Old Games, the store was originally launched by Polish developer CDPR in 2008, with a focus on selling classic games that had become hard to get hold of, stripped free of old, decaying digital rights management software. As the store developed, it began selling newer games too, but always on the condition that they shipped without any form of DRM.</p>

 <p>In the late 2000s, DRM had become the cause of a huge amount of controversy, with games shipping on DVD-ROM with ludicrous, game-breaking restrictions, such as limits on how many times they could be installed, the inability to run fully installed games without the discs in drives, and most insidiously, online checks that meant games couldn’t be played without an active internet connection. Ostensibly in place to prevent the illusory threat of “piracy,” these restrictions only ever prevented legitimate game owners from playing their games freely, while pirated versions were usually stripped of all DRM by the first day of a game’s release. It was a farce. (And it still is, with DRM software in digital games now severely impeding performance.) GOG has been run for the last 18 years with a refusal to sell DRM-infected games.</p>

 <p>It’s good to know that time hasn’t changed Michał Kiciński’s position on the matter. Speaking to&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em>, the new outright owner of GOG explained that after a bidding process against an unknown rival company, he succeeded in buying the company he created because he sees “opportunities” for the business. GOG made very little money for CDPR, but Kiciński believes there’s a route to more financial success, and he’s not exactly unambitious.</p>

 <p>“I see huge opportunities for GOG to grow,” Kiciński says. “And somebody might say that having a competitor like Steam with 80 percent of the market share is a huge obstacle, but to me it’s the opposite. I see: ‘Oh, there is one big competitor, it’ll be difficult for them to defend the market, because they already have 80 percent, so it should be easier to take the market from them.”</p>

 <p>The focus to try to do this is not to try to out-Steam Steam, but rather to “just be better at a certain segment.” This is the site’s focus on classic games, but also working with independent developers with big-game games who are willing to sell via GOG. Citing games like&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em> and&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, which were simultaneously released on GOG alongside Steam, it proves that outside of the mega-publishers, there are those willing to embrace GOG’s ethos. Oh, and as part of the sale it was agreed that CDPR’s games will remain on GOG for at least the next six years—that certainly helps.</p>

 <p>When it comes to refusing DRM, Kiciński tells&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em> that it remains “a core value of GOG, and there’s no signs that it might die in any visible future,” describing this as both an ethical and pragmatic choice. And, with a refreshing frankness, he says he has no time for publishers who don’t get it. “Most corporate people, they make plain stupid decisions.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-tp-links-tri-band-wifi-6e-router-at-its-lowest-price-with-42-off-2000659062</link>
            <guid>1404496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Built to improve Wi-Fi performance in large homes, the TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router delivers faster speeds and more reliable connectivity. With the addition of an extra 6 GHz band, Wi-Fi 6E expands on the two bands (5 GHz and 2.4 GHz) that have been standard in routers for years, giving each device more space on the airwaves and reducing congestion. The combined speeds of all three bands reach up to 5400 Mbps, enabling smooth, uninterrupted 4K and 8K video streaming while you continue browsing the Internet, chatting, and downloading files on other devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/">The TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router is now available on Amazon for $116, down from its usual price of $200, for a savings of $84, or 42%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful router to improve your home Wi-Fi connection</h2>
<p>With the added 6 GHz band in the tri-band Wi-Fi 6E on the Archer AXE5400, there are three independent paths for traffic, making it ideal for applications such as gaming, video conferencing, or high-bitrate video streaming, where interruptions can be frustrating. Smart TVs, gaming consoles, and laptops typically run on the 5 GHz band, while smart home devices and general web surfing can use the 2.4 GHz band.</p>
<p>This router has true tri-band capabilities and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), so it can communicate with multiple devices simultaneously rather than waiting for each device to connect one by one. It also includes a 1.7 GHz quad-core processor and 512 MB of RAM to handle heavy traffic, especially when many devices are accessing the Internet simultaneously.</p>



<p>In addition to delivering the performance gains of Wi-Fi 6E, the router also offers advanced network security features that enhance protection and control. HomeShield tools included with the router include: basic network scans, identification of new devices connecting to the network, built-in Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities, and reporting to display network usage patterns over time. There are also basic parental controls and WPA3 encryption, providing an additional layer of security for compatible devices compared to WPA2-based equipment, as well as support for both a built-in VPN server and a VPN client to protect your traffic or securely access your home network from remote locations.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, the TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router works with major Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including but not limited to AT&amp;T, Verizon, Xfinity, Spectrum, Cox, CenturyLink, and Frontier. However, most cable and DSL connections require a separate modem, which must be purchased separately. The router itself provides Wi-Fi, plus wired Ethernet WAN and LAN ports, and a USB port for supported accessories so that you can mix wired desktop computers with wireless mobile phones and streaming devices. Plus, the TP-Link Tether app lets you set up the router from your smartphone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/">Once operational, the router’s relatively small size makes it easy to fit next to your modem, and its $116 sale price is a better value than the $200 original list price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Hytale Have Controller Support? PlayStation & Xbox Controller Support, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hytale feels like the spiritual successor to Minecraft in many ways, and it could be one of the big games over the next few years. Its early access release has been met with various questions, including whether Hytale includes controller support or not.</p>



<p>The tension building for Hytale’s thought-impossible launch has been seismic. After getting the green light to continue production in mid-2025, Hypixel Studio has been working hard on an old build to ensure the game is in a good state for early access.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-has-secured-development-costs-for-the-next-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale has secured development costs for the next two years</a>, which is great, but it could mean nothing without controller support for some.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-use-a-controller-for-hytale">Can You Use A Controller For Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale doesn’t support any form of official controller support for its early access launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you struggle with a mouse and keyboard, you might come unstuck at times trying to negotiate Hytale. The developer has been very transparent over many of the details surrounding Hytale’s early access build, and the official website has even addressed the question of controller support.</p>



<p>Under <a href="https://hytale.com/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Accessibility</a>, here’s what the information has to say.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are currently missing controller support.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, there’s no second-guessing if you can hook up a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S pad to play Hytale—you can’t, and it’s unfortunate, as it will ultimately exclude a handful of potential users.</p>



<p>On the plus side, it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-controller-support-being-added-to-hytale">When Is Controller Support Being Added To Hytale?</h2>



<p><strong>Hypixel Studios has said that controller support is a “top priority” that the team is looking to add ASAP.</strong></p>



<p>You might have to hang fire just a little bit for controller support. From the sounds of it, you might not be waiting too long. Once again, let’s check in with the game’s Accessibility page:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This [controller support] is one of our top priorities and is expected to be available soon after release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>How soon is ‘soon,’ is anyone’s guess. It could be a week or a month. Time is relative here and affects different groups of players. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale expecting one million users during the early access launch</a>, stability and a structurally solid framework could be the goal at first.</p>



<p>Hopefully, controller support arrives in the time it takes to get stomped on by a dragon in the game’s world.</p>



<p>Is a lack of controller support at the early access launch a big no-no for you? What other key features is Hytale missing for its debut? Share some ideas via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, and start up some Hytale conversations.</p>

Take the helm, manage the ship and resources, and make difficult decisions. Will you be able to bring home the ship and its crew?</p><p><strong>“What if?” Scenarios</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Did you ever wonder what would have happened had Captain Janeway decided differently? If an important crew member had followed a different path? Or what the outcome would have been had the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager embraced Borg technology to increase their chances of survival?</p><p>Wonder no more: <em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em> allows players to take control and shape the journey of the U.S.S. Voyager as they want. Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your <a title="Genres > Action [3,324 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s! The game features <a title="Genres > Roguelike [407 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don’t react accordingly.</p><p><strong>Deep Ship <a title="Genres > Management [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a> and Research</strong></p><p>After being moved forcefully into the Delta Quadrant, the U.S.S. Voyager ends up heavily damaged and in dire need of repairs as well as internal reconstruction. Restore destroyed rooms, secure life support and energy supplies, and start constructing. Ship systems, crew quarters, industrial and research facilities: You must decide what to build and when, to ensure the ship has what it needs for the perilous journey.</p><p>Expedite research into different fields. New technologies and improved layouts will not only strengthen the ship but also boost your crew’s morale. Exotic and dangerous research, like the technology of the Borg, is also within your reach. As captain, will you embrace it for the potential it offers, or will you omit it for the dangers it presents?</p><p><strong>Exploration and Resource Acquisition</strong></p><p>The dangers and opportunities of the Delta Quadrant beckon to be discovered by you and your crew. Scan celestial bodies to locate precious resources that fuel your journey. Find points of interest and oddities along your way, but beware: While the Delta Quadrant may reward the bold, it punishes the careless just as quickly. As captain, you have the final say in plotting a course and defining an approach.</p><p><strong>Ship Combat and Away Missions</strong></p><p>The journey of the U.S.S. Voyager would not be possible without both combat between ships and away missions to planets or space facilities.</p><p>For away missions, put together a team based on the individual talents of your crew. A team with skills that complement each other might be best suited for the task, but it is up to you to call the shots. Minimize the risk for the team’s members, rush headlong into danger, or take a scientific approach—you decide.</p><p>When diplomacy fails, the U.S.S. Voyager and its crew are ready to enter ship combat at your command. From the bridge, you give commands for offensive and defensive maneuvers, targeting enemy ship systems and using special weaponry. And even during ship combat, the individual skills of your crew members come into play: Assign battle stations to crew who bring precious skills to the table and trigger them in crucial moments to maximize your combat effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>“What if?” Scenario and Storytelling</strong> – The ultimate platform to play out your course of action during the iconic journey of the U.S.S. Voyager.</li><li><strong>Complex Ship Management</strong> – Repair, construct, and maintain an efficient and habitable ship to ensure systems and crew operate effectively.</li><li><strong>Exploration and Decision Making</strong> – The Delta Quadrant is a fascinating yet perilous place that awaits exploration and demands decisive action.</li><li><strong>Combat and Away Missions</strong> – Use the talents of your crew smartly to minimize risk during away missions as well as strike boldly during ship combat encounters.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Combat Deep Dive</span></h2><p><iframe title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Combat Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K9_Kn6fvEU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-adds-switch-2-version-launches-february-18]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fable Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>When Forza Horizon 6 was announced in 2025, Microsoft said it would come to PS5 after the Xbox and PC releases, but the company did not say what the exact gap would be. As for Fable, there is no word yet at all about a PS5 release, but it would be little surprise, given the belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-may-bring-all-their-big-games-to-ps5-analyst-says/1100-6528617/" data-ref-id="1100-6528617">Microsoft will release all of its big games on PS5.</a></p><p>When Fable was delayed to 2026, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delay-into-2026-could-allow-it-to-release-on-ps5-at-launch-leaker-suggests/1100-6529719/" data-ref-id="1100-6529719">the delay could allow the game to release on PS5 alongside the Xbox and PC versions.</a></p><p>Fable and Forza Horizon 6 will be shown off at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-returns-january-22-with-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/1100-6537273/" data-ref-id="1100-6537273">Xbox Developer Direct on January 22</a>. During the showcase, Playground will provide an "extended look" at Fable, which is notable because Microsoft has shown so little so far. Forza Horizon 6, meanwhile, will get a debut of the first gameplay footage.</p><p>Microsoft puts some of its games on rival systems like PS5 to help them reach more people, and to bring in more money. It was recently reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-xbox-game-just-passed-300-million-in-revenue-on-ps5-report-says/1100-6537323/" data-ref-id="1100-6537323">Forza Horizon 5 for PS5 passed 5 million units sold and $300 million in revenue.</a></p>

                <p>Nexon has officially announced that Arc Raiders has sold more than 12.4 million units since the $40 game launched at the end of October 2025.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The Korean publisher, which owns the Arc Raiders IP and developer Embark, further stated that Arc Raiders passed 10 million units sold by the end of December 2025. Nexon said sales accelerated recently, presumably due in part to the game's 20% discount, pushing total figures to 12.4 million and counting. The game has sold well and still has lots of players, as the game<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-were-the-top-15-most-popular-games-last-week-in-the-us/2900-7295/" data-ref-id="2900-7295"> regularly ranks at the top, or near it, on the Steam charts.</a></p><p>Anyone who logs into Arc Raiders by the end of today, January 13, will get the "Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool" as part of the game's new update today.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4634592" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4634592"></a><figcaption>Get the Gilded Pickaxe for free right now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg"></figure><p>This update makes a series of significant changes, including reducing the fire rate for the Kettle from 600 to 450. "The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favors using third-party software," Embark said.</p><p>Additionally, the Trigger 'Nade has been nerfed. "This nerf aims to make it less usable as a 'trigger-in-air' grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb," Embark said</p><p>What's more, the new Arc Raiders update fixes an exploit with key cards that allowed players to retain the room keys even after using them.</p><p>Given the huge success of Arc Raiders so far, it's no big surprise that Hollywood has come calling. Embark has said it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">gotten TV and movie pitches</a>, but no deals have materialized as of yet.</p><p>Arc Raiders has been big hit, but it's also been criticized for its use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-my-game-of-the-year-but-its-use-of-generative-ai-really-sucks/1100-6537140/" data-ref-id="1100-6537140">AI-based text-to-speech systems</a>. Patrick Söderlund, the head of Arc Raiders studio Embark, recently shed more light on the situation, saying the studio's goal in implementing AI into its development processes is to make better games more efficiently. He also pushed back against the idea that using AI systems in game development would lead to lower employment at Embark.</p><p>"We don't use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors," Söderlund told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesBeat</a>. "People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players. I realize it is an intricate subject and discussion."</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/" data-ref-id="1900-6418435">Arc Raiders review</a> scored the game a 9/10. "We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played," reviewer Mark Delaney said.</p>

                <p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has clarified his statements regarding X's AI generation of nonconsensual sexual images of minors and women, saying he merely "criticized a government official" for pressuring publicly traded companies for attempting to "block a speech app owned by their political opponent."</p><p>Right around the January 9 weekend, news broke that X users were turning to Grok, the platform's AI tool, to <a href="https://www.404media.co/groks-ai-csam-shitshow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create images of minors and women</a> in sexually compromising outfits and positions. The situation drew the attention of US Senators Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Edward Markey (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), who <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_apple_and_google_on_removing_x_and_grok_from_app_store_192026pdf.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote a letter to Apple and Google</a> requesting that the companies remove the Grok and X apps from their app stores for the "mass generation of nonconsensual sexualized images of women and children." The senators have asked for a written response from both companies by January 23.</p><p>In response to the letter, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/senators-apple-google-remove-grok/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MacRumors reported and shared on X</a>, Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009732745140871463" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quoted the post on January 9 and said</a> that senators using their political power to remove these apps for the harm they have caused are "gatekeepers" who are trying to "censor all of their political opponents." He <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009753835456156088" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">continued in a follow-up post</a>, explaining that no major AI company is "perfect" because they all have "documented instances of [their tech] going off the rails" and that these companies "make their best efforts to combat this." These comments blew up, drawing criticism from some corners of Elon Musk's social platform and praise from others.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-argues-banning-twitter-over-its-ability-to-ai-generate-pornographic-images-of-minors-is-just-gatekeepers-attempting-to-censor-all-of-their-political-opponents/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer ran a story on January 11</a> criticizing Sweeney for what it described as a defense of "an unprecedented online sexual humiliation machine," Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the outlet's reporting</a>, calling the story a "vile lie" that misconstrued his statements.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This is a vile lie by PC Gamer.

Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010523813205717499" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded</a>, suggesting there might be "some group chat somewhere" of people plotting who to attack, when to attack, and why to attack. He <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010498148263776673" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">believes that the story PC Gamer ran</a> was an "absolutely disgusting disregard for the truth and for editorial practices."</p><p>GameSpot reached out to Epic for comment but has not yet received one.</p><p>While Sweeney appears frustrated with PC Gamer's framing of his comments, he also clarified that X's Grok generating child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other nonconsensual sexually exploitative images is "bad." He also reiterated his position that "every significant AI has instances of this" and that companies "make their best efforts to stop it," but all are "imperfect."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009751797393502548" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">1) That is bad.<br>2) Every significant AI has instances of this.<br>3) Every significant AI company makes their best efforts to stop it.<br>4) All are imperfect.<br>Thus the combined danger of selective enforcement against political opponents, and distribution monopolies.</p>  — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009751797393502548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>According to the <a href="https://rainn.org/get-the-facts-about-csam-child-sexual-abuse-material/what-is-csam/" rel="nofollow ">Rape, Abuse, &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN)</a>, CSAM (pronounced “see-sam”) refers to "any visual content--photos, videos, livestreams, or AI-generated images--that shows a child being sexually abused or exploited."
