            <p>Following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">parliamentary debate</a> of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government last year, a group of Green Party members have announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would "compel" its MPs to support the campaign.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In case you need a refresher, the Stop Killing Games campaign is pushing for action from governments and lawmakers against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a>. The campaigners argue that publishers should be required to put in place an end of life plan for titles whoe servers are shut down, ensuring players aren't locked out of always-online titles immediately at that point, instead being able to keep playing in some form - generally offline or via fan-maintained online servers. The other side of the coin argues that this entails a not unsubstantial cost and burden to put on studios or publishers.</p>
<p>There weren't any Green Party MPs present at the Stop Killing Games petition's parliamentary debate, something that arguably isn't too surprising given the left-wing party only has four MPs at current - for context, the ruling Labour Party currently have 404 and their main opposition the Conservatives have 119. Now, party member Morton Atkins, chairperson and coordinator of the party's branch for Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire has announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would push the Greens towards being vocal advocates for what Stop Killing Games propose.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’m campaigning to change this. In collaboration with a dozen plus <a href="https://twitter.com/GreensOrganise?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GreensOrganise</a> and Green Party of England and Wales members we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign.</p>— Mo 🏳️‍🌈💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💜🇵🇸🇸🇩🇨🇩 (@Mo_Atkins_Green) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mo_Atkins_Green/status/2008944073218854960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>"In collaboration with a dozen plus Greens Organise and Green Party of England and Wales members, we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign," Atkins announced in a thread on the Tweeter. Revealing that he signed the Stop Killing Games petition which parliament debated, he added the following:</p>
<blockquote>The Green Party of England and Wales aims to be the party for a sustainable society and the party for gamers. If this passes it will help reduce destruction of digital art which has considerable environmental impacts during its creation, keeping that art alive through community volunteers and engagement with them via 'end of life plans' for all games, preserving our online third spaces which are crucial for tackling isolation and loneliness especially among our youth and the neurodivergent community who live parts of their social lives in these spaces.</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that the group of party members Atkins cites as supporting the proposed amendment thus far is a relatively small one and doesn't appear to include any of the party's four MPs at this point. I've reached out to the Green Party to ask whether any of those MPs plan to support the proposed amendment or wish to express views on it. Atkins suggested that the amendment will be put to a vote at <a href="https://springconf2026.greenparty.org.uk/login?backUrl=%2F">the party's 2026 Spring Conference</a>.</p>

            <p>The self-explanatory <a href="https://gabemcarvalho.itch.io/dont-stare">Don’t Stare</a> is both a gamejam creation I enjoy for itself and also, an idea I’d love to be incorporated into any number of first-person RPGs. Here is how the latter possibility might work: you are bandying insults with the Demon King ahead of the final battle. You’ve got some solid bantz going, but there’s a note of awkwardness, for the Demon King has very large, protruding ears, and you can’t stop looking at them.</p>
<p>Such biteable tubercles! Such luscious lobes! The more you stare, the more agitated the Demon King becomes, till at last, he flees in tears before you’ve exchanged a single blow. And that, young Chosen One, is how we first defeated evil many decades ago. I understand the Demon King has had some plastic surgery since.</p><!--more-->
<p>There could actually be a Demon King in Don’t Stare, for all I know. It’s a speed-dating sim with 67 fantastical characters. Your own character doesn’t want to be here – they’ve been signed up for the event by an interfering friend. As such, your goal isn’t to romance anybody but to scare them all away by moving your eye cursor over parts of their anatomy they’re sensitive about.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s as obvious as a literal hole in somebody’s head. Sometimes it takes a bit more calculation. You’ve only got 20 seconds before the bouncer throws you out, mind, so peel those peepers.</p>
<p>NPCs in videogames seldom object to being stared at - an expression of the player’s power that could always do with more analysis, versus the more obvious intrusive agency afforded by, say, guns and traversal abilities. Think about how you keep your eyes to yourself while walking down a city street, and compare how you swing the camera about without a care while playing Assassin’s Creed. </p><p>Some exceptions to the rule: in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, there are creatures that respond (very unpleasantly) to being looked at. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, Norman Reedus will sock you one if you look at his crotch while visiting the "Private Room" (compare and contrast "press L1 to gawp at cleavage" in MGS3).</p>
<p>I guess you could argue that Amnesia games also constrain your gaze, because looking at awful stuff will drive your character nuts. And perhaps you could make connections with a game like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3595450/Object_Impermanence/">Object Impermanence</a>, in which parts of the world are only present when you're looking at them. Any other weird eye mechanics to discuss?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quantic Dream has just announced that Detroit: Become Human has surpassed 15 million units sold in 2026. </p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was released back in 2018 and quickly gained popularity in the community thanks to its cinematic storytelling and decision-based gameplay. We were recently informed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-sold-one-million-copies-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 1 million copies in two weeks</a>, thanks to a massive Steam discount that was instrumental in reaching a new milestone. </p>







<h2 id="h-detroit-become-human-reaches-massive-sales-milestone-in-2026">Detroit: Become Human Reaches Massive Sales Milestone in 2026</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466707/detroit-become-human-sales-top-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>, a <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2026/01/08/detroit-become-human-surpasses-15-million-units-sold-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Quantic Dream reveals that Detroit: Become Human has sold 15 million units worldwide across PlayStation 4 and PC. The report shows that the game has been steadily hitting new milestones since 2020, with 5 million units in that year, reaching 11 million units in the next 5 years. 2025 was an excellent year for the game, as it sold 4 million more units, bringing total sales to 15 million by January 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-detroit-become-human">About Detroit: Become Human</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human takes place in 2038, where technology has advanced so much that human-like androids can be found worldwide. Players get to play as three of these androids, each of which has different moral dilemmas and obstacles to overcome. The game places a significant focus on player decisions, where your choices not only shape your characters’ journey but also impact the entire city of Detroit. The game features “thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings,” so no playthrough is exactly the same, as the most minute decisions can have a significant impact on how the story plays out. </p>

<p>Capcom has released a new teaser trailer for Alex, the latest addition in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>There's no raw gameplay here, but if you ever wanted to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a>'s Andore (Hugo) get beaten to a pulp, this trailer has you covered. Alex fully turns heel for this one, becoming 'The Man With No Allies' as he taunts his opponent and rebukes the crowd.</p>
<p>From this short teaser, we're not overly keen on Alex's look, but it's at least much, <em>much</em> better than his appearance in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a>. Jesus, that was <a href="https://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/as/common/character/bustup/l/alx.png?h=eb260947df38fcec30440acb79613441">rough</a>.</p>
<p>As for when fans will finally get to play as Alex, there's no firm release date, but the trailer ends to confirm that he'll be available in 'Early Spring'. So we're potentially looking at a release in March, perhaps.</p>
<p>Alex will join Sagat and C. Viper in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass, with Ingrid making her mainline series debut at some point in the future.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> for Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2, we said it's "crisp, clean, and as slick as we could have ever hoped", awarding it a score of 9/10. It also featured as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">one of our personal Game of the Year choices</a> for 2025, so do check that out if you have a moment.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders developers have revealed that they are implementing significant changes and new detection systems to tackle the ongoing cheating problem in the game. </p>



<p>In recent days, ARC Raiders has been accused of rampant cheating, with a popular streamer stating that the “egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse than peak Call of Duty</a>.” The developers have now acknowledged the issue and outlined their plan to resolve it. </p>

<p>The dev team will be “implementing significant changes” to ARC Raiders rulesets and will deploy “new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters” in the coming few weeks. The process will include updating their anti-cheat system to improve detection and enforcement of bans. </p>



<p>Additionally, the developers will implement “client-side” fixes that will target the ARC Raiders ‘out-of-map glitch, which has become a massive pain in the title. Furthermore, the developers will also be adding changes that will help streamers, including tools that will “help mitigate stream sniping”. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall underestimated just how much players would engage with the game's various sidequests and optional content, and as a result of this extra grinding would find the final boss fight a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>As we all know by now, Clair Obscur became quite a sensation following its release last year. The first game from Sandfall, many weren't sure exactly what to expect on its debut, but before long many were deeply invested in its world and characters. In fact, players were so invested in Clair Obscur, they completed a lot of optional side content and dungeons, leveling up their characters in the process. </p>
<p>This meant, though, that by the time it came to the final showdown (don't worry, I won't spoil it here), a lot of players were actually a lot stronger than Sandfall anticipated, and so the fight itself was a little <em>too</em> easy.</p>

<p>"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Clair Obscur's lead game designer Michel Nohra said in a recent interview with Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">Games Radar</a>).</p><p>Nohra added: "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>"I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur's lead programmer Tom Guillermin believes a lot of this was due to Sandfall's "humility", as no one at the studio really expected the game to become quite such a success.</p>
<p>"We weren't sure if our game was going to be that good," Guillermin said. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon."</p>
<p>Closing, Guillermin said of course the team was "happy about that", however Sandfall just "didn't see it coming".</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>Last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have - perhaps slightly ironically now - proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With just a month before the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> release on 12th February for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has shared a gameplay deep dive to reveal a bunch of the details to the latest Mario sports game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – A courtside deep dive! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-jpcJnnllI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mario Tennis Fever is built, of course, around the core rules of Tennis with basic shots like Top Spin, Slice and Lobs, with slides and leaping shots to reach the ball… but this is a series that always brings something pretty extra. This time around it’s Fever Rackets, which can unleash all sorts of special shots and wild effects.</p>
<p>Having charged up your Fever gauge with a long enough rally, you can pull off a Fever Shot, with each of the game’s 30 rackets having a unique effect. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Racket – Freeze a patch of the court</li>
<li>Pokey Racket – Summon a Pokey</li>
<li>Shadow Racket – Summon a shadow double to play alongside you</li>
<li>Golden Dash Racket – Get a burst of speed to reach the ball</li>
</ul>
<p>The tricky thing is that you can block a Fever Shot, so long as you reach and return the ball before it lands on your side of the court – Sneaky! The various Fever Shots that deal damage can also reduce your HP until you’re forced to take a time out. Oh, and in doubles, you can both unleash a Fever Shot at the same time.</p>

<p>There’s 38 characters in total, including all of the usuals and with a special shoutout for Baby Waluigi, Goomba and Nabbit. The full list is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario</li>
<li>Luigi</li>
<li>Peach</li>

<p>Each has particular stats, but you can match them up with any racket.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of modes to play in, from a standard tournament (now with commentary), to the tricky&nbsp;Trial Towers and Mix It Up mode, where you’ll have to play minigame modes like Ring Shot, Forest Court Match, Pinball Match, Racket Factory Match, Wonder Court Match (with Super Mario Wonder effects).</p>
<p>And then there’s the Adventure mode, which sees Mario, Luigi and chums all turned into babies. Now running around without your previous tennis abiliites, you’ll have to learn and train them all up again through the journey.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a ton of multiplayer. Up to four players can play on a single system in split-screen, while there’s local wireless multiplayer, and support for GameShare (which also supports streaming to the original Nintendo Switch, even though this is a Switch 2 exclusive). Turning to the online, there will be both casual online rooms and ranked matches, while the more casual amongst you might like the motion controlled Swing Mode.</p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever also has amiibo support, with various Mario amiibo changing the design of the ball used within play, but not actual gameplay effects.</p>

		<p>Epic is kicking off 2026 with their first major <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> collab event of the year, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-park">South Park</a> has been smushed into the enduring battle royale. There’s some fun new twists here, from the 5-player Quints playlist, to the Cartmanland POI and a free Born in the Chaos battle pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Born in Chaos - South Park Drops Into Fortnite!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13QoRmIFK0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having dredged up the powerful Stick of Truth, Butters has forced Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny to play Fortnite with him. The stick is so powerful, it’s managed to bend the game code to allow all five of them to team up in the Quints playlist.</p>
<p>Here’s what else you’ll find in this event, running from today through 5th February:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gameplay Items:</b>&nbsp;Players can restore health, heal allies, or damage enemies with <b>Cheesy Poofs</b>; reboot automatically after being eliminated with the one-time-use <b>Kenny’s Respawn Token</b>; and for the first time ever, control where the Storm goes by retrieving the one-time-use <b>Stick of Truth</b> from the sky.</li>
<li><b>Cartmanland:</b> Drop into a new POI: Cartman’s massive personal theme park! Cartmanland features rideable thrills such as CHAOS BLAST, Voyage to the Center of the Planet, and Pi Pi’s Splash Town.</li>
<li><b>The Born in Chaos Pass:</b>&nbsp;With no V-Bucks required, the Born in Chaos Pass features 13 South Park-themed items players can unlock – including a Cheesy Poofs Emote, Back Blings, Pickaxes, and more – by completing new South Park Quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Epic has always been pretty hot on the IP collabs, but it certainly feels as though they’re picking up the pace on some of these. In the last few months of 2025 along, they brought the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/03/the-kpop-demon-hunters-have-dropped-into-fortnite-for-some-demon-rush-pve/">K-Pop Demon Hunters</a> into the game from the hit Netflix movie, and the there was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/the-fortnite-x-simpsons-crossover-has-been-a-pretty-big-hit/">the whole Simpsons crossover</a>.</p>

<p>South Park is hardly a stranger to the realms of video games, from one of the most popular and enduring episodes of the show having featured World of Warcraft at the peaks of its early popularity, to the menagerie of tie-in games from the tail end of the PS1 and N64 era, through to the popular RPG duology <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/04/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-review/">Stick of Truth</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/">The Fractured But Whole</a> – it’s obviously Stick of Truth that Fortnite is leaning on to get the boys into the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer Lion Shield that its Roman themed city builder Nova Roma will no longer be releasing into early access on January 22nd. Following feedback from those who have played the Nova Roma demo, the developer has made the decision to delay the game by two months to put in some extra polish. That means Nova Roma early access will now launch on March 26th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nova Roma - Demo Now Available!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtHL2DE4K-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a joint statement Pete, Michael, &amp; Sam of Lion Shield said, <em>“First off, thanks for all your feedback on the Nova Roma demo! It’s been great to see the cities everyone’s creating, and we’ve definitely been impressed and surprised with the things you’re all doing with the dams and aqueducts! Given the response to the demo, we are going to push our launch date back a couple more months. The new date will be March 26th, 2026. Using your feedback we’ve updated the demo with lots of tuning, fixes, and recently we added rain, flooding, and droughts. We’ll continue to update the demo – we’re sort of thinking of it as a ‘proto-early access’. It’s disappointing to have to wait even longer and we’re sorry about that! We want to make sure everything is polished and we want to get in as much of your feedback as possible before release. Until then we hope you enjoy the demo and keep the feedback coming!”</em></p>
<p>In Nova Roma, the Roman Empire is falling into decay so you have to lead a small group of citizens to build a new version of the city in new lands. To build successfully you will need to meet the needs of the citizens, and gain the favour of the gods through building temples. Nova Roma is not just a builder where you throw up some buildings a be done with it. You will need to plan where to place dams and aqueducts to get water flowing to the city, without causing floods, and set up supply routes to get raw materials to the city without spreading too quickly. Advisors and senators will be there to help guide you build Nova Roma, and deal with the different issues that come up which will need balancing. You will need to make sure there is enough variety of entertainment to keep citizens happy after days of working, otherwise they may become unhappy too leading Nova Roma to ruin.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/avowed-lands-ps5-february-17-2026-anniversary-update-drops-on-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1401325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> made a surprise appearance at the <strong>New Game+ Showcase</strong> yesterday, with <strong>Obsidian</strong> delivering two announcements, the biggest of which is undoubtedly that Avowed is launching on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> soon.</p>



<p>The action roleplaying game is about to celebrate its first anniversary. It launched for PC and Xbox Series S|X on February 18, 2026, and on <strong>February 17</strong>, the game will be available on Sony's PS5 console, following the established pattern set by Microsoft with its newfound multiplatform policy. Pre-orders are now live on the PlayStation Store, offering two options: a <strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA26136_00-0827146390058176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$49.99 Standard Edition</a></strong> and a <strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA26136_00-0074184226734561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$59.99 Premium Edition</a></strong>. If you're not quite sure about pulling the trigger on the Premium Edition, which adds a Digital Artbook and Soundtrack, 2 Player Armors, and 8 Companion Skins, there's a <strong>$10 Premium Upgrade</strong> that can be used to jump from the Standard Edition to the Premium one later. </p>



<p>By the way, there's also a pre-order bonus for all those who purchase Avowed in advance: the so-called <strong>Emperor's Feast</strong>, five royal dishes that restore health, mana, and temporarily boost attributes to give players an early edge. Here's the list of the bonus food:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 Darkest Rauataian Chocolate Cookie</li>



<li>1 Candied Nuts</li>



<li>1 Wild Mushroom Stew</li>



<li>1 Roasted Chicken</li>



<li>1 Paradisan Trout Pie</li>
</ul>



<p>The game is also tagged as being <strong>PS5 Pro Enhanced</strong> on the PlayStation Store. There are no details yet on the specifics, but it's safe to say it will look and perform best on the PS5 Pro, since it's currently the most powerful console on the market. </p>



<p>I loved playing Avowed, as you know if you've read <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my launch review</a></strong>, so I'd definitely recommend PS5 users to look forward to it. Here's a quote from my article:</p>



<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avowed Developer Interview | New Game+ Showcase 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yhr_UqvElk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Avowed is also receiving a free Anniversary update, which will be released on all platforms. This major patch will introduce the following new features:</p>



<p><strong>New Playable Races:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Amowin</li>



<li>Oralins</li>



<li>Dwarves</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Weapon Archetypes:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Quarter-staff</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ability Tree Expansions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New abilities added to the Ranger and Fighter tres (to bring them on par with the Wizard tree)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Accessibility Features:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Arachnophobia mode</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Character Customization:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New facial feature presets and new outfits</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Photo Mode:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Community-requested feature adapted from&nbsp;Grounded</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Quality of Life:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Gear and progression improvements, bug and crash fixes</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New Game Plus Mode:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Carry over all abilities and endgame gear (with enchantments intact) into new playthrough at level 1</li>



<li>Randomized enemy modifiers (increased elemental resistance on some enemies, stun-lock immunity on others)</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the Avowed news, Obsidian also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8GuSLiE1IM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>Grounded 2</strong> (currently in early access) is about to get the <strong>Winter Update</strong>, which will add the Community Garden, a new biome attached to the existing picnic area and divided into three sub-biomes: vegetable garden, greenhouse, and pumpkin patch. New creatures like the Crickets (bus-sized with unique attack patterns) and two earwig variants (ranged/melee pairing) will introduce more tactical complexity, but there's also a new mountable creature, the Ladybug buggy, and some insects returning from the previous game, wasps and black ants. </p>



<p>The interview did not reveal a release date for the update, but the game's X account <a href="https://x.com/GroundedTheGame/status/2009400217712644142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that fans will want to watch the Casually Grounded 2 livestream next week for that.</p>

<p>There'll also be some new content in the Switch 2 Edition, including an exclusive arcade-style mode where you'll face off against waves of zombies using Juliet's Chainsaw Blaster and a turret. Joy-Con 2 mouse support will also offer a "fresh and distinct control experience".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#943)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 9]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-9-943/</link>
            <guid>1401313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of another week, but before the weekend can land successfully, you need to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Let’s keep that streak running and make 2026 your most profitable year in the puzzle challenge space! Below, I’ve outlined today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions, so you can get things wrapped up quickly.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #943:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 BALL</li>



<li>8 BALL</li>



<li>6 MAFIA</li>



<li>COUTH</li>



<li>CARDINAL</li>



<li>DEEP END</li>



<li>CHAINZ</li>



<li>FORTH</li>



<li>HEART EMOJI</li>



<li>LIMB</li>



<li>DIRECTION</li>



<li>LEST</li>



<li>SOLO CUP</li>



<li>THIN ICE</li>



<li>NON BLONDES</li>



<li>OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Slang or casual terms for where you live.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think about how something might sound.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>THands you might make at a card table.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Add “animal” after each</em> <em>word</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 9:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-9-943">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 9 (#943)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– 3 BALL, CARDINAL, HEART EMOJI, SOLO CUP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – 8 BALL, DEEP END, LIMB, THIN ICE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – 6 MAFIA, CHAINZ, DIRECTION, NON BLONDES</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COUTH, FORTH, LEST, OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>The first Fortnite update of 2026 has arrived, bringing new content and changes to the game, resulting in the customary downtime, and this guide has all the details of when to expect servers to return.</p>



<p>After a packed schedule of Winterfest content, Fortnite still has plenty to offer during Chapter 6 Season 1, which won’t come to an end until early March, and the January 9 update has plenty to offer.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime duration and what’s coming in the January 9 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers be Back up?</h2>

<p><strong>Fortnite’s servers will be down for several hours for the January 9 update, and there’s no confirmed time for their return. However, previous downtime indicates how long the game will be unavailable.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, though the wait can be longer if any issues are discovered.</p>



<p>This means that servers should be back up after the January 9 update somewhere between 5 AM ET and 8 AM ET, so keep an eye on social media around these times to check if the servers are back online.</p>



<p>Once the servers are back online, make sure to have a look at the latest content on Insider Gaming for guides on all the major additions and tips to help you.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-january-9-update">What’s in the Fortnite January 9 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest additions in the January 9 update in Fortnite are the launch of a major South Park collab, introducing new cosmetics in the Item Shop and in-game content.</strong></p>



<p>A free Mini Pass will be available during the South Park collab, along with a makeover to the Wonkeeland POI, which is transformed into Cartmanland, and the addition of the Stick of Truth Mythic item.</p>



<p>The January 9 update will also bring a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-south-park-collab-will-include-limited-time-five-player-playlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new five-player limited-time game mode</a>, while removing Winterfest content from the game, and there will also be updates to other game modes, including Blitz and Reload.</p>



<p>Full patch notes and content reveals should be shared by Epic Games on the official Fortnite blog during the downtime.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Code Violet Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review</link>
            <guid>1401298</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let me level with you folks right up top: Code Violet is a bad game. No judgement (some judgement) if you saw tasteful (and sometimes not) screenshots and trailers featuring its beautiful brunette protagonist mixing it up with dinosaurs and felt compelled to pick this up just to ogle. But if you want anything else from Code Violet, like a compelling story with interesting characters or an engrossing crucible of tense and savvy action horror to conquer, then you’ve come to the wrong raptor-infested space station. The best it can give you is terrible third-person shooting, boring level design, and technical blunders that make stalking through this futuristic bloodbath feel prehistoric.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Violet’s story is unapologetically tropey science fiction, mixing far future space colonization, genetic modification, and more to make this final girl survival story as impenetrable as possible. Bits and pieces of the tale are interesting, though that’s mostly limited to side stories and lore found in the journal entries of victims scattered among the wreckage. But almost everything you play through and watch in cutscene form is derivative, awkwardly animated and acted, and forgettable. Avoiding spoilers, even when things get truly bonkers towards the end (in a similar fashion to developer TeamKill Media’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/quantum-error-review"><u>Quantum Error</u></a> from 2023), all the new and drastic revelations that should be monumental to the story at hand instead feel rushed and full of twists and turns that are either undercooked or entirely too convoluted. The very few other characters you meet are barely more than one-note exposition dispensers who you’ll watch your hero, Violet, worry and cry over and never really understand why.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Violet herself is a hollow shell with no motivations outside of doing what others tell her to do, as well as being incredulous and weepy when weird and sometimes difficult events arise. She’s meant to fill a sort of Jill Valentine or Lara Croft archetype of tough gals that can think their way through most challenges, and shoot their way through the rest. But while those two video game legends have agency and capability developed through their laundry lists of heroic feats, snappy dialogue, and sometimes dense inner monologues, Violet’s own thoughts about the happenings around her seem absent from most interactions. She only feels particularly good at anything when I’m in the driver’s seat, tip toeing down hallways and filling dinosaurs full of lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is doubly damning. Outside of being a missed opportunity to introduce a good new character into the greater video game lexicon, it also makes Code Violet’s leering, pervy camera work and extensive dress up options feel like it's crossing the line from fun into creepy. There are tons of characters in games who successfully make being sexy or flirty a major part of their schtick, and the best ones are those that come across as completely in control of their own image while they do so. So its an unfortunate irony that in a post-<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>/<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a> world, one where people have never been more ready to accept hunky himbos and skimpy seductresses, Code Violet found one of the few ways to do it wrong.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A few parts look good at a distance, but textures can get muddied up close.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I played on a regular PlayStation 5 rather than a Pro, and at mid-to-far distances, a few parts of Code Violet really do look good. That’s especially true in the more creatively designed areas, like when you’re outside looking up as islands float in the purplish void of the sky. When you get up close, however, textures can get muddied and metallic surfaces reflect light in gaudy ways that seem off putting for the grunge and grime that sometimes smears them. And most of the heavy metal halls you’ll skulk down are uninspired sci-fi staples that don’t feel any different than any other game that asks players to escape from a locked down hellhole of a science facility. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/06/doom-3-review">Doom 3</a> pulled this aesthetic off far more effectively over 20 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s occasional flair, some statues that would look more at home in a medieval castle than a space base, for instance. There’s no real explanation for them, though you can make inferences based on some late-game happenings, but at the moment they come off largely as “it’s here just because.” One curious thing I did always stop to look at were the soda machines and various oil paintings that stick out like a sore thumb in this setting. Not because I found them to be particularly riveting (some were admittedly cool-looking), but mostly because I couldn’t stop trying to determine if they were AI generated or not – I’m no expert, so the jury is still out on that, but they certainly give off that vibe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those cool outdoor skyscapes hang over the rote and bland grasslands you’ll have to trudge through to get from one building to another almost mockingly. The limited time you spend in these zones is transitory. They basically serve as long hallways with bundles of tall grass to crouch behind when enemies are on patrol. You don’t even get a map to use, and you won’t need one as it will be very obvious where you need to go next, with very little opportunity to diverge from this critical path. Maybe these sections were meant to serve as some reprieve from the dark, claustrophobic halls of the various facilities on this planet, but other than having a brighter color palette, they feel exactly the same to navigate through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back indoors, rooms that might have something to investigate or shoot are separated by long hallways with nothing to spice up the transition from one action zone to another. This almost never changes across the handful of maps you’ll explore, creating a predictable, slogging pace between rooms. Part of what makes games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-remake-review">Dead Space</a> so tense is that any and every room feels like one you could be maimed in. In Code Violet, you can be reasonably sure that most of its rooms exist just to be walked through by you and nothing else. Scoping out extra upgrade materials to strengthen your weapons or finding hidden keys or combinations to open certain lockers are the only good reasons to stray off the path, and even then I learned to go without these things pretty early on because the effort often wasn't worth the prize – they usually meant enduring the crumbling fossil of Code Violet’s combat system for longer than necessary.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The camera can render some indoor encounters a completely unintelligible mess until it's refocused.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Violet herself is agile and swift in line with most third person games of this ilk, and even has a Resident Evil-style back stepping dodge, which you will use a lot to create space between yourself and incoming dinosaurs. In a straight up skirmish with these scaly foes, a well-timed dash back can really befuddle the raptors, shattering their simple gameplan of running at you, taking a big swing, pausing, and doing it again. There’s limited space before you hit a wall or a door that might have automatically closed behind you, though, so you can only backdash so much before making yourself a much easier snack to catch. The camera will collide with these barriers far sooner than Violet will, rendering any encounter that doesn’t take place in the dead center of the room a completely unintelligible mess for as long as it takes you to get the camera refocused. Indoors, this was a frequent headache, and lingered like a second, scarier jump scare waiting to pounce after a raptor bursts out of the wall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The variety of these jurassic jerks is a let down, with large or small velociraptors and poison-spitting dilophosauruses making up the bulk of the non-boss foes. Each type has its own behaviors, but they are shallow and predictable. Big raptors just run and swipe at you until either you or it are dead. Small raptors are usually in packs and make a conga line toward you, taking a swipe before running away, only to immediately turn around and do it all over again. The spitters just stand in one place and shoot, opting to close the distance only when you do so first. You’ll encounter some gator-like creatures in the last third of the approximately six hour campaign, but they barely bother to deal with you so long as you don’t enter their waters, making them extremely easy targets. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett Green's Sci-Fi Horror Ho-down</h3><p>A very good list of some very good sci-fi horror games</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Any challenge I got from these mouthy menaces came from how erratic and stupid they could be, often getting caught in the environment while attempting to reach me or disengaging once I simply walked the other direction. Their bullet spongy, stun resistant nature also means that they can just run up and take a bite out of you before they die, not quite becoming a danger, but definitely becoming an annoyance since any hit from them could potentially cause you to bleed, which can kill you if you don’t treat it in time. This is all true for the remarkably few boss fights as well – you may be facing a scaly man-dino hybrid now, but almost nothing about the strategy of walking backwards, dodging on time, and then countering with a face full of lead has to change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, all these lazy lizards have a sort of supernatural omniscience. Even when you make your best attempts to sneak into or around a room, there's a great chance that they already know where you are and are on their way to kill you. On top of that, so many encounters involve you opening a door to see dinosaurs staring directly at you or are scripted events where they have the drop on you, so there aren’t many attempts to stay quiet to begin with. Unless you’re using the GlassVeil function of Violet’s suit, which can render you sometimes comically invisible for a short period, stealth is a large waste of time in most areas. I say comically because you can use it mid-fight with a dinosaur, and there’s a good chance they will simply give up any attempt to find you and return to milling around aimlessly when you do. Hilariously, this strategy even works on bosses, who will completely stop and wait for you to reveal yourself, usually with gunfire, and then make a half-assed attempt to follow up until you reappear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real enemy are the myriad bugs that can’t wait to bite and peck at your progress. Sometimes the sound mix will run off the rails or a very important skybox, one that might hold valuable information about a puzzle, simply won’t load. Weapons sometimes display the wrong ammo counts, or just disappear from your inventory all together – which I guess is a fair trade for the fact that every item I used directly out of my storage box didn’t actually expend it in the review build we were provided, meaning I could always heal to full at any safe room I made it to. (TeamKill Media tells us it’s already aware and working on fixes for some of these bugs, such as the infinite storage item issue, but didn't say when those might arrive.) </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Code Violet is not the Dino Crisis successor you may have hoped for. It doesn't even clear the bar of being a successful clone of the various other third-person shooters it cribs most of its ideas from. Its dated map layouts and visual style let its predecessors down. The only weight I felt from its convoluted story and flat, empty characters were on my eyelids. Its anemic host of enemies are dull, and far more scary are the amount of bugs that were in this review build that, though a priority on developer TeamKill Media’s list of fixes, hit Code Violet’s balance and pacing like a life-ending comet from outer space.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The middle of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-battle-pass-season-20-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-7337/" data-ref-id="2900-7337">Overwatch 2 Season 20</a> has arrived, and the midcycle is bringing the chaos with new modes, new loot, and new in-game collectibles. One of the most notable new additions is Showdown Shuffle, which runs January 13-26. This mode is going to change which character you're controlling, often at random intervals.</p><p>Showdown Shuffle locks players into a role, but not a particular hero. Instead, hero swaps can occur when players reach certain milestones for kills or assists, or even when players are eliminated. According to Blizzard, this was done to encourage players to experiment with new characters and adapt on the fly. Showdown Shuffle will be a 5v5 battle available in Control, Hybrid, Escort, Push, and Flashpoint. Match modifiers will also change throughout the battle for more unpredictable outcomes.</p><p>Starting today through January 11, Assault will return during a Quick Play Hacked event that brings back classic Overwatch maps Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and Volskaya Industries. It's a fitting start the year, considering that 2026 will mark the 10th anniversary of Overwatch.</p><p>Later in the month, from January 22 to 25, Junkrat's Loot Hunt will let player spend a weekend chasing rewards and earning loot boxes at their own pace. There won't be any progress resets during this event and every match counts on the way to potentially earning as many as nine loot boxes before the end of the weekend.</p><p>Doomfist is getting a new Mythic Magma Titan Doomfist Hero Skin, which Blizzard describes as channeling "blazing energy through a sleek streetwear style." There are four upgrade tiers for the skin that can add new gauntlets, colors, and even customized effects for Doomfist's sounds and abilities.</p><p>Widowmaker, Lúcio, and Reinhardt are also getting Cosmic Owl Skins that are timed for release alongside live esports moments in Season 20. Two new collections are also coming to the shop. From today through January 19, the Borealis Collection will give Mercy, Wuyang, Lifeweaver, Sojourn, and Echo a chilly makeover composed of "celestial forms shaped by frost, starlight, and Arctic power." That collection will be followed by the Heist Collection from January 13 to 26. These outfits give Roadhog, Reaper, and Ash "gritty underworld looks" without a whiff of Christmas or winter themes.</p><p>Season 20 will reintroduce Drives from January 30 to February 4, which will give players a chance to earn exclusive rewards while pushing their progression further. Blizzard is promising that wins and losses will be forgiving in the early stages of Drive. But the higher players climb, the battles will be considerably higher as they work to increase their Drive score across Core Competitive and Stadium.</p><p>Before that happens, however, there's going to be a competitive reset. Until then, players need to finish strong to secure their rewards while earning titles, Galactic skins, and Competitive Points.</p>

<p>Fire Emblem is the first release of 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> was originally teased for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack's GameCube library last year, and it's now been added to the service in the first update of 2026.</p>
<p>This tactical role-playing game was originally released on the GameCube in 2005. We'll have a new review up soon on Nintendo Life, so look forward to that! For now, here's some backstory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>All of Tellius is torn in a bloody war that has set the human empires against the nations of the shape-shifting laguz. A small band of mercenaries, led by the earnest but inexperienced Ike, possesses the means to end this war, but a hard path lies before them. Players must master strategy, steel and sorcery to restore order to the seven kingdoms."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>To play this game via the Nintendo Classics - GameCube library, you'll need to have access to a Switch 2 and an active Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership.</p>
<p>As a bonus, Nintendo has also released the game's soundtrack on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a>. We've <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-music-adds-a-fire-emblem-soundtrack-in-first-update-of-2026">shared the full list of songs</a> in a separate post.</p>
<p>This latest release for the GameCube library follows the addition of Wario's World in December. Some other titles planned for the service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/859176/towerborne-launch-release-date-paid-offline</link>
            <guid>1401235</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Towerborne</em>, a side-scrolling action RPG published by Xbox Game Studios that has been available in early access, will officially launch on February 26th. But instead of launching as a free-to-play, always-on online game as originally planned, <em>Towerborne</em> is instead going to be a paid game that you can play offline.</p><p>“You will own the complete experience permanently, with offline play and online co-op,” Trisha Stouffer, CEO and president of <em>Towerborne</em> developer Stoic, says in <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/towerborne-launches-february-26-with-massive-full-game-update/">an Xbox Wire blog post</a>. “This change required deep structural rebuilding over the past year, transforming systems originally designed around constant connectivity. The result is a stronger, more accessible, and more player-friendly version of Towerborne — one we’re incredibly proud to bring to launch.”</p><p>“After listening to our community during Early Access and Game Preview, we learned players wanted a complete, polished experience without ongoing monetization mechanics,” <a href="https://www.towerborne.com/FAQ/">according to an FAQ</a>. “Moving to a premium model lets us deliver the full game upfront—no live-service grind, no pay-to-win systems—just the best version of <em>Towerborne</em>.”</p><p>With the popular live service games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/858127/top-five-most-played-games-xbox-ps5-2025">getting harder to usurp</a>, <em>Towerborne’s</em> switch to a premium, offline-playable experience could make it more enticing for players who don’t want to jump into another time-sucking forever game. It makes <em>Towerborne</em> more appealing to me, at least.</p><p>With the 1.0 release of the game, <em>Towerborne</em> will have a “complete” story, new bosses, and a “reworked” difficulty system. You’ll also be able to acquire all in-game cosmetics for free through gameplay, with “no more cosmetic purchasing.” Players who are already part of early access will still be able to play the game.</p><p><em>Towerborne</em> will launch on February 26th on Xbox Series X / S, Xbox on PC, Game Pass, Steam, and PS5. The standard edition will cost $24.99, while the deluxe edition will cost $29.99.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/859176/towerborne-launch-release-date-paid-offline]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Towerborne, a Looter Brawler developed by Stoic and published by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/xbox-game-studios/">Xbox Games Studios</a>, is leaving early access and launching as a full game on February 26, 2026. In addition to the Xbox platforms the game is currently available on, including PC, it will also be available on PlayStation 5. Along with the full launch, many changes are coming as part of the reimagined launch experience update.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/towerborne-launches-february-26-with-massive-full-game-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Per Xbox,</a> one of the major changes that current players may not be happy with is the game moving from free-to-play to a fully paid model. The game will start at $24.99 for the standard release and $29.99 for the more premium deluxe edition. However, one benefit of the new model is that the game will shift from always being online to a title players can buy once and play offline.</p>

<p>In addition to the new paid release model, the game features multiple updates that enhance the player experience. For example, there’s an updated, complete story featuring a major antagonist, side quests, and an overhaul of the Bounty Board. There’s also a reworked difficulty system with a new Brutal difficulty for those seeking a truly challenging experience. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.towerborne.com/FAQ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Towerborne FAQ </a>states that players can continue their character progression from Early Access; however, it recommends starting over and playing the game from the beginning.</p>



<p>During an interview as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New Game+ Showcase</a>, game director Daniel McLaren and design director Shana Markham spoke about how important it was for them to listen to their player base and flesh out the story after it was originally intended for the narrative not to play a major role in the game and be more of a backdrop for the Looter Brawler experience.</p>

			<p>Polish indie developer <strong>Paradark Studio</strong> is still working on its intriguing '<strong>CyberWestern</strong>' first-person action/adventure game <strong>ExeKiller</strong>. </p>



<p>Paradark shared an updated gameplay overview during today's <strong>New Game+ Showcase</strong>, reviving hopes in the project. The previous gameplay trailer was released in early 2023, while the debut trailer originally went live in late 2021, coinciding with the game's announcement.</p>



<p>In ExeKiller, you take on the role of <strong>Denzel Fenix</strong>, a licensed bounty hunter working for the powerful <strong>Helion Corporation</strong>. His job is straightforward: track fugitives and extract <strong>SOULs</strong>. SOULs are digital implants used to monitor and control the population.</p>



<p>In this world, survival doesn't come cheap. Players must constantly be aware of how they manage and carry their equipment, given the limited inventory space and high prices on essential supplies. <strong>The wasteland environment itself is a threat</strong>, with radiation zones, lethal sandstorms and extreme temperatures all potentially deadly to Denzel.</p>

<p>Firearms are an important part of the gameplay experience, but so is experimentation, according to the creators. <strong>Players can combine weapons, gadgets, environmental hazards and special abilities</strong> to approach encounters creatively or avoid combat altogether. Denzel can enhance his perception through cybernetic implants, allowing players to uncover hidden elements, piece together narrative clues, and read the environment, rather than relying on waypoints.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of ExeKiller is that <strong>missions are non-linear</strong>. There is no prescribed playstyle or guided solution; instead, players are given clear objectives, but are free to approach each contract through stealth, dialogue, direct combat, or a combination of all three. <strong>Not every job has to end with a kill</strong>. Paradark promises a choice-driven narrative where players shape NPC behaviour, dialogue and the broader narrative with their decisions, leading to multiple possible outcomes and endings.</p>



<p>The game is in development for PC, and you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1701840/ExeKiller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <strong>Steam</strong></a>. However, Paradark stated that console versions are planned as well.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-gameplay-debut-epictellers-entertainment-new-game-plus/</link>
            <guid>1401196</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Starfinder: Afterlight</strong> is a new turn-based cRPG from <strong>Epictellers Entertainment</strong>, a Barcelona-based studio that saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-qa-even-after-bg3-not-many-are-jumping-into-crpgs/">how Baldur's Gate 3 proved there was a commercial appetite for strong cRPG games</a> (as they told us in the linked exclusive interview), and wanted to offer a sci-fi flavour to those fans of the genre and anyone introduced to cRPGs through Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Today, at the New Game Plus Showcase, Epictellers debuted a first look at some gameplay, including some combat and a bit of exploration. It's not a huge look at what's to come, but it does feature some stunning voices, and we now know that a demo is due to arrive soon, ahead of its early access release set for sometime in 2026.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-pc-early-access-release-date-2026/">It was unveiled last year</a>, with a 2026 release window for its early access release and a star-studded cast already attached to it, including another Baldur's Gate 3 connection with <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-features-voice-acting-from-neil-newbon-astarion-in-baldurs-gate-3/"><strong>Neil Newbon</strong></a> both voicing a character in the game and directing the rest of the cast. </p>



<p>Speaking of the rest of the cast, on top of Neil Newbon, players will be able to enjoy the dulcet tones of <strong>Roger Clark</strong> throughout the whole game as the narrator. Clark, who you'll know as the voice of Arthur Morgan in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, was picked specifically to help bring the western feel to the game that Epictellers Entertainment wanted Starfinder: Afterlight to have.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2025 dev commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mw-pPlhAHHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside Clark and Newbon are <strong>Fred Tatasciore</strong>, <strong>Inel Tomlinson, Melissa Medína, James Alexander,</strong> and <strong>Carolina Ravassa.</strong> You'd know Tatasciore from a slew of animated films and TV shows, but also games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. You'll have heard Tomlinson in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, Medína in Borderlands 4, The Mortuary Assistant, and Warframe: 1999, to name a few. While you'd recognize Alexander from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Horizon: Call of the Mountain, and Ravassa from Overwatch and Grand Theft Auto V. </p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight boasts a talent-rich cast, thanks in part to its successful Kickstarter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-80-mins/">which was funded in just 80 minutes </a>and ultimately <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description">surpassed its goal</a> by hundreds of thousands. Now that we know to expect a demo soon, hopefully, we'll also have a release date to look forward to not long after.</p>
