            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Amazon is continuing to celebrate The Game Awards, which took place on December 11th, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=120158211011&amp;pf_rd_p=cb919822-ef92-44d0-941a-1bcdb4d30dd7&amp;pf_rd_r=7PJJHZQP9THN1Q4JEA03&amp;ref_=GoG24&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a big sale</a> on titles that were nominated in their respective categories. The deals include a discount that brings the PC version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-Standard-Online/dp/B0FNGXKPK9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, which ended up taking home nine awards (including game of the year), back down to its all-time low of $39.99 ($10 off). If you’ve somehow made it through your gaming backlog, don’t mind adding to it, or need a last-minute gift for your favorite gamer, it’s a good time to pick up some of the top titles of 2025.</p><p><strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></strong> is a turn-based RPG with an engaging battle system with plenty of tactical diversity, an atmospheric soundtrack that sets the right mood, and a story that our reviewer found heart-wrenching, stirring, and humorous. Battles feel dynamic thanks to a dodge and parry system that rewards you for launching a countermove. Getting a perfectly timed parry can turn the tide of your battle, but it may take you some time to learn how certain enemies move before you can learn the right timing. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> is the latest entry in the long-running survival horror series set in 1960s Japan, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Hill-PlayStation-Amazon-Exclusive-Day/dp/B0F1C14LY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5 version</a> is on sale for $44.99 ($25 off) exclusively for Prime members. Its strengths lie in its beautiful visuals, intriguing location, deep story, and tense, melancholic atmosphere. There aren’t many jump scares, but you may feel a general sense of unease. The game’s protagonist, a high schooler named Hinako, grows more assertive as the game progresses, and she wrestles with both the enemies in front of her and an internal struggle between tradition and modernity. The game has five possible endings, which adds to its replayability. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/782012/silent-hill-f-review-ps5-xbox-steam">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em> </strong>is the latest title from Kojima Productions, and you can snag the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-2-Beach-PlayStation-5/dp/B0F19GPDW3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5 game</a> for $49.97 (around $20 off). The game is a direct sequel to the original <em>Death Stranding</em>, and it follows protagonist Sam and his adopted child Lou as the former continues his quest to connect the world to an internet-like network.</p><p>The game’s landscape is bleak and empty, and you’ll have to contend with ghostlike creatures as you trek through the game’s world with weapons, traversal gear, healing items, and cargo. The missions, which range from rescuing a hostage to keeping your cargo above a certain temperature in harsh terrain, keep the game feeling interesting. The game’s story is easier to follow than its predecessor, though knowing the backstory can help a lot. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Split Fiction </em></strong>is a co-op adventure game that takes place in two different worlds simultaneously, and both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Split-Fiction-Playstation-5-PS5/dp/B0F6423HHW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Split-Fiction-Playstation-5-PS5/dp/B0DQF6GRT8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5</a> versions are on sale for $30 ($20 off). Protagonists Zoe and Mio are both trapped in a machine, but one is transported to a land of futuristic cities, while the other finds themselves in a fantasy land full of magical kingdoms. The characters get new powers in each section, but two players need to work in tandem to navigate through their respective connected worlds. Coordination is key, whether you’re outwitting a boss in a section reminiscent of two-player pinball or playing little minigames that take place in the middle of its narrative. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Read our review</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/843459/game-awards-playstation-nintendo-pc-games-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-adds-another-80-off-laptop-as-holiday-clearance-deals-continue-on-amazon-not-listed-on-official-site-2000651632</link>
            <guid>1381966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops (and PCs) don’t have to be massive or insanely expensive to get the job done. If you’re after a machine that takes care of all your everyday work and play-related tasks with ease, Amazon is letting you upgrade for under $500 right now; you read that right.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">The 15.6-inch HP laptop, which would run you around $2,000 on a regular day, is currently going for $400</a>. That’s after the retailer took a whopping 80% off its retail tag. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling fast. Whether you’re looking to snap one for yourself or want to gift it to a student or work professional in your life this holiday season, now is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Display, Reliable Performance</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, it’s a classic HP laptop. The sleek, lightweight design makes it ultra-portable, letting you carry it around easily wherever you go. The 15.6-inch screen is bright, while the 85% screen-to-body ratio offers a larger room to work and play on. You’ll enjoy crisp, vibrant visuals consistently (for movies, shows, presentations), and also won’t have to fight your own reflections when working in well-lit rooms. Translation? An immersive viewing experience that’s easy on the eyes, even when using the laptop for an extended period of time. Paired with the screen is a full-sized, soft grey keyboard with a numeric keypad to make typing long documents comfortable.</p>
<p>HP has packed the laptop with a 4-core Intel N100 processor that’s capable of hitting speeds up to 3.4 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology. It does not make the machine a powerhouse, sure, but it’s still great for regular office work, study requirements, and post-work entertainment. There’s a 16GB RAM to keep everything running smoothly, and especially comes in handy when you’re trying to multitask through busy days. With this at hand, you’ll be able to use a bunch of different applications at the same time, keep a ton of tabs open on your browser, take some quick meetings, and more; without noticeable slowdowns that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>As for storage, it gets you a 256GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, which can house your important work documents, some media files, and necessary programs. We won’t sugarcoat it; the storage isn’t massive, so if you’re someone with a massive library of heavier projects, it might not be sufficient for you. But for casual use, it does the job. Moreover, SSDs are much faster than traditional drives, so you’ll also enjoy fast boot and load times with this one.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 wireless card, and a wide range of ports, including one USB Type-C, two USB Type-A, one HDMI, one headphone/microphone combo, and an AC smart pin. Some other features that deserve a mention are dual speakers and an HP True Vision 720p HD camera to make video calls a breeze.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially at its current price. You can grab it for just $400 right now, which is nothing considering all the features</a> it packs. If you’re looking for more memory and storage, there’s a 32GB RAM/1TB SSD version of the laptop available too, which is currently sitting at $600. Again, the deal expires soon, so it’s better to grab yours before that happens.</p>

Understand its fragile balance, uncover its deepest questions, and find more than just the answers.</p><p><em>Chroma Zero</em> immerses you in a universe of mystery, color, energy, and movement, and challenges your expectations and intuition. There are no levels, the puzzles are integrated into the fabric of the space itself, and everything can change in the blink of an eye. Exploration and curiosity are rewarded.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Playtesters have taken between six and 12 hours to finish the game, and a bit more to explore everything. Most progress is gated only by knowledge, which is gained by exploring and experimenting.</p><p>This is an immersive, non-linear, risk-taking and moderately challenging game, made by a solo developer. The narrative is mostly light-hearted, but can be impactful at times. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty, though the game helps to guide you as well. So if you’re exploring everywhere, you will know what to do—maybe just not how to do it! I was inspired by games like <em>Antichamber</em>, <em><a title="Games > Outer Wilds [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a></em> / <em><a title="Games > Riven [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/riven">Riven</a></em>, and the discovery elements of <em>Tunic</em>. I hope to bring more games like these into the world, since by their nature they are focused on giving you a wonderful and surprising first-playthrough.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge Based Progression</strong> – Learn the rules of the space, and you can progress farther in the world and deeper into the mystery</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Open-World [791 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">Open-World</a> Puzzles</strong> – Explore everywhere, the world itself is the puzzle.

                <p>Gears of War fans hoping to see a new trailer for the upcoming prequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day/" data-ref-id="5000-631971">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, may have been disappointed that it skipped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a> this year. That may be why the official Gears of War social media accounts have shared a message assuring fans that E-Day is still coming in 2026.</p><p>The image shared on the Gears of War X account didn't share any spoilers and it was just a skull set against some haunting red and black shades. But it did confirm the 2026 release window.</p><p>For now, Gears of War: E-Day is only confirmed for Xbox Series X|S and PC. However, it seems very likely to be the second game in the franchise to make the leap to PlayStation 5, given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-launch-times-revealed-for-franchises-debut-on-ps5/1100-6534232/" data-ref-id="1100-6534232">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>--a remake of the original game--became the first title in the series to appear on a Sony console. Cliff Bleszinski--the co-creator of the franchise--has mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-co-creator-is-thrilled-that-the-franchise-isnt-xbox-exclusive-anymore/1100-6534071/" data-ref-id="1100-6534071">he's happy that the Gears of War games are no longer exclusive</a> to a single console.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day was announced during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024, but there haven't been many updates about it since that time. Just over a year ago, it was revealed that John DiMaggio (Futurama) and Carlos Ferro <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-is-bringing-back-original-marcus-and-dom-voice-actors/1100-6527641/" data-ref-id="1100-6527641">will reprise their respective roles</a>, Marcus Fenix and Dominic "Dom" Santiago.</p><p>The game is an original prequel story that's set 14 years before the first Gears of War, when Marcus and Dom were still young soldiers in the Coalition of Ordered Governments. Their world, Sera, has finally found some measure of peace before the Locust Horde struck on Emergence Day, which threatens to wipe out all of the humans living on the planet. A new city, Kalona, will be one of the central locations for the story within the game.</p><p>Outside of the gaming realm, John Wick and Deadpool 2 director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-director-is-excited-about-gears-of-war-movie-and-making-his-first-war-film/1100-6534228/" data-ref-id="1100-6534228">David Leitch is set to direct</a> the live-action Gears of War movie for Netflix. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dave-bautista-really-wants-to-play-the-lead-in-netflixs-gears-of-war-movie/1100-6509125/" data-ref-id="1100-6509125">Dave Bautista has lobbied for years to play Marcus</a>, but he has yet to land the part.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161136/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>After hopping into my 20th Hyperspace in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>’s DLC, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, I realised something. I’ve been doing the same things over and over again for the past few hours.</p>
<p>Now, I know the series isn’t exactly known for varying things, but it feels particularly egregious within a condensed DLC experience. And for the entire 10-15 hours I’ve spent running around these Hyperspace pockets, I can probably count on one hand what I’ve done.</p>
<p>This is a pretty chunky DLC in Pokémon terms — the main story can probably be beaten in around 6-8 hours, but there are a lot of new Pokémon, new Side Missions, and more to dig into, including after the credits — but the bulk of Mega Dimension feels like empty calories. Here I am, back in Lumiose City, a place I already got bored with fast because of its lack of variety, and now I’m running around the same handful of randomly-generated Hyperspace pockets over and over again just to fulfil research tasks and progress the story.</p>

<p>Yes, you read that right: randomly-generated. Mega Dimension is <em>sort of</em> a roguelite, and that stopped me from completely sleepwalking my way through every single dimension. For what the liminal pearly white snapshots of Lumiose City lack in variety, they make up for in a handful of other ways. They’re home to an abundance of new returning creatures. Not only that, the ‘mons in these spaces are all over level 100, with many reaching way beyond 150 in the later stages.</p>
<p>I’ve grown up with this franchise, and if you think I don’t still get excited whenever I see a Cubone running around carefree or even newer ‘mons like Sandygast bobbing around in the concrete, then I’m sorry. It’s especially exciting to see these Pokémon at levels way beyond the level cap. Who knew a gang of level 120 Mankey would be lethal? I watched six of them beat up my Feraligatr in no time at all. I got the same level of thrill encountering Alpha Pokémon in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> whenever I jumped into a level 180 dimension and found something I hadn’t caught before.</p>

<p>The higher levels in these dimensions is easily the best thing about this DLC. It makes catching wild Pokémon fun in a different way; no longer am I guaranteed to get something <em>just</em> because it’s a Meditite or a Sandile. It might beat me and my Pokémon up before I get a chance to weaken it a little or sneak up on it. In fact, I found the compact corridors and rooftops of Lumiose worked to the DLC’s advantage, because I had to be a little more thoughtful about how to catch things here than in the base game’s Wild Zones.</p>
<p>Catching Pokémon and dealing with high-level monsters are the highs; the lows are the repetitive maps, the annoying platforming, and the list of random tasks that you complete to build up research points. The grind only gets longer the further in you get.</p>
<p>There’s nothing compelling about awkwardly floating from one rooftop to another, or scrambling around to find the right ladder to get to the top of the building you’re aiming for. Destroying boulders, watering down sludge, picking up items, breaking Poké Balls, catching ‘mons I already have 10 of in my box, or fighting trainers à la the Z-A Royale. It’s all the same stuff in the same spaces I’ve spent hours and hours running around a few months ago.</p>

<p>These alternate pockets of Lumiose City exacerbate all of my problems with the city in the base game. The city lacks character, and in these spaces, it’s all just a blank slate of whiteness. There’s no real way to jump, meaning you have to drop and float and hope you land in the right spot. They’re a chore to get around, with no map and a time limit determined by the type of donut you feed Hoopa before jumping in. And there’s maybe only about six variations of these spaces. When I’m excited to see a sewer, of all places, you know something’s up.</p>
<p>The aforementioned donut making could be cute, and initially, it kind of is – Hoopa and new character Ansha are a delightful pair, and who doesn’t like donuts? But like exploring Hyperspace, baking is a chore. Using berries from the base game (and eventually, Hyper berries), you make donuts that determine how much you increase your Pokémon’s levels and the amount of time you can spend in Hyperspace, depending on the dimension’s star rank <em>and</em> the donut’s rank.</p>
<p>You need to make a lot of these, and you can only make one at a time. It’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> crafting all over again. Weirdly, there’s an option to make the exact same donut you just made, but if your Coba-flavoured confection was a test and you know how to make it better, have fun making one at a time over and over again. And if you don't have any great donuts available, well, get ready to run around the city or Hyperspace or buy them one by one from a vendor.</p>

<p>Luckily, what <em>is</em> great about the base game is still great here. The action-oriented combat is still largely excellent, perhaps let down by some of the chaotic forced double battles peppered throughout the story. The Rogue Mega Evolution fights are actually even better in Mega Dimension, because your foe actually moves around and engages with the space. I even lost to one of them because I jumped in unprepared and was shocked at just how fast it moved and how hard it hit.</p>
<p>When you’re fighting something that matches your level, or something that exceeds it, things get nail-biting, a scramble of defensive choices, Pokémon-swapping, and dodging. But when the DLC basically requires you to be level 100 in the first few hours, but <em>still</em> throws mandatory trainer fights at level 70 your way, it’s a little baffling.</p>
<p>The repetitiveness of Mega Dimension really does let the DLC down because, like with Legends: Z-A, there are some really good foundations here. A Pokémon roguelite could work really well, but there’s little variety to take much advantage of the randomness, besides the Pokémon you encounter.</p>

<p>The combat is great, but give me a set of consistent, high-level fights. Even the Side Missions are a step-up here, for the most part, but for every good battle, story of a city struggling with change, or brand new Mega Evolution encounter, there’s another fetch quest or “trail the Pokémon” task.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The core of Pokémon and the highs of Pokémon Legends: Z-A just about manage to shine through in the Mega Dimension DLC, but the repetitive Hyperspace dimensions, bland level design, and dull donut making stop this from being a true Mega Evolution for the game.</p>
<p>If you’ve grown up with this series, you’ll find it hard to resist the lure of the expanded Pokédex and seeing your favourites almost looking their best is a joy. Repetition is not freeing, though, and as with the base game, I’m missing the freedom of the core series again.</p></section>

<p>"the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>During The Game Awards, Capcom finally confirmed the existence of Leon Kennedy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> with an awesome new trailer. It seemingly confirms that players will experience more traditional survival horror while playing as Grace Ashcroft, while Leon's gameplay will be more akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>But will the campaign be skewed in favour of one character over the other? According to Capcom, no. In speaking with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, director Kōshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa confirm that Leon and Grace will share almost equal screen time throughout Requiem.</p>
<p>In fact, Nakanishi compared the structure to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>, during which players jumped between Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield (funnily enough, this, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</a>, was also directed by Nakanishi).</p>
<p>Here's how Nakanishi describes the two play styles with Leon and Grace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’ve said before that Leon isn’t well suited to horror. Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don’t fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace’s sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We’re really emphasising the difference in their experiences this time.</p>
<p>"It’s almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna (laughs). It was important to combine the slow and fast segments well, and Grace and Leon turned out to be the best combination for that. Leon also has lots of new actions, giving you a strong sense of release compared to Grace’s sequences."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The director also explicitly states that Grace's gameplay is based specifically on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a>, while Leon's is based on Resident Evil 4. By including two distinct styles, the development team is hoping to relieve some of the terror players might feel when playing as Grace by allowing Leon to be the badass we know he is.</p>
<p>That said, Nakanishi is also keen to stress just how much weight Leon is carrying on his shoulders now that he's an older protagonist. He specifically mentions the idea of Leon returning to Raccoon City and responding to the "place where it all began" now that he's a lot more experienced.</p>
<p>This all sounds pretty great to us, and we can't wait to see how things pan out when Requiem launches on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

		<p><span>Despite being the most-hyped reveal at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-game-awards">The Game Awards 2025</a>, there’s a good chance you may not be familiar with the games that precede <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/divinity-original-sin-3">Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. However, it looks like RPG fans may soon get the chance to experience the breakout sequel that put this series on the map as well as its developer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/larian-studios">Larian Studios.</a> The same Larian Studios that created one of the genre’s modern masterpieces, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Divinity - Cinematic Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxzyVeAG00w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition has been floating in the ether for a while now. We assumed that, given the success of BG3, Larian would have quickly followed up with an enhanced version of its previous game, eager to steer its legion of newly-acquired fans towards Larian’s own original IP which debuted way back in 2002.</span></p>
<p><span>After appearing on a ratings board (which is usually a good sign of a game’s impending release) Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive fell off the radar, but now it has reappeared. Ahead of the big reveal at The Game Awards, <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1998412420050796931">a post from PlayStation Game Size surfaced on social media</a>, confirming the game’s existence on PS5.</span></p>


<p><span>Given that this information comes from a pretty reliable source when it comes to leaking PlayStation Store data, hopefully we can expect an official announcement from Larian Studios in the coming days.</span></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/26/divinity-original-sin-2-review/">Divinity: Original Sin 2 review</a> we scored the game a smashing 9/10, saying that it was “the strongest CRPG in decades, with a fascinating plot that enthrals, despite taking a while to get going and being hard as nails at times. It’s the little adventures that flesh out the world and so much of it can be missed at first glance because you didn’t have the right skill or failed a persuasion check. Massive in scope and jam packed with features that includes a GM mode that shows a surprising amount of customisation with great ease, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a bumper package.”</p>

			<p>For long stretches since Routine was announced way back in 2012, it’s been easy to assume this was vapourware, that it would never be released. It is therefore with great delight that I can confirm that, not only is it fully complete, but it has actually turned out to fulfil all my expectations and more. The retro-futuristic stylings, the moments of sheer terror, and the fascinating storyline all combine to produce a game that is well worth the wait.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROUTINE | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dm8Gw2MaLEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game’s title is a suitably tricky play on words, with dual references to the everyday nature of your job as a computer technician and the nature of the programs you interact with on the 1980s style terminals scattered around the lunar base. The aesthetic of the game draws equally on the Alien series and Duncan Jones’ Moon, with clear narrative echoes to both appearing as well. I am a sucker for this kind of vision of the future so have been eagerly awaiting the chance to immerse myself in Lunar Software’s debut game.</p>


<p>Routine begins in standard science fiction disaster fashion. A lunar base outpost has suffered a complete systems breakdown shortly after the crew reported a mysterious finding. You take the role of a solo systems tech who must travel to the base and find out how to restore power and function. Little do you know that you will be exposed to mysteries and horrors beyond your imagination and find yourself changed in ways you never thought possible.</p>


<p>The general atmosphere and aesthetics of Routine are superb, taking clear influence from the retro-futurism of films like Alien and Silent Running. Huge CRT monitors are littered around the environment with many being accessible for hacking with your gun-like multitool. Unlike many similar games, objects around you are more interactive, with intuitive prone and leaning mechanics being necessary to hide and navigate around parts of the environment. </p>
<p>The early enemies are threatening and merciless but have nothing on what will face you later on. Environmental signposting is good and it is worth trying to orient yourself through this as there was no in-game map that I could find. While there is a degree of backtracking involved, the individual areas are compact enough to avoid this becoming a chore.</p>

<p>Interacting with the world requires the use of your CAT (Cosmonaut Assistance Tool), which looks like a gun but is not really an offensive weapon and feels more like a blend of a VHS camera and radar speed gun. You can fire off bolts of electricity to stun enemies, but this function was mostly used for puzzle solving in my playthrough. In the very beginning of the game the embedded tutorial teaches you that the CAT requires batteries (fortunately these are incredibly common around the map) with different modules you find along the way using up different amounts of power.</p>
<p>Your first module is a Wi-Fi feature that lets you connect to the main terminals in the game – terminals that act as save points, task journals, and manual. This immersive menu is incredibly effective and means that you never have to break free of the game to save and access your journal whilst also ensuring that you need to find a terminal to access these functions. The immersive nature of the mechanics continues with the CAT itself which you have to directly engage with to insert batteries, activate the WiFi and also use the later module upgrades which require you to hold up the device’s miniature screen and zoom in.</p>

<p>Puzzles range from looking for password codes to directly using the CAT functions to search the environment for hidden clues. These functions are introduced regularly throughout the game in a way that means you are never left doing the same thing for too long.</p>
<p>The pacing of the game in general is excellent, unless you put it down for a day or two and forget your way around… Playing prior to release added a great deal of extra satisfaction as there were no walkthroughs or puzzle solutions to look up. I’d absolutely recommend persevering if you’re stuck to experience the game this way.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Routine is one of the best linear narrative experiences I’ve played this year and is well worth the lengthy wait for release. The atmosphere and aesthetics combine to create a game that oscillates between unnerving and genuinely terrifying whilst the surreal and philosophical storyline will hook you all the way to the game’s conclusion. I’m looking forward to a host of video essays dissecting the narrative in the near future.	</p></div>

              <p>Everyone knew <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> was a frontrunner to clinch some of the biggest categories at The Game Awards 2025, but I don’t know that anyone expected it to sweep the night and <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">set a new record for winning nine awards</a> (<em>The Last Of Us 2</em> earned seven back in 2020). Instead of resting on its laurels, Sandfall Interactive used the night to shadow-drop <em>Clair Obscur</em>‘s free mini-DLC to give fans a reason to dive back into the Belle Époque RPG.</p> <p>This content drop <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-free-update-expansion-bosses-2000633193">was teased earlier this year</a> and includes a new playable environment called “Verso’s Drafts” inspired by the character’s childhood. There’s also new late-game boss battles, more Luminas and Weapons, extra costumes, and the addition of a photo mode for players to document their dress-up sessions with. Here’s a trailer for the new area:</p>  <p>The photo mode comes with dozens of filters and the devs say they’re excited to see how players use them to capture moments from the game’s memorable cinematic scenes in completely new ways. And for anyone who hasn’t played Clair Obscure yet, it’s worth noting that the game is currently just $40. Normally $50, it’s 20 percent off on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox until December 16.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitechs-wireless-gaming-headset-deal-comes-early-hitting-its-cheapest-price-yet-despite-being-newly-released-2000652578</link>

              <p>Enhance your gaming experience by treating yourself to audio that actually does your games justice. If you’ve been relying on the default speakers built into your TV, you probably don’t realize how much you’re missing. Switching to a quality over-ear headset feels a lot like discovering you’ve needed glasses your entire life—once you try it, everything suddenly becomes sharper and far more detailed. With proper surround sound, you can pick up tiny environmental cues, like the faint scuffle of an opponent approaching from behind, and identify their position using audio alone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6369/">Even better, the Logitech G522 Lightspeed PC gaming headset is currently 25% off, dropping from $160 to just $120 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6369/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Advanced Synchronized Audio</h2>
<p>Logitech knows to take comms seriously. It doesn’t matter if you are a pro-level&nbsp;<em>League</em> player telling your jungler when to make their move or if you’re just laughing with friends because you barreled back down the mountain in <em>PEAK</em> again. The best in class voice clarity with full bandwidth 48 khz/16 bit microphone ensures your words are coming across crystal-clear. Its can handle broadcast-quality audio if you intend to use this headset while livestreaming on Twitch.</p>
<p>The audio you hear is equally impressive. The state-of-the-art PRO-G audio drivers can deliver synchronized 48 khz/24 bit audio of the highest quality, producing rich bass with minimal distortion. You get real sound—not the hollow tin-can crap you hear with bargain-bin headsets.</p>
<p>The Logitech G522 Lightspeed headset offers several choices for how to connect to your PC or mobile devices. Use a wired USB-A and USB-C connection for uninterrupted play. Bluetooth is also supported so you can connect to your phone or even a Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Any gaming headset worth its weight in gold needs to be comfortable. The Logitech G522 Lightspeed headset utilizes rounded cushion ear cups for maximum comfort. The suspension band allows it to fit around the contour of your head perfectly. Plus, its washable so you can keep the whole thing hygienic. No one has ever gotten a Victory Royale without sweating a little bit. The headset is lightweight too so you’ll barely even notice it while wearing it on your dome.</p>
<p>And of course, this wouldn’t be a capital-G “Gamer” accessory without the state-of-play-mandated RGB support. The side-facing lighting can produce up to 16.8 million colors, fully customizable by you. There are eight different lighting zones across the headset so you can create different combinations of colors.</p>
<p data-start="2463" data-end="2767">Battery life is another standout. With lighting off, you’ll be hitting close to the 60 hours of game time before you need to plug it back in. Not stats unfortunately on how long the headset lasts with lighting on. And with a 30-meter wireless range, you can wander off between matches to make much-needed trips to the kitchen to replenish your snacks without losing audio.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Last night’s Game Awards revealed the first trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-trailer-cast-release-date-2000652775">next year’s&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie</a>, and people’s reaction has been excellent to watch. Given the source material, and the multiple straight-faced attempts to make it work as a movie over the last few decades, there was a base assumption that this would be another self-serious attempt to make a dramatic action movie. When it was clearly not that, something that looked both fun and even funny, the world reacted with a collective “huh?” But to solve the puzzle, there’s one important piece that people missed: the director.</p> <p><em>Street Fighter</em> is being directed by Kitao Sakurai. Who’s that, you ask. Kitao Sakurai is the director of 62 episodes of <em>The Eric Andre Show</em>.</p> <p>If that doesn’t mean anything to you, this should help:</p>  <p>And now we’re all on the same page.</p> <p>I think it’s really worth watching the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie trailer again, following the above.</p>

  <p>I was pretty sure that was Eric Andre dancing behind the news desk as Don Sauvage for a split-second there the first time I watched. And yup, it is! And it all starts to make so much more sense.</p>

 <p>As social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spacecoyote.com/post/3m7r5oye4xc27">filled with memes</a> about the extraordinary new look for Guile, and game sites tried to comprehend what they’d just seen, it was all reasonably skewed by prior expectations. Me too! And <em>Kotaku</em> in general! Ethan’s take was to call the trailer “<a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-trailer-cast-release-date-2000652775">surprisingly good</a>.” It’s only 16 years since we were served Andrzej Bartkowiak <i>Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li</i> (<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/street-fighter-the-legend-of-chun-li/">a 17 on <em>Metacritic</em></a>), and no one can shake 1994’s Steven E. de Souza version, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue. There was no reason to think that that we should hope for something better this time, either. So watching the trailer, preconceptions were so heavy that it was almost impossible to see what was really happening.</p>

 <p>What we actually see in this trailer is <em>deranged</em>. With the blinkers of pessimism removed, every cliched pose, every choreographed punch and kick, starts to reveal what it truly is: a goof. Seriously, look closer. That hoary old shot of Zangief pulling the tractor—there are two bored men sat on top of it, one reading a paper. The crash zoom on Andrew Koji’s Ryu, a shameless Bruce Lee rip-off moment—that’s on purpose. And Noah Centineo looking like the Ken doll version of Ken Masters—that also makes much more sense. In this light, Guile’s spectacular (and faithful!) flattop is no longer an anomaly, but a natural part of events.</p>

 <p>Now factor in the details like how Kyle Mooney has a character in this film, and how Sakurai’s more recent work has included&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal</em>, and his only previous feature film was the surprisingly good genre-bending comedy <em>Bad Trip</em> starring Eric Andre and Lil Rey Howery, and there’s no way to believe this new&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie is going to be a weird-ass comedy from start to finish.</p> <p>Heck, given the pacing on the Eric Andre Show, the frenetic trailer might even match the final experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Review</p>
      </div>
<p>A new Call of Duty game has been released every year since the franchise's beginning in 2003, and it doesn't appear that Xbox-owned publisher Activision will stop this pattern any time soon. The only change to the release model is that the series will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release back-to-back installments</a> of the same subseries, as Modern Warfare and Black Ops have both done.</p><p>Even with Black Ops 7's shortcomings, Booty states that the title is "one of the most-played games on Xbox" and he remains "really proud of what the team did, in terms of feature innovation, moving the franchise forward."</p><p>The Xbox team also stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call of Duty was the top franchise on Xbox Game Pass</a> in terms of player-count and hours played, although this applies to the series as a whole, not just Black Ops 7.</p><p>Booty also emphasized that, in regard to any Call of Duty title, it's "not just about the launch" but also about the ongoing seasonal content that follows. Black Ops 7 Season 1 launched earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-7-and-warzone-season-1-adds-more-maps-weapons-and-warzone-integration/2900-7281/" data-ref-id="2900-7281">adding new weapons, maps, and integration with Warzone</a>.</p><p>In the same interview, Booty also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-a-call-of-duty-movie-is-finally-happening-after-10-years-of-trying/1100-6536930/" data-ref-id="1100-6536930">touched on the upcoming Call of Duty movie</a>, which he expressed confidence for.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/165-id-software-developers-form-wall-to-wall-union-cwa/</link>
            <guid>1381858</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yet another Microsoft studio has taken advantage of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">labour neutrality agreement the company signed with the CWA (Communications Workers of America)</a> to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard through, and this time it's DOOM developer id Software, with 165 developers at the Texas-based studio voting in favour of forming a wall-to-wall union.</p>



<p>Announced with <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-developers-texas-vote-form-latest-wall-wall-union-cwa">a press release from the CWA</a>, union members cited wanting to protect elements of their work, like being able to work remotely, ensuring "<em>responsible</em> <em>use of AI</em>," as lead services programmer at id Software and union member, Chris Hays, told <a href="https://aftermath.site/id-software-union-doom-microsoft-cwa/">Aftermath</a> in an interview.</p>



<p>"<em>The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives</em>," said id Software producer and union organizer Andrew Willis in a press release. "<em>The union is a way for us, the developers, to take back control of the industry we love and to ensure that it delivers high-quality products from high-quality workers who have health benefits and longevity beyond quarterly profits.</em>"</p>



<p>This past August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/450-diablo-developers-vote-in-favor-unionizing-cwa/">450 developers working on the Diablo series at Blizzard voted in favour</a> of forming a union with the CWA, and in May 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZeniMax Workers United QA were able to reach a tentative deal with Microsoft</a> to finally ratify their union contract after two years of negotiating.</p>



<p>"<em>Remote work isn't a perk,</em>" Hays added in the CWA press release. "<em>It's a necessity for our health, our families,</em> <em>and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being.</em> <em>With a union, we will have the opportunity to make sure that everyone has a voice in the things that matter most to us</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the developers at id Software have voted in favour of the union, they will have to go through the process of getting a contract agreement and then getting that agreement ratified. It took the ZeniMax Workers United QA union two years and a strike to get their contract done, which doesn't bode well for the other unions under Microsoft currently trying to get a contract agreed on and signed. But voting for the union is still a major step towards better working conditions for the developers.</p>



<p>Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has changed the video game industry in a myriad of ways, but perhaps one of the most significant ways will end up being how it allowed a labour movement within the video game industry to gain serious momentum. </p>



<p>"<em>I'm very proud to be a part of this effort to organize our studio, to have a voice in decisions that directly affect myself and my coworkers</em>," said organizing member and senior VFX artist at id Software, Caroline Pierrot. "<em>In an industry that has proven to be very unstable over the last few years, more unions means more power to the workers and a real shot at shaping the future of the industry for the better</em>."</p>

            <p>
How about that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-official-control-2-is-control-resonant-a-paranatural-melee-brawler-with-shapeshifting-hittin-sticks">Control Resonant</a>! What was previously referred to as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> now has its own name, and its own protagonist, Dylan Faden, the tongues-speaking brother of the first game's heroine Jesse. Gone is her shapeshifting gun too, replaced with a shapeshifting bit of metal instead. The horrors of the Oldest House have spilled out into New York City, Jesse is MIA, and Dylan must bash his way through it all to find her in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>-esque manner. Interesting enough a setup, but I am bothered by one thing: Remedy say you don't need to play the first game to play this one.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/control-resonant-brings-a-new-paranatural-crisis-to-ps5-out-2026/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that came with the official reveal last night, co-creative director at Remedy Mikael Kasurinen laid it out for us. "You don’t need to have played the first Control to experience Resonant," he wrote. "It’s a new story and a fresh entry point into Remedy’s world of the Federal Bureau of Control - though returning players will recognize familiar echoes of Jesse’s path and the mysteries binding these two siblings together."
</p>
<p>
This isn't a surprising thing in that by the time Control Resonant releases next year, if it does, it will have been seven years since the first one came out (the same amount of time that has passed in-world). It's just quite frustrating, because when the studio said <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-faq/">the same thing about Alan Wake 2</a>, it was only true on a technical level. Sure, it was easy enough to follow, but there really is so much to it that you'll need to have played the first one to fully appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
Seven years in-world is obviously a convenient amount of time to help justify the lack of a need to play a previous game. It is just a frustrating trend that has been born out of a desperation to, I assume, make certain sales figures. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Rebirth's co-director even said <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1665705101196136448">you don't have to play Remake beforehand to enjoy it</a>, which is nonsense of the highest order.
</p><p>
Sequels are not an inherently bad thing, and if you can only make them in a fashion where you need to bring in new people, thusly potentially alienating what drew people in in the first place, I question why you're making a sequel at all. Hell, Remedy are trying to build a whole universe here - why not be brave and go the whole hog, try something actually new?
</p>
<p>
Mayhaps I am being a curmudgeon, I would like to note that I do think the actiony, whompy bits look Sick as Heck, and will be eager to check it out whenever it does end up releasing next year. But I won't pretend that I don't need to play Control.

If you’re looking to enjoy a more immersive visual experience with your screen, where the entire room lights up during action-packed scenes and settles into a calm vibe when something peaceful is playing, a smart lighting strip is what you need.</p>
<p>Depending on the features you’re after, these can cost a pretty penny, but that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/">The 65-inch Philips Hue Play Gradient Smart TV light strip is currently going for just $130 at Amazon, after a whopping 56% or $167 discount.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen these lights drop to in a long, long while, and you’ll also enjoy free shipping with your purchase. These are sure to make holiday movie nights a lot more fun – just be sure to get your orders in before the price goes back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of LED Multi-Color Lights</h2>
<p>The box comes with a one White and Color Ambiance 65-inch TV smart LED light strip with mounting brackets. It attaches to the back of your screen (just below the corners) safely using the brackets. This deal applies to the 65-inch version, but you can also get the 55-inch and 75-inch sizes, depending on the size of your TV. Both versions are discounted, going for $142 and $255, respectively. Note that the lighting strips need to be paired with a Hue bridge and sync box (both sold separately) to unlock their full potential. If you don’t have those already, now is a good time to snap them up, too, as several Philips Hue products are going for less at Amazon.</p>



<p>Once everything is up, the strip offers both warm-to-cool white and millions of LED multi-color lights to choose from. The colors blend perfectly into each other, while the 45-degree angle light projector casts the stunning gradient of light onto the wall behind your TV. Of course, syncing abilities are the highlight here, as they make the lights react to whatever’s happening on screen in real time, whether you’re watching a show, playing a game, or just listening to your favorite music. Watching a Stranger Things episode? Expect your living room to light up with some Eleven magic. Thrilling, action-packed games with a shooting sequence are going to put up a light show, while LoFi songs are going to fill the space with calm vibes. It’s great for both solo streaming sessions, movie nights with friends, plus fun New Year’s parties.</p>
<p>Voice control is supported, meaning you won’t always have to adjust settings or manage the lights manually via the dedicated app. It plays nicely with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can say something like “Hey Alexa, turn the lights on”, or “Hey Alexa, increase the brightness”, and your command will be answered in seconds. The Hue Bridge brings even more convenience by letting you add motion sensors, set routines, create timers, and more. There’s a lot more to like about this smart lighting strip. It does more than adding lights to your setup; it creates a vibe. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/">The current deal lets you pick the 65-inch version for $130, after an impressive 56% discount.</a> Other sizes are discounted too, so there are options to choose from. Deals this good tend to wrap up soon, so it’s best to grab yours without wasting a lot of time.</p>

<h4>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie – Official Mario &amp; Luigi vs. Bowser Jr. Teaser</h4>
<p>It made a billion at the box office so of course there’s a sequel to the Super Mario Bros. movie, and here we get to see Bowser Jr. being very annoying.</p>

			<p>Marvel Rivals appearing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> might not have been the most surprising thing to happen at the show, but the reveal trailer NetEase Games brought with it matched the energy and the spectacle of the show appropriately, as it revealed that Deadpool would be joining the game's roster on January 16, 2026, with the launch of Season 6. Season 5.5, meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-adds-rogue-gambit-new-game-mode-new-map-and-more/">which adds Rogue to the roster after Gambit was added at the beginning of Season 5,</a> is available right now.</p>



<p>The cinematic trailer for Season 6 was one of the more animated trailers of the night, with Deadpool cracking jokes all the way through that fit his character, particularly all of his fourth-wall-breaking comments.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NetEase will reveal more details about Season 6: Night at the Museum and Deadpool closer to its arrival, though in the meantime, Season 5.5 is available right now for players to jump into, adding a new vanguard, the X-Men Rogue, to the roster.</p>



<p>Season 5.5 also sees the return of Jeff's Winter Splash Festival, this time with a new holiday-themed map,  Jeffland. It features a new three-way brawl and three unique Jeff builds that each have their own skill set. There are also plenty of winter and holiday-themed skins for players to grab to keep the holiday mood going through each match.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>And, as is the case with every seasonal update, there's plenty of tweaks, balances, and bug fixes included in today's Season 5.5 release, with this batch including improvements to the spectactor system, new emotes, fixes for player stats that weren't registering properly, and more, all of which you can find in the patch notes with the big highlights mentioned in NetEase's Dev Vision video below.</p>

            <p>Have you showered yet today? No? Then maybe treat yourself to a bath if you can. It might help prepare for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Capcom formally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-confirm-leon-kennedys-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-with-new-trailer">confirmed last night</a> that, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">leaked</a>, it contains Leon Kennedy. Some of their devs have now offered a bit more detail as to how it'll feel to play as both him and co-lead Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, Requiem director Akifumi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa revealed that the time number of sections you'll spend playing as one of the two protagonists are "almost equally split", likening the structure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>.</p>
<p>As for how it feels to jump back and forth between them, there's a dichotomy of more traditional horror/fighty bloke action going on. "I’ve said before that Leon isn’t well suited to horror," Nakanishi explained. "Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don’t fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace’s sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We’re really emphasizing the difference in their experiences this time.</p>
<p>"It’s almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna."</p><p>Taking that metaphor forwards, I assume the monstery things the pair are up against are the dirt and dust we all accrue when we're out and about not playing a horror game. If any other familiar Resi faces show up, will they be filling the role of those little bits of cucumber which get put on the eyes of every person who's every been in an advert for places that boast baths and saunas?</p>
<p>Despite all the relaxing language, Nakanishi made clear that the actiony bits won't be a walk in the park. "The battle this time will probably push Leon to his limits more than ever before", the director said, later adding that the team have build on Kennedy's Resi 4 moveset to mirror how his skills and mindset have evolved since his last appearance. Altogether, Nakanishi reckons the juxtaposition of spooks and shoots will help Requiem deliver "a kind of exhilaration and satisfaction that past Resident Evil titles didn’t offer". </p>
<p>We'll see if that's the case when the Resi spa opens up on February 27th, 2026.</p>
