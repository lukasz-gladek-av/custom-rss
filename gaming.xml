			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game confirmed to use NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch, despite the currently available footage not featuring any indication of the upscaler being used.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed they received official confirmation from CD Projekt RED that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-development-more-seven-weeks-the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2</a> uses a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. DLSS is reportedly used in all four display modes - docked Quality and Performance, and handheld Quality and Performance.</p>
<p>After having received confirmation, Digital Foundry went back to the footage available in the best possible quality to see if there's any clear indication of the upscaler being in use, but the low post-processing quality, which is at a lower resolution than the rest of the footage, makes it difficult to spot some of those DLSS "edges" that show the upscaler being in use, although some were still found upon a closer inspection of the footage.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Cyberpunk 2077 uses NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2, CD Projekt Red also confirmed that, while all modes target 1080p resolution, except for handheld Performance mode, which targets 720p, dynamic resolution scaling is in place, and the scaling can range from 2x and up per axis, meaning that we are looking at a 540p to 1080p range for the display modes targeting 1080p and a 360p to 720p range for Performance handheld.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most regions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

This time, it’s through the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle, a new Battle Royale season that starts May 2nd and features Darth Jar Jar and the debut of Force Lightning, a new in-game ability. The news was appropriately <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">revealed at Star Wars Celebration</a> in Japan. As with most <em>Fortnite</em> seasons, this one had been heavily rumored in the runup.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Darth Jar Jar is a <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-jar-jar-theory-explained/">goofy fan theory</a> that holds that Jar Jar Binks was secretly a Force user and possibly the real villain of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequel trilogy.</p><p>Ahmed Best, the voice of Jar Jar Binks since <em>Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace</em>, said on stage at the event that he improvised some Darth Jar Jar lines for the portrayal. When asked to list any of his favorites, he said, “‘I am the phantom menace’ was totally [improvised],” adding that the line was something he’s “been meaning to say for over 20 years.”</p><p>Galactic Battle will include X-Wings and TIE Fighters that players can pilot, themed maps, and “all-new Item Shop offerings including Mace Windu.” Players will also be able to buy put their hard-earned Fortnite V-Bucks towards a <em>Star Wars-</em>themed Battle Pass with characters like Emperor Palpatine and Wookiee Cuddle Team Leader. Galactic Battle will play out over five weeks with different themes leading up to a narrative live event. Here’s the schedule, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">from StarWars.com</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Imperial Takeover – May 2, 2025</p><p>The Pull of the Force – May 8, 2025</p><p>Mandalorian Rising – May 22, 2025</p><p>Star Destroyer Bombardment – May 29, 2025</p><p>Death Star Sabotage – June 7, 2025</p></blockquote></div><div><p>Of course, this is far from the first collaboration between the two pop culture behemoths. There have been <em>Star Wars</em> skins in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966222/fortnite-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-crossover-event-stormtroopers">game dating back to 2019</a>, and last year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148086/may-the-fortnite-be-with-you"><em>Star Wars</em> elements spread throughout the entire <em>Fortnite </em>ecosystem</a>, including its Lego and rhythm game spinoffs.</p></div><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s current season <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616926/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-lawless-trailer-battle-pass">has a heist theme</a>, and has featured celebrity cameos from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/627340/auto-draft">Shohei Ohtani</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644491/switch-it-up-like-nintendo-xbox-playstation-pc-and-mobile">Sabrina Carpenter</a>.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Right now, the details are pretty sparse - for instance, we don't yet know what characters will, or will not, be added to the battle pass, but there's a number of familiar faces in the teaser above - and it's thought this season will run a little shorter than usual, possibly clocking in at around 30 days.

            <p>Pocketpair has responded to Nintendo's legal action by asserting the patents The Pokémon Company believes Pocketpair has contravened are invalid due to other games that came before it, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, Tomb Raider, and even Nintendo's own Legend of Zelda series.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/pocketpairs-defenses-against-nintendos-patent-lawsuit-unpacked-ark-craftopia-zelda-ff14-etc-may-render-asserted-patents-invalid/">Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/palworld-dev-fights-nintendo-lawsuit-with-comparisons-to-fallout-monster-hunter-and-more/">VGC</a>), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair challenged Nintendo's patent applications which were reportedly filed between February and July 2024, several weeks and months after the monster-collecting game debuted in January of that same year.</p>
<p>Pocketpair maintains through prior preparatory briefs that Nintendo's patents-in-suit shouldn't have been granted given games using the systems and art protected by the patents were already in existence.</p>

<figcaption>PALWORLD Early Access Review: Is It Worth It?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZl10Mlc7I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Specifically, the developer said the patents contravene art already in place in Ark: Survival Evolved, Pocket Souls, and its own Craftopia, as well as a whole list of other notable references, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, Octopath Traveler, Pikmin 3, Monster Hunter Ultimate, and a range of prior Pokémon games.</p>
<p>Pocketpair states that games like Rune Factory 5, Titanfall 2, and Pikmin 3 Deluxe "make it easy to see how a player character can perform an action to release a monster or a capture item (like a ball) and fire in a direction by releasing a button", whilst Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Far Cry 5 and Tomb Raider "already showed that there can be different types of throwable objects".</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pocket Souls, Octopath Traveler, Monster Super League and Final Fantasy 14 "made it easy to imagine that one could pick targets on the field and then show an indication of how likely the capture operation is to succeed", and "generally speaking, it has been an element of the Pokémon series for more than 30 years that different capture items have different success rates".</p>
<p>If, like Pocketpair believes, all these games already invalidate Nintendo's patents, "it doesn't matter whether Palworld does what such a patent describes: you can infringe an invalid patent all you want".</p>
<p>"There is no question that Pocketpair and its lawyers have made a huge effort to develop many invalidity and non-infringement arguments," the briefing by Games Fray - prepared by a patent-specialist Japanese lawyer - states.</p>
<p>"Again, a single such argument for a given patent is enough to be cleared with respect to that patent. But Nintendo is suing over three patents, and Pocketpair won’t want to lose over any single one of them."</p>
<p>As Eurogamer sumarised recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a> ever since Palworld was first revealed. Dubbed "Pokémon with guns" ahead of its early access release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a> before Nintendo finally announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> in September. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular.</p>
<p>As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a> but despite this, Pocketpair <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/">has released a game on Nintendo Switch</a>, and is considering bringing Palworld to Nintendo Switch 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Nvidia's machine learning upscaler is used in both docked and handheld modes.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the most ambitious titles lined up for the launch of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt RED</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> has been showcased via work-in-progress code seen at the console's launch tour. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Digital Foundry had the chance to go hands-on at the recent London event</a> and while our initial impressions are on the record, many questions remained unanswered. Is the port using Nvidia DLSS? CDPR has now confirmed that the answer is yes, making this the first known title to use the machine learning-based upscaling technology.</p>
<p>"We're using a version of DLSS available for Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, powered by Nvidia's Tensor cores," the firm told us. "The game utilises DLSS in all four modes: in handheld and docked, and the performance and quality variations of each."</p>
<p>DLSS has been viewed as a 'magic bullet' of sorts in the run-up to the Switch 2's unveiling. In a world where developers are pushing visual technology to the next level, running games at full native res with consistent performance becomes unviable, so rendering at lower rendering resolutions is commonplace, with upscalers used to produce the final output image. These upscalers can range from basic bilinear scaling to more advanced techniques, like TAA upscaling - where information from prior frames is fed into the current one to improve detail.</p>
<p>DLSS is a form of TAA upscaling, but with a twist - by feeding the lower resolution frame along with history from prior frames and other data, such as motion vectors - a neural network is then used to reconstruct the image. As the Switch 2's GPU includes machine learning tensor cores, there's no reason why any DLSS technology couldn't come to the Nintendo hybrid - the caveat being that there's still a computational cost to using it.</p>

<p>CD Projekt RED also confirmed that the current target for the Switch 2 version of the game is to offer different graphics modes - a quality and performance toggle for the handheld and docked versions. When connected to a TV, there's the choice of a 30fps quality mode and a 40fps performance mode. The latter would presumably operate only with the TV in 120Hz mode - a new frame for every three display refreshes, up against the 30fps quality mode which delivers a new frame for every other refresh. With consistent performance, both should look smooth, with the 40fps mode sitting between 30fps and 60fps in terms of fluidity. Both modes are using 1080p as the output resolution with dynamic resolution scaling in effect in combination with DLSS.</p>
<p>The handheld mode - as things stand - is slightly different. Necessarily so as system performance is lower. In this scenario, the quality mode is still outputting a 1080p image with DLSS and dynamic resolution scaling, again targeting 30fps. The performance mode sees the output resolution drop to 720p, with the handheld screen in 120Hz mode and 40fps as the target.</p>
<p>In terms of input resolutions, our initial pixel counts from the very, very short snippet of footage seen in the Nintendo Direct delivered readings from 540p to 1080p - and the fact we could pixel count it at all made us doubt whether DLSS was in play at all. CD Projekt RED has also confirmed that "scaling can range from 2x and up per axis", so depending on GPU load, the DLSS upscaler will be fed with anything from 540p to 1080p in the 30fps quality modes and the docked 40fps performance mode. For the handheld iteration of the performance mode, the 2x and up scaling would suggest DRS between 360p and 720p, depending on GPU load.</p>

<p>DLSS compatibility had been mentioned by Nintendo and Nvidia in previous PR, but its use in Cyberpunk 2077 (and in both handheld and docked configurations, no less) is our first confirmation of the technology being used in a launch title. However, we are seeing a slightly different utilisation of DLSS compared to PC. There, it's typically the case that post-processing elements are rendered at the same output resolution. So, if you're outputting 1080p from a 540p image, there are still components of the image that should be rendered at full 1080p.</p>
<p>It may be the case that Cyberpunk 2077 is still rendering those post-processed components at input resolution instead, which may explain why we're able to see obvious stair-stepping edges that make pixel-counting possible. As you'll see in the DF Direct posted today, it does look to be the older convolutional neural network version of DLSS that's being used - not Nvidia's freshly minted DLSS 4.0 transformer model.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">hands-on with Cyberpunk 2077 at the Switch 2 London event</a>, our impression was that CDPR's work-in-progress code was recognisably Cyberpunk, but we encountered many situations where it appeared both CPU and GPU were over-taxed resulting in some lurching drops to performance. However, the code was seven weeks old at that point with a good deal of development time remaining until the Switch 2 launch on June 5. We view Cyberpunk 2077 as something of a benchmark game - and can't wait to see final code on the new Nintendo console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/interview/649723/henk-rogers-tetris-book-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Henk Rogers first read the script for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23650577/apple-tetris-movie-taron-egerton-review">the <em>Tetris</em> movie</a>, he was shocked. “There was so much Hollywood in the movie,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It just drove me nuts.” The film largely follows a pivotal period in Rogers’ life, when he traveled to the Soviet Union to navigate the complex rights issues for <em>Tetris</em> to bring it to platforms like the Game Boy. There, he connected with game’s creator Alexey Pajitnov, with whom he eventually formed a lifelong friendship, and turned <em>Tetris </em>into a global phenomenon.</p><p>The movie turned this experience into something resembling a high-stakes spy thriller — and while Rogers ended up loving the final product, that initial experience inspired him to tell the story of what really happened. “While reading the script I said, ‘I have to set the record straight,’” he says.</p><p>That story now exists in the form of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Game-Tetris-Russia-Love/dp/1962603202?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>The Perfect Game</em></a>. While Rogers originally sat down to write about the events that transpired in the movie, he soon realized the story was much bigger than that. “I started writing it, and somebody looked at it and said, ‘That could be a book, it’s just not big enough,’” he explains. “I didn’t want to rewrite that part and add water, so to speak, so I added the before and after. So it ended up being about my game career.”</p><p><em>The Perfect Game</em> starts out by exploring Rogers’ early life, bouncing around from the Netherlands to New York City to Hawaii, before eventually landing in Japan, where he founded Bullet-Proof Software and went on to release the influential RPG <em>The Black Onyx</em>. Even before the book gets to the <em>Tetris</em> part of the tale, it’s filled with fascinating insight into the early days of game development. Rogers talks through the many complications and nuances of dealing with publishers and funding, as well as releasing and marketing a game in Japan despite not speaking Japanese.</p><p>But things really kicked into gear at CES in 1988, when he flew to Las Vegas in search of a new game to publish and stumbled on a puzzle game about falling blocks. As he tells it, he knew immediately that he found something special. “I left the Consumer Electronics Show with a sense of purpose,” Rogers writes in his book. “I was determined to publish <em>Tetris </em>in Japan.” That proved tricky, of course, due in large part to the web of copyright laws in the Soviet Union at the time. Rogers found himself traveling back and forth between the Soviet Union and Japan, dealing with everyone from the higher-ups at Nintendo — including legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto — to the intimidating employees at Soviet trade organizations.</p><div><p>“There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p></div><p>Rogers’ account is a detailed one, and he says that he wrote the book entirely from memory. That said, he did check with his friend Pajitnov on a few details, which resulted in one of the book’s more charming features. At various points, Pajitnov’s thoughts are inserted into the book, where he often disagrees with Rogers on small details, like how impressed he was by the Famicom version of <em>Tetris</em> or the quality of the elevator in his apartment building.</p><p>“Alexei read my manuscript and was writing in the margins where his memory is different, so I decided to keep those and put them in the book,” Rogers explains. “There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p><p>Even if it’s missing the Hollywood thrills of the script that inspired Rogers to write in the first place, <em>The Perfect Game</em> is a fascinating read, particularly if you’re interested in game development anecdotes. And because the story covers the entirety of Rogers’ career to date, which includes setting up The Tetris Company and bringing the game to just about every platform imaginable, there are a lot of stories about pivotal points in the medium, from the launch of the Game Boy to the burgeoning days of mobile gaming.</p><p>The story is especially notable as<em> Tetris</em> continues to thrive. In addition to the movie and book, Rogers was also featured prominently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox">Digital Eclipse’s playable documentary <em>Tetris Forever</em></a><em>,</em> and the game still pops up frequently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636581/nintendo-music-app-tetris-dr-mario-kirby-edit-share-playlists-update">places like Nintendo’s new music app</a>. Rogers has largely stepped away from the business, which is now run by his daughter Maya. So now when he sees the game appear somewhere surprising, it elicits a different kind of feeling. “It feels like success,” he says. “Every time <em>Tetris</em> pops up somewhere, or a new deal comes down the pike, it’s like, ‘Wow, she’s killing it.‘”</p><p>As for that movie, Rogers changed his mind when he actually saw it, describing the film as “emotionally correct,” even if it didn’t get all of the facts right. “The first time I saw it I cried about things that never actually happened,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For years, I’ve cared a lot about my wallpaper. Sometimes it’s a photo of a place I love, sometimes it’s a shot of my family, sometimes that all just looks kind of aesthetically busy and I go for something minimalist. I find a lot of wallpapers just by Googling words, but in case you’re curious, here are a few sources of stuff I’ve liked over the years:</p><div><ul><li><span><a href="https://x.com/aestheticsguyy"><strong>Aestheticsguyy</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I don’t know anything about this person, their account, or where these wallpapers come from, but they post a <em>ton </em>and I find myself scrolling their page at least every couple of weeks. I’ve been really enjoying their <a href="https://x.com/aestheticsguyy/status/1907914130625003910"><strong>Formula series.</strong></a></span></li><li><span><strong>The </strong><a href="https://bento.me/papers"><strong>Papers</strong></a><strong> app.</strong> The mobile app, like most wallpaper apps, is pretty ad-riddled, but there’s a lot of good stuff in there. But honestly, I’ve found most of the stuff I like by following <a href="https://x.com/papers_app?lang=en">Paper’s X feed<strong>,</strong></a> which is just a giant stream of wallpaper options.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/category/Wallpaper"><strong>Basic Apple Guy</strong></a><strong>.</strong> As you’d expect, there’s a lot of Apple-related stuff, but some of his more abstract stuff really works for me. I really love the <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/liminal-spaces"><strong>Liminal</strong></a> set.</span></li><li><span><strong>The </strong><a href="https://www.backdrops.io/"><strong>Backdrops</strong></a><strong> app.</strong> This is one of the nicest selection of wallpapers – and one of the most usable wallpaper apps — I’ve found anywhere. (In the email version of this newsletter I said this was Android only, but I was wrong! It’s just harder to find on iOS.)</span></li><li><span><a href="https://onlockscreen.app/wallpapers"><strong>On Lock Screen</strong></a>. I don’t tend to find all that much truly unique stuff here, but it’s a fun website to poke around every now and again. (A lot of good stuff <a href="https://x.com/on_lockscreen">on the X feed here</a>, too.)</span></li><li><span><a href="https://shop.theverge.com/en-usd/pages/wallpapers"><strong>The Verge Shop</strong></a>. This is not just a plug! I mean, it <em>is, </em>but I mean it sincerely: I got our <a href="https://shop.theverge.com/products/cellular-wallpaper-pack"><strong>Cellular Wallpaper pack</strong></a> for free because I work here and it’s still my favorite wallpaper. And if you don’t want to pay, we have<a href="https://shop.theverge.com/en-usd/products/the-verge-wallpaper-pack"><strong> a whole archive of free ones</strong></a> to poke through.</span></li></ul></div><p>I should say two things about all this. One, the wallpaper world has long been a mess when it comes to ownership and copyright — people just share these things willy-nilly. And two, there is a <em>lot </em>of generative AI at work in the wallpaper game right now. I always try to track down wallpapers I find (a reverse image search on Google often does the trick), but it’s messy.</p><p>Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because I had a conversation with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/swolewoman/?hl=en"><strong>Casey Johnston</strong></a> from <a href="https://www.shesabeast.co/"><strong><em>She’s a Beast</em></strong></a> the other day (coming soon to <em>The Vergecast!</em>), and she made a surprisingly compelling case that actually, wallpapers are bad. She argued that you don’t want your lockscreen and homescreen to be peaceful or exciting or enticing — they should be ignored as much as possible, because you should either get to what you’re doing or get off your phone. This strikes me as a very good argument! I’ve had an all-black wallpaper going ever since we chatted, and, well, I don’t know how I feel about it. I certainly don’t like looking at it as much as I used to.</p><p>So here’s what I’m wondering: what’s your wallpaper strategy? Have you had the same one forever? Do you rotate daily? Hourly? Where do you find stuff? I want to hear all about it — and also, I want to start sharing more of your homescreens in this space, too. So if you have a good one, send it my way. And we’ll be back to our regular programming next week.</p><div><p id="crowdsourced"><h2>Crowdsourced</h2></p></div><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week.

<p>Taking to social media, the publisher/developer revealed it had confirmed the "unauthorised modification of game data in Monster Hunter Wilds for High Rank environment Investigations, Field Surveys, and more" and warned players to "stop playing immediately" if they suspect a quest has been modified after applying patch 1.010.</p>

<p>"Modified data can interfere with normal gameplay and even render the game unplayable. If you suspect a quest has been modified, please do not play it, or stop playing it immediately," the statement said.</p>
<p>Capcom then posted an image to help players identified modded data, such as missing monsters, too many item limits per slot, or "bonus rewards with six or more slots in quests for one target monster". You can see it below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>❗Unauthorized Data Modification Warning❗</p><p>We have confirmed the unauthorized modification of game data in Monster Hunter Wilds for High Rank environment Investigations, Field Surveys, and more.</p><p>Modified data can interfere with normal gameplay and even render the game… <a href="https://t.co/Z9HZuigQQZ">pic.twitter.com/Z9HZuigQQZ</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1913216880795410834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>A website <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/unauthorized-modification-data/">update</a> admits that Capcom "cannot individually determine whether a specific quest has been modified", but <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1913216880795410834">added</a> in a subsequent post: "We plan to implement additional countermeasures in future updates to detect users who have engaged in unauthorised modification of game data to prevent other players from being implicated in such actions".</p>
<p>If you do suspect that a quest you are participating in has been modified, Capcom recommends you leave "immediately" and "quit the game without saving".</p>
<p>The free Title Update 1 for Monster Hunter Wilds was released at the beginning of this month, April, bringing with it new quests where players compete for the fastest hunt time. However, even then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-warns-of-monster-hunter-wilds-cheaters-as-new-update-arrives">Capcom warned of potential cheaters, which will lead to account suspension and invalid completion times</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media, Capcom warned against cheaters and the use of external tools. "To ensure a fun and fair experience for our players, we will take action against accounts participating in fraudulent ranking activity, such as the use of cheating or external tools," it said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developed by Bit Reactor in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment, Star Wars Zero Company puts you in control of Hawks, a former Republic officer, in a gritty story starring an original cast set during the waning Clone Wars.</p>

<p>As Hawks, you command a ragtag group of mercenaries and bounty hunters from across the galaxy to combat a dangerous, emerging threat. Hawks' appearance and class are fully customizable, and the operatives you recruit come from a wide array of original Star Wars character classes and species, including Clone Troopers, astromechs, Jedi, and more. Your squadmates are also customizable through their appearances, loadouts, and abilities.</p>



<p>While in the field, players engage in turn-based tactics missions. Player choice looks to play a role in shaping the narrative and gameplay. You can also increase the bonds between your squadmates, unlocking powerful combat synergies. Between missions, you can build up your base and leverage your intelligence network of informants to stay on top of your enemies' moves.</p>

<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," Bit Reactor CEO and creative director Greg Foertsch said in a press release. "It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and a deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Gets Rated for Nintendo Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2.1168848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It looks like Assassin's Creed Shadows might be coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> in the not-too-distant future. The news comes directly from PEGI (Pan-European Game Information), the European rating regulator, which has <a href="https://pegi.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> a version for Nintendo's upcoming console. Of course, it could be a mistake, especially since the listing only appears in the 'most searched' tab and not when you actually search for the game.</p>
<p>However, chances are it's not. We know that Ubisoft has been a big supporter of Nintendo platforms ever since the original Switch. So far, for the Switch 2, they have just announced Star Wars Outlaws, which will be released on September 4 with all the DLC, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-dlc-arriving-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pirate's Fortune</a>, which launches next month on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>The main doubt surrounding the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows on the Nintendo Switch 2 would be of a technical nature. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is very advanced from a technical standpoint</a>. The latest iteration of the Anvil engine features virtual geometry, ray-traced global illumination, dynamic weather, wind, seasons, and destructible environments. However, it is that announcement of Star Wars Outlaws that should give fans hope. While Massive's game runs on a different engine, their own Snowdrop, it is just as advanced as Assassin's Creed Shadows, if not more so in certain areas. On PC, it's even more taxing than the latest Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 could run both games decently, it would be proof that it can punch above its weight class, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-good-job-ps4-visuals-enhancements-40-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to be</a> PlayStation 4-like with some enhancements here and there. Both of these games only run on the latest consoles by Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Assassin's Creed Shadows, the lineup of the upcoming console would get even richer. The game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> the second most successful launch after Valhalla, which launched during COVID, and critic reviews also rewarded Ubisoft Quebec's title accordingly. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 8.7/10 by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>

            <p>
Everything is expensive. Everything! Bills, food, video games, you name it. I mean, £75 for a game where you drive around as an Italian plumber? Not entirely convinced by this one, Mr. Bowser. I could get into the weeds of why all of this is happening (none of it for being particularly good reasons), but I won't because I bring word of something actually getting less expensive. Shock horror, I know, and yet here are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rockfish-games">Rockfish Games</a> announcing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everspace-2">Everspace 2's</a> upcoming Wrath of the Ancients DLC will be a bit cheaper when it launches.
</p>
<p>
Rockfish shared the news in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/524214742651240614">Steam post earlier this week</a>, explaining that "with events happening in the world, it seems like everything is getting more expensive and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general." Said events could perhaps be in reference to a certain man in a certain position of power enacting baffling tariffs, though I could be reading a smidge too deep between the lines here. As such, while the initial plan was for Wrath of the Ancients to be priced at $30, it'll now only be $25, quite a nice little reduction.
</p>
<p>
In turn, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game's</a> previous bit of DLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everspace-2-turns-monster-hunter-with-secret-nebula-dwelling-kaiju-that-are-essentially-living-procgen-dungeons">Titans</a> is also being lowered from $15 to $12. Great! Rockfish also quite quickly cleared up that no, "no content has been cut," and that currently they're in the "middle of our final polish and bug fixing phase ahead of release."
</p>
<p>
I am genuinely not sure I've heard of a developer lowering the cost of DLC prior to it even releasing like this before. I'm sure it must have happened somewhere along the line, but couldn't possibly tell you when. It's genuinely just quite a nice move because $5 really can go a long way. You'll be able to pick it up pretty soon too, as it launches on May 12th next month.

            <p>
I always find it a bit odd when people make comparisons like "new game is the next game you really love" because you're most likely setting yourself up for some kind of disappointment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a> was the most recent game to fall victim to such a framing, with many dubbing it as British <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a>, which it didn't end up being, nor was it likely intended to be. Thus, alongside some other issues, it's had a general reception of "yeah, it's not bad", which in a world of sequels upon sequels isn't always the response a developer might want. Still, a sequel is still clearly on developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rebellion-developments">Rebellion's</a> mind.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass">GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>, and how he's feeling post launch. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall," Kingsley explained, continuing on to say, "Happily, that risk is paying off." Guess that roughly positive, slightly mixed response isn't a huge deal then! That doesn't mean Kingsley believes the scale of the developer's projects is perfect, in fact when asked about it whether or not they've got it just right, he said he doesn't think so.
</p>
<p>
"I think that one of the things Chris [Kingsley, Rebellion co-founder and CTO] and I want to do is repeat success. So we want to do more Sniper Elite, we want to do more Zombie Army, we want to do more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-brigade">Strange Brigade</a>. Now it looks like we want to do more Atomfall - it's been successful, can we find the resources to do it? I don't know."
</p>
<p>
Kingsley goes on to talk about things like those Fallout comparisons, success on Game Pass, releasing Sniper Elite: Resistance just a couple of months beforehand, all well worth reading, but no clear indication as to whether or not he thinks a sequel might come. Rebellion are obviously best known for their Sniper series these days, which continue to do well. Perhaps we'll have to wait a while longer to see if they can carve out a slice of that pie for another Atomfall.
