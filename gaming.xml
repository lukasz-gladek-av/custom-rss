              <p><span>It’s been months since Epic Games <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-creepy-horror-game-steam-banned-before-launch-santa-ragione-2000647324">removed <em>Horses</em> from its PC storefront</a> and the two sides are still feuding about what exactly took place. Developer Santa Ragione claims it was ghosted by Epic while the </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>maker claims it’s been transparent throughout the process. Now Santa Ragione’s co-founder and studio director, Pietro Righi Riva, has responded to the response to the response, claiming Epic Games’ “vague and semi-automated statements” provided little in the way of meaningful feedback about why</span><i><span> Horses </span></i><span>was removed from the storefront.</span></p> <p><span>This latest chapter in the ongoing censorship fight began with </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game?open=false#%C2%A7a-note-about-horses"><i><span>Game File’s</span></i></a><span> February 5 interview with Epic Games, in which it asked VP Steve Allison why the game was taken down. “My understanding is the trust and safety team thought </span><i><span>[Horses</span></i><span>] was worth taking a fresh look, and they determined that it indeed was against our policies on a couple fronts,” Allison said. “And so, the call came late—and we love that studio; we did their previous game as a short exclusive—but because that [trust and safety] team, that’s their job and that is, if you do the letter of the law on our policies, it is what it is.”</span></p>

 <p><span>For context, Epic Games’ content ratings </span><a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines"><span>guidelines</span></a><span> state that games “with Adults Only (AO) ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store.” They do make an exception for games that only carry AO ratings “because they use blockchain, NFT, or cryptocurrency technology.” </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is also not available through Steam for similar reasoning, but can be purchased on GoG and itch.io.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/app.bsky.feed.post/3mebdquhjts2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreieobrr7wsfjrlwzargszax3mipgo43vus3xdgurceeb4qayvzrpxq"> <p lang="en">Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn?ref_src=embed">Santa Ragione (@santaragione.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/post/3mebdquhjts2k?ref_src=embed">2026-02-07T11:44:28.467Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>On February 7, Santa Ragione rejected Allison’s claim in a post </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdquhjts2k"><span>on Bluesky</span></a><span>. “Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us,” stated Santa Ragione.</span></p>

 <p><span>Today, Epic Games followed up on Santa Ragione’s post in a statement to several publications, including </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span>. “Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” communications manager Brian Sharon said.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place.”</span></p> <h2>A cloud of confusion still hangs over <em>Horses</em>‘ last-minute rejection</h2> <p><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>reached out to Santa Ragione for clarification regarding the “incorrect statements” they alluded to in their initial Bluesky post. “On Dec 1, 24 hours before release, Epic sent us what looked like an automated notice saying that they were unable to distribute </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span> on the Epic Games Store because their review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” replied Pietro Righi Riva. “They went on to specify that their policies prohibit content which ‘contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated,’ and content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Riva further explained that they responded to Epic Games’ first notice to appeal within “28 minutes,” on the basis that “all nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation” and that “the content presented does not in any way promote abuse and animal abuse.” After Epic Games’ second review of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, Riva told us that “No additional information or context was ever provided. We emailed them twice since to plead for a resubmission and find a solution but never received a reply.”</span></p> <p><span>“I do not think that those two vague and semi-automated statements would qualify as ‘contacting us twice.’ Their initial message suggested there was a path to ‘make updates to our product to ensure compliance’ but never explained what that would entail or what specifically needed change in the first place,” Riva concluded.</span></p> <p><span><em>Horses</em> has received </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><span>a range of reviews</span></a><span> since it launched, but one thing many critics seems to agree on is that there is nothing in the game nearly as scandalous as Epic and Valve banning it would imply. Adding to the confusion and skepticism is that PC gaming storefronts have been under extra pressure recently from payment processers at the behest of pro-censorship activists to crackdown on NSFW content. For all the controversy, Epic and other storefronts still haven’t made it clear precisely what they found so objectionable about the content in</span><i><span> Horses</span></i><span>.&nbsp; </span></p>

<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161884/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In a cruel twist of irony, those of us who remember the breakneck mayhem of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/carmageddon">Carmageddon</a> are creeping ever closer to our senior citizen bus pass. This will allow us to ride a slow-moving passenger vehicle that gains no extra points for mulching pedestrians.</p>
<p>Released in 1997, this classic of vehicular combat arrived with some critical praise and instant controversy. Deliberately baiting outrage with its points-for-murder gameplay, it was banned in some countries and heavily censored in others. A huge hit regardless of backlash, it spawned many sequels, ports, and imitators over the years.</p>
<p>Developers 34BigThings (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/redout">Redout</a>) are bringing the franchise back from the dead for a new generation, adding a roguelite spin in the process. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/carmageddon-rogue-shift">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a> is just as fun and addictive as the original was back in the day, though it’s a little too lightweight to be truly great.</p>
<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161888/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In keeping with the setting, theme, and tone of the series, this new Carmageddon populates its tracks with zombies and mutants for competitors to mow down in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p>
<p>Alongside the Roger Corman-produced <strong>Death Race 2000</strong>, the series has always drawn inspiration from the <strong>Mad Max</strong> franchise (it started life as a licensed adaptation, but publisher SCI couldn’t get the rights). Rogue Shift manages to capture the blood, chrome, and chaos of those films far better than it ever could in the '90s. Everything has a wasteland punk aesthetic, presenting a world where the need to blow each other up on a high-speed circuit is a believable way to let off steam.</p>
<p>A racing game in the thinnest sense, Carmageddon’s focus is firmly on high-speed destruction derby action. You shoot other cars to scrap while careening around makeshift courses, racking up credits by mowing down the irradiated denizens of this savage wasteland.</p>
<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161891/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tracks are bonkers obstacle gauntlets, littered with swinging wrecking balls and flailing tentacles. Hordes of shambling undead and giant mutants that explode into clouds of acid conspire to sabotage your pole position.</p>
<p>The handling model can be best described as 'slip ‘n slide'. Every vehicle has a weight to it and you’ll mostly be swinging it around corners, hoping you don't clip some scenery and spin out. It can be frustrating to force a respawn after hitting a wall at max acceleration, but a perfect lap feels exhilarating once you nail it.</p>
<p>Rather than the <strong>Mario Kart</strong> approach of picking up weapons mid-race, your loadout is fixed. Each car comes equipped with a starting weapon, ranging from machine guns to lasers and everything in between. Your vehicle itself is a sub-weapon, with an effective slam ability that lets you violently shunt opponents into barriers. Seeing rivals explode in slow motion as point multipliers flash up on screen never gets old.</p>

<p>As entertaining as this metal-on-metal carnage is, it is a loop that lacks lasting appeal. That is where the roguelite elements come in. You start a new game and work through a series of randomly generated events, each with their own primary and bonus goals.</p>
<p>Events range from straightforward races, survival, and combat-focused challenges. There are also boss fights against cars packing uniquely destructive offence. The aim is to get as far as possible without being damaged beyond repair. Death sends you back to the start, but not empty-handed. You earn a currency — amusingly called beatcoin — to spend on new cars, weapons and store stock for the next run.</p>
<p>Each cycle offers the chance to try a new rig with a fresh set of stats and weaponry. Upgrades and repairs are available during a run, but difficulty ramps up at a steady pace. Early deaths are almost guaranteed in the first few attempts.</p>
<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161886/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The unlock system does a good job of encouraging replay. It’s hard to walk away after a defeat when a massive truck with a shotgun bolted to it is waiting to be pulled out of the garage.</p>
<p>Yet even with the steady supply of new equipment, upgrades and vehicles, Rogue Shift struggles to hold attention over the long haul. Track fatigue sets in before long, and no amount of random generation can fully offset that.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that the game is solo only. This style of combat racer feels tailor-made for local and online multiplayer. Quick time to kill, rapid respawns, and short tracks are designed for spectacle rather than precision. Not being able to ram a friend into an oncoming pack of exploding mutants feels like a glaring omission.</p>
<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161895/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That absence stings because Rogue Shift has a sense of fluid speed that arguably has not been seen since Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, which arrived with a full multiplayer suite.</p>
<p>It’s also a well-optimised version. Frame rates remain stable even during visually chaotic moments, when the screen fills with flying cars and mutant hordes. Undocked play has a surprisingly sharp fidelity, with splashes of colour and blurred neon lighting recalling the impressive Night City driving of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. The only technical hiccup of note was some occasional input lag when docked, which was infrequent and brief.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>An explosive return from this 30-year-old franchise, Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is close to being the full package. It's one of those rare reboots that can satisfy older fans while also appealing to newer players drawn to the roguelite loop. It's fast, entertaining, and backed by a teeth-rattling heavy metal soundtrack.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, then, that there isn’t more of it. With no multiplayer and no additional content announced, Rogue Shift starts strong and shows real promise, but it ultimately runs out of gas.</p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pendragon-core-rulebook-review-glory-awaits</link>
            <guid>1430389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Originally published in 1985, the <em>Pendragon </em>tabletop roleplaying game saw its glorious return to Chaosium with its sixth edition in 2024. Both grounded and fantastical, <em>Pendragon</em> offers players the chance to live out their dreams of courtly knighthood. As I prepare to review a new adventure module releasing for the game, I thought it prudent to take an in-depth look at the Core Rulebook, which Chaosium provided us for review.</p><h2><strong>What Is </strong><em><strong>Pendragon</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p><em>Pendragon</em> is a tabletop roleplaying game created by Greg Stafford and published by Chaosium, where one player takes on the role of Gamemaster while others pick up the mantle of Player-knights.</p><p>The world of <em>Pendragon</em> revolves around King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and while your Player-knights won’t start at such lofty levels, their chivalry and glory are the north-star for which you’ll be aiming.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-squire.jpeg?itok=bxw-0nIy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1420" height="950">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pendragon-squire.jpeg?itok=1I5RyeNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="803">
                  

  </picture><p>This is not a game about blasting magical spells and healing your party with a wave of holy magic as you face down hordes of evil goblins. Nor is it about amassing untold wealth by cracking open treasure chests.</p><p>Instead, <em>Pendragon</em> is a game about acting as a true knight, hoping to attain both honor and glory as you embark on quests, woo your true love, and pursue your passions. For players used to the ramshackle, reality-breaking world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> or <em>Pathfinder</em>, this game may feel a bit “down-to-earth,” but that - in my opinion - is what makes it so special.</p><h2><em><strong>Pendragon</strong></em><strong> Traits, Passions, and Skills Define Your Player-knight</strong></h2><p>In <em>Pendragon</em>, there are five main statistics to each character: Size, Dexterity, Strength, Constitution, and Appeal. But while these statistics are important, they hardly define your Player-knight.</p><p>Where your Player-knight truly begins to take shape is through a set of 13 pairs of opposing Traits, like Chaste/Lustful, Generous/Selfish, Prudent/Reckless, and Valorous/Cowardly. This collection of traits is one of the most unique aspects of <em>Pendragon</em>.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-king-and-performers.jpeg?itok=eYrNn0Bf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1140" height="812">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pendragon-king-and-performers.jpeg?itok=VLV9o4rY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1140" height="812">
                  

  </picture><p>For each trait, you’ll assign points (or roll randomly) to determine your how your character is likely to behave and move about the world. The sum total for each opposing trait pair must equal 20, so if your character has a 14 score in Generous, their Selfish trait is only a 6. This means they’re more likely to act in a generous manner.</p><p>I only go into this much detail when describing how these traits work because I truly believe this is the most interesting element of the game. By rolling dice on these traits, you’re aided in your roleplaying. This helps confirm how you see your character when you roll well, and opens up interesting opportunities for role-play when you roll unexpectedly.</p><p>For instance, let’s imagine your Player-knight is about to square off against an imposing brigand nearly twice your size. Your Valorous/Cowardly score is 6/14, meaning you’re (currently) known for being a bit of a coward. But as you roll on the trait, something strange happens - you fail your cowardly roll and succeed in your Valorous roll! Against all odds, your character takes a brave stand!</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-battle.jpeg?itok=2R-Yavk4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1230" height="786">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pendragon-battle.jpeg?itok=m7xeQh9- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="767">
                  

  </picture><p>What an interesting way to approach roleplaying! Along with Traits, you have Passions - these are the goals, ideals, and interests that drive your character forward. From Homage to your lord to love of your family, pursuing these passions will help drive your character forward.</p><p>And then, like most Tabletop RPG’s, you also have skills. But unlike most RPG’s, these skills - from Awareness to Battle, Compose (as in poetry) to Falconry - cover far more than your traditional adventure-focused game.</p><p>That’s because <em>Pendragon</em> is about so much more than swinging your sword and charging on your horse (though there’s plenty of that). <em>Pendragon</em> is an RPG where a misstep in court, a miss-play in a game of chess, or an uncouth moment in front of your true love could be just as disastrous as any blow from an axe.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-chess-match.jpeg?itok=hIn8Q_Ni 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1452" height="838">

  </picture><h2><strong>What is </strong><em><strong>Pendragon</strong></em><strong>’s Core Mechanic?</strong></h2><p><em>Pendragon</em> uses a d20 system for determining successes and failures when attempting actions, and uses a d6 when determining damage. This is an interesting system, where players attempt to roll <em>under</em> their attribute, trait, or skill to succeed.</p><p>For instance, if I have a Player-knight with a Flirting skill (yes that’s a real skill) of 12 and I’m hoping to flatter my true love, I’ll roll a d20 and hope for a 12 or less. A critical success is a success that perfectly matches your attribute (a 12 in this case).</p><p>If I’m opposing someone in a roll, I not only need to roll <em>under</em> my skill, but then if I succeed I also need to have rolled <em>above</em> what they rolled (if they also succeeded).</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-young-knights.jpeg?itok=vzs1tLgN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1076" height="818">

  </picture><p>This creates a very interesting tension, where I’m hoping to run my dice as close to failure as possible (while still succeeding). It’s a system I’ve never seen used anywhere else!</p><h2><strong>What else does the </strong><em><strong>Pendragon </strong></em><strong>Core Rulebook cover?</strong></h2><p>What <em>doesn’t</em> it cover!? The <em>Pendragon</em> Core Rulebook is over 230 pages long, and includes character creation rules, rules for combat, equipment, a whole (fairly long!) chapter on horses, pursuing noble aspirations, advancing your knight, and so much more.</p><p>I’m the kind of player who loves to get lost in the details, and so, for me, I find these extensive notes, tables, and charts extremely satisfying. If you’re the kind of player who doesn’t feel the need to get bogged down in all the small details, there’s also a Starter Set that well get your gaming group into the action with daring speed.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-king-and-queen.jpeg?itok=6xrVqHgJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="952" height="586">

  </picture><h2><em><strong>Pendragon</strong></em> <strong>Core Rulebook - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><em>Pendragon</em> is, for lack of a better term, “a lot of game.” By that I mean that there is so much here to dive into, both on the part of the Player-knights and the Gamemaster. This isn’t the kind of game you can pop into with a silly group in-between <em>D&amp;D</em> campaign sessions.</p><p>This is the sort of Tabletop RPG that players need to come to knowing what they’re getting into. You won’t be flinging fireballs or whipping chains of lightning around the room, but you just might impress the nobles of your house with your poetry. In fact, that sentence should serve as a litmus test - if your play group responds to that statement with anything other than “By Merlin’s beard! We need to play right now,” then <em>Pendragon </em>may not be right for your playgroup.</p><p>But, on the other hand, for the group who values a serious approach to Tabletop RPG’s, <em>Pendragon</em> offers a unique place in the gaming world. Here’s a game that’s more grounded in reality, but <em>doesn’t</em> treat your characters like worthless dogs barking in the bowels of a dungeon. Too often, when you trade high-fantasy for reality, you end up with a game like <em>Torchbearer</em> (which I love), where your a low-down dirty adventurer, or like <em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em> (which I love), where you’ll be lucky to survive your first encounter with a rat.</p><p>Instead, <em>Pendragon</em> presents a gaming world where the highest challenge is upholding the goals your Player-knight sets for themselves, seeking out ways to grow your honor, act nobly, and pursue glory. It asks players to imagine a world where they are, unambiguously, at least <em>trying</em> to do the right thing more often than not, and the murkiness of the world around them bends and snaps in reaction.</p><p>If everything I’ve written here sounds, to your play group, like it might lead to a legendary campaign, then I heartily recommend <em>Pendragon</em>!</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Pendragon <em>used in the creation of this review was provided by Chaosium.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-leave-ceo-build-a-rocket-boy-mindseye/</link>
            <guid>1430383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Leslie Benzies, co-founder and co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, the developer behind MindsEye, is reportedly on ‘temporary leave’ from the firm. This was confirmed by the <strong>other </strong>CEO, Mark Gerhard, who recently revealed an alleged €1 million plot to sabotage BARB and MindsEye.</p>



<p>Per an email from Gerhard to the wider company, Benzies is taking a ‘well-earned temporary leave to recharge after more than a year of working around the clock.’ But following that, Gerhard stressed he’d be guiding the company forward and signed off his email as ‘CEO’ and not ‘co-CEO’.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-did-leslie-go">Where Did Leslie Go?</h2>



<p>It has been a tough few weeks for the team at Build a Rocket Boy. After the disastrous launch of MindsEye, the studio’s inaugural game, and several bouts of layoffs, the team was hit again by yet another scandal earlier this month. Leslie Benzies, formerly of Rockstar North fame, found himself accused of sexual assault in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/">recently uncovered ‘Epstein file.’</a></p>



<p>He categorically <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ex-rockstar-north-president-denies-epstein-files-allegations/">denied the assault</a> but confirmed he was in a consensual relationship with his accuser.</p>



<p>In a new report published by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-build-a-rocket-boy-save-itself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry</a>, it was revealed that an email posted by Mark Gerhard after an all-hands call confirmed Leslie Benzies’ temporary departure from the company.</p>



<p>Gerhard worded the email quite strangely, making it sound like the absence might be a little longer than you might assume:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>He has our deepest gratitude, and with the leadership team and your support, I will guide us forward.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report expanded with comments from former and current employees at BARB, one of whom explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think BARB survives this crisis. I believe the end is coming for BARB, and it’s not heralded by saboteurs, but by Mark and Leslie themselves.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That was in response to Gerhard’s claim of having evidence that Build a Rocket Boy and MindsEye were subject to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/">a ruthless and targeted campaign</a> to bring the brand down. Insider Gaming recently published a report detailing this exact claim.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest patch update for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> features new Meshes, audio updates, weapon updates, and so much more.</p>



<p>On February 9, Apex Legends announced the launch of their latest season: Breach. With the new season comes a range of updates, including the all-new Hardlight Mesh. These meshes serve as destructible, breachable windows. They are translucent, block projectiles, and affect player movement.</p>



<p>They allow players to create new entry points and attack angles, and they rebuild after a significant delay following damage. Controller Legends can also reinforce them to become more sturdy and allow them to bunker down, delaying enemy assaults.</p>







<p>In the latest patch, there are also updates to different Legend types. The Fuse type has received major updates, particularly to its ultimate, which now drops a mortar that detonates on impact, then sprays smaller bombs around its landing point. Additionally, they’re no longer slowed by explosive damage, have faster weapon stow time, and more.</p>



<p>The Apex team described the Catalyst type as “needing help for a while.” They can now reinforce up to four doors, have a maximum of three traps, and work in a larger area.</p>







<h2>Audio Updates Included Also</h2>



<p>Additionally, the Apex team announced audio updates for season 28. There are now more audio customization options, providing finer-tuned control over: Legend Dialogue, Ping Dialogue, and Announcer Dialogue.</p>



<p>Players can check out the full patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/breach-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios Brings the Cold Snap Back to ARC Raiders and Launches a PvE-Focused Event Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-shared-watch-pve-event-embark-studios/</link>
            <guid>1430359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, <strong>Embark Studios</strong> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-players-can-prepare-for-the-second-expedition-with-a-new-catch-up-mechanic-and-lowered-stash-value-requirements/">a few changes coming to Expeditions</a> in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> to help players be better prepared to send off their Raiders into the unknown. Now, as we near the end of the first Expedition, the team has confirmed the next event that'll start tomorrow and bring players to the end of the month.</p>



<p>Firstly, Embark is bringing back the <strong>Cold Snap</strong> map condition as part of the regular rotation of map conditions players can experience starting tomorrow, <strong>February 10, 2026</strong>. It was a fun map condition for the winter season, and added an interesting layer of survival gameplay to your runs Topside, because you had to make sure you didn't get caught out in the cold for too long. It's good to see it make a return, and hopefully, Embark makes a habit of keeping beloved map conditions around, even if they're introduced as part of a seasonal event. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clear skies and sunny temperatures are predicted for Topside this weekend, but don't pack your winter gear away yet folks; the weather towers are predicting sporadic snowfall in the foreseeable future!<br>The Cold Snap returns to our regular rotation of conditions from February 10… <a href="https://t.co/J4OACyBc9y">pic.twitter.com/J4OACyBc9y</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020180761849331776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Second, and perhaps most exciting for ARC Raiders players cut from a certain cloth, is that the studio will kick off a new, <strong>PvE-focused</strong> event called <strong>Shared Watch</strong> tomorrow, February 10, that'll run until <strong>February 24, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>More information about the event is set to arrive in tomorrow's patch notes, but the basics of it are that players will progress through the event's rewards by earning <strong>Merits</strong>, which will unlock items, Raider tokens, and a new baseball-themed <strong>Slugger</strong> cosmetic set.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You watch my back, I'll watch yours - that’s how Speranza keeps ticking 🫶<br>Join your fellow Raiders in celebrating the Shared Watch; team up with strangers, turn your barrels on the machines, and earn rewards in the process.</p><p>The Shared Watch Event begins tomorrow! <a href="https://t.co/ssYtkLxZ4r">pic.twitter.com/ssYtkLxZ4r</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020905547927552273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>ARC Raiders might technically be a PvPvE game, but depending on who you ask, some players would describe it as an entirely PvE game. Scores of players within the community are seemingly uninterested in participating in the PvP components and would rather work together with their fellow Raiders to take down ARCs and gather loot.</p>



<p>It's unclear if this event will include a PvE-only mode, but it's definitely PvE-focused, as it encourages players to work together to take down ARCs, which is one of the best thrills that ARC Raiders offers outside of the tension of safely extracting to Speranza by the skin of your teeth.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> first Lego sets</span></a><span> are launching later this month for the series’ 30th anniversary, but some reviewers and creators have gotten early access to the sets and are building them for coverage. These models are made up of hundreds or thousands of pieces, and sometimes, Lego sneaks an easter egg or two into the build. This is the case with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914"><span>Eevee</span></a><span> model, which has a hidden reference to the Pokémon’s various evolutions.</span></p> <p><span>Eevee’s whole schtick is that it’s able to evolve into one of several evolutions depending on certain conditions, including the time of day, the use of a certain evolution stone, or whether or not it knows a Fairy-type move. Each form is pretty distinct, with each carrying a different color scheme, elemental theme, and shape. While Eevee’s eight evolutions aren’t getting their own Lego sets (yet), the Eevee model’s innards are a nod to each of them.</span></p>

   <p><span>As TikToker and Lego creator Bricks By Mind demonstrates, the inside of the Eevee model includes colored bricks that correspond to each of its evolutions. Parts of it are made up of yellow, orange, and blue bricks that resemble the colors of the electric Jolteon, flaming Flareon, and water-wielding Vaporeon, respectively. Meanwhile, the inside of the head has a brick for each of the other evolutions stacked next to one another behind its eyes. This includes the aforementioned three, but also blocks for the Ice-type Glaceon, Grass-type Leafeon, Psychic-type Espeon, Dark-type Umbreon, and Fairy-type Sylveon. It’s a neat touch.</span></p> <p><span>Thankfully, the Eevee model is the cheapest of the </span><i><span>Pokemon </span></i><span>Lego sets, and will only run you $59.99 compared to the $200 Pikachu one, or the staggering $649.99 you’ll have to pay for the Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise one, when they all launch on February 27.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> is encouraging players to team up with strangers in the next <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> event, which launches tomorrow, February 10.</p>



<p>The Shared Watch event was announced in a social media trailer and will run through February 24. </p>



<p>While not specified, the caption states that players will clean up with strangers to turn their barrels on the machines, hinting at a PvE event. Still, people in the comments were asking for clarification as to whether this would be a PvP event.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-follows-this-event-in-the-arc-raiders-roadmap">What Follows This Event in the ARC Raiders Roadmap</h2>



<p>Following the conclusion of the shared watch event on February 24, players can sign up for the second in-game Expedition on February 25. The event will begin on March 1. This time around, ARC is introducing a Skill Point catch-up system, which will allow players to reclaim some coins they missed during the first Expedition. </p>



<p>Each missing Skill Point from the first Expedition now only requires 300k stash value, and any Coins collected will first count toward the second Expedition before being applied to previously missed Skill Points.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor</link>
            <guid>1430350</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Zero Parades is an exploration of failure,” explains Jim Ashilevi, writer and VO director at ZA/UM. “What it means to lose everything and then keep going regardless. And then, since it's such a painful question, it inevitably becomes an exploration of what it means to be human. How uncomfortable and strange it is to exist in a body that has thoughts and feelings and responsibilities, and a past that they can't go back and fix.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is why I love working here,” says ZA/UM’s head of studio, Allen Murray, with a smile. “I never had these conversations making Halo games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> was, of course, never going to follow up its 2019 “disaster cop” RPG with a game about heroes saving the world. That’s not to say that it hasn’t moved into <em>slightly</em> more traditional video game territory, though. Its new game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/zero-parades-for-dead-spies">Zero Parades: For Dead Spies</a>, is an espionage spy thriller set in a dark, almost psychedelic reflection of the Cold War’s closing years. Global powers conspire, enemy agents lurk in the dark, and the entire world sits on the doorstep of the end of history. But while that could theoretically be the elevator pitch for any number of mainstream, combat-forward RPGs, ZA/UM is doing spycraft the only way it knows: Disco style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the one North Star that we have is that we have to be genuinely interested in the stories that we are choosing to tell,” says Ashilevi. “If we were to start mimicking someone else, or go bigger and more expensive and add production value and fighting mechanics and multiplayer, I think we would just destroy ourselves in the process.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This “North Star” means that, on the surface, Zero Parades looks almost identical to Disco Elysium. It’s another dialogue-centric, introspective, isometric RPG with striking art direction. But that’s not to say it’s the exact same game dressed up in a John le Carré skin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think you can see the team has really wanted to exceed their production chops with Zero Parades,” explains Murray, “in terms of having the world seem more reactive, more lived in. There's more action, more people walking around doing things.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ZA/UM had no intention of creating a “traditional” video game RPG, it did want to dig deeper into the genre’s more crunchy elements. This time around there are more skill checks, alongside a mental and physical health system that can be exerted to increase the chances of passing those checks. There’s further emphasis on multiple solutions to individual problems, the very foundation of BioWare’s celebrated Infinity Engine games. By pushing the depth of choice available and enhancing the world’s reactivity to those choices, the team saw the opportunity to create something that stood distinct from Disco Elysium.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sophomore efforts are really challenging,” Murray admits. “You don't want to repeat your first hit, nor can you really.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took a lot of time for the team to come to terms with that. During the years following Disco Elysium’s release and subsequent “Final Cut” version, ZA/UM experimented with a number of concepts – some were effectively direct sequels, while others explored “a completely different direction,” according to Ashilevi. The path to Zero Parades arrived with the decision to “not fully reinvent the wheel.” The goal, Murray says, was to “expand on what we know how to do, and make a bigger game, both mechanically and in terms of production scope, and do it well.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mission Control</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Murray acknowledges that there were “years of drama” before the studio got to that point. For many fans of Disco Elysium, that will mean only one thing: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds"><u>the firing of several key creatives in 2022</u></a> and their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-directors-accuse-zaum-shareholders-of-fraud-as-the-company-says-they-were-fired-for-misconduct"><u>subsequent accusation</u></a> that ZA/UM’s executive management had seized control of the company through fraud. It’s a complicated chapter in the studio’s story, in which those exorcised from the company – including game director Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov – are characterised as either toxic disruptors or the victims of corporate conspiracy, depending on your source. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more to ZA/UM’s troubled recent history than those controversial dismissals: this is a studio that has repeatedly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs"><u>cancelled projects</u></a> and, in early 2024, made 20 of its staff redundant. It all paints a picture of an inexperienced studio struggling to adapt to life after releasing an unexpected mega hit on the first attempt, with the workers caught in the crossfire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ZA/UM’s UK-based workforce unionised last year</u></a>. </p><p>The artistry comes first, the storytelling comes first. It still feels like the whole video game development side of things is just like a happy accident.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while collective bargaining is undoubtedly important, those workers also need strong leadership to avoid the woes of the past. Maybe they’ve found that in Murray, a 20-year veteran of the video games industry with previous tenures at Microsoft, Bungie, PopCap, and Private Division. He was appointed as ZA/UM’s new head of studio shortly after news broke about those painful redundancies, and over the past two years his goal has been “coaching the people in the studio, maturing our processes, helping people to really focus on what we're making, how we're making it, and why we're making it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was easy to have a lot of things sort of floating around,” he admits. “But how are we <em>actually </em>going to animate this, or how are we going to light this? What does this story really mean? What are you really trying to get across to the player?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, ZA/UM is made up of around 90 members of staff. Several of them have, like Murray, been recruited from established developers such as Rocksteady in order to arm the studio with specialist video game experience. But the remaining members of the Disco Elysium team, which makes up approximately 35% of the studio’s total roster, plus many of the new recruits, “come from a background that has nothing to do with game dev,” says Ashilevi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a studio, we still view ourselves pretty much as a collective of artists,” he explains. “The artistry comes first, the storytelling comes first. To me personally, it still feels like the whole video game development side of things is just like a happy accident.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Price of Power</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to Zero Parades, which tells the story of Hershel Wilk, codename “Cascade”, who’s pulled out of retirement for the all-time classic spy trope, One Last Job. By moving into the espionage genre, ZA/UM has been able to work at a notably different scale than it did with Disco Elysium. While Zero Parades takes place in a physical space not too dissimilar to that of the studio’s previous game, by stepping into the shoes of a spy rather than a local detective, the story naturally explores a much grander stage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You do have to contend with world powers,” Ashilevi reveals. “It's not just wallpaper, or stuff that you read from notes that people leave in drawers, or newspapers left on tables. You do have to come into close contact with some of the big players as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This global stage is explored through Hershel’s very personal lens, so while the stakes are certainly heightened this time around, your actions are still conducted at street level. You may be able to turn the cogs of a mega corporation and shift the balance of worldwide politics, for instance, but to do so may require betraying your closest friend. Hershel’s own pain will be tangible, whereas those rotating cogs will feel distant, perhaps even unimportant, to her own life. Such is the toll of espionage.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/09/zero-parades-format-fetishist-1770647663407.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hershel will encounter people obsessed with niche corners of pop culture. | Image credit: ZA/UM.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To create something that reflects Disco Elysium’s triumphs, though, you can’t just tackle issues of the human condition. You’ve got to get at least a little eccentric. And that’s where Hershel’s hobbies come into play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“She's deeply fascinated with comic books, music, you name it,” Ashilevi reveals. “So the story is also an exploration of pop culture and what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>soft power</u></a> means. Why is it important for us to be obsessed with pop artists and cartoons, and films and pulp novels, and things like that? Why are people so deeply obsessed with retro tech and bootlegged media, like underground forbidden films? What does it do to your soul, and how does it define your identity?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While music, fashion, TV shows, and retrofuturistic music formats all contribute to the city of Portofiro’s vibrant texture, there is a dark side to it all. What is a consumer as a political entity? How do tiny decisions, like tuning into a particular show or buying a certain magazine, tie into the movements of the big powers? These are potential avenues for Hershel – for you – to investigate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle for soft and hard power, waged between international banks, imperialist states, and communist unions, is something that goes beyond just Hershel’s current mission. “We need to come up with an inspiring enough sandbox so that whatever we choose to do with those characters or this universe next, we can just jump right into it and keep telling stories because the groundwork has been laid,” says Ashilevi. Zero Parades is the starting point for something bigger, then. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least that’s the hope. The world of Elysium was also envisioned as a space for multiple stories, but it seems that book is now eternally closed. And while Zero Parades may not necessarily need to be as significant a breakout hit as Disco Elysium was to unlock the potential for sequels, it does need to stand tall in a world where the “Disco-like” is a rising genre, made up of games developed both by fans inspired by that RPG masterpiece and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick"><u>new studios set up by the scattered former members of ZA/UM’s original creative team</u></a>. But by following their own creative North Star, the team behind Zero Parades hopes to captivate players once more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have no clue what kinds of games or stories people are hoping to get out of ZA/UM,” Ashilevi says. “The only thing we can control is whether we're staying true to our own vision and voice. And that's what we have done with Zero Parades.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has reportedly partnered with Korean gaming giant Nexon for yet another crack at turning StarCraft into a shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While unconfirmed by Blizzard itself, the project is the subject of an article in <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Korea Economic Daily</a>, the country's largest business newspaper. The report states that Nexon has a development team dedicated to the project within its shooter division, with a StarCraft modder installed as its project lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has long held ambitions to launch a shooter spin-off from its sci-fi real-time strategy series, while Nexon has recently found Western success within the shooter space as the owner of Swedish development studio Embark Studio — the outfit behind The Finals and Arc Raiders.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the report is cautious on the project's development — noting that Nexon previously partnered with Square Enix to develop a Final Fantasy spin-off that faltered in the planning stages. A note of caution here is likely wise, too, considering Blizzard's own track record on abandoned StarCraft spin-off projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-ghost">StarCraft Ghost</a>, announced in 2002, was Blizzard's first attempt to expand the series beyond its real-time strategy origins. Planned as a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A second StarCraft shooter attempt, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>. Ares was reportedly "like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe," but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside. Finally, in 2024, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier shared word of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">third StarCraft shooter project then in development within Blizzard</a>, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Nexon's shooter be the same project as the one Hay had been leading, or a new iteration of it? This remains unclear, especially since Hay's project had apparently been in development two years ago, whereas Nexon's game sounds more recent — and developed on a different continent. IGN has contacted Blizzard for more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sports are foundational to gaming as a medium. From Pong to NES Baseball, the infancy of the medium was littered with just-about-recognisable renditions of real-life sports in an attempt to conjure a degree of familiarity to this fledgling form of entertainment. But in the mid ‘90s, the developers at Nintendo collectively had a light bulb appear above their head housing an idea that would change gaming forever – what if Mario and his friends <em>played tennis?</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The greatest Mario sports games are a perfect blend of those two words: Mario and sports. It has to be a simulation worth its salt, giving you a reasonable adaptation of what it’s truly like to play the sport in question. However, just as vital is the Mario part, splicing the sport with the Mushroom Kingdom’s trademark personality. In the decades following 1995’s Mario’s Tennis, Nintendo’s sports games evolved from simple sims to wacky adventures, before retreating back to a steady, if uninspiring, run of titles. The early days of Camelot Software’s handheld RPGs and chaos-inducing console sims are seemingly long gone, and today many of Mario’s sporting outings are greeted with more of a shrug than with anticipation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> releasing this month on Nintendo Switch 2, we could be about to enter a new era. So in celebration of a joyful future (or just a magical past) here’s the top 10 Mario sports games, ranked. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Mario Sports Games</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mario Hoops 3-on-3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-hoops-1770302985415.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">If many modern Mario sports games are poisoned by a lack of personality, games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-hoops-3-on-3-mario-slam-basketball">Mario Hoops</a> are the antidote. 3-on-3’s unique presentation blends 3D models with excellent sprite work, a striking approach that bridges the graphical styles of the GameBoy Advance and Nintendo’s then-new DS handheld. Nothing represents this mix better than the character select screen, the single greatest in all of Mario history, which lays the groundwork for a charming basketball romp. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoops could easily claim to be the best use of the DS’ touch screen. Tapping in different areas sees Mario and his friends dribble around the court, keeping the ball away from opponents and collecting coins and items. It’s an intuitive motion, and that use of the stylus extends to all the basics of basketball, like shooting and passing. Regrettably, Nintendo has rarely returned to the idea of basketball in the Mushroom Kingdom, but even if it did try again, few consoles would execute the idea better than the DS… well, as long as you’re not left-handed, that is. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Mario Tennis (Game Boy Color)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-tennis-gbc-1770303000447.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The early days of handheld Mario sports games produced some of the most unusual oddities in Nintendo’s history, and their lack of Mushroom Kingdom whimsey and focus on regular human characters is often looked back upon with a raised eyebrow. However, actually dive into the Game Boy Color’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-gbc">Mario Tennis</a> and you’ll find that eyebrow is put firmly back in place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Tennis features a wonderful RPG “Tour” mode that nails the genre’s basics. Being locked into three-set matches with a far more powerful opponent is akin to boss battles in a more traditional RPG. They become challenges that you relish, always pushing you to move more quickly after a serve or time your smashes to perfection. Working through the tour sees you levelling up your original character via a very satisfying process, with the grind required to improve specific skills never feeling like a chore. The graphics and controls are inherently limited by the console, but that simplicity lends Mario Tennis a lovely rhythmic quality that encourages repeat replays even a quarter of a century later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Mario Golf: World Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-world-tour-1770303082047.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">For as slow and ponderous as the sport of golf can be, it’s a miracle that it consistently dovetails so beautifully with the chaotic and colorful world of Mario. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-world-tour">World Tour</a> nails the balance between both sides of the Nintendo sports coin, offering a quick and snappy way to execute precise and considered rounds of golf. With no need for complicated button schemes or deep systems, World Tour gives you a great sense of control that allows you to cut through the fiddly stuff and get to work on the eternal quest of improving your swing, just like a real casual golfer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 3DS and Wii U era was a difficult one for Mario sports titles, but World Tour stands out from a lacklustre crowd thanks to its personality-packed game modes like Point Tourney, Star Coin challenges and Speed Golf. Castle Club also adds a story mode centred on your Mii, complete with a fun upgrade system with stat-boosting cosmetics like clothes and clubs, which is reminiscent of Camelot’s handheld glory days. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Mario Superstar Baseball</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-superstar-baseball-1770303206159.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like basketball, Nintendo has barely paid any attention to baseball across the past couple decades, despite knocking it out of the park on the first try back in 2005. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-superstar-baseball">Mario Superstar Baseball</a> is a wonderful marriage of addictive baseball mechanics and Mushroom Kingdom chaos, played out in iconic Mario locations that have been contorted into baseball fields. Only in Wario Palace could a barrage of environmental hazards turn a home run into a devastating out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superstar Baseball boasts one of the Mario sports series’ most engaging story modes  thanks to its “chemistry engine”. The relationships between your teammates dictates the speed and accuracy of their passes, meaning you won’t want to pair Mario with Wario and Bowser, but he’ll combine beautifully with Luigi and Peach. It’s a simple and effective way to bring depth to an already smooth experience that belongs in the Nintendo big leagues.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Super Mario Strikers</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-super-mario-strikers-1770303339338.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s amazing what a little pop of 2D animation and a few guitar riffs can do to make a subset of Mario sports games feel completely unique. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-strikers">Super Mario Strikers</a>, the jumping plumber’s first foray into the world of soccer, has always had a rebellious edge. Anyone who was glued to their GameCube in the mid-2000s will  look back on it with a special kind of fondness, especially in the light of its disappointing revival on Switch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nostalgia for Strikers isn’t just due to its bold presentation, though: its gameplay is perfectly calibrated. Each character controls just loosely enough to invite exactly the right amount of chaos into each and every match. If the dial was turned too far towards clean passing and shooting, Mario Strikers would be nowhere near as fun. Instead, developer Next Level Games created something aggressively competitive, wholly chaotic, and vibrantly unique – everything a Mario sports game should be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mario Golf: Advance Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-advance-tour-1770303536951.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Golf: Advance Tour is one of the Game Boy Advance’s true gems, launched during a time when developer Camelot was proving itself as a Nintendo sports powerhouse. Compared to its predecessors it is genuinely beautiful; the GBA was an absolute haven for bright and colorful adventures and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-advance-tour">Advance Tour</a> benefits greatly from the system’s then-advanced capabilities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those vibrant visuals are just the face of a game that takes the proven and perfected RPG structure from Camelot’s previous sports games and introduces even more Mario characters and locations to the mix. On the gameplay front, despite only having two face buttons available, Camelot designed a great-feeling, tight control scheme that ensured each shot you took felt measured and clean. That sharpness became a design philosophy that continues to stick around throughout every installment in the Mario Golf series. Advance Tour remains special to this day, though, thanks to its unique pixel art rendering of otherworldly courses, and the GBA’s form factor making it the perfect game to pack for on-the-go strolls through the Mushroom Kingdom’s premier golf courses. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mario Tennis (Nintendo 64)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-tennis-n64-1770303675344.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The moment you play your first shot in the Nintendo 64 version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis">Mario Tennis</a>, something just <em>clicks</em>. The responsive gameplay, smooth animations, and freeing analog control creates an indescribable sense of elegance. Long rallies become like trances in which you find yourself less determined to win the point and instead simply addicted to the sensation of knocking the ball back and forth. Well, until you completely mistime a shot, Toad falls flat on his face, and you’re suddenly a couple sets down, that is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in the year 2000, Mario Tennis is another example of deep gameplay that requires just two face buttons and directional controls, representing Nintendo at its most simple and effective. Subsequent tennis games went on to add ideas, gimmicks and modes that undeniably helped them surpass the offerings of this N64 title. But the bones of modern Mario Tennis are all here, a timeless gameplay loop perfected 26 years ago that endures throughout Nintendo’s history.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-toadstool-tour-1770304306552.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of what we expect from modern Mario sports games originated back on the GameCube, and the brilliant Mario Golf formula established by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-toadstool-tour">Toadstool Tour</a> is one that Nintendo has defaulted to over the last couple decades. Its use of normal and power shots, manual or automatic swinging, and approach to camera control are all now staples of 3D Mario Golf titles for good reason: the simplicity just <em>works</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That simplicity gives Toadstool Tour plenty of space to carry out an overwhelming charm offensive. There are so many different ways to play, especially in multiplayer, from the conventional Doubles and Tournament modes to the more eccentric Coin and Ring attacks, giving Toadstool Tour a shot at being the best party game on this list. It’s also the Mario Golf game that does the sport itself the most justice while still feeling quintessentially Mario. It’s simply a great bit of goofy, golfy goodness. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mario Power Tennis</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-power-tennis-1770304379782.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything that made Mario Tennis on the N64 so brilliant is preserved and built upon with the GameCube’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-power-tennis">Mario Power Tennis</a>. The console’s extra horsepower is used to add wild flourishes to the courts and characters, allowing the established, excellent 3D tennis formula to thrive alongside a deep collection of crazy Mario-isms. Smartly, developer Camelot decided against making full use of the GameCube’s iconic multi-button controller, understanding the enduring appeal of a simple control scheme, while still finding a way to add deeper mechanics, such as offensive and defensive skill shots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with fun challenge courts that test specific tennis skills and Item Battles which create chaos over the net, Mario Power Tennis boasts feats of creative genius like Artist on the Court, a mode in which you use your tennis skills to paint a mural.These may not be flagship modes, but they add the kind of personality and flavour that you can’t get from anyone else but Nintendo in today’s gaming landscape.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Super Mario Strikers Charged</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-super-mario-strikers-charged-1770304475821.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like how Power Tennis and Toadstool Tour benefited from the excellent foundations of their predecessors, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-strikers-charged">Super Mario Strikers Charged</a> takes every beloved detail from the original Strikers and advances them several steps further. Its refined design places increased emphasis on tactics; each character now has stats and special abilities, which makes playstyles and team composition as vital to victory as actually kicking the ball. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Strikers Charged the very best game in this list, though, is how that tactical play is enhanced through Super Abilities and Mega Strikes, AKA the greatest gimmicks ever introduced to a Mario sports game. Abilities like Yoshi turning into a giant egg and flattening people across the pitch, or Bowser setting players on fire, or Petey Piranha spraying mud in every direction provides a variety of incredibly silly, yet highly tactical opportunities. The Mega Strikes, meanwhile, increase the level of hype around the proceedings, triggering a cut scene and allowing you to score up to six goals in one go. This is a great arcade soccer game, but Super Mario Strikers Charged is also completely out of its mind, and it’s that wonderful blend that makes a Mario sports game truly great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those are our picks for the very best Mario sports games. Did we get a hole in one, or have we suffered a triple bagel?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Creative Director/EP Nick Herman and AdHoc CEO Michael Choung also discuss the "miracle" behind making a video game. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a million things that have to go right for a video game to be a success. Well, maybe not a million. But a lot. Michael Choung, the CEO of AdHoc Studio – which released the popular superhero workplace comedy game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review"><u>Dispatch</u></a> last year – admits as much. Choung says that there were “probably 20 decisions in the last seven years” that aligned to make the game a huge success. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-game-performances-of-2025"><u>casting Aaron Paul</u></a> as Dispatch’s protagonist, Robert Robertson/Mecha Man, was one of those decisions. </p>I spoke exclusively with Choung and Dispatch Creative Director/Executive Producer Nick Herman ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-ghost-of-yotei-rule-the-annual-dice-award-nominations"><u>DICE Awards</u></a> (Dispatch is nominated for six, including Game of the Year) on February 12 to break down everything that had to go right in order for Dispatch to see the light of day. Herman says that, although they had “pretty decent” temporary tracks out of the  stand-in actors they hired before the main cast got into the studio, Paul’s performance pushed the entire development of the game in a new direction. <p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we cast Aaron Paul and brought him into the booth, he brought a lot more gravitas,” Herman says. “He brought a heaviness to the character that started to allow us to take him more seriously. You can actually feel that he's got this burden on his shoulders and this weight from his past, and the game got a little bit more serious. When we were working with him we realized that was a good thing. We wanted that depth to show up in the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Paul, perhaps best known for his Emmy-winning turn as Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad, is nominated for a DICE Award for Outstanding Achievement in Character, a nomination he shares with Herman and Dispatch’s other Narrative and Creative Directors. Laura Bailey, Paul’s co-star in the game who plays Courtney/Invisigal,  is nominated for the same award. Herman says that assembling an all-star cast – which also includes Jeffrey Wright, Matthew Mercer, and Ashley Johnson – was both a creative and strategic decision. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We knew that we wanted to have some big talent that when people see the name, they’d go, ‘Oh I know who that is. I know that actor and I like them,’” Herman says. “Aaron just read the script and he liked it. So we were very fortunate. We needed that tier, especially when you're going into rooms with a lot of suits who have a lot of money and make decisions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there's a desire for people to want there to be this puppet mastery strategy around this stuff,” Choung adds. “But we just like these voices. You want it to be creatively compelling. (But) then you have these other additional bonuses: (the actors) having a huge audience, they (come from) different worlds. A lot of them were friends. They were people that we'd worked with before. So it’s years and years of experience just coming to bear.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/27/dispatchthumb-1761592135786.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Invisigal (voiced by Laura Bailey) in Dispatch</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that Dispatch has become both a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review"><u>critical</u></a> and commercial success, both Herman and Choung are reflecting on the intense reaction to the game. I asked them each if they could point to a single thing they were most proud of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can dislike it, but the tone is unique and the result of countless numbers of decisions,” Choung says. “It’s a very strange alchemy that results in a tone like this. I'm proud that we stuck to our guns and we were okay with something a little off the beaten path.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had a lot of bold ideas that people told us were maybe a little too risky,” Herman adds. “People were saying there's no money in narrative experiences. This stuff is dead. Removing freewalk, not having exploration, focusing on having one core main mechanic. All of these things are things we wanted to try for for a very long time. And we've treated Dispatch like this is our one shot, like this might be the last time we ever get an opportunity to make something on our own together. I think all of those things combined is the reason Dispatch is successful. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dispatch Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The fact that it worked and that people were responding to it is awesome. I hope other people learn from this. Just go fucking nuts if you can. I'm proud that we went as hard as we did and we took as big of a swing as we could. Whether it's an indie game with one developer or it's a larger studio, it's hard and it's a miracle when a game gets made every time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to catch IGN’s exclusive broadcast of the 29th Annual DICE Awards on Thursday, February 12 at 8pm PT. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.

		<p>Sony has announced that it will be streaming a State of Play this Thursday, February 12th, and the stream will last around an hour. There is no specific game being showcased this State of Play, with it instead being a more general one with updates from a number of game developers. That could mean we will see quite a few new announcements, as well as updates on games that Sony has previously announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | February 12, 2026 [English]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P0e5YEXtZu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The timings for the State of Play are 2PM PT, 5PM ET, 10PM GMT, 11PM CET, and Feb 13th 7AM JST. There have been rumours that Sony would be hosting a State of Play, so this confirmation was not completely unexpected. In terms of what games will be shown, well we can only speculate. Maybe we’ll see some more of Marvel’s Wolverine, or Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet though I would expect that to get its own State of Play closer to when it is ready for release. We will have to wait until Thursday for the updates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-mass-effect-like-action-adventure-rpg-gets-new-trailer-early-2027-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we're roughly one year away from the planned launch of <strong>EXODUS</strong></a>, the Mass Effect-inspired sci-fi action RPG in development at <strong>Archetype Entertainment</strong>, the developers are starting to share more about the game. <span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/more-than-mass-effects-spiritual-successor-exodus-wants-to-pull-decades-of-player-choice-into-a-single-story-and-the-devs-think-theyve-cracked-it/" target="_blank">Speaking with Gamesradar</a>, Narrative Director Drew Karpyshyn (who wrote the first three Mass Effect games while at BioWare) stressed that side content in EXODUS will always feel tied to the companions and the game's overarching themes, rather than being tacked on as in some roleplaying games.</span></p>



<p><em>We don't want things to feel tacked-on. We definitely don't want you to feel like you're doing it because you're obligated, or you just need the experience points. We want side quests to be something you would do even if you weren't getting a reward. You're going to get rewards of course, but we want you to feel like 'this is something I'm interested in, this is something I want to explore'. Side content should always feel "tied to the themes of our game, tied to the companions you have, tied into the interesting aspects of our game that maybe don't get explored as much on the critical path.</em></p>



<p>In the Gamesradar interview, Karpyshyn also noted that EXODUS <strong>focuses on only a small portion of the overall lore</strong> the team has had to build for the science fiction franchise (which already has a published book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exodus-Archimedes-Peter-F-Hamilton-ebook/dp/B0CSYWZNRS?ref_=nav_ya_signin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Archimedes Engine</a>, an upcoming book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FTTDG2CC?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_1&amp;storeType=ebooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Helium Sea</a>, and a Traveler's Handbook tabletop RPG).</p>



<p><em>You take a couple of core themes that you want to explore, and then you have to gauge reaction of the rest of the team and people as they experience the IP. We can't add everything into one game. The game would be thousands of hours, which sounds great in theory, but isn't realistic.</em></p>



<p>This bodes well for potential future installments, although Archetype Entertainment will have to ensure the first entry lands well before Wizards of the Coast provides the green light to make new titles. </p>

			<p>Last month, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> announced that it would <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">host four showcase events for its biggest ongoing franchises</a>, to update players on what's next for each series. We've already seen the showcases for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">World of Warcraft</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-dropping-the-2-overwatch-2-is-now-just-called-overwatch-moving-forward/"><strong>Overwatch</strong>,</a> with today's <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kohfwPjrSkg">Hearthstone</a></strong> presentation coming next, followed by a <strong>Diablo</strong> showcase later this week. But you might have noticed that one major franchise is missing from that list: <strong>StarCraft</strong>.</p>



<p>In fairness, it's not surprising that StarCraft was left out of getting a showcase to start the year, only because it's been years since we've seen a new entry in the StarCraft series. When we heard that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/"><strong>Nexon</strong> would be taking charge of making the next game in the series in April 2025</a>, the direction in which Nexon would take the franchise was unclear, with the assumption being that the studio would be making another <strong>real-time strategy (RTS) </strong>game. Not just because StarCraft has traditionally been an RTS series, but also because of how popular the genre is in Nexon's home base of Korea.</p>



<p>Then, last month, a report from Windows Central pointed to a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/third-person-starcraft-shooter-will-reportedly-be-unveiled-at-blizzcon-2026/">StarCraft-based third-person shooter</a></strong> as the headlining title at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/">BlizzCon 2026</a></strong>, though there was no suggestion of who is behind it aside from the presumption that it would be Blizzard.</p>



<p>Now, however, a new report from <a href="https://m.dnews.co.kr/m_home/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994">The Korea Economic Daily</a> (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r0592a/new_details_from_nexons_starcraft_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">spotted on Reddit</a>) seems to point to Nexon's upcoming StarCraft project, and the rumoured third-person shooter being one in the same. The project is reportedly being made within Nexon's "<em>shooter headquarters</em>," implying that it won't be an RTS title.</p>



<p>It's worth taking all of this with a grain of salt, especially considering the fact that we have no confirmation from Blizzard that a StarCraft game is on its way. What we do have is a tease from Blizzard about this year's BlizzCon being <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">"<em>one for the ages</em>,"</a> the aforementioned Windows Central report, and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-allegedly-incubating-a-starcraft-shooter/">2024 report from Jason Schreier that Blizzard is also working on a StarCraft shooter</a>.</p>



<p>If the previous report about Blizzard incubating its own StarCraft shooter is correct, and it's being made alongside the shooter that Nexon is said to be working on, then the next two games in the StarCraft universe could both be shooters, with the next RTS entry in the series still in limbo.</p>



<p>Hopefully, BlizzCon 2026 will have all the answers if we don't hear from Blizzard sooner. The convention is set to take place on <strong>September 12-13, 2026,</strong> so StarCraft fans might still have a few more months of waiting to see what's next for the franchise. </p>

            <p>I hate Discord with the intensity of a supernova falling into a black hole. I hate its ungainly profusion of tabs and voice channels. I regret its cybersecurity breaches. I resent that the PRs use it for every virtual press event. I’m furious that I have to download 12 updates whenever I remember to turn it on. I despise the feisty and cloying loading screen trivia and service messages. Show me the “empathy banana” again, you weird little gopher beetle. I’ll put you in the microwave. </p>
<p>I also dislike that Discord now assumes I’m “teen-by-default” and restricts my access appropriately unless I go through some kind of age verification process, though I can understand the rationale, given some of the awful things that have happened via Discord. Already in play across the UK and Australia, this new “age-assured” approach is now being rolled out worldwide to create “a safer and more inclusive experience for users over the age of 13”. Rather unnervingly, Discord’s new age verification system includes an “inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age.”</p><!--more-->
<p>The “teen-by-default” strategy follows several major reported incidents of child grooming, sexual abuse and exploitation on Discord. In June 2023, NBC News <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-still-has-a-child-safety-issue-085304790.html">disclosed</a> 35 cases of adults being charged with "kidnapping, grooming, or sexual assault" that involved Discord, together with 165 cases of prosecution for sharing child sexual exploitation material on the platform. </p>
<p>In March 2024, The Washington Post, Wired, Der Spiegel, and Recorder <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2024/764-predator-discord-telegram/">published an investigation</a> of Discord channel 764, which has been used to orchestrate sexual abuse and murder, with links to police cases worldwide; Discord subsequently removed over 34,000 accounts associated with the group. Last year, a US teenager <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-teenager-sues-roblox-and-discord-for-allegedly-facilitating-the-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor%E2%80%9D">took Discord to court</a> for allegedly facilitating sexual exploitation.</p><p>These incidents aside, Discord are operating amid a climate of increased repression toward sexually explicit or themed material on digital platforms. Last year, payment processors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">initiated a crackdown</a> on transactions of adult games on Steam and Itch. The crackdown is on-going, with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/867874/stripe-visa-mastercard-amex-csam-grok">notable exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>“Beginning with a phased global rollout to new and existing users in early March, users may be required to engage in an age-verification process to change certain settings or access sensitive content,” reads <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally">a company update posted today</a>. “This includes age-restricted channels, servers, or commands and select message requests.</p>
<p>Here’s how the platform will work, going forward: “Discord users can choose to use facial age estimation or submit a form of identification to its vendor partners, with more options coming in the future. Additionally, Discord will implement its age inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age. Some users may be asked to use multiple methods if more information is needed to assign an age group.”</p>
<p>Discord promise that they won’t be infringing on anybody’s privacy, while running any of these systems. In particular, they’re keen to reassure you that other users won’t be able to learn your age, by hacking the workings. They stipulate four “key privacy protections”, as below:</p>
<blockquote><ul><li>On-device processing: Video selfies for facial age estimation never leave a user’s device.</li>
<li>Quick deletion: Identity documents submitted to our vendor partners are deleted quickly— in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.</li>
<li>Straightforward verification: In most cases, users complete the process once and their Discord experience adapts to their verified age group. Users may be asked to use multiple methods only when more information is needed to assign an age group.</li>
<li>Private status: A user’s age verification status cannot be seen by other users.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve verified your age, you’ll be able to see your assigned age group in your account settings. The platform “prompts users to age-assure only within Discord and currently does not send emails or text messages about its age assurance process or results”. You can also appeal against the result and retry the process.</p><p>Beginning early March, Discord will apply new default settings to all users. You’ll need to be “age assured” as an adult to unblur “sensitive content” (or turn the blurring feature off), access age-restricted channels, servers and app commands, or speak on stage in servers. DMs from people you “may not know” will be routed to a separate inbox limited to adult users, and you’ll get warning prompts when such people send you friend requests.</p>
<p>Alongside all this, Discord are recruiting a “Teen Council”, consisting of 10-12 teenagers who can “help ensure Discord understands - not assumes - what teens need, how they build meaningful connections, and what makes them feel safe and supported online.” If I were one of those Teen Council members, I'd probably start by asking how exactly this background "age inference" system works.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Amazon is making a live-action adaptation of </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, specifically the 2018 game set in Norse mythology. The show hasn’t begun shooting yet, but the casting announcements are trickling out as Amazon and Sony prepare to move ahead with production. Some actors fans will recognize from other shows and movies as well as the games, but so far only one is reprising their role from the actual Santa Monica Studio’s franchise. Let’s run down who we know is in the</span><i><span> God of War </span></i><span>TV show thus far.</span></p> <h2><b>Ryan Hurst as Kratos</b></h2>  <p><span>Leading the show will be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-amazon-kratos-ryan-hurst-2000659874"><span>Ryan Hurst as the god of war himself</span></a><span>. Hurst played Thor in the games, so he’s familiar with the source material, though the familiar casting wasn’t without </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584"><span>a little bit of controversy</span></a><span>, as this will be the first time Kratos is not portrayed by a Black actor. Outside of playing Thor in </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>, Hurst has also played Opie in </span><i><span>Sons of Anarchy</span></i><span> and Beta in the </span><i><span>Walking Dead </span></i><span>franchise. Most recently, he has played Miles in the new Netflix western series </span><i><span>The Abandons</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Callum Vinson as Atreus</b></h2>  <p><span>The co-lead of the series will be child actor Callum Vinson as Kratos’ son Atreus. One of Vinson’s most high-profile roles hasn’t actually premiered yet. He’s playing a young Jason Vorhees in </span><i><span>Crystal Lake</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Friday the 13th </span></i><span>prequel coming to Peacock later this year. But beyond that, he’s also appeared in series like </span><i><span>Poker Face</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Chucky</span></i><span>, and voiced Piglet in recent iterations of </span><i><span>Winnie the Pooh</span></i><span>. That’s a pretty decent resume for someone so young.</span></p> <h2><b>Alastair Duncan as Mimir</b></h2>  <p><span>One of the other game actors coming back to </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>for the show is Mimir actor Alastair Duncan, who is, thus far, the only performer reprising their existing role from the games for the show. Duncan’s voice performance was already one of the stand-outs in the </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>games, so I’m sure he’ll crush it again on TV.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka as Brok and Sindri</b></h2>  <p><span>Rounding out our known heroes are Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka as the bickering dwarven brothers Brok and Sindri, respectively. Woodburn has been in shows like </span><i><span>Seinfeld</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Conan the Adventurer</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Bones</span></i><span>, and recently appeared as Zoltan in Netflix’s </span><i><span>Witcher </span></i><span>series. Gulka, meanwhile, has worked on shows like </span><i><span>X-Files </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Stargate</span></i><span>.</span></p>

  <h2><b>Max Parker as Heimdall</b></h2>  <p><span>It looks like the show will be playing with the timeline of the games a bit, as Heimdall is set to appear in the first season, though he didn’t appear in the games until </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Boots </span></i><span>actor Max Parker will portray the evil bastard. He has also led </span><i><span>Vampire Academy </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blood, Sex &amp; Royalty</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Thor</b></h2>  <p><span>With Hurst playing Kratos this time around, someone else has to pick up Mjölnir for the show. Icelandic actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson will portray the god of thunder. </span><i><span>Severance </span></i><span>fans will likely recognize him as Mr. Drummond, where he was a very intimidating presence throughout the second season. Not a bad pick for </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>’s version of Thor.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mandy Patinkin as Odin</b></h2>  <p><span>Odin, who, again, was an enigma throughout the first Norse </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, will be showing up early in the Amazon series, as well. Storied actor Mandy Patinkin will be playing the all-father, and I’m eager to see him fill the shoes left by Richard Schiff, who played him in </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>. Patinkin, on top of having a long history in theater collaborating with legends like Andrew Lloyd Webber, has also been in plenty of films and television across his decades-long career, including his iconic role as Inigo Montoya in </span><i><span>The Princess Bride</span></i><span>.</span></p> <h2><b>Teresa Palmer as Sif</b></h2>  <p><i><span>Warm Bodies </span></i><span>actor Teresa Palmer has joined the cast as Sif, the wife of Thor and mother of Magni, Modi, and Thrúd. Palmer has most recently led the TV series </span><i><span>The Last Anniversary</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Mix Tape</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Family Next Door </span></i><span>last year.</span></p> <p><span>That’s all we know so far, but if you’ve played the Norse </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> games, you know they’re packed with characters. We still haven’t heard who’s being cast for Freya, Baldur, Angrboda, and many, many others. The </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>show is currently in pre-production, with the 2018 game’s director Cory Barlog on board as an executive producer, but there’s no set release date yet.</span></p>

<p>Amazon’s <em>God of War</em> adapts the storyline of 2018’s God of War, which features Kratos and Atreus on a journey to lay Faye, Kratos’ wife and Atreus’ mother, to rest. <em>Deadline</em> shares Atreus’ official show description as:</p><p>"The ten-year old son of Kratos, who grew up in a remote forest cabin, isolated from the rest of the world and raised almost entirely by his mother Faye. He is an accomplished archer, has an affinity for animals and is intensely curious about what lies beyond the confines of his forest home. After his mother’s death, Atreus is left with a cold, distant father who he barely knows and who knows little about him in return.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The campaign for the newest edition of <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> has launched on Kickstarter. The new <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition refreshes the iconic superhero TTRPG with streamlined rules, simplified character creation, and a new suite of superpowers.</p><p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greenroninpub/mutants-and-masterminds-4th-edition/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition will retain the bombastic superhero action and creative freedom of the superhero RPG, just with some quality-of-life improvements.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The game, which debuted in 2002, is built around an award-winning RPG system. Every action in the game is resolved by a single d20 roll. In addition, there are no character classes, but a point-buy system, allowing you to make just about any larger-than-life costumed hero you can imagine. From there, adventures can range between fighting aliens, thwarting would-be conquerors, or stopping rampaging monsters.</p><p><em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition will retain this system. A d20 roll still resolves everything.. Players will still make characters using a pool of Power Points, but the core rulebook will contain 15 hero archetypes (The Paragon, The Battlesuit, etc.) which serve as templates for new players.&nbsp;</p><p>The new core rulebook does add some new twists to this formula. It will include new rules for different heroic feats, advantages, and superpowers. The newest edition will also include Reactions to the game, introducing new tactical options in superhero brawls. Lastly, the book will feature artwork by comic artist Sean Izaakse.</p><p>For older fans, the digital stretch goals of <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition contain some throwbacks. The goals include older prewritten Astonishing Adventures updated to the new system, such as A Cold Day in Midtown, Into The Idiot Box, and Rise of the Tyrant. There is also a gazetteer for Earth Prime, an introduction to the game's core setting written by the game's creator, Steve Kenson.&nbsp;</p><p>The different pledge tiers for <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition are as follows:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ed18be609d6f65fc398410faecb4caae2"><em>Hero's Handbook PDF for $25:</em> A digital copy of the Hero's Handbook and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e28ca8875493aa545649e0ba6c3524edf"><em>Hero's Handbook and GM's Kit for $40:</em> Digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e7ef65ca7aa87e51a50d1489f292d0e2f"><em>Hero's Handbook Print and PDF for $50:</em> A physical hardcover and digital copy of the Hero's Handbook, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e340ff38a66bdd099536c9fedc9d5d5b2"><em>Hero's Handbook and GM's Kit Print and PDF for $80:</em> Physical and digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="ef3bb1299d4234d5ae891236646d07436"><em>Campaign Starter for $140:</em> Physical and digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, a set of physical hero tokens, reaction tokens, and a condition deck.</li></ul><p>At the time of writing, the campaign for <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds </em>Fourth Edition has raised $116,921, more than twice its initial funding goal of $50,000, and has unlocked all digital stretch goals. The campaign ends on March 5, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>A recent update to Steam allows developers to list a planned 1.0 release date for their Early Access games. While developers have always been free to share this information in blog posts or in the description on the store, in the past, they couldn't flag a game's planned release so clearly.</p>
<p>While this might seem like a small change, I'm thrilled to see it. Steam Early Access can be an excellent tool for developers, allowing them to put their game into players' hands and earn money without waiting until it's ready for a 1.0 release, but it can be a mixed bag for players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In its best form, an Early Access game launches in a playable (if unfinished) state, it then receives a string of updates, before eventually ending in a full release. But there are many games that never make it all the way to 1.0. As much as a developer may wish to finish a game, if they run out of funds, they might choose to move onto another project entirely. There are more than a few Early Access games in my library that haven't been added to in years, and I know the developers have either shut up shop or moved on to something else.</p>
<p>Before buying a game that's in Early Access, I now find myself having to become a detective – checking for when it was last updated or seeing if the developer is working on another, more recent project. I don't want to distrust the game maker, but I also don't want to spend money on an unfinished game that will never see its final version.</p><p>While <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/500597484211404992?l=english">Valve's latest update to Steam</a> doesn't change things radically – as I say, developers were free to write about the planned 1.0 release dates before, both on Steam and off it – it does make it a little easier when browsing games to see if a project is nearly finished or still a long way off. A developer could still blow through a release date or delay it, but this seems somehow more concrete and easier to hold a game maker accountable.</p>
<p>There is more to this change than first appears, too. As Valve say "Last year we introduced the Steam Personal Calendar, and realized one valuable kind of 'release' was missing from the UI: upcoming transitions from Early Access to 1.0. With an official 1.0 date display, we could give those transitions an official display in Personal Calendar, and help address the developer requests around formally showcasing the planned 1.0 release."</p>
<p>This means that if you wishlist a game that's in Early Access, it should now appear in your personal calendar when it's near a 1.0 release. So, if you're not keen on buying a game that's in an open-ended Early Access state, but you're happy to pick up a copy when you know it's definitely coming out and near release, you can now do that more easily.</p>
<p>So, as I say, a small change, but a welcome one.</p>
