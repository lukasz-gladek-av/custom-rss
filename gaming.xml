            <p>Another day, another AI-generated "slop" accusation, this time against Blizzard and its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> x <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> crossover event.</p>
<p>In a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/diablo_x_hearthstone_colab_is_ai_generated/">Reddit</a>, later picked up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/">PC Gamer</a>, redditor Ipyreable believes they've spotted an image with telltales signs of generative AI. At the time of writing, over 4,400 people have upvoted the post.</p>
<p>Given Hearthstone's fantasy leanings, it would be fair to presume a make-believe world embodies mystical things that don't align with the real world we live in, but I don't think there's many people who'd be prepared to defend an ear with three conchas (yes, I did indeed have to look that word up. You're welcome).</p>

<p>Appending an image with several questionable features, including a hand that fades into a wall, mirrored/reversed card art, and that strange ear, of course, the OP wrote: "Guess $158 pets aren't enough to pay an artist to draw the image for their colab lmao".</p>
<p>The $158 refers to Hearthstone's first ever cosmetic pet, King Krush, which is locked behind a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQVMosqrrek">gambling mechanism</a>" which requires you to spend your real life money.</p> <div>

<p>"Well, let's keep calling them out for this shit. If they're not going to pay artists, users are going to grumble. That's just how it is as well," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4ewxar/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one player, to which another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4ex6vq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">replied</a>: "Less grumbling, and more 'stop buying things with real money'. Can do both, but the latter is the only thing that gets brought up in yearly budget meetings with the money goblins."</p>
<p>"The sad reality is that most users won’t notice or care much at all," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4fmtb9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> someone else. "It’s better to focus on supporting companies and creators who make their own shit. Easier to get people excited for something new rather than try to diminish their attachment to something comfortable and familiar."</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard has yet to comment publicly on the accusations and, at the time of writing, the artwork remains online.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft announced around 9000 employees would be laid off</a>, including roughly 200 staff from King. Now, in a new report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">sources state King is reportedly replacing laid off staff with AI tools they helped to build</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-once-again-accusing-activision-blizzard-of-using-ai-generated-art-in-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-event-marketing-materials]]></content:encoded>

This is but one step in the Japanese company's grand plan for the IP, which includes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the first title</a> (also to be developed by Bloober Team) and the spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Townfall</a>, which is being made by Screen Burn (formerly No Code). </p>



<p>But Silent Hill f is particularly significant because KONAMI felt that the series was progressively being westernized. This game, in development at Hong Kong-based studio NeoBards Entertainment, was instead conceived as a fully Japanese horror game.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-announced-60s-japan-higurashi-ryukishi07/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced</a> on October 19, 2022 during that fateful Silent Hill transmission stream, Silent Hill f is <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to launch on September 25</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are now open, granting all a White Sailor School Uniform costume, an Omamori: Peony equippable item, and an Item Pack that includes one Shriveled Abura-age, one Divine Water, and one First Aid Kit.</p>



<p>The Standard Edition is priced at $69.99, while the Deluxe Edition is $10 more expensive and provides access to the digital art book, the digital soundtrack, and a pink rabbit costume. Moreover, if pre-ordering the Deluxe Edition, users will get 48 hours of early access, which means they'll start playing on September 23.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Silent Hill f is a survival horror game, much like previous titles. However, it will be set in Japan for the first time. More specifically, it takes place during the 1960s in the fictional town of Ebisugaoka, which was inspired by the real-life Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture, where mountains and forests cover more than 91% of the city area.</p>



<p>Protagonist Hinako Shimizu is just a regular high school student in Ebisugaoka until the isolated town is suddenly enveloped by a dark, mysterious fog. Ebisugaoka suddenly becomes silent as a grave, and it will be up to Hinako to investigate what's going on.</p>



<p>The story was written by the renowned author Ryukishi07 ('<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higurashi_When_They_Cry">Higurashi When They Cry</a></em>'), who KONAMI handpicked because they wished for someone who understood the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-silent-hill-f-deep-dive-digs-into-how-konamis-core-design-concept-of-find-the-beauty-in-terror-drove-the-games-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japanese horror concept</a>. At its core, it is about terror possibly being found even within beauty: when something becomes too immensely beautiful and perfect, it becomes deeply unsettling. For his part, Ryukishi07 claimed that Hinako Shimizu (portrayed in the game by Japanese actress Konatsu Kato) is a protagonist who makes her own choices rather than simply being pulled along by the story. By the way, the story will be entirely standalone, although there will be some references to previous entries.</p>



<p>Fans rejoiced when they learned that historic composer Akira Yamaoka would return for Silent Hill f. Yamaoka has since revealed that he focused on infusing the game's music with the series' Japanese "essence," reflecting his own cultural identity into the work as much as possible. We also know that the sound team traveled to the aforementioned town of Ebisugaoka to record its unique soundscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Not much has been said or indeed shown about the gameplay of Silent Hill f. We do know it will follow the series tradition of offering players a variety of complex puzzles to solve, as well as many grotesque-looking monsters to deal with. We also don't know its estimated length, but we'll be sure to update this article if the developers provide any indications.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Like the Silent Hill 2 remake, Silent Hill f is powered by Unreal Engine 5. The PC system requirements were <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-gets-new-trailer-details-and-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in March and don't seem too taxing on paper, although we'll have to test the game ourselves to see if it runs well. The requirements also include confirmation that NVIDIA DLSS and other similar upscaling technologies (presumably AMD FSR and possibly Intel XeSS) will be included. However, we don't know yet if the game will also support frame generation techniques.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11 x64<br>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 5700<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 50 GB available space<br>Sound Card: Windows-compatible audio Device.<br>Additional Notes: Playing on minimum requirements should enable playing on Performance quality settings at 30 at 720p. SSD is recommended.</p>



<p><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11 x64<br>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 50 GB available space<br>Sound Card: Windows-compatible audio Device.<br>Additional Notes: Playing on recommended requirements should enable playing on Performance settings at 60 FPS or Quality settings at 30 FPS at FullHD (or 4K using NVIDIA DLSS or similar technology).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Weaponlord - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/889e99b0841d6/weaponlord-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Brawl</a>, my friends!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-weaponlord-snes">Last week</a>, North America and Europe duked it out over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/weaponlord">Weaponlord</a> on the Super NES, with NA giving their EU PALs a good wholloping and taking home 85% of the vote.</p>
<p>Today, we're looking back at Rare's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/blast_corps">Blast Corps</a>, a delightful piece of nonsense from Twycross' 64-bit masters which saw you destroying everything in the path of a trundling warhead to prevent a catastrophic explosion. What can we say? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>'s got us in the mood for smashing stuff to smithereens.</p>
<p>It's a duel this week, as the European version was just the NA version with the customary black border. After checking out the options, drop your vote in the poll at the bottom of the page and we'll see whether East or West is best when it comes to the ol' smashy-smashy.</p>
<p>Let's get blasting.</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Blast Corps - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/053855f056548/blast-corps-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Microsoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Western variant. shows J-Bomb standing atop Backlash with the bike (Ballista) in the bottom right corner, behind which the big red bomb-laden carrier is seen approaching.</p>
<p>The puddle at the bottom, the flying bricks, and the fiery billows from the collapsing building offer some visual interest and help distract from the blocky nature of the render. The logo in the top right feels a bit generic and the red stencilled 'BLAST' gets a bit lost on top of the radiation symbol, but despite being a bit disparate, we can't help up like this.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Blastdozer - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25f46a6a47771/blastdozer-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Microsoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether you prefer the Japanese or North American cover, we can all agree that <strong>Blastdozer</strong> is just a better name, if only because there's zero confusion over the pronunciation and you're unlikely to provoke laughs in the playground when you tell your pals that Blast 'Corpse' looks amazing, instigating months of merciless ribbing.</p>
<p>Ahem. Looking at the cover, there's a lot to love. Cool mechs and big vehicles? Check. Explosions? Natch. Big red slogan slapped right over the centre? Boom. In honesty, 'BLAST 'EM ALL!' isn't the most riveting line, but we admire the bombast of putting it right in the centre of the blast, exactly where a less confident game would slap the logo.</p>
<p>And that logo at the bottom is a winner, too, boldly mixing the blue-tinged steel plating with the yellow and black warning barrier behind. We're not quite sure that that red, ticker-tape thing around the border is supposed to be, but we think we like it.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! Remember that this one is part of the Switch Online Expansion Pack library, so if you missed it back in *checks notes*...1997...*has a moment*, you can easily catch up with this winner.</em></p>
<p><em>Otherwise, we'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-new-gameplay-s-party-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This week, Chinese developer S-GAME hosted S-PARTY 2025, a two-day event in Beijing during which fans could get hands-on with the highly anticipated Phantom Blade Zero. IGN India has posted a 22-minute gameplay video from this new demo that shows some hidden boss fights, secret item discoveries, and new weapons. We've embedded it below.</p>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero is undoubtedly one of the most eagerly awaited games in the action RPG/Soulslike genre, although as you might recall, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stressed</a> that it is not to be considered a pure Soulslike game.</p>



<p>Last month, S-GAME CEO Soulframe <a href="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1937262120418312391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> exactly what he thinks the game is:</p>



<p><em>Phantom Blade Zero is neither a Soulslike game nor a traditional action game. I've always admired the creators who defined these genres. I spent years immersed in their work, drawing inspiration and learning from their brilliance. But in the process of making this game, we stumbled onto a path we never expected:<br>At first, we just wanted to make a game that brought 'hack and slash' Into a multi layered map. But once the animations and environmental assets came together, everything was "stitched together" by a strong cultural aesthetic — creating something that felt deeply familiar to us, yet is rarely seen or experienced in games.</em></p>



<p><em>Broadly speaking, it falls under the category of ARPGs. But more specifically, maybe it could create a new identity that is Wuxia Action Games? Because here you'll get to experience:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Leaping across rooftops under a rain of arrows; </em></li>



<li><em>Fighting off pursuers atop a speeding carriage;</em></li>



<li><em>Uncovering the truth behind an incident that shocked the world years ago; </em></li>



<li><em>And even more iconic cinema moments.</em></li>
</ul>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero | Exclusive Gameplay Footage | IGN India" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q5eTmj0gDzQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Soulframe also added that Phantom Blade Zero will feature three difficulty settings (Wayfarer, Gamechanger, and Hellwalker, although the latter is only unlocked for a second playthrough with New Game+), unlike traditional Soulslike titles.</p>



<p>The game still has no release window, but we might learn more at Gamescom, where S-GAME is set to bring a large presence with a massive 500 m² booth in Hall 6 (B-050G) featuring over 60 demo stations. The demo is said to be the most comprehensive shared publicly to date, a full 1-hour playable experience featuring all-new boss battles, striking level design, immersive storytelling, and visceral blade-to-blade combat.</p>



<p>We'll be at Gamescom and look forward to checking out the new demo after <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting on last year's Phantom Blade Zero hands-on</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a> has been one of the Switch highlights of 2025 so far, and it's been getting regular updates since it launched in April.</p>
<p>The next patch is now available and we've got the full patch notes here via the official game website. This bumps the Switch release up to <strong>Version 1.1.1</strong> and apparently includes improvements to various aspects of the game, as well as balance changes and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h3>The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy (Version 1.1.1) - 26th July 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Specification improvements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter Select</strong></p>

<p>It’s time for the Edge of Eternities pre-release and with having gotten a chance to try out some limited play of the set in the MTG Arena creator event I can share some insights that might just help you win your&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;pre-release... or know a bit more about the set, which we've been learning more about ever since the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-edge-of-eternities-preview-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Edge of Eternities Preview Cards Revealed"><em>Edge of Eternities&nbsp;</em>preview </a>only a few weeks ago</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/151/pain-for-all" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pain for All"><strong>Pain for All</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pain-for-all1.jpg?itok=LB0zz8Vs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pain-for-all1.jpg?itok=KEWUdFIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is a premium removal spell, and it plays really well in practice as well. On the surface, it is a relatively rare red ‘bite’ spell dealing damage equal to the power of your creature to an opponents, but there’s a lot more to this one. First of all, unlike other bite spells, Pain for All can also burn your opponent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bigger and second of all, it also gives a ‘<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/875/stuffy-doll" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stuffy Doll">Stuffy Doll</a>’ effect to the creature, meaning that when it’s dealt damage it deals damage to your opponents. With limited often involving a lot of fights, and the set has a higher number of high toughness creatures (16 commons, and 19 uncommons with more toughness than power) provoking ground stalls you can exploit with Pain for All.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/37/starfield-shepherd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Starfield Shepherd "><strong>Starfield Shepherd&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfield-shepherd.jpg?itok=vwKVdiaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfield-shepherd.jpg?itok=1USITqGl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This uncommon flier is excellent to get, in large part due to it’s warp ability. Being able to warp this on turn 2 helps ensure that you have a land drop in the future, and holding onto it a little can trigger Void abilities that you have. While a 3/2 Flying for 5 is a bit undersized, when it comes with having fetched a pair of cards it becomes quite good. The Shepherd gets even better if you have a strong 1 drop that it can fetch as well, with the best option in the set being <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/159/rust-harvester" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Rust Harvester">Rust Harvester</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/78/starfield-vocalist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Starfield Vocalist"><strong>Starfield Vocalist</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfield-vocalist.jpg?itok=Xms8oxVs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfield-vocalist.jpg?itok=0j_HMots 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In many sets, the Vocalist would be a buildaround type card left for people wanting to do whacky or strange drafts. But, Edge of Eternities is not most sets, and there are even more enters abilties then normal with Warp, as those creatures come in doing something then more often than not, and there are 62 creatures with ‘enters’ abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/220/interceptor-mechan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Interceptor Mechan"><strong>Interceptor Mechan</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/interceptor-mechan.jpg?itok=B-F81fs6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/interceptor-mechan.jpg?itok=IFaueP14 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/103/gravedigger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gravedigger ">Gravedigger</a> is always good, but this uncommon puts the venerable raise dead bringer to shame by not just flying, but working with artifact synergies and fetching artifacts, but also having the ability to grow. This thing is a machine and a strong reason to go black/red if you open it.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/101/fell-gravship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fell Gravship"><strong>Fell Gravship</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fell-gravship.jpg?itok=82EXM_Bh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fell-gravship.jpg?itok=BknhTM2w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Speaking of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/j25/452/gravedigger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gravedigger">Gravedigger</a>&nbsp;replacement options, Fell Gravship is a spacecraft option for black decks, milling a few cards and then grabbing you a spacecraft or creature back. With the format being slower and more defensive, it feels like there is time for spacecrafts to be stationed, meaning the 3/2 flying lifelink body here can be quite useful.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/221/mmmenon-uthros-exile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mm'menon, Uthros Exile"><strong>Mm’menon, Uthros Exile</strong></a></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mmmenon-uthros-in-mtg-arena.jpg?itok=-ZbF9q7f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mmmenon-uthros-in-mtg-arena.jpg?itok=6PKumtli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In one of the drafts I got a Mm'menon to go with a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/223/pinnacle-emissary" rel="nofollow">Pinnacle Emissary</a>... and another one of each later in the draft.</figcaption></figure><p>With all the artifacts in Edge of Eternities, and all the Lander creation going on in the set, Mm’menon here is able to grow himself or other creatures you have quite quickly and strongly. Without flying, Mm’menon would be still quite playable given the density of artifacts, with it, it can become a menace, to the degree it made my top 10 of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Ranking%20All%20The%20MTG%20Edge%20of%20Eternities%20Commanders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-new-commanders-in-mtg-edge-of-eternities">best commanders in&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/204/seedship-agrarian" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Seedship Agrarian"><strong>Seedship Agrarian</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/seedship-agrarian.jpg?itok=VkxszN0w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/seedship-agrarian.jpg?itok=VJQIBUrU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Landers are quite useful in <em>Edge of Eternities </em>limited, as they work to set up various artifact synergies, can hit void triggers, and in great especially make splashing much easier than it often is. The price is enough that I don’t think you can quite cut land over it, but in green with a couple of lander creators, you can splash a color quite easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the lander makers, Seedship Agrarian is one of the best, as while its 4 mana, it makes a lander each time it’s tapped – making it perfect for stationing spacecrafts. Additionally, it grows whenever a land enters, something you’ll be doing a lot with this scientist working for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/207/skystinger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Skystinger"><strong>Skystinger</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skystinger.jpg?itok=hh_V7ILX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skystinger.jpg?itok=HcQrFIEz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Skystinger is easy to overlook as a normal green lower cost anti-flying hate, but it’s important not to miss this little fellow, as it’s able to take on almost anything in the air. The air in <em>Edge of Eternities </em>come the late game can come to be occupied by some bigger creatures when certain spacecrafts get fully operational, but Skystinger for his humble 3 mana is able to take on almost all comers in the air.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/12/dual-sun-adepts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dual-Sun Adepts"><strong>Dual-Sun Adepts</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dual-sun-adepts.jpg?itok=1-o7k9aY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dual-sun-adepts.jpg?itok=bubcgUAb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>White has ties to both go-wide and +1/+1 counter themes in this set, both of which go very well with this 2/2 Double Striker who also provides a reasonably priced team pump. There’s really not much to say about this guy, aside from he’s solidly costed and does precisely what white is looking to in general, and he absolutely loves to be the recipient of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/21/honor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Honor">Honor</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/46/annul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Annul"><strong>Annul</strong></a></p>

Annul is one of the most efficient pieces of artifact removal because it can do it for 1 mana as long as you keep the mana up – something players should be aware of also when facing blue decks. It’s worth running at least one or two pieces of artifact hate in your deck if you get it, though most of it is in red and green.</p>

<hr><p>With that, best of luck at your pre-release and hope you enjoy&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>!</p>

		<p>“The story of killing Nazis is evergreen,” is the somewhat eyebrow-raising tag line for Amazon MGM’s next video game adaptation, Wolfenstein. Patrick Somerville, writer of the excellent The Leftovers, will be rather busy as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner.&nbsp; Wolfenstein developer MachineGames will also be on hand as Executive Producers. although that title is rather honorific and does not necessarily mean they will have input.</p>
<p>This is not the first time someone has tried to adapt the franchise, in 2012, movie producer&nbsp;Samuel Hadida announced a film based on the games&nbsp;with&nbsp;Roger Avary, writer of Pulp Fiction, attached to write and direct.</p>


<p>No other details of the Wolfenstein TV show have been revealed but most games have featured William “B.J.” Blazkowicz, an American soldier who encounters Nazi’s dabbling in the occult. The first game was released… prepare to feel very old… forty-five years ago, in 1981.&nbsp; Since then, there have been thirteen games, with the most recent, 2019’s Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, being a spin-off set a week before the previous game, Wolfenstein:&nbsp; Youngblood.</p>
<p>Sadly that game did not live up to expectations and we gave <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/29/wolfenstein-youngblood-review/">it 6/10 in our review</a>, which was summed up with “Go home Wolfenstein, you’re drunk.”</p>

            <p>Former DreadXP and Critical Reflex alum Ted Hentschke has teamed up with Jakub Bałuszek-Sobolewski to form Black Lantern Collective, a new publisher dedicated to horror games.</p>
<p>Described as an "all-new indie publisher leveraging the passion and expertise for established horror savants to bring a curated collection of chills, thrills, and unease to the freaky masses", Black Lantern hit the ground running with ten game announcements, but kicks off its release schedule with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/">Captum Mortum</a>, an atmospheric psychological horror game coming in August.</p>

<p>"Caput Mortum is a short first-person horror experience inspired by retro 3D dungeon crawlers and survival horror games," the team explains. "Delve into a tower of forgotten nightmares, where every step could be your last. Overcome horrors from beyond death and unlock the secrets of forbidden knowledge."
</p>
<p>Also on the way is a first-person narrative adventure "about tagging billboards and watching your house burn down", <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105190/CHILDREN_OF_SATURN/">Children of Saturn</a>, rogue-like dice build <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3512300/Dead_Finger_Dice/">Dead Finger Dice: A Billionaire Killing Game</a> wherein you take on pole dice against blood-thirsty demon billionaires - as you do - and a "darkly quirky" RPG called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3145370/Muffles_Life_Sentence/">Muffles' Life Sentence</a> set in a prison where innmates are remade to match their crimes. The latter is out now on Steam.</p>

            <p>Amazon MGM Studios has selected yet another video game series for a TV show adaptation - and this time it's Wolfenstein.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/">Variety</a>, the exact plot details have yet to be disclosed, but the show's official tagline reminds us that "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen".</p>

<p>Jonah Nolan (aka Jonathan Nolan) and Lisa Joy - names you would've seen on the credits of Fallout - are already on board as executive producers, along with Athena Wickham, James Altman, and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson. Patrick Somerville will serve as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner under his production company, chaoticgood.tv.</p>
<p>Variety reports Somerville - who created the shows Maniac and Station Eleven - has reportedly been a fan of the Wolfenstein games "since he was a child".</p>
<p>Amazon is clearly looking to replicate the success of its hugely successful game-to-TV adaptation, Fallout, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime</a>, even though the show's second season's December 2025 debut is still months away.</p>
<p>More than 100 million people have watched Fallout's first season to date, Amazon has revealed, making it one of the streamer's top three launches ever. Amazon is now moving quickly to make more of the show, and begin teasing its second batch of episodes with another longing look at the Las Vegas skyline at the end of the below trailer.</p>
<p>Other in-progress TV adaptations at Amazon include a series based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">God of War</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">Warhammer 40,000</a>. In fact, Amazon is so confident of its God of War adaptation, it has ordered a second season before the first has even been aired.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch is back in the world of Predator via an extended version of animated movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-killer-of-killers">Killer of Killers</a> — and it’s sent fans of the long-running sci-fi franchise down a lore rabbit hole that calls into question the endings of the original movies and what was thought to be a canon Predator video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, current Predator custodian Dan Trachtenberg announced a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/extended-ending-of-predator-killer-of-killers-featuring-arnold-schwarzenegger-as-dutch-and-danny-glover-as-mike-harrigan-to-broadcast-tonight-sdcc-2025">surprise extended version of Killer of Killers that shows Dutch from the original Predator and Danny Glover's Mike Harrigan from Predator 2 captured and frozen by the Yautja</a>. Trachtenberg said during a panel at Comic-Con that Schwarzenegger had given his blessing to use Dutch in future stories, leaving the door open to a Killer of Killers follow-up that would see Dutch and co revived and pitted against a Predator once again.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">BRAND NEW PREDATOR KILLER OF KILLERS EXTENDED ENDING FEATURING DUTCH AND MIKE HARRIGAN <a href="https://t.co/xoDYwLmLFP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xoDYwLmLFP</a></p>— MOVIEDEATHS (@MOVIEDEATHBLOWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/MOVIEDEATHBLOWS/status/1948936697678352506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The extended version of Killer of Killers is out now, so fans are already analyzing it to within an inch of its life. Reaction appears to be mixed. While some are excited about the iconic characters' return, some are disappointed with the idea that the Yautja kidnap victorious humans in the first place. Let’s remember the iconic scene at the end of Predator 2 where an elder Yautja rewards Harrigan with an antique flintlock pistol as a trophy. The suggestion now is Harrigan was later kidnapped and put in stasis, which some believe devalues the human victories seen in previous Predator movies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It just feels like shit knowing your favorite human survivors are just going to be kidnapped and probably killed in an arena by another human or by the Warlord,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/predator/comments/1m9iekb/is_this_the_new_epilogue_of_killer_or_killers/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Vector_Mortis</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why would the Yautja congratulate Harrigan, give him the pistol, and leave just to come back, take the pistol, and kidnap him?” wondered Slow_Obligation2286.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not a fan of this at all,” added Hanesman12. “Harrigan and Dutch had good endings. Zero reason this needed to be done. Purely nostalgia bait.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This removes everything we previously knew about Dutch and Harrigan’s timelines after the movies,” said Originalname888. “This removes the honor code. This removes everything.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now latching onto a potential explanation for what is going on here: that the whole kidnap human survivors thing is the work of the Yautja tribe we see in Killer of Killers, which does not represent the Yautja as a whole. Perhaps this particular tribe has gone rogue and will eventually be put in its place. On that we’ll have to wait and see, but what is irrefutable is that it is now canon that Dutch and Harrigan were kidnapped soon after the events of their movies and remain in stasis at this undetermined point in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s an additional tricky Predator lore question that revolves around Dutch. 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a>, developed by IllFonic, features Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as Dutch. In the run up to the game’s release, the developers talked about working with people at previous rights holder Fox (this is before Disney bought the company and its franchises) to cement Hunting Grounds’ place within the official Predator lore.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This was exciting for fans as it meant Hunting Grounds officially revealed what happened to Dutch after the events of the first Predator movie — and there was no mention of being kidnapped by Yautja. Indeed, Hunting Grounds shows an older Dutch in the year 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, is Hunting Grounds no longer canon? Is Trachtenberg ignoring it? Is there another explanation? These are just some of the questions fans are trying to answer in the wake of Dutch’s return in Killer of Killers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever Trachtenberg’s master plan, there remains huge interest in the upcoming Predator: Badlands, the first 15 minutes of which were shown at Comic-Con. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-predator-badlands-trailer-sparks-theories-for-how-a-xenomorph-may-make-a-surprise-appearance-to-turn-it-into-a-secret-avp-movie">The Alien franchise links are clear</a>, but will there be an AVP movie afterwards? We’ll have to wait and see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
