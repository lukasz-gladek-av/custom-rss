						<h5>Gamesir T7 Xbox Wired Controller</h5></div></div>
					<p>There are a lot of titles where the gaming experience is unparalleled with a gaming controller. Surely, there are instances where a mouse excels but the multi-tasking of a controller is what makes it stand out. Thankfully, there are plenty of controllers available to choose from and this goes for most price ranges.</p>
<p>The majority of gamers usually settle for a cheap one, which is why companies like Gamesir have introduced their brand new budget T7 Xbox wired controller. The <a href="https://www.gamesir.hk/products/gamesir-t7">Gamesir T7</a> brings an Xbox layout and a wired connection that works with several devices out of the box but is it good enough for us to recommend it?</p>
<p>We will see how it performs in various areas and review it in detail in this article. That will be followed by our verdict on the T7 Xbox wired controller which will sum up all the pros and cons of it, providing a clear picture of whether it will be suitable for your needs or not.</p>

<h2>Gamesir T7 Summary</h2>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>Gamesir T7 is a budget Xbox controller, which is compatible with multiple Xbox consoles out of the box. Moreover, it can be used with PC and Steam Deck, making it a suitable option for those who own these platforms. Since the controller is wired, connecting it to mobile phones won't be possible as it misses the Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>The T7 controller is aimed at offering all the necessary controls for playing modern games and whether it is FPS, action-adventure, RPG, or competitive titles, the T7 has all the basic controls for Xbox and PC games.</p>
<p>I liked how it looked from the outside. The white chassis with some grey and orange buttons and accents add to its aesthetics. The controller is also available in various other colors, including Sapphire Blue and Ruby Red, but the Creamsicle White is minimalistic and feels lovely sitting on the desk.</p>
<h2>Connectivity and Compatibility</h2>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>Gamesir T7 can only be connected to the devices via the USB A to C cable connection. The USB C port is available on top of the controller and the cable is quite long for letting you play from a distance. While it isn't braided, it is still a high-quality and thick orange-colored cable, which you can comfortably store anywhere using the available cable tie strap.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gamesir-T7-21.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There is a 3.5mm jack at the bottom of the controller, which can be used to connect a gaming headset. It's pretty convenient and a must-feature for controllers if you own a wired headset. Unfortunately, the more expensive <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gamesir-tarantula-pro-controller-review-solid-but-can-be-overwhelming/">Gamsir Tarantula Pro misses on this feature, which we have reviewed previously</a>.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gamesir-T7-7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The control layout is roughly the same as you find on regular Xbox controllers. There are four face buttons, a D-Pad, two joysticks, an Xbox home button, and a few miscellaneous buttons for various functions. Let's dive into each in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Face Buttons and D-Pad</h3>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>The face buttons are mushy and so is the D-Pad. Both use membrane switches but I found a bit different feel when pressing the two. Face buttons are pretty much how you will find on most budget controllers but the D-Pad is a bit clicky-type. The size of the D-Pad may not be large, but it's adequate.</p>
<p>The XY buttons are colored in grey while the AB buttons are orange. This contrast helps users adjust to the Xbox controller layout quickly while offering an attractive look.</p>
<h3>Joysticks And Triggers</h3>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>Both joysticks and triggers use the Hall Effect mechanism for detecting the movement. Hall Effect is pretty popular in most budget controllers nowadays since there is zero drifting. With Hall Effect technology, the input is registered even in the smallest movements of buttons and joysticks as the mechanism involves magnets to measure voltage to know the distance and direction.</p>
<p>As per Gamesir, the T7 triggers are accurate up to 0.1mm. These are usually good for racing games but for genres like FPS, it would have been great if the triggers could be adjusted to hair-trigger mode. The official website does say that the triggers support both analog and hair-trigger modes, but I didn't find any button or latch to switch to the hair-trigger mode. The latter makes shooting pretty instant similar to a gaming mouse.</p>
<p>As for the joysticks, these are pretty reliable with a lifespan of up to 5 million cycles.</p>
<h2>User Experience</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gamesir-T7-13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Gamesir T7 is a light-weight controller and it's mostly because it doesn't use any batteries. This helps in long gaming sessions and since you don't have to worry about battery life, it's decent for PC and Xbox gaming. Still, it doesn't take away the fact that there are instances where you would have to manage that long cable and would rather want to play wirelessly.</p>
<p>There are a lot of controllers out there that bring Bluetooth connectivity for the same price as the T7. This has reduced the compatibility of T7 to just devices that bring a USB A port connection.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the controls are responsive and satisfactory. I particularly liked the D-Pad and the bumpers. They always gave a clicky feel, which was satisfying and didn't feel flimsy or low quality. Joysticks are also decent but I wouldn't say that these are the best ones. I have used some budget controllers before like EasySMX X05, which had smoother joysticks for better aiming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gamesir-T7-14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Coming to the grip, even though the T7 has a textured grip as you can see in the image, these are very minimal. The textured grip extends all the way to the top at the back but I didn't find them significant to make a solid grip.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Gamesir T7 Xbox wired controller is an all-right gaming controller for PC and Xbox users. The controls are satisfactory, the build quality is good, and the experience overall is positive. I liked the appearance and how good it looks despite featuring no RGB lighting. It would have been great if it had more buttons and some remappability but at this price, it isn't a big complaint.</p>
<p>The long and good quality cable is an additional pro for the T7, which will let you play from the couch unless you are planning to sit several meters away from your device. The Gamesir T7 isn't the best at this price but it gets the job done by offering up-to-the-mark and competitive features. However, I would prefer to go with a controller that offers both wired and wireless connectivity if my budget is $35.</p>

					
					

<p>Gamesir T7 is a satisfactory gaming controller for your daily gaming needs that works with various devices out of the box. While it doesn't have premium features, it gets the job done with its modern and responsive controls.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-runs-naraka-bladepoint-twice-as-fast-says-developer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-runs-naraka-bladepoint-twice-as-fast-says-developer-pssr-has-similar-quality-to-dlss.1028172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-runs-naraka-bladepoint-twice-as-fast-says-developer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This is the week of the PS5 Pro, and you can expect lots more coverage on Sony's mid-generation console refresh. Earlier today, we published our <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-unboxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unboxing</a> of the hardware; now, here's another episode of our chats with game developers who have chosen to support the new console at launch.</p>
<p>This time around, we interviewed&nbsp;Yongcheng Liu, Console Version Producer of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/naraka-bladepoint-review-musou-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naraka: Bladepoint</a> at NetEase ThunderFire Universe X Studio. The free-to-play battle royale game continues to be extremely popular and just received a new gameplay mode and new hero (Cyra, a high priestess from the Temple of Light and Shadow, a support-oriented character who excels at healing teammates, controlling enemies, and dealing damage).</p>
<p>In our PS5 Pro chat, Liu said the new console runs the game twice as fast as the base PlayStation 5. The producer also reckons PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution offers similar visual quality to the current AI upscaling benchmark, NVIDIA DLSS, save for minor differences in small details. Keep scrolling below for the full Q&amp;A.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Mode, New Cosmetics | Halloween is there!  NARAKA: BLADEPOINT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGHrJNXB7Hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? Which single feature were you most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>The GPU upgrade is highly significant, offering approximately double the performance improvement for Naraka: Bladepoint. The most impressive features are PSSR and VRS. In particular, VRS, when applied to specific rendering processes in Naraka: Bladepoint, can drastically reduce rendering time. This is extremely important for a competitive game like Naraka.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar, reduced, or increased?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 version of Naraka: Bladepoint is our first console game, so unfortunately, we did not have the experience of transitioning from PS4 to PS4 Pro. I believe that with the next generation of console upgrades, we will have much more experience and informed insights to answer this question.</p>
<p>Due to Naraka: Bladepoint's large PC user base and our diligent efforts, we release game updates frequently, with significant content updates every 2–3 weeks. Consequently, you will consistently notice new graphical technologies and features being added to the game. For the console version, our usual approach is to optimize the performance of these updates as much as possible rather than retain everything. Therefore, Sony's recent hardware upgrade will allow us to timely integrate many of the accumulated graphical effects into the console version.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game? Also, how does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game?</strong></p>
<p>Naraka: Bladepoint can achieve 4K 60FPS on the PS5 Pro without using upscaling technologies, which is not possible on the PS5. In balanced mode, the PS5 Pro with PSSR enabled offers better visual quality compared to the PS5 using other upscaling methods while still maintaining a stable<br>
frame rate.<br>
As a live-service battle royale game, Naraka: Bladepoint places significant stress on the CPU, often resulting in CPU bottlenecks in many circumstances. Therefore, there is some FPS difference between the PS5 Pro and high-end PCs. However, we have implemented different graphical modes to provide our fans with more freedom of choice.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share the complete details of the various PS5 Pro modes available to Naraka: Bladepoint players?</strong></p>
<p>● <strong>Quality Mode:</strong> Provides native 4K ultra-clear visuals, ideal for users seeking better visual experiences.<br>
● <strong>Balanced Mode:</strong> Enhances fluidity while maintaining 4K resolution, balancing both visual quality and smoothness.<br>
● <strong>Frame Rate Mode:</strong> Offers native 1080P visuals for users who need the highest frame rates, ensuring smoother gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? If so, how does it compare to the premiere AI-based upscaling solution, NVIDIA DLSS?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Naraka: Bladepoint does use PSSR. We believe that the various upscaling technologies have<br>
had the most significant impact on game development in recent years, and we actively embrace this trend while also exploring the application of new graphics technologies.<br>
When comparing PSSR to DLSS, the overall visual performance is similar, with minor differences in some small details. For a competitive game like Naraka: Bladepoint, we strive to ensure that players do not notice these differences during regular gameplay unless the platform's performance cannot support it.</p>
<p><strong>The big controversy about Sony's new console is related to its pricing. Based on the hardware, do you believe it to be fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>From a developer's perspective, better GPUs and CPUs provide more development headroom, helping us apply new graphics technologies to our games. The high pricing could be due to various reasons, such as changes in chip prices, increased manufacturing costs, and so on. I hope these<br>
factors do not hinder players from experiencing the games they love. Therefore, we will continue to<br>
support both the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions, ensuring that every PS player who enjoys Naraka:<br>
Bladepoint can have a great experience with the game.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Enshrouded has received what developers Keen Games are calling the survival game's "most sizable" update yet, sizable being an appropriate word for mountains. Expect a new playable area, the Alabaneve Summits, with its own enemies, resources, non-threatening wildlife and quests. The maximum character level has risen to 35! There are new townsfolk to find and place in your poorly built houses! You can tame animals, and make them live in poorly built houses too! You can get hypothermia!</p>
<p>All this, plus the first draft of a new dynamic weather system, with sudden snowfall draining your body heat in the new biome. It's a bountiful overhaul indeed for an early access game Ollie described as "a solid foundation" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enshrouded-early-access-review">back in January</a>, praising its "best-in-class building" while complaining about "insipid" combat, various quality-of-life issues, and a purposeful abundance of fog. Find a trailer below.</p>

<p>And here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4461471496628338725?l=english">the full changelog</a>. Some highlights: there are new grappling hook skills that let you use it Bionic Commando-style to yank airborne foes into melee range, or reel yourself toward larger enemies. Gliding is now more challenging, with air turbulence affecting your flight path, though you can switch this off. They've also added single player pause functionality, and reworked the levelling curve so that you won't max out too early.</p><p>Possibly most enticing from my perspective as an early-game quitter is that the characters you can recruit for your homestead now behave more like people than glorified vending machines. They have a day-night cycle during which they'll explore, inspect points of interest, take breaks, talk to you and sleep at night (on the floor, if necessary). The obvious downside of this is that you might start to feel bad about their living arrangements.</p>
<p>Enshrouded will leave early access in 2025. If you'd like to know how it has evolved since January and what's left to do, the devs have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4122554066513691534?l=english">one of those roadmap things</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the great thing about <em>FFXIV</em>–and this is a staple of most MMOs if we’re being entirely honest–is how many supplementary things there are to do to immerse yourself in the world beyond the main story quest. Do you want to earn some titles and cute minions? Do literally anything else on offer, like become a master crafter, or fisher. There are multiple jobs that you can take on that have nothing to do with combat, dungeons, trials, or anything remotely like that. You can lock in to the most idle game content ever and spend your hours relaxing, casting a line, and chatting with friends in a Discord call. Take it from one of said friends who has been on that call, my friends seemed utterly blissed out, and that could (and perhaps should) be you, too.</p></div><div><p>Music is how I most often come down. The minute I pop my overpriced earphones into my head and put on my messy, uncurated playlist of liked songs, my worries wash away. Even now, I’m listening to Phoebe Bridgers and Connor Oberst’s joint record <em>Better Oblivion Community Center </em>to simultaneously listen to a record I’ve meant to throw on for some time now, put on something folk-adjacent to relax the nerves, and motivate me to write today. I’m chill as fuck now. And you can be too, if you just give yourself over to music.</p><p>Enter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a></span>, the dreamiest iteration of the otherwise most stressful game ever. <em>Tetris Effect </em>doesn’t just set the whole thing to relaxing house music with lyrics about connectedness between all living things: it transforms <em>Tetris </em>into a completely different experience.

I came to peace with the things I could and couldn’t do, and became better at seizing opportunities to make triumphant and huge plays. I learned to take my time and pick my moments, and by internalizing that, I made peace with some part of myself that rarely enjoyed it.</p><p><em>Tetris Effect actually </em>gave me that, but it’s also just a thoroughly relaxing version of <em>Tetris </em>set to trippy visuals and the aforementioned house music with lyrics about connectedness. If what you really need is a semblance of unity, perhaps in the face of overwhelming dread and an existential threat, there are few experiences that can soothe you like <em>Tetris Effect</em>.</p></div><div><p>My <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4"><em>Sims</em></a></span><em> </em>girlies have always been ahead of the curve on this one, if I’m being totally honest. These games aren’t for me, but I can understand how they could be for others. Hell, life has gone sideways a million different ways, and a game enabling me to be delulu, remake myself, and act out my fantasies sounds like a wonderful gift.</p><p>I think it’s good that we all have something that we can have control over that routinely brings us some bit of joy or peace of mind. <em>Sims </em>is the blueprint, in this regard; the original feel- good game to relax withto and drown out the noise of the world with. <em>The SiIms 4</em>, like the rest of the series before it, is an exercise in complete and selfish control, a luxury so many of us are often denied, and risk having taken away from us at numerous disappointing junctures.</p><hr><p>I don’t know about you all, but I could stand to pull a bit of a disappearing act right now. The <em>Final Fantasy XIV Online </em>icon on my desktop is looking mighty tempting, and while I’ve resisted it for some time now, maybe I owe it to myself to go somewhere better. At least, until the real world begins resembling my greatest fantasies a bit more. Anything but this, y’know?<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Metro Awakening is finally here and <strong>it is looking sharp</strong>. I played a trial of Awakening on PS VR2 at Gamescom, but it was a drop in the ocean in terms of experience compared to running through the entire game on Meta Quest 3. That’s what I’ve busied myself with of late, and I’m happy to say that this is <strong>still </strong>one VR shooter that you shouldn’t miss.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Metro Awakening review, captured on Meta Quest 3.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-underground">Going Underground</h2>



<p>Metro Awakening is, for want of a better term, a <strong>real Metro game</strong>. It looks, feels, and sounds like a classic Metro title, plunging players into the dank depths of the Moscow metro system, forced to survive against mutants and human enemies out for blood. It’s an entirely new perspective on the franchise – literally – but it works so well once you give it a few minutes to get settled.</p>



<p>I’ll be honest, it took me a few attempts to gel with Metro Awakening, and those attempts included playing with the game’s settings, but once I’d hit the perfect setup, I was <strong>immersed and loving every inch </strong>of Vertigo Games’ stab at this legendary post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>Metro Awakening has an all-new, original story penned by Dmitry Glukhovsky, the franchise’s creator. That’s one of the most remarkable elements of this gritty VR shooter, and a few twists and turns along the way kept me thoroughly engaged, just as I would have been playing a premium, traditional release in the series, like Metro Exodus.</p>



<p>As you explore this story, you’re treated to an original soundtrack composed by Anne-Kathrin Dern. It’s unmistakably <strong>Metro</strong>, and on more occasions than I could count, the soundtrack, paired with the ambient audio, was enough to send a chill through me.</p>



<p><em>Seriously, if you’ve ever played a Metro game, you’ll know how terrifying they <strong>can </strong>be. As you’re crawling through a spider-infested vent with nothing but a lighter to guide you, a ‘Lurker’ will leap around a corner, diving and scratching at your face. Imagine how intense that is through a VR headset.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-excellent-expansion">Excellent Expansion</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro Awakening is a prequel, and it takes players along a path that sees the protagonist, an unassuming doctor named Serdar, become one of the most supernatural entities in the Metro series: Khan. It’s set in 2028, while the first Metro game walks players through events that happen in 2033.</p>



<p>That’s where the name ‘Awakening’ comes from, see?</p>



<p>It might be a prequel set years before the first game, but it’s brilliant how familiar Awakening feels compared to the follow-up, full-sized titles. From the voice acting to the weapons, and from the post-apocalyptic environment to the mutants that stalk the tunnels of Moscow, everything is instantly recognisable as being pulled from a Metro game.</p>



<p>And it’s in these elements – the weapons, equipment, set pieces, and so on – that players will come to appreciate the depth and detail of this game. I spent so long studying the rifles and handguns I could pick up, I probed every corner looking for collectables, and I found myself hitting ‘restart’ on checkpoints just so I could try a different approach through a scene.</p>



<p>This game is focused heavily on stealth, given that Serdar is not a grizzled combat veteran, but I found myself pushing into some hardcore fights. On the easiest difficulty, you’ll still get a tasty enough challenge, and going on the toughest difficulty setting is nothing short of masochistic.</p>



<p>Within a couple of hours, you’ll have an arsenal of weapons and a full array of tactics to deploy, but like other games in the series, Awakening is relatively open-ended. I found myself accidentally ‘getting ahead of the game’ just by wondering <strong>if </strong>I could do a certain thing and then <strong>trying </strong>to do it. It doesn’t hold your hand, thankfully.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>This game isn’t without faults. I’ll sum those up before I cap off my Metro Awakening review.</p>



<ul>
<li>I had to reload checkpoint a few times because of a bug where I was either too high off the ground or too close to the floor.</li>



<li>I also had to reload the game because on three or four occasions, I stepped outside my boundary and the game locked me out of the playable area.</li>



<li>I lost a fair bit of ammunition by taking a magazine out of my weapon and setting it down on a surface that promptly swallowed it.</li>
</ul>



<p>I also <strong>had </strong>to play the game using continuous movement as opposed to teleporting, simply because I kept teleporting into surfaces that would throw my headset into disarray. It worked out for the better, though – continuous movement is superior. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Metro Awakening is worth every penny. It’s the most immersive post-apocalyptic experience I’ve had the pleasure of playing, and every step I took through the tunnels beneath Moscow had me feeling on edge and wary of my next move. I lost myself in the heart-pounding pressure of gunfights, and stealth sequences made my mouth run dry.</p>



<p>This is as close to the end of the world as you’ll ever hope to be, and the 8 – 10 hours you play fully exploring this game will be very well spent. </p>



<p><em>Metro Awakening is available worldwide on November 7 on PS VR2, Steam, Meta Quest, and Viveport.</em></p>

            <p>I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-is-live-with-an-early-glimpse-of-the-new-camping-wound-and-weather-systems">the Monster Hunter Wilds beta</a> looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1gjfc9x/why_most_of_the_models_from_the_mhws_beta_becomes/">this reddit thread</a> earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.</p>
<p>If every monster in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.</p> <!--more-->
<p>All this comes with the severe caveat that we are talking about somebody's patchy translation of amateur tech breakdowns that may have been totally fabricated. Capcom ain't talking either. But the explanation is consistent with what I dimly understand of memory management in other video games. More importantly, the low poly monsters are just extremely good fun.</p>
<p>It isn't particularly novel to argue that Actually, video games are more visually intriguing when you boil away a lot of detail and geometry. I did <a gref="https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-thankless-quietly-imaginative-task-of-developing-for-low-spec-gaming/">a feature about low-spec graphics for PCGamer</a> back in the day, and have also written in glowing terms about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-power-of-demakes-in-the-year-of-next-gen">PS1 demakes of triple-A games</a>, together with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">arsey reverse-historical commentaries on Silent Hill 2</a>. So I won't belabour the point this time. Fortunately, I have other people to belabour it for me.</p><p>The beta's jigsaw-dinosaurs have sparked a wave of enthusiasm on Twitter, one of those little trends that makes you think ah, maybe Twitter ain't so bad these days, and then you spend longer than five minutes there, and nope, still awful. In amongst <a href="https://x.com/Zugsie/status/1852222041040060501">the complaints about optimisation</a>, there are people attempting half-serious taxonomies of the low-poly menagerie.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Monster Hunter Wilds OBT PC Low Poly Model Tier List:</p><p>S - Rey Dau, a paper plane of all time.<br>A - Chatacabra, the cube with legs<br>B - Dogashuma, another fun cube but it's more plump<br>C - Balahara, that looks far too passable to be funny <a href="https://t.co/uvbkwsvOva">pic.twitter.com/uvbkwsvOva</a></p></div>— Project αΩ (@DzatBL) <a href="https://twitter.com/DzatBL/status/1852306817420021766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>Studying these low-poly models is a useful exercise for armchair developers like myself, inasmuch as it reveals which parts of the base monster's appearance the Wilds artists consider essential, in order for you to perceive it as a monster at all  - shape, colour, anatomy, texture, et cetera. All told, I wonder if they'd consider doubling down on the LOD glitch and making it a proper feature, perhaps with some directorial commentary. But above all, I need to know how exactly you make yourself some fancy leather pauldrons from a Chatacabra that looks like a haunted box of tissue paper.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty is not only one of the most popular casual shooter games, but it thrives in the world of competitive and ranked, too. With Black Ops 6 just released, many are waiting for the game’s ranked system to drop. However, all Call of Duty games over the last few years have kept the same ranked system. Here are all the Call of Duty ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-call-of-duty-rank">Every Call of Duty Rank</h2>



<p>Call of Duty still stands as one of the biggest games in the world of esports and gaming, with millions of players hopping on every day. However, just because the game is incredibly popular amongst casual gamers, there is a massive competitive scene too.</p>



<p>So, here is a list of every rank in Call of Duty (updated last in Modern Warfare 3):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze (I – III):</strong> 0-899 SR</li>



<li><strong>Silver (I – III):</strong> 900-2,099 SR</li>



<li><strong>Gold (I – III):</strong> 2,100-3,599 SR</li>



<li><strong>Platinum (I – III):</strong> 3,600-5,399 SR</li>



<li><strong>Diamond (I – III):</strong> 5,400-7,499 SR</li>



<li><strong>Crimson (I – III):</strong> 7,500-9,999 SR</li>



<li><strong>Iridescent:</strong> 10,000 SR</li>



<li><strong>Top 250:</strong> 10,000+ SR</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s ranked system runs off of Skill Rating (SR), which is Call of Duty’s in-game points used to rank up. Players rank up by getting kills and wins when playing ranked. </p>



<p>If the ranked system changes for Black Ops 6, we will update you here at Insider Gaming.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-top-250-in-call-of-duty">How to get Top 250 in Call of Duty</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s final rank, Top 250, is quite unique compared to other games. While every game has a final rank that players strive for, no other game has a rank that specifies you are in a certain top portion of players. </p>



<p>Being able to brag that you have made it into the Top 250 in Call of Duty is an incredibly impressive feat, as literally, <em>only </em>250 people will be able to make this claim. Still, unlike other final ranks in games, your spot in the Top 250 could be lost depending on how many others are working to get there. </p>



<p>To stay in the Top 250 you will have to consistently play ranked and work to not lose your spot. Those who make it into the Top 250 will be shown on a leaderboard for everyone to see, giving them the ultimate bragging rights.</p>



<p>Are you planning on trying to get into the Top 250 in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</p>

They'll need to earn special items called Fallen Citadel Gates in order to travel to Arthas' frozen throne. These can be earned by completing dungeons, acquired as log-in rewards, or acquired as a rare drop from monsters killed over the course of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting the Lich King isn't all there is to the event. Players will be able to earn new weapon cosmetics modeled off some of WoW's own legendary weapons by progressing through an event pass, including Thunderfury, Shadowmourne, Gorehowl, and Atiesh. Those who didn't earn the Frostmourne skin from a previous WoW-themed event will be able to do so during this time around as well.</p><p dir="ltr">A new PvP battleground, Cutthroat Basin, will also make its debut on November 13. The map is modeled off WoW's Arathi Basin battleground, complete with capture points like the lumber mill, blacksmith, and stables. Players' levels, items, and gems will be normalized for the PvP event to make things fair, and players will additionally be able to seek out special skill orbs during the battle that will grant access to WoW abilities like Blessing of Kings, Stealth, Eagle Eye, and Blink.</p><p dir="ltr">There are other cosmetics too, though some of them won't be for free. Murloc skins for Diablo Immortal's familiar pets can be earned for free, but Illidan-themed wings and cosmetics can only be earned through the gacha-style Phantom Market, of which players will get one roll for free for logging in during the event. Two versions of WoW's iconic Ashbringer sword will be available for purchase from the in-game shop for the duration of the event, with no free way to earn the legendary Paladin weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there is one cosmetic for WoW players that can be earned during the event: a Treasure Nabbin' Bag back cosmetic. To claim it, players who play WoW and Diablo Immortal with the same Battle.net account simply need to log in to Diablo Immortal with a character level 10 or above to earn the Treasure Bag in WoW.

The company quietly listed the $60 gamepad <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-HORIPAD-Steam-Midnight-Black-Deck/dp/B0DLLKRFG8/?tag=theverge02-20">for preorder on Amazon</a>, with availability starting December 16th.</p></div><p>Hori originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186645/valve-steam-controller-officially-licensed-wireless-horipad-announcement-specs">released its Wireless Horipad for Steam in October</a> — but only in Japan. The controller features dedicated buttons you can use to pull up menus in Steam, whether you’re playing in Big Picture Mode, or on the company’s handheld. Just like on the Steam Deck, the gamepad comes with touch sensors on its joysticks for motion controls and mappable back buttons.</p><p>The controller can connect to your computer or Steam Deck with Bluetooth or the included USB-A Bluetooth receiver. Hori says the wireless gamepad will last up to 12 hours on a full charge, but you can plug in its USB cable in case it runs out of juice in the middle of your game. Additionally, you can remap buttons and adjust the gamepad’s stick sensitivity, gyro controls, and turbo settings from the controller menu in Steam.</p><p>Hori’s controller lacks a few features you might expect to see on a Steam-specific controller, though, including rumble packs, a headset jack, and a trackpad. Still, it seems like a decent choice if you want a controller that’s sort of like an extension of your Steam Deck. It’s just too bad Valve hasn’t revived the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">ultra-customizable Steam controller</a> it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">discontinued in 2019</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Halloween is over, and Christmas is just around the corner. With Black Friday giving gamers quite a few options of titles to buy for the Holiday season, which games are the best to play for Christmas fans?</p>



<p>Here are the best Christmas video games to play.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-christmas-games-to-play">Best Christmas Games to Play</h2>



<p>Looking for the best Christmas games to play? Luckily, there are quite a few. However, many of these games are not necessarily Christmas-themed from the get-go. Many popular titles have Holiday updates during the season, giving gamers a break from the usual worlds they love to explore. </p>



<p>So, which video games are the best for players to jump into during Christmas?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been a leader in Christmas updates. The game adds quite a few new changes to its maps that go alongside the Holiday season. A personal favorite is the Christmas lights that can be seen hung up throughout different maps.</p>



<p>The game has many other additions, though, including new game modes and more. Last year during the Modern Warfare III Christmas update, we saw a mode called “Snowfight” introduced, which allowed players to kill each other using snowballs.</p>



<p>Sounds like a blast, right? With Christmas-themed rewards and more, the Call of Duty Christmas update is a must for gamers to play and will be introduced once again this December.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite">Fortnite</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite is another game that always has an update to go along with whatever big Holiday is around the corner. With Fortnitemares, the game’s Halloween update, just ending, gamers are preparing for a unique Christmas update. </p>



<p>The game even has a “12-days-of-Christmas” event, where players can head to a log cabin where a plethora of presents will be sitting around an open fire. Every day you open up the game during the event, you will be able to open up one present. These gifts range from skins to gliders to weapon wraps and more. </p>



<p>The game usually adds quite a few Christmas-themed features onto the map, too. Snow will cover a large portion of the island, giving players the proper Christmas feel.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go">Pokemon GO</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Expect to see Pokemon GO on this list? While many have thought to believe this game is dead, the popular mobile game by Niantic is still thriving and even has a Christmas update. </p>



<p>So, what’s all included in the Holiday update? Well, last year, during the Pokemon GO Christmas event, there plenty of players playing the video game were able to capture new Pokemon that had yet to be introduced to the game. There are still a few hundred names that have yet to join the game, so we could easily see more added during Christmas this year.</p>



<p>But new Pokemon is not the only feature that comes with the game’s Christmas update. Many new variations of Pokemon will begin to appear, all wearing Christmas or Holiday-themed clothing. For instance, in the past, Pikachu wearing a Santa hat could be seen and catchable throughout the streets.</p>



<p>The game also features special raids, rewards and more during the Christmas season, so get prepared.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Want a break from shooters or walking around your city in the cold trying to catch Pokemon? Well, the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft, has a yearly Christmas event called “The Feast of Winter Veil.”</p>



<p>This event has been happening for years now and is a staple within the Warcraft community. It will even translate over to Hearthstone and other WoW-themed titles.</p>



<p>Players who jump in during the season will get various rewards from gifts under the tree. There will even be reindeer seen that players can attempt to free. </p>



<p>Not only that but there will be plenty of rewards and items to collect, including Christmas-themed cosmetics and more. And yes, you can even pick up snow and throw it as snowballs. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft is by far one of the best Christmas games to play, if you want to pay for the monthly subscription, that is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-will-you-be-playing">What Will You Be Playing?</h2>



<p>With Christmas just around the corner, what game will you be playing? Will you hop in a shooter like Black Ops 6 or Fortnite? Or will you be looking to grab a bit of exercise, roaming the streets hunting for different Pokemon? </p>



<p>Or will you and some friends be jumping into World of Warcraft, completing raids and gaining as many Christmas-themed cosmetics as possible? The possibilities are endless this winter, so enjoy the Holiday season.</p>

<p>Nintendo modified its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025 after Switch hardware and software sales dropped significantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial report</a>, Nintendo’s net sales decreased by 34.3% for the first half of the fiscal year. Operating profit dropped by 56.6%, ordinary profit decreased by 61%, and profit attributable to parent company owners decreased by 59.9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s dedicated video game platform sales dropped by 34.1 per cent year over year, and “a decline in unit sales for both Nintendo Switch hardware and software” was attributed as the cause for this fall. Mobile and IP-related businesses also saw sales decrease by 43% year over year, as income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie decreased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s gross profit declined 32.6% year-on-year. However, the gross profit margin increased by “1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 60.8%.” Additionally, SG&amp;A expenses increased by 2.2% year-on-year, and the ratio of SG&amp;A expenses to sales increased by 13.4 percentage points to 37.5% year-on-year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the fall, Nintendo has decided to revise its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025. The new estimates are 1,280.0 billion yen in net sales and 360.0 billion yen in operating profit. The ordinary and net profit forecast will not change, staying at 420.0 billion yen and 300.0 billion yen, respectively. Hence, the forecasted annual dividend will remain at 129 yen per share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo has also modified the unit sales forecast for Nintendo Switch hardware and software. The forecasted unit sales for Switch hardware have been decreased by 1 million units and software by 5 million units, with the new numbers being 12.50 million and 160.00 million units, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 146 million units</a>. However, it suffered from a 31.0% drop year-on-year in hardware (4.72 million units) and a 27.6% drop year-on-year in software (70.28 million units). Also, Nintendo stated that the plan for Switch 2’s announcement before April 2025 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unchanged</a>. What are your thoughts on Nintendo lowering its annual forecast?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has a ton of cards to collect from common collectibles to Ultra-Rare, Full art designs. Opening packs is one of the main ways to pull cards, and a long-standing rumor suggests certain boosters—”Bent Packs”—give you better luck.</p>



<p>It’s hard to quantify how much money I’ve spent on real-life Pokémon packs at this point. The buzz of opening a pack and not knowing what’s inside never gets old. Pokémon TCG Pocket digitizes the age-old hobby and converts the TCG into an easy-to-digest mobile phone format.</p>



<p>You still get to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open Pokémon packs</a> and experience the unbridled disappointment when you get a duplicate for the ninth time. A certain Bent Pack suggests you can boost your odds of getting super-rare cards from packs. Let’s see what all the fuss is about.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-do-the-corner-pack-trick-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to do the Corner Pack Trick in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Every trick in the book. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Corner Pack Trick—otherwise known as the Bent Pack—in Pokémon TCG Pocket, is looking through the carousel of packs, and when you come to make your choice, <strong>you turn the pack to its side</strong> and identify a certain shape of pack <strong>noticeably bent in one (if not both) of the corners.</strong></p>



<p>To be honest, I don’t where this theory started, I don’t know who came up with it, but it’s pretty cool nonetheless. I use my own superstitions when opening packs from spinning the packs around in a full circle to opening the pack from the right-hand side instead of the left side.</p>



<p>But if you look closely at the carousel and thoroughly investigate each pack, I can confirm you can see one of these bent packs from time to time. But does it actually mean anything?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-corner-pack-trick-work-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Does the Corner Pack Trick work in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>No science or logic proves the bent pack works in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong>, and after checking this out myself, I would conclusively say the <strong>corner pack is nothing but a myth</strong>—albeit a fun one to distract yourself!</p>



<p>Firstly, if you go onto the packs section of Pokémon TCG Pocket, the game has a button in the bottom-left corner saying “Offering Rates.” This is in line with <strong>regulations concerning loot boxes and gambling</strong> to protect you, and let you know the odds of getting each card, the rarity of a pack, and what you can pull—especially if you’re spending real money.</p>



<p>A bent pack might sound cool on paper, but it would be deceitful; players in the know would automatically gain an advantage over other players, and it would be a legal issue. Furthermore, I’ve tried these corner-trick packs, and there’s no obvious difference between them and opening a regular pack.</p>



<p>You can check out YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@spragelsPocket" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spragels Pocket</a> if you need a visual clue for the bent pack.</p>

<p>If you need a fresh way of opening packs, knock yourself out and hoard all the bent packs you can get your hands on.</p>

This year's N7 Day - the annual celebration of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> held on 7th November - will be a "quieter" one than usual, developer BioWare has said. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on X, BioWare has told fans that N7 Day 2024 will still host "a little fun", but its attention was currently still focused on last week's big launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. 
</p>
<p>
Past years have seen BioWare release a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mass-effect-teaser-shows-series-will-return-to-milky-way">trailer</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-teaser-image-revealed-and-analysed">concept art</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">audio snippets</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">logos</a> for the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> - now the studio's next project.

Details of Mass Effect 5 remain thin on the ground, though we know it will see a return to the series' home turf of the Milky Way galaxy, and pick up the action several hundred years after the conclusion of the original trilogy.

The studio hasn’t released full patch notes, but it has confirmed the update will address a bug that broke my heart as a long-time fan of the series who had been waiting for this game for ten years.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Unfortunately, there was a bug that made their custom appearance revert back to one of the default settings found in the character creator when starting the game. Folks, it was a massive bummer to get to some of those big story moments and not see my old hero as he should look. But hopefully this patch will rectify that issue so no one else has to deal with that when they reach the ending. The short list of some of the patch notes includes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>- Fixed an issue where some customizations were not applied to the Inquisitor correctly in one scene.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>- Fixed an issue where DLSS options could end up “grayed-out” on a 40-series Nvidia GPU. (PC only)</p><p>- Fixed an issue that caused Companion Skill Points to reset.</p></blockquote><p>Overall, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-tips-faction-inquisition-romance-1851685483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-tips-faction-inquisition-romance-1851685483"><em>The Veilguard </em>was a mostly polished experience</a></span> on my end, devoid of the typical BioWare jank. By the time I got to the ending and saw some stranger posing as my Inquisitor, I was taken aback by such a cataclysmic bug rearing its head after nearly 60 hours. So I’m happy to see the team get this fix out so quickly.

Isn’t it just for kids? Aren’t you supposed to be playing <em>PUGB</em> instead? No! Because as nauseating as the infinite merch and all-pervading presence of the game may seem, it’s actually a <em>really </em>fun multiplayer shooter. And given it’s free, it’s still worth a look. But ho boy, seven years of development has piled up into one ridiculous mess of a lobby screen, making even just finding the core game a bemusing exercise. So, let us guide you through the madness.</p><p>Starting <em>Fornite</em> is, in itself, deeply confusing. Once you’ve created an account, you’ll be faced with a ludicrous wall of game modes before realizing there are multiple tabs to look through, piles upon piles of quest types, ongoing storylines, and a Battle Pas–and that’s all before you’ve figured out how to just start a game of vanilla <em>Fortnite</em>. On top of that, if you want to unlock a skin, you’ll either need to complete a quest or purchase them. That’s not even mentioning the game’s weapon color system. But don’t worry because this guide will break down everything you need to know about playing <em>Fortnite</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-recommend-id="image://96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-recommend-id="image://96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When loading into <em>Fortnite</em>, you’ll automatically be in the “<strong>Play</strong>” section. This is where you can select various game modes to play. The majority of the modes are fan-made and can be played with friends. But if you want to play the vanilla <em>Fortnite</em> or other official Epic modes, you’ll need to scroll down until you see “<strong>By Epic</strong>.” From there, you should see all of the official Epic Game game modes that <em>Fortnite </em>is known for alongside the studio’s logo on the thumbnail.</p><p>Once you’re here, you’ll see modes such as “Ranked Reloaded, Ranked X Trials,” and much more. The Ranked modes are lobbies usually meant for people looking for more of a challenge. Most of these people are looking for other high-skill players to improve their rank on the <em>Fortnite</em> leaderboards.<br></p><p>If you’re looking for a more casual game, keep scrolling until you land on the Battle Royale mode, AKA vanilla <em>Fortnite</em>. This is the type of game that <em>Fortnite </em>is mainly known for. The rules for this mode are simple: The last one standing wins. From here, you can pick between two types of Battle Royale: Build and Zero Build.<br></p><p>If you’re looking for a faster Battle Royale, you can always play Reloaded. Like the normal mode, this can also be played in Build or Zero Build. However, it’s worth pointing out that this mode significantly differs from the normal BR mode. The map is much smaller and takes inspiration from OG <em>Fortnite</em>. When players die, they can respawn as long as the feature is enabled and their teammates are still alive. If this sounds a bit familiar to you, it’s because this is Epic’s version of <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> Rebirth Island mode. The games usually play a lot quicker and can be more intense. So, don’t jump in expecting a slow game.<br></p><p>To change lanes a bit, there’s <em>Lego Fortnite</em>, which is like an entirely different game. In a nutshell, this is Epic’s version of <em>Minecraft</em> and other survival games. There is a bit of a story to it, but the main goal is to build a base and survive for as long as possible. This is a third-person mode in which you’ll go toe-to-toe with various fantasy beasts and monsters.<br></p><p>In the vein of shaking things up, there’s also a mode called Rocket Racing. As the name suggests, this is a mode in which you and other players race against one another. The rules are fairly simple: be the first one to cross the finish line, and you’ll win. Think of this mode as Fortnite Mario Kart, if that helps.<br></p><p>The last big mode is Fortnite Festival. This mode allows you and other players to play licensed music from artists such as Lady Gaga, The Weeknd, and even Fortnite original songs. This is a rhythm-based mode in which you’ll be tasked with pressing the right buttons as they appear. There are two types of Festival modes you can play. The first is the Main Stage. This is where you all work together and jam out to get the highest score. The other is Battle Stage, where you’ll compete against one another to see who gets the highest score.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-recommend-id="image://f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-recommend-id="image://f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Build and Zero Build play similarly, but each mode has a few significant differences. Players must destroy structures around the island in Build to get building supplies. They can farm and build from three different structures: wood, brick, and metal.</p><p>Wood structures build the fastest but have the least health. Brick takes a bit longer to build and has a decent amount of HP. Metal takes the longest to build but it has the most HP out of all three materials.<br></p><p>When playing Zero Build, you won’t have the option to do that. To combat this, players have an additional 50 overshield that automatically refills itself up. So, players can potentially have up to 150 shields throughout the match.<br></p><p>Other than that, both Build and Zero Build play the same.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-recommend-id="image://154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-recommend-id="image://154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you play the game, you’ll unlock various items such as Back Bling, Gliders, and sometimes Skins. To equip these, you’ll need to be in the main menu once more and scroll over to the “<strong>Locker</strong>” section.</p><p>You can change various aspects of your character. So, if you unlocked a Back Bling and think it’ll be nice on Peely, you can mix and match it all you want. On top of that, you’ll be able to change up the Glider, which you use at the beginning of the game, to land. You can also change your contrail, which is the ora you see as you descend from the bus.<br></p><p>That’s not the only thing you can switch up. On top of unlocking cosmetic items, you can do the same with emotes. To do this, scroll down one tab in the Locker section, and you’ll be able to equip up to <strong>seven </strong>at a time.<br></p><p>If you want to change the skin of your gun, you can change it by looking at the “<strong>Wrap</strong>” section. Just like character skins, these vary from wrap to wrap. Some are more colorful and dynamic than others. These don’t give you any special edge, as they just personalize your current gun.<br></p><p>The last main thing you can personalize is how your car looks in-game. Like everything else mentioned in this section, they don’t give you any kind of edge. They just make you look cool.<br></p><p>Occasionally, Epic will allow players to unlock free car skins, but most of the time, they’ll have to purchase them with real-world money using V-Bucks. The car skins can range from cool-looking generic ones to real-world cars such as the BMW. You’ll also be able to change how the car rims look, smoke, and even boost.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-recommend-id="image://225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-recommend-id="image://225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s always good to go into a game to complete a quest. These quests vary based on which game mode you’re playing. So, make sure the quests are compatible with the standard BR mode if you’re jumping into a BR game. Most of the time, these quests will reward you with XP, and you’ll unlock more cosmetic items on special occasions.</p><p>It’s also worth pointing out that there are story-based quests players can complete. As the name suggests, these tell the story of what’s happening in the current BR season. These are worth doing because they trigger audio clips and reward you with many XP.<br></p><p>If you have a particular quest you want to complete before jumping into a game, you can track it. To do this, go to the specific quest you want to do and press “<strong>Track Quest.</strong>” When you load into a game, it’ll be highlighted for you and guide you through what you must do.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-recommend-id="image://01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-recommend-id="image://01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While playing <em>Fortnite</em>, you’ll notice that guns and items will have a specific color to them. This is extremely important because the color tells you much about the weapon at face value. For instance, whenever you’re rebooted back into a lobby, you’ll spawn in with a grey pistol, which isn’t the best because grey is the lowest-ranking color. </p><p>Below is a list of every weapon color, alongside its rank.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Grey - Common</li><li>Green - Uncommon</li><li>Blue - Rare</li><li>Purple - Epic</li><li>Orange - Legendary </li><li>Gold - Mythic</li><li>Cyan - Exotic</li></ul><p>One thing worth mentioning is that Epic often changes its mind about adding exotic weapons.

For example, if the bus is flying from Sandy Steppes to Castle Doom, you’ll want to avoid places like The Raft, Reckless Railways, and Restored Reels because they’re all within the immediate area.</p><p>Instead, you’ll want to land at places like Brawler’s Battleground or Rebel’s Roost. The further, the better. Because more often than not, most players won’t bother to land that far off from the bus route. Since you’ll be landing at a named land, the odds of finding good gear are incredibly high, and if you’re one of a handful of people there, you could loot up the entire area before anyone else.<br></p><p>If you do this, you should be able to at least survive the initial drop and get some good items along the way. It’ll also give you some time to experiment with guns so you can decide which ones you like.<br></p><p>We recommend always having at least one to two healing items at all times. Because you never want to be in a situation where you’re low on HP and die immediately in a fight.<br></p></div></div><div><p>Now that you have a solid load out, you’ll need to keep things going. There’s nothing worse than getting a bunch of kills just to die immediately. Finding a car is a good rule of thumb for long-term survival. These offer protection and allow you to travel across the map with ease. Plus, there are plenty of gas stations across the island. These let you refill your tank and recover from whatever damage it took.</p><p>You’ll also want to keep an ear out for other players fighting. The second you hear shots, get there as quickly as you can. More often than not, both players will be on the verge of death, and this is a fast way to earn an easy double kill or single kill. But be warned, you’re probably not the only person doing that. (This is also great if you’re in the final circle, too)<br></p><p>In <em>Fortnite</em>’s current season (Chapter 5 Season 4), vaults will open as the storm closes. These vaults will always have good loot, and on top of that, each one has a workbench that allows you to modify your gun. Those mods will make all the difference in a fight and can carry you to a victory royale. The catch is that the lobby will be notified when a vault opens up, so it’s a high-risk reward.<br></p><p>We also suggest you avoid Loot Island. It’ll always spawn mid to late-game. If you capture it, you’ll be rewarded with top-notch items. But the thing is, most of the lobby will be going there, and more often than not, the best players in the lobby would like to capture it. We don’t recommend going to the island unless you’re willing to risk it for the biscuit.<br></p><p>There you have it! Our ultimate guide on how to play Fortnite. Hopefully, this made things a bit more digestible for you to understand and made it easier to survive until the late stages of a Battle Royale match.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>N7 Day 2024, the annual celebration of the Mass Effect franchise, is just days away. And while fans are usually excited about any potential announcements from BioWare, the studio is warning people to keep their expectations low this year.</p>



<p>“We hope everyone is enjoying their time in Dragon Age: The Veilguard,” the studio wrote on <a href="https://x.com/bioware/status/1853552873138720920">social media</a>. “It’s only a few days until N7 Day and this year will be quieter because of launch. Be sure to check back then for a little fun, though!”</p>







<p>N7 Day 2024 will be the 13th held by the studio. It began in 2012 and is named based on the N7 designation held by Commander Shepard.</p>



<p>As far as the future of Mass Effect, the next game in the franchise is currently in development at BioWare. The game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-5-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly being worked on</a> by “trilogy vets”. It’s unknown, however, where development sits and when a release date could come. If you need a Mass Effect fix in the mean time, a board game based on the franchise was recently released.</p>



<p>What do you think will be revealed, if anything, at N7 Day 2024? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> battles are already being dominated by two decks in particular: the usual suspects of Charizard and Mewtwo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The streamlined mobile version of the beloved TCG arrived in late October and its meta already appears formed, with most players bringing a Charizard ex or Mewtwo ex deck into the more competitive battle mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Pokémon TCG usually comes down to more than just raw power, both of these decks are admittedly about hitting hard. Charizard ex has a 200 damage attack, for example, which is enough to knock out any other Pokémon in the game, and Mewtwo has an also very strong 150 damage attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a downside to these, of course, as they each cost four energy and lose two energy per attack. This means, in theory, it takes two turns before the attack can be used again, but both of these decks also have reliable energy generation that allows players to speed that process up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/char-1730822552313.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex are dominating the Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket meta.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex is a fire card, so this deck can also bring in Moltres ex. For just one energy, Moltres ex lets the player flip three coins and add a fire energy to a bench Pokémon for every heads, and its 140 hit points as a basic Pokémon allows it to stick around for a long time while charging up a Charmander, Charmeleon, and eventually Charizard on the bench.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that, by the time the opposing player forces Moltres ex out of the active Pokémon slot, there is often a Charizard ready to go with upwards of six energy attached, allowing it to essentially wipe out whatever is put across from it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo works in a similar way, though as a basic Pokémon itself, players will often put it directly into the active Pokémon slot. It also has a two energy, 50 damage attack and 150 hit points to keep it around and doing damage, meaning players have enough time to set up a Gardevoir on the bench.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Stage 2 Pokémon takes some time to set up, with Ralts and Kirlia coming before it, but once it's on the bench, players can use its Psy Shadow ability to add one energy to the active Pokémon. This again counters the discard two energy cost of Mewtwo's 150 damage attack, as the standard energy joins the Gardevoir energy each turn to add two at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's rare to see a deck that isn't one of these two in the more competitive battle mode, though one led by Pikachu ex and another led by Starmie ex appear to be just a tier below these two. Both present quick ex Pokémon with high damage, low cost attacks, meaning if players can deploy them quick enough it's hard for opponents to build a strong board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October on iOS and Android as a digital version of the beloved trading card game. It lets players open packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collect cards</a>, build decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battle others</a>, a simple formula that has already proved popular given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">it made $12 million in just four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also hitting fast and hard with events, and players can perhaps test out these two heavy hitting decks in its latest. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">The Lapras ex Drop Event adds a new category in the Solo Battle menu</a> that lets players take on four increasingly difficult Lapras decks with a chance of winning a special booster pack after each, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">which can include the brand new Lapras ex</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/persona-series-reaches-23-5-million-copies-sold-worldwide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the previous sales milestone for Persona in March 2024, the series has gone on to sell a whopping 23.5 million copies across the globe, with the sales including both physical and digital. In March, it was reported that the Persona series had sold 22.6 million copies. This was announced shortly after the release of Persona 3 Reload, which sold more than one million copies in less than a week. The Persona series is continuing to expand and become more popular, as it was once considered a niche series. However, as announced in <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/library/printing_annual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sega's Annual Integrated Report</a> for 2024, the report now includes the updated cumulative sales for the most notable IPs for Sega. This, of course, included Persona.</p>
<p>In this report, Sega says that the fast sales growth for both the Persona and Like a Dragon franchise can be attributed to the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-annual-franchise/">the games</a> were released on multiple platforms, as well as simultaneous worldwide releases. Not only that but remasters and spin-off titles have helped the franchises exponentially. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, as for most gamers, Persona 5 and the other Persona 5 spin-offs really helped bring the franchise to the forefront and introduced people to the series as a whole.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the Persona 5 series alone sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Again, this is a statement that doesn't come as much of a surprise, especially considering how many games are in the Persona 5 series alone. In total, there are five titles in the Persona 5 series, with another game called Persona 5: The Phantom X due to be released in the near future. The Open Beta for this title began in April 2024, but there haven't been too many updates since then. Compared to the other games in the Persona 5 franchise, this one won't be as much of a mainstay as others, as only some of the original staff from the first Persona 5 game are working on this game, and it's marketed as a gacha game for the most part.</p>
<p>This year also saw the release of Persona 3 Reload, and then ATLUS branched out and created Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is a game that has a similar art style to that of Persona and has also done significantly well. Whether we'll see remakes of the original Persona games that started off the franchise remains to be seen, as we've seen some of the older games get ported to other platforms, like Persona 4 Golden, which was released last year.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like this franchise is going to continue to be massively successful for Sega and Atlus.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-generation-zero-update-will-be-its-last.1028046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-generation-zero-update-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Systemic Reaction has announced that the next major&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>update will serve as the game's final major content drop.</p>

<p>The Showdown Update currently doesn't have a release date, but Systemic Reaction describes it as&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s "last hurrah", promising that it will conclude the story arc that's been running throughout the game's "main missions and in-game lore".</p>

<p>The update will take you to "a new area that you haven't been to before", and Systemic Reaction is promising that while it's not quite as big as some of the game's other areas, it will give the studio "the space needed to tell the last part of our story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/generation-zero-update-last-screens.jpg?itok=oz6nXfUl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/generation-zero-update-last-screens.jpg?itok=rqFjR_KA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This mysterious teaser image is pretty much all we know about the Showdown Update right now.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've not yet gathered all of&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s Soviet Nesting Dolls collectibles and you haven't caught up on "the attached lore" yet, Systemic Reaction recommends you do so prior to the Showdown Update's arrival.</p>

<p>As well as the story coming to a head, Systemic Reaction is also promising that the update will add new Experimental weapons, and it'll also remove the skill point cap, allowing you to "unlock all skill upgrades and complete the endgame experience".</p>

<p>New cosmetics are also on the way, as well as a host of quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes that are the bread and butter of any self-respecting game update.</p>

<p>Although you won't need&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s&nbsp;<em>FNIX Rising&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alpine Unrest&nbsp;</em>expansions to enjoy the Showdown Update, Systemic Reaction does recommend them for "more context".</p>

<p>The game launched in 2019 and received numerous updates over the course of its life, adding features like a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-shooter-generation-zero-is-getting-photo-mode-next-week">photo mode</a>, destructible <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/generation-zero-update-lets-you-storm-fully-destructible-bases">bases</a>, and even a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/generation-zero-companion-update">cute little robot friend</a> to keep you company on your travels.</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704270/Generation_Zero/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/generation-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/generation-zero/C20WW4W29FQ1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and it's also playable on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility. The game will remain online, so even though it won't be getting more updates, it'll still be playable.</p>

            <p>The trailer for Bambas! starts off innocently enough. It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them. </p>

<p>The final 30 seconds of the trailer are an appalling display of sneakers kicking cars to death, flip-flops stamping on defenceless sandcastles, and stilettos flagrantly holding up traffic at zebra crossings. It's just as well the video is only a minute long, because the escalation curve is clear. If this were a four minute gameplay overview, the last third would consist of shoes vindictively toeing the Declaration Of Independence, or nudging lost kittens into jet engines.</p>
<p>Bambas! - yes, the exclamation mark is part of the title - is the work of Villena, Spain-based Devilish Games, who say it isn't just a game but "a tribute to urban culture". You can find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3274390/Bambas/">Steam</a>. Come release day in 2025, the game will "break stereotypes with its non-linear narrative and environmental storytelling, where stories unfold around every corner". You will "discover hidden spots that hold secrets and characters that will lead you down unexpected paths".</p><p>The game's setting is "a vibrant, detailed Mediterranean coastal city where creativity rules and exploration is your passport to fun", a place of Jet Set Radio-ish abandon where "you'll need to navigate crosswalks, kick cans, balance on curbs, and pull off impossible jumps to complete hundreds of challenges". It all looks and sounds very jolly - far from the Qwoppy puzzler I was half-expecting from the press release, and more in keeping with the mayhem of Untitled Goose Game.</p>
<p>Complete those challenges, and you'll unlock "countless" shoes. I've never been a shoe collector, myself - I've never had the budget for it, but also, I don't have the imagination. Any shoes I own are doomed to be worn everyday from dawn till dusk until they lose all form and colour and become muddy teatowels, wrapped around my feet.</p>
<p>It occurs to me, after watching the trailer for Bambas!, that my shoes might resent this treatment, and wish to be free of me. I am looking at my current trainers as I type this, and wondering what they'd do if I were... out of the picture. Readers, I am telling you this because I fear to utter the words aloud: <em>it is possible that my shoes are conspiring against me</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/binding-of-isaac-online-co-op-mode-10th-anniversary-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/binding-of-isaac-is-getting-an-online-co-op-mode-as-part-of-the-10th-anniversary-update.1028037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/binding-of-isaac-online-co-op-mode-10th-anniversary-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to the latest announcement by Binding of Isaac creator <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edmund McMillen</a>, the title will receive a full online co-op mode, including completion markers for its 10th-anniversary update. The online co-op mode is scheduled to arrive on November 18, 2024. The game will also receive a ‘considerable balance update’, which will look towards buffing items the community has found to be “lacklustre/bad”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binding of Isaac is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a massive 50% discount on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and discounts on all DLCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edmund McMillen and Nicalis, Inc. developed Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which was released in 2014. It is an action RPG shooter with a heavy focus on rogue-like elements. Players follow Isaac’s journey as he battles gangs of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, fears, and eventually his mother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game features shooter gameplay in randomly generated environments.

        <p>Filled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du Reve.

                <p>Now that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-launches-on-console-patch-notes-include-thrills-chills-and-cross-play/1100-6527468/" data-ref-id="1100-6527468">out on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>, the developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/" data-ref-id="5000-509328">Phasmophobia</a> have spoken about what's next for the co-op ghost-hunting game. One thing you can expect <em>not </em>to see is a crossover with famous IP like Ghostbusters, as the developers currently don't have plans to add licensed content.</p><p>"I think it's something we’ve seen from the community, whether you look at the Discord, at the Reddit, at the socials, people are talking about it, asking for that kind of stuff,” Phasmophobia marketing manager Asim Tanvir said to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/phasmophobia-devs-on-licensed-ip-dlc-no-ghostbusters/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>. "Again, it's about the demand from the playerbase, the community, for that, and it's about whether it falls in line with our vision for the game as well. We don’t want to put--for example--the actual Ghostbusters in the game. It just wouldn’t make sense.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> From the Rift is the upcoming season of the battle-royale and it launches on Tuesday 5th November - yes, you read that right, it's out today! So, you really don't have long to wait to get your hands on the new and revamped Lifeline, Launch Royale, plus all the other goodies being added to round off 2024.</p>
<p>As recently announced on <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1853784986689622333">Apex Legends official X account</a>, this season will be home to Launch Royale - a brand new mode that lets you turn back time and set foot in the very beginning of Apex Legends, with the original Legends and weapons on offer to give you the original Apex experience.</p>
<p>That's just the first of many things to look forward to this season - up next is the remixed and revived Lifeline. The combat medic not only has a very literal new look with a robotic arm (with currently unknown origins), but all of her abilities are now different, too - redesigned to give better reset opportunities for any squad that contains her.</p>
<p>Lifeline's Passive still contains combat revive but it's been expanded, so now she can also grab onto D.O.C and glide mid-air for a short period of time until fuel runs out. You can let go of and grab D.O.C as much as you want during gliding, as long as there's fuel - which replenishes the moment you touch the ground. Weapons cannot be drawn while gliding, however.</p><p>D.O.C is still Lifeline's Tactical but the little drone now has more mobility. Instead of hovering in place, he'll now follow an ally he's assigned to while healing them and any allies in the surrounding area. Lifeline can call him back to her or reassign D.O.C to another teammate at any time.</p>
<p>Now, onto the biggest change, Lifeline's Ultimate says goodbye to the Care Package! In its place will now be D.O.C's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, a ring-shaped shield that's impervious to damage. Lifeline's squad can enter and exit the shield as they like, but there's no strafing if the ring is deployed inside a building or outside - it's the same wherever it's deployed. However, the halo is stationary and without a roof there's a vulnerability to attacks from above so watch your back.</p>

<p>Lifeline isn't the only Legend getting some love in Season 23. Gibraltar is getting a massive cooldown reduction on his dome from 30 seconds to just 17 seconds alongside two other upgrades. Newcastle's mobile shield will no longer take damage and it can now be controlled while downed, as well as Wattson being able to tap into the revive expert perk as a chooseable upgrade. At a recent press event, it was also teased that Loba and Mirage will see big changes this season but, at the time of writing, these are still to be revealed.</p><p>All Support class legends are seeing some boosts this season too, with class perks to help them excel in revival and recovery. Supports won't be slowed down while healing and small meds will heal double the normal amount. Also, this class will be able to revive allies 25 percent faster than before, with health regen granted to revived players and mobile spawn beacons in teammate's death boxes as well as at crafting beacons. To counter all that, Supports no longer have the unique ability to craft squad banners.</p>
<p>On the subject of Legends, the Apex Legends team has made clear it's aware of the issues with Crypto and his Off The Grid ability, but has assured there are changes coming to fix these issues at the start of the season and Off The Grid will be staying for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Now, let's move on to the new loot type being added in From the Rift - Rift Relics. These are new and exceptional pieces of loot - and something to look out for. When lightning strikes the ground from cosmic rifts in the skies above, you should follow the beam of light to find new high-level loot. These loot items are different from anything else found on the ground across the maps in terms of sheer power and functionality, and there's even some items that will be familiar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> fans. One such item is the EPG-1, marked as possibly the biggest and most powerful Rift Relic Weapon.</p>

<p>There's a new category of item being added as part of this, called Boost Kits. These add passive or active abilities to your Legend when you find them. For example, The Hover Boost Kit will let you hover in the air while aiming.</p><p>We've learned there are more than 25 Rift Reflics available in the loot pool, which will be added gradually across the season. Getting your hands on any of these relics can dramatically turn the tables of who is winning in a match - so it's worth battling it out to find them before someone else does. These new and intriguing loot items will be available across PUBS, as well as the limited-time Trios Revival and Straightshot Revival modes this season.</p>

<p>Weapon update time, and first of all the HAVOC is going into the care package with the Select Fire Beamshot attached. As one goes in, another comes out so the Devotion is returning to the floor without the Turbo Charge but it has received multiple baseline buffs to compensate. The Sentinel and Rampage have had their charge capacity increased, the Longbow and Spitfire have had damage buffs, as well as the L-Star now dealing extra damage with the P2020 Akimbos getting a hip fire accuracy increase.</p>
<p>A new universal melee weapon has been added, the Karambit. Also called Raptor's Claw, its design and animations won't be the same for each Legend. Every character will have their personalities reflected by this weapon if they use it and it will be available at the launch of From the Rift.</p>

<p>Ranked has had some tweaks that are said to be laying the foundations for bigger updates coming in the future. A new visualisation tool will be introduced in ranked lobbies so you can see the distribution of ranks in the one you're in. It's a bar at the bottom of the screen that shows you what rank players are in the lobby and how many of that rank are. There is a plan to add this mechanic to other modes in future seasons.</p><p>The entry cost for platinum, diamond and master ranks will be reduced and new ranked rewards are actively being worked on to replace the removed dive trail rewards, but it's worth knowing they're likely coming in the near future instead of this season.</p>
<p>Apex Legends' team told us that working on anti-cheat is its top priority. The developer is working hard behind the scenes to continuously improve anti-cheat and working with more anti-cheat tools to ensure that the matches remain fair in such a competitive game.</p>
<p>Apex Legends From the Rift will launch on Tuesday 5th November 2024 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p>
