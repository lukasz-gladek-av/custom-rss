            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Earlier this month, Junghun Lee — CEO of Nexon, the parent company behind current live-service shooter du jour <em>Arc Raiders</em> — <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">made waves in the game development community with a straightforward statement</a>. “It’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” he explained. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ai-in-game-development-strange-scaffold/">Indie developers were quick to loudly and vociferously call bullshit</a>. “It’s just not true,” Alex Kanaris-Sotiriou, cofounder of <em>Röki </em>and<em> Mythwrecked </em>developer <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/">Polygon Treehouse</a>, tells<em> The Verge</em>.</p></div><p>As similar reactions poured in over social media, many developers shared that avoiding generative AI was not only a matter of personal pride, but also a matter of professional marketing — one that developers are leveraging to let their players know their games were made by humans.</p><p>For Kanaris-Sotiriou, the question of adopting the use of gen AI to make games was an easy one to answer. “The foundations that it’s built upon, the idea of using other people’s work without permission to generate artwork [...] are unfair,” he says.</p><p>Lee’s comments are just the latest in a string of <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/playstation-boss-ai-used-all-aspects-game-development/">notable gaming CEOs</a> declaring that <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-boss-argues-arc-raiders-ai-use-actually-makes-gaming-better-and-that-people-jump-to-extreme-takes-about-the-tech-surely-theres-a-middle-ground-here/">gen AI is the future of the medium</a>. But Kanaris-Sotiriou, along with many of his game development peers, wanted to push back against this assertion. So earlier this year they collaborated on a solution — a simple image file of <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/no-gen-ai-seal">a golden cog-shaped seal</a> that declares, “This developer assures that no gen AI was used in this indie game.”</p><div><p>They made the image (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kanaratron.bsky.social/post/3li7u4xsjrc2l">which Kanaris-Sotiriou tweaked</a> to ensure it didn’t too closely resemble <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Official_Nintendo_Seal">a more famous seal of approval</a>) freely available for any studio to use in their marketing materials, websites, or game pages. While Kanaris-Sotiriou doesn’t have hard numbers on its use, the seal shows up on the store pages for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1226670%2FRosewater%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Rosewater</em></a>, <em>Astral Ascent</em>, <em>Quarterstaff</em>, and more. In the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kanaratron.bsky.social/post/3li7t5wpc7s2l">Bluesky thread announcing the seal’s creation</a>, multiple indie developers shared that they put it on their Itch.io pages and on Steam, where it serves as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032678/valve-steam-generative-ai-rules-disclosure-pre-generated-live-illegal-content-copyright">antithesis to the platform’s gen AI disclosure rules.</a></p></div><p>Other developers are adopting their own bespoke solutions that act both as an informative statement against gen AI and a philosophical one.</p><p><em>“</em>Absolutely everything in Unbeatable was created by human beings without any generative assistance<em>,” </em>reads a graphic <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dcellgames.com/post/3m5g2ktw6rc22">posted by D-Cell Games</a> on Bluesky about its upcoming game <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2240620%2FUNBEATABLE%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Unbeatable</em></a>. The image was created specifically in response to Lee’s comments.<em> “</em>Every frame drawn, every word written, every model sculpted, every line of code typed, every song sung with a real voice, every guitar played with a real hand, every moment flawed and messy because we are, also<em>.”</em></p><p>Where other developers have taken a simple declarative approach against gen AI, the passion in D-Cell’s statement is apparent and it reads almost like a challenge to those who use the tools. “Ignoring all of the ethical, moral, and legal concerns of using generative AI, it’s a huge waste of effort,” says Jeffrey Chiao, studio producer at D-Cell Games, in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. “We can produce results that meet our quality standards without its assistance.”</p><div><p>Gen AI enthusiasts see the technology as a way to unlock hidden creative potential, and to many it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/694531/runway-ai-video-games-generate">a tool to speed up the time-consuming and costly processes</a> inherent to video game production. Some of the biggest companies are taking advantage of that; EA has announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805777/ea-stability-ai-transformative-game-development-tools">a partnership with Stability AI</a>, for instance, while Microsoft is using AI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">to generate gameplay</a>.</p></div><div><p>Ubisoft in particular has had a lot to say about gen AI, with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results">CEO Yves Guillemot calling it</a> “as big [of] a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D” in a recent earnings call. Players can converse with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105748/nvidia-neo-npc-prototypes-gdc-2024">Ubisoft’s gen AI-powered Neo NPCs</a> while the company’s Ghostwriter tool <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/7Cm07zbBGy4Xml6WgYi25d/the-convergence-of-ai-and-creativity-introducing-ghostwriter">generates short snippets of dialogue called barks</a>. <em>Subnautica 2</em> and <em>PUBG</em> publisher Krafton <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-weeks-after-declaring-its-ai-first-company-future/">suggested its employees voluntarily resign</a> if they can’t abide by the company’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">“AI-first” reorganization</a>. Meanwhile, gen AI assets are showing up in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618822/activision-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ai-generated-content"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> (and again in <em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-responds-to-complaints-of-ai-generated-assets-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a></em>), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-replace-ai-art-found-in-anno-117-pax-romana/1100-6536293/"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695243/we-totally-used-gen-ai-but-you-werent-supposed-to-notice"><em>The Alters</em></a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/10/29/the-finals-is-using-ai-voicework-and-it-is-bad/"><em>The Finals</em></a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2025/03/13/the-sims-4-rival-inzoi-brings-chatgpt-style-ai-characters/"><em>InZoi</em>,</a> and more.</p></div><p>Video game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24009903/the-cost-of-aaa-development-is-too-damn-high">development budgets are ballooning</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/816005/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta-g-delayed-november-2026">games are taking longer to release</a>. A tool that can help get games to market quicker and cheaper is an attractive proposition — especially in the indie space, where <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-16/video-game-makers-turn-back-to-kickstarter-in-tough-funding-climate">investment has significantly dried up</a> and smaller teams require developers to do multiple jobs. And while generative AI is being used across all levels of the industry (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91152298/nintendo-pledges-its-games-will-be-made-by-humans">with notable exceptions</a>), the loudest pushback is coming from the space that ostensibly stands to benefit from it the most. “Constraints we face as indies inspire us to develop with really creative solutions,” Kanaris-Sotiriou says.</p><div><p>“Constraints we face as indies inspire us to develop with really creative solutions.”</p></div><p>Tom Eastman, president of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2870530%2FBattle_Suit_Aces%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Battle Suit Aces</em></a> developer Trinket Studios, echoes that sentiment. He says that the problems <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/">gen AI purportedly solves</a> are the very things that make game development so rewarding. He spoke about how, in the final days of working on the studio’s previous title, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battle-chef-brigade-helps-me-navigate-a-complicated-rel-1844340900"><em>Battle Chef Brigade</em></a>, several key locations in the game didn’t have finished art. Rather than go through the process of creating the hand-drawn line art that dominates the game’s aesthetic, the team decided to use less time-consuming watercolors instead. “Those are the interesting creative decisions that are fun to work through, instead of ‘please magic box solve my problems.’”</p><p>The developers I spoke to acknowledged that as gen AI technology improves, there will be more pressure to use it. And while it’s difficult to pin down with hard numbers, they also see how their official anti-gen-AI declarations have resonated with their players and communities. “It’s almost definitely going to be all around us at this current rate, but I think the things people want in our works aren’t going to change because of it,” says Chiao. “So we’ll hold on our own and continue doing things our way — it’s more fun that way.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
               <p><span>This past summer, kids turned to </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span> to protest the aggressive, violent escalation of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. Now, activists are using both </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V </span></i><span>roleplay to educate gamers on how to handle an IRL ICE raid.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As reported by both </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-defense-training-on-fortnite-new-save-collective/"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/activists-are-using-fortnite-to-fight-back-against-ice/"><i><span>WIRED</span></i></a><span>, a global gamer group called New Save Collective has been organizing special events in video games that mimic real-world ICE raids to help raise awareness and educate players about their rights. On November 20, the collective organized a </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span> event, which took place in the </span><i><span>GTA Online</span></i><span> RP servers and featured masked ICE agents stopping players and demanding they show identification.</span></p>

 <p><span>On November 21, New Save Collective held a related event in the currently</span><i><span> Simpsons</span></i><span>-themed </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, specifically in the “Delulu” mode, the only one that features proximity chat. It allowed players to meet each other in-game before practicing what to do if ICE approaches them in a real-life scenario. The role-playing event featured agents played by the Collective (which has recently partnered with other immigration advocacy groups like Immigrants Belong and Define American) attempting to detain and/or question “vulnerable” civilians, their chosen term for people most often targeted by ICE raids.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In clips shared with </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span>, the agents reportedly urged other players, who were not the target of their search, to leave. “This does not concern you,” one said. A person responded with, “We’re allowed to record,” while the group of “civilians” closed in on the two agents, who were standing on top of a golf cart. The agents decide to “abandon the vehicle” and leave, during which a player yells, “Yeah, I threw a pizza at you!”</span></p>

 <p><span>Obviously, this is nothing like how an ICE raid goes in the real world, but that’s the point—to allow gamers a chance to role-play what could be a very scary situation with relatively low stakes. An organizer told </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span> that the goal of the space was less training for a potential ICE raid and more “to organize a community and build trust.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Both ICE and the White House have repeatedly co-opted gaming to both promote their anti-immigrant propaganda and serve as potential recruitment spaces. The most recent example happened last month when </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/29/why-trumps-white-house-is-using-video-game-memes-to-recruit-for-ice"><span>official government Twitter accounts shared AI-generated images</span></a><span> of Trump as </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>’s Master Chief and calls to “stop the Flood.” It’s heartening to see New Save Collective try and steal back some digital space from the alt-right. The “culture change organization” dedicated to humanizing immigrants,&nbsp; Define American, told </span><i><span>Wired </span></i><span>that, “Gaming wasn’t kind of a random genre that we chose. We’ve been tracking anti-immigrant myths and disinformation digitally for years.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>New Save Collective will hold more events throughout the rest of 2025, and told </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span> the response thus far has been “overwhelmingly positive,” except for the people claiming to be ICE agents who have tried to join the Discord server.</span></p>

<p>Season 1 is on the horizon in Black Ops 7, and the first season in the latest Call of Duty title is bringing a host of new content across all game modes, including Zombies.</p>



<p>Zombies in Black Ops 7 launched with two maps, the larger, story-based Ashes of the Damned map, with a smaller segment of the map, Vandorn Farm, used for the Survival mode, and the tally of maps is set to more than double in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>—along with the addition of new enemies and the return of content from other Black Ops titles.</p>

<figure><figcaption>New map. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the latest blog post ahead of Season 1, which kicks off on December 4, Astra Malorum is the next story map in Zombies where players explore “an evil presence festering in the Dark Aether.”</p>



<p>The map features a new enemy, the O.S.C.A.R Elite Robot, a new Wonder Weapon, the LGM-1, and new traps, alongside the story quest and easter eggs to uncover.</p>



<p>For players grinding through Camo challenges and wanting a change of scenery from Vandorm Farm, Season 1 provides exactly that with Exit 115, another location from the larger Ashes of the Damned map, available in Survival from launch, with the Zorya Observatory following in mid-season.</p>



<p>Alongside the new maps, a slew of new and returning Ammo Mods will become available, including Light Mind and Shatter Blast, Field Upgrades, including Tesla Storm and Frost Blast, and the return of the fan-favorite Perk Mule Kick—all of which have their own Research to complete.</p>



<p>Zombies will also support the addition of seven new weapons, with some available at the start and others arriving mid-season, 11 new Weapon Attachments, while Directed Mode for the Ashes of the Damned story quest will also be available, guiding players through the necessary steps for completion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Attack on Titan crossover is live with title update 1.1.6; however, the quest is only available for a limited time, until December 22, 2025. </p>



<p>The details about Assassin’s Creed Shadows have been less lately, with AC Mirage taking up the news in recent days. We recently learned the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed 10 million players</a> thanks to the arrival of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-dlc-patch-notes-new-free-content-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valley of Memory DLC</a>. Now, we are receiving new content for AC Shadows as well, with popular manga and anime series Attack on Titan making its way into the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-attack-on-titan-crossover-will-add-new-skins-for-yasuke-and-naoe">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows’ Attack on Titan Crossover Will Add New Skins for Yasuke and Naoe</h2>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Attack on Titan crossover goes live on November 25 and will run until December 22. During this time, players can take part in a limited-time quest where they face a mysterious, power-hungry faction that has infiltrated feudal Japan and kidnapped a Titan Shifter. There’s a lone survivor with a dark secret who fails to rescue the Shifter and then recruits Naoe and Yasuke to help them out. </p>



<p>To unlock the AOT quest in AC Shadows, players will have to first unlock Yasuke as a playable character and then head to the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower. While playing the quest, players will unlock new banners and a statue for their hideout and will acquire a crystal katana for Naoe once completed. </p>



<p>Along with the quest, AC Shadows will also receive the Attack on Titan Dual Pack, which is inspired by the series’ universe. This pack includes new outfits, weapons, trinkets, and a new mount. Some of what we saw in the trailer showed Naoe wearing Mikasa Ackerman’s iconic costume, and Yasuke wearing a titan-themed armour. </p>

<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-third-story-drop-a-puzzlement">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Third Story Drop: A Puzzlement</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows title update 1.1.6 introduces the game’s third story drop, along with the Attack on Titan crossover. The new quest is called “A Puzzlement”, and it has been described as fun and humorous. It will feature Yasuke and Naoe engaging with two old acquaintances who are having a loud argument about a mysterious door in South Wakasa, and they have tasked the duo with figuring out how to open it. </p>



<p>The quest will have Yasuke and Naoe learning each other’s skills as well. Naoe will learn to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke’s war-kick ability. Yasuke will learn to stealthily dispatch enemies non-lethally. Players will also finally be able to settle the debate as to who would win in a straight-up duel between our two protagonists. </p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-title-update-1-1-6-patch-notes">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.1.6 Patch Notes</h2>

To mark the upcoming release, The Pokemon Company is partnering with the <a href="https://www.pokemon-cafe.jp/en/pikachu_sweets/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pikachu Sweets Pokemon Cafe</a> in Tokyo to <a href="https://www.pokemon-cafe.jp/ja/pikachu_sweets/news/251121_3309.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">introduce a themed menu</a> inspired directly by the DLC's mysteries and motifs. These limited-time offerings aim to give fans a preview of what awaits in the expansion, in an edible form.</p><p>The highlight of the promotion is a pair of striking new donuts, currently referred to only as the Red Donut and Blue Donut--names chosen to avoid spoilers before launch. Despite the intentionally vague labels, their designs unmistakably resemble Groudon and Kyogre, the legendary Pokemon featured on the covers of Pokemon Ruby and Pokemon Sapphire. The official website even playfully teases their origins with the line: "They look like some kind of Pokemon…?", suggesting that these real-world treats may hint at major Legendary appearances within the DLC itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4611458-abdcd77a05827defbee1120302daf4ef78dbe772.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4611458" data-ratio="0.545" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4611458-abdcd77a05827defbee1120302daf4ef78dbe772.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4611458"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Pikachu Sweets</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4611458-abdcd77a05827defbee1120302daf4ef78dbe772.jpg"></figure><p>The Red Donut will have a strawberry and tea Flavor, with the Blue Donut having a banana and lemon flavor. Both cost 550 yen.</p><p>Two drinks will also be available. Standard hot drinks featuring a special Hoopa or Gulpin design will be on sale during the promotion. A special drink, Hoopa's Mischief Ruby Chocolate Frappe, will cost 864 yen. The drink will be bright pink and feature an edible Hoopa on the top.</p><p>"This orange-flavored chocolate frappe is inspired by the mischievous Pokemon Hoopa," the description reads. "It's pink, yet chocolate-flavored! It’s just like Hoopa's mischief. Mix the refreshing orange flavor with the chocolate sauce at the bottom of the cup for a rich, varied taste."</p><p>Rounding out the themed lineup, the cafe will also serve a selection of playful hot drinks--each decorated with limited-edition Hoopa or Gulpin latte art--to keep fans warm during the winter launch window. These drinks join the already show-stealing donuts as part of the full collaborative menu, creating a small but memorable tasting tour through some of the motifs and mysteries players can expect to encounter in Mega Dimension. And of course, no Pokemon event would be complete without some kind of merch, so if you order a donut-and-drink set, it earns you an exclusive Pikachu Sweets sticker.</p><p>The new menu drops Wednesday, December 10, 2025, through Sunday, March 1, 2026, timed to coincide with the launch of the DLC itself on December 10. With Mega Dimension promising new Mega Evolutions, a Hoopa-centered narrative, and possible Legendary surprises, these treats offer a whimsical first taste of what's to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>It’s been more than two months since right-wing talking head Charlie Kirk was assassinated and an artist at <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> developer Sucker Punch Productions was fired for making a joke on social media about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Drew Harrison wasn’t the only person who was punished by the seething online mass of the American alt-right and the government that supports it—<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/charlie-kirk-purge-how-600-americans-were-punished-pro-trump-crackdown-2025-11-19/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a <em>Reuters</em> special report suggests more than 600 people</u></a> were fired, suspended, investigated, or otherwise actioned against. But Harrison’s story, which she is commenting on here for the first time, dovetails with a year-long harassment campaign her company had faced and remained publicly silent on until the day she was let go. An online mob had been railing against <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> and Sucker Punch since the sequel to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> was announced last September. They were further riled up by Kirk’s death and the firestorm of censorship and cancellation around it.&nbsp;</p><p>From my conversation with Harrison, it appears that Sucker Punch’s parent company, Sony Interactive Entertainment, acted swiftly and with little investigation into the situation around Harrison’s comments, as many companies did during those few weeks in September. In doing so, it <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired/"><u>emboldened gaming’s worst-behaved actors</u></a> yet again and set a worrying precedent for an industry that too often kowtows to the reactionary sects within it.</p><h2 id="muffins-and-death-threats"><strong>Muffins and death threats</strong></h2><p>On September 10, hours after Kirk was shot, Harrison made an off-color joke on social media:&nbsp;“I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/imodrew.bsky.social/post/3lyjc7w2p3k2j?ref=aftermath.site"><u>she wrote</u></a>, referencing the alleged murder by Luigi Mangione of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/luigi-mangione-indicted-first-degree-murder-charge-grand-jury-unitedhe-rcna184313?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a United Healthcare executive</u></a> back in December 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>A screenshot of her BlueSky post immediately began circulating on Twitter after right-wing commentators and influencers urged people to track down those who had mocked or criticized Kirk.&nbsp;</p><p>For the next 12 hours, Harrison’s cellphone was bombarded with threatening calls and texts from unknown numbers. Dozens of replies to her post urged Harrison to kill herself and demanded a boycott of Sucker Punch’s <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, which was less than a month away from launch. “Say goodbye to your career,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bo66ix.bsky.social/post/3lylf3jwwg22o?ref=aftermath.site"><u>reads the only post</u></a> from one anonymous account. Others called her a “worm” and much worse for what they viewed as a celebration of Kirk’s death. “I hope the same happens to you,” said another anonymous account <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/amauricoelhoc2.bsky.social/post/3lyjt3qwyjt2u?ref=aftermath.site"><u>with one post</u></a>.</p><p>Despite this, Harrison was hopeful Sucker Punch was well aware of the tactics of <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Gamergate</u></a>, especially since they had <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam/"><u>resurfaced</u></a> in the previous year. The allegations that consultancy firms were injecting diversity, equity, and inclusion principles into video games extended to Sucker Punch when <em>Yotei</em> was announced and queer actor Erika Ishii was revealed to be playing its protagonist.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just thought, ‘I’m their entertainment for the day,’” Harrison told me of the people harassing her. “I assumed it was going to go how it always has: Nobody cares about what they say because they literally only harass for the fun of it.</p><p>“There’s no moral code they’re trying to uphold. There’s no cause they’re rallying for. They are just trying to make people suffer.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Drew Harrison (photo by Harrison)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the night of harassment, Harrison was determined to continue working as usual at Sucker Punch. The studio often ordered too many bananas for the communal kitchen at its office in Bellevue, Washington. Harrison would take the mushy, brown-spotted ones home, bake them into a sweet treat, and share the results.</p><p>The morning after Kirk was killed, Harrison sent a message to the companywide office chat: “I made the worst people on the internet mad. As an apology, there are banana muffins in the kitchen.”</p><p>Colleagues reached out almost immediately. Some told Harrison they were also being harassed, while others were unsure what she had done. Many expressed concern for her safety.</p><p>An office manager, Harrison said, explained that the company’s phones were being bombarded with anonymous calls — so many that another Sucker Punch employee, who was granted anonymity for fear of retribution, told me they were instructed to unplug their desk phones.&nbsp;</p><p>A human resources employee asked if Harrison was getting death threats. She said yes, recalling that the employee replied, “I’m here to protect you.”</p><p>Midday, a member of Sucker Punch leadership sent a message to the office chat, along with a copy of Sony’s social media policy.</p><p>“Due to a social media post by one of our team members, many corners of our studio and Sony organization are having to manage a developing situation,” the message read. “We may have to pause a trailer release…there will be some significant amount of work created now to ensure we keep the spotlight on the fantastic game we’ve all created. Please be mindful of how you represent yourself online…”</p><p>Hours later, Harrison was invited to a video call with someone she had never met, a member of Sony’s human resources department. Within 10 minutes, she no longer had a job.</p><h2 id="%E2%80%98fire-them-all%E2%80%99"><strong>‘Fire them all’</strong></h2><p>At the time, Sony confirmed to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kotaku</u></a> that Harrison was no longer employed but otherwise didn’t comment. A little more than a week later, Sucker Punch studio head Brian Fleming told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sucker-punch-brian-fleming-interview-playstation-ghost-of-yotei?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Game File</u></em></a>,<strong> </strong>&nbsp;“I think we’re aligned as a studio that celebrating or making light of someone’s murder is a deal-breaker for us, and we condemn that, kind of in no uncertain terms.” He declined to elaborate further.</p><p>The campaign for Harrison’s firing had been led by popular streamer Zack Hoyt, known as Asmongold, and Mark Kern, a former video game executive who posts under the name Grummz. On the day of Kirk’s death, Grummz instructed his followers to <a href="https://x.com/Grummz/status/1965993969705451988?ref=aftermath.site"><u>help Asmongold amass a list</u></a> of those “mocking or cheering Charlie Kirk’s assassination.”</p><p>“Fire them all,” <a href="https://x.com/Grummz/status/1966026728637346234?ref=aftermath.site"><u>he wrote</u></a>. “Every game dev, too, who celebrated this. We no longer have tolerance for death cults.”</p><p>After Harrison was fired, Asmongold, who has more than 3.6 million followers on Twitch and 4.5 million on YouTube, <a href="https://x.com/it_zzzy/status/1975142506359840868?ref=aftermath.site"><u>discussed the developments on his stream</u></a>.</p><p>“They got fired from their job,” he said. “Too bad, huh? Wow. What a shame for you.” He added, “Eventually, you’ll get a new job, and when you do, I might just make another video and contact that employer, too. Now, why would I do that? For fun. I enjoy it. I like it. It’s a nice pastime.”</p><blockquote>“Studios don’t want to address toxicity against their employees because they see it as confronting the dark sides of their community, which they believe is a core demographic."</blockquote><p>But Harrison’s firing didn’t happen in a vacuum—as mentioned, both Kern and Hoyt, along with a slew of other content creators and right-leaning voices on Twitter and YouTube, had already had <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>and its creators in their sights for over a year prior to her Charlie Kirk post.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the online subculture’s rowdiest voices complained that Erika Ishii, the queer actor who portrays the game’s avenging samurai, <a href="https://x.com/Grummz/status/1945180368283558381?ref=aftermath.site"><u>was not pretty enough</u></a>. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@asmongoldclipz/video/7419452381923904814?lang=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Others suggested</u></a> that Sucker Punch had hired too many women to work on the game. Harrison pointed out that <a href="https://x.com/Davisaar69/status/1840047660318740924?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a picture circulated</u></a> by rightwing reactionaries to support the latter argument (a side-by-side of all men sitting at a table versus all women, with <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> emblazoned over the men and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> over the women) was, shockingly, inaccurate. “It’s literally a picture of the Sucker Punch soccer team and our Women’s Day photo, from the same year,” she said.</p><p>Sucker Punch never made any public statements about the harassment of Ishii or the allegations against its dev team, and as far as Harrison and the anonymous Sucker Punch employee know, no statements were made internally, either. Sony did not reply to multiple requests for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>“The studio has a lot of vulnerable people. There are a lot of LGBTQ people. There are a lot of people on work visas,” the employee told me over a call. “There are a lot of people who would be targets if their name was put to their words.”</p><p>Leaders at games studios, who are often in much less vulnerable positions than their employees, also choose to remain quiet, for a much different reason. “Studios don’t want to address toxicity against their employees because they see it as confronting the dark sides of their community, which they believe is a core demographic,” said Rachel Kowert, a research psychologist and visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge.</p><h2 id="the-wrong-kind-of-action"><strong>The wrong kind of action</strong></h2><p>Harrison said she asked for clarification about her firing during the brief video call, and the Sony HR employee said her BlueSky post was “celebrating and inciting violence.” When she asked what part of her post was celebrating and inciting violence, she said the employee replied with “the comments.”</p><p>Harrison acknowledges that her post about Kirk’s death could be considered a violation of Sony’s social media policy (tenets include “think before you post,” “consider the impact of your words,” and “be civil”).</p><p>“Full disclosure, the joke was not in the best taste,” Harrison, who had never been formally reprimanded during her tenure, said. “But at no point did anyone ask me to delete it. At no point did anyone ask me to apologize — and for the record, I would have. I would have worked with PR to write an apology. It feels like nobody investigated the harassment me and my coworkers were receiving.”&nbsp;</p><p>She and her peers wondered if the deluge of harassment would force the company to take action against the harassers, especially after a companywide email noted that a security guard would be temporarily stationed at the office entrance.</p><p>In 2023, a Washington State judge <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/14s3qU7K78oeSvWW1YL8RD3cofI-7mCaU/view?ref=aftermath.site"><u>found a man liable for nearly $500,000</u></a> after he harassed a community manager for<em> Destiny 2</em>. After the employee shared the online creations of a Black fan, the judge said he faced a “campaign of racist, stochastic terrorism” that included a “hideous, bigoted voicemail.”</p><blockquote>“If we as an industry got better about realizing when harassment is happening and standing up as a block, maybe this wouldn’t stop harassment, but there would be much more hesitation to do it."</blockquote><p>Harrison, though, said that no senior members of Sucker Punch’s management or executive teams spoke to her in the hours before she was fired.</p><p>“If we as an industry got better about realizing when harassment is happening and standing up as a block, maybe this wouldn’t stop harassment, but there would be much more hesitation to do it,” the anonymous Sucker Punch employee said.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know within our studio there’s this mentality of ‘don’t feed the trolls, there’s going to be harassment, there’s going to be people on the fringes trying to nibble at you…just ignore them,” they continued. “But that comes from an era of the internet where everyone was on forums in these siloed communities that were moderated, and you would have a lone actor enter a community and try to agitate people, and everyone would starve them of attention, or the moderators would put them in their little bubble. But that’s not how the internet works anymore, it’s people with global reach, an agitator that has millions of followers, and they use coded language and dog whistles and speak in a way that lets them shirk accountability and responsibility.”</p><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was released to critical acclaim on October 2, becoming the fourth-best-selling game in the United States between August 31 and October 4, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvmyfmyk25?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to research firm Circana</u></a>. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m62wlx7h2s2s?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Circana’s mid-November numbers have it ranked 10th</u></a> in year-to-date sales. It has the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/?ref=aftermath.site#1" rel="noreferrer">second-most nominations</a> at this year’s Game Awards, tied with <em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em>. Harrison said she did not receive any severance or the industry-standard “ship bonus,” a cash injection given to developers who worked on a game to celebrate its release.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after <em>Yotei</em>'s release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/imodrew.bsky.social/post/3m2d446u6ak2k?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Harrison posted on BlueSky</u></a>, writing: “As it turns out my joke didn’t make the game do any worse, my firing didn’t make the game do any better, so really the only thing that the harassment campaign succeeded in was sucking all the joy out of my life so I guess that’s a W.”</p><p>Two months after her firing, Harrison told me she’s “extremely depressed and isolated” and is trying to fill her days with things that bring her joy. “I’m not sure if I want to try and stay in an industry that seemingly does not value its employees or support women and diversity,” she said. “I’ve accepted that even Sucker Punch is changing from what I really loved about it, and that’s been helping me move on knowing that I was there for the best of it.”</p><p>Harrison’s firing hasn’t stopped reactionaries from speaking negatively about <em>Yotei</em> and the team that made it. In the days after its launch, a<a href="https://x.com/DAKKADAKKA1/status/1975409027396890997?ref=aftermath.site"><u> false rumor spread that a potential ending involved Atsu in a lesbian relationship with another character named Oyuki</u></a>, much to the alt-right’s disgust. A large number of detractors believe that the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m62wm2amgs2s?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recent Circana numbers</u></a> showing <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> ranks within the top ten best-selling games in 2025 thus far are purposefully doctored or otherwise inaccurate. Some replies to<a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1990468210098081922?ref=aftermath.site"><u> Ishii’s nomination for Best Performance at The Game Awards </u></a>call her a terrorist (<a href="https://x.com/erikaishii/status/1285259908011548674?ref=aftermath.site"><u>they once jokingly tweeted</u></a> that they were antifa) and a DEI hire, or others express disbelief and disdain.</p><p>But when the ire for <em>Yotei</em> eventually fades, Harrison knows it will just be transferred to another game, another group of developers, or another individual. That’s why she wants people to remember what actually happened to her.</p><p>“I was fired because of a harassment campaign. It wasn’t the result of a bad joke,” she said. “And I really don’t want this to happen to anyone else, because I feel like with the state of everything, it will absolutely happen to other people.”</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired/"><div><p>The Right’s Charlie Kirk Cancellation Spree Has Emboldened Gaming’s Worst - Aftermath</p><p>The Charlie Kirk witch hunt has led to heaps of harassment, but only a small handful of firings, in the video game industry.</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst controversies <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">surrounding its use of Generative AI tech for NPC voices</a>, Embark Studios' latest release, the third-person extraction shooter ARC Raiders, continues its sales streak, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-dominated-steam-again">Alinea Analytics</a>, it has almost reached 7 million copies sold across all platforms.</p>



<p>After selling close to 750K copies on Steam last week, Alinea Analytics reports that ARC Raiders is at 4 million copies sold on Steam alone, and is due to reach the 7 million mark soon. Last week, the game's publisher, Nexon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">reported that it had officially sold over 4 million copies.</a> </p>



<p>It's further proof that ARC Raiders is undeniably one of the video game industry's biggest hits in 2025. It was even one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shooters-dominated-october-2025-revenue-mau-charts-battlefield-6/">top 20 games for MAU and revenue in Newzoo's October 2025 report</a>. Though, as is the case with all multiplayer games, a strong launch is only the beginning. Now, it's about consistency in the long run. It'll be interesting to see where the game stands a year from now.</p>



<p>Other notable titles in Alinea Analytics' latest report include PEAK closing in on 15 million copies sold, making it one of the biggest indie titles of the year. RV There Yet? and AdHoc Studio's Dispatch were also two of the top-selling games on Steam last week, as indie games continue to have a strong showing this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto reviewed ARC Raiders</a>, giving the game a 9/10 and praising its sound design, gameplay loop, map design, and more. "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>

            <p>
I'll be honest with you folks, as aware as I have been about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, i.e. Not The Witcher 3 from some of the folks who helped make The Witcher 3, I have felt very disinterested in it. Sure, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/freshly-spilled-blood-of-dawnwalker-footage-reveals-an-action-rpg-where-witcher-dialogue-meets-wall-walking">recent look at gameplay</a> certainly paints a polished at minimum picture, but at a cursory glance I have to admit I did just kind of write it off as vampire Witcher. Except I've now been quite quickly pulled in thanks to an important element of the game shared by its director in a new interview: there's no main quest.
</p>
<p>
This comes from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">Eurogamer</a>, who spoke with game director (and Witcher 3 co-director) Konrad Tomaskiewicz about this very fact. After clarifying that "no, there's no main quest" in The Blood of Dawnwalker, Tomaskiewicz explained, "You build your experience from the quests you encounter. You know where your [enemy is]. You can attack this place anytime you want to. It's up to you if you want to do it by yourself, or if you want to build yourself, find the powerful items, develop your character, or do some quests and find allies to help you do it."
</p>
<p>
Here's a line that I like in particular from Tomaskiewicz: "We want to bring video games closer to pen-and-paper RPGs and give you the freedom to experience what you want to experience." <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> as a genre is quite obviously popular, but a majority of them are ultimately quite constrictive in what you can actually do. There's limits in the world of video games! Understandable limits, but I'm always curious to see how someone might try to break them.
</p>
<p>
This ability to attempt to achieve your goal isn't exactly a novel thing technically, later on Tomaskiewicz compares it to Fallout: "Our game is more similar in this area to the old Fallout, the first and second [games], where you have a clear goal and everything is optional - you decide. You travel the world, you decide what you want to do. There is no main quest." 
</p><p>
Not to mention the fact that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild lets you seek out the final boss almost right from the start. However, Fallout is obviously quite an oldschool RPG by now, and Breath of the Wild sits in a weird place genre-wise, plus it does have a main story, so I'm keen on seeing how Blood of Dawnwalker tackles such a structure.
</p>
<p>
The Blood of Dawnwalker is due for release sometime in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Rockstar Games employee dismissals have dominated gaming headlines for several weeks. Now, a new report has revealed the Discord messages that are believed to have led to the termination of 34 Rockstar Games workers.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reported back in October about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Workers allegedly being fired to prevent union forming.</a> Since then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games has claimed that the fired employees were leaking information</a>. There have been protests since, and the company has since been hit with legal action over the firings.</p>



<p>But now, a new development has seemingly uncovered the actual Discord messages at the root of everything.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-allegedly-accessed-union-discord-server">Rockstar Games Allegedly Accessed Union Discord Server</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A dark period for Rockstar. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People Make Games</a> released an eye-opening video on November 24 titled: “The Messages Rockstar Saw Before Firing 34 Union Members.”</p>



<p>The reporter claims that they have “since spoken to a Rockstar insider, who has shared screenshots with People Make Games of what they believe to be the messages sent just a few weeks ago on that Discord server, which directly contributed to the firings of these 34 former employees. We also know how Rockstar got hold of these messages as well.”</p>



<p>According to People Make Games, the source is “not one of the fired workers” and isn’t even part of the union. The Discord server has apparently been around since 2022 and consisted of various Rockstar employees.</p>







<p>The reporter’s source claims that “They couldn’t recall a single example of any confidential game details being shared.” It’s said that the beginning of October 2025 saw Rockstar Games revise its policies pertaining to the company Slack—a messaging platform usually used by workplaces.</p>



<p>Various non-essential chats were removed, with the company claiming them to be a “distraction” and a source of “poor conduct”. </p>



<p>This “Slack purge” did not go down well. The union Discord server discussed these changes, with one individual saying: “I would really like to see the evidence for them being too much of a productivity hit. I can’t imagine it being worth the absolute dumpsterfire this will be for morale.”</p>



<p>It’s alleged that Rockstar’s Slack revision email was sent out after 5 PM—and employees can’t check their emails outside of work—and a second email about guidelines and conduct was also pushed. The emails were shared by people still in the office on Discord to inform other colleagues who hadn’t seen them yet.</p>



<p>“This led to one member of the Discord approaching studio management to express concerns about the discussions taking place,” the report adds. Additionally, “I’m told this either contributed to or kicked off an investigation into the Discord by the company, which does line up with the timings we now understand.”</p>



<p>The report claims it’s likely Rockstar did manage to access the union Discord server. Soon after, the whole world learned of the firings, with Rockstar presumably identifying individuals in the union chat who had broken guidelines, weren’t adhering to policy, and potentially attributed this to leaks.</p>



<p>You can see recreations of the Discord messages in the full video below.</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">The gates are open - and a new era of Hunters has arrived. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE brings the legendary rise of Sung Jinwoo to life like never before, capturing every ounce of heart, grit, and power that made Solo Leveling a global phenomenon. Available now on PC via Steam and Xbox PC, the game invites players to step into Jinwoo’s shoes and carve their own path from E-Rank underdog to unstoppable Shadow Monarch. With breathtaking visuals, cinematic storytelling, and exhilarating combat, this is Solo Leveling unleashed.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is Solo Leveling?</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608839-pr_slao_coop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608839" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608839-pr_slao_coop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608839"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608839-pr_slao_coop.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>Solo Leveling began as a breakout web novel that exploded into an award-winning Webtoon and anime. Fans gravitate to its fast-paced action, clean power progression, and the thrill of watching Sung Jinwoo rise from the weakest Hunter to a total powerhouse. His underdog-to-unstoppable journey is the heart of what made the IP a global phenomenon – and in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE, you get to step directly into that rise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Intense action with plenty of player choice</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Longtime fans and newcomers to Solo Leveling will find plenty to enjoy in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE. The game follows the story of Jinwoo from his lowly E-Rank Hunter days through his path to becoming a legend, adapting the series while adding several brand-new surprises in the story. You'll be able to change Jinwoo's appearance, too, giving our hero a fresh new appearance that's all your own. Incredible graphics accurately recreate the look and feel of the Solo Leveling world (and the ferocious monsters in it) that fans have come to love from the webtoon and the anime. The beloved voice cast of the anime adaptation have also returned to reprise their roles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608053-250926_slaoss9large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4608053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608053-250926_slaoss9large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4608053"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608053-250926_slaoss9large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In order to showcase Jinwoo's vast arsenal of abilities, the development team have crafted and refined a realtime, action-driven combat system that offers players a wealth of options for both gameplay and customization. Using an in-depth skill tree system, you are in full control of Jinwoo's growth, allowing you to create an incredible Hunter that plays exactly the way you like. Then, take those freshly-picked abilities and put them to use in thrilling fights! Use parries to expose and exploit enemy weaknesses, Chain Smash your way through powerful combos, and call upon the overwhelming power of Ashborn, Monarch of Shadows to seal your victory.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Raise the stakes with multiplayer and a wealth of options</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The title might be "Solo Leveling," but you don't have to adventure alone. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE features co-op battles with up to three other players online. This mode allows for a party of Jinwoo and other Hunters--or everyone can bring their own, custom-made Jinwoo to the battlefield for a true show of incredible combined strength! If you'd rather go it alone, however, you can recruit a group of CPU-controlled Hunters to bolster your ranks and help Jinwoo take on some of the special Hunter dungeons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608054-250926_slaoss8large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4608054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608054-250926_slaoss8large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4608054"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608054-250926_slaoss8large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You won't ever have to worry about your adventure's progress being suddenly halted, either. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE is a complete game package and does not require any further transactions after purchase — though you will be able to purchase certain cosmetics and emojis as additional DLC content. All of the Hunters, gear, and progression are earned through player effort and skill. You'll be able to jump in knowing you can enjoy the Solo Leveling experience with no strings attached.</p><p dir="ltr">But we've said enough--it's time to take Jinwoo's amazing journey into your own hands. Forge a unique path and discover your true potential in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE, available now.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBP4nkFcNw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/omBP4nkFcNw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>It's cartoon o'clock</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We are just one week away from the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> on Switch and Switch 2, and to mark the occasion, Tribute Games and Dotemu have released the game's opening movie to keep the hype train a-moving.</p>
<p>Now, for those who have been paying attention to all the character reveals and behind-the-scenes looks in recent months, some of this footage might not be all that new; if, however, you're coming in with fresh eyes, be prepared for some Saturday morning cartoon nostalgia.</p>
<p>The opening film provides a neat character-by-character rundown of the game's 15-fighter roster, each reimagined in the '90s cartoon visuals that Tribute has so clearly been inspired by.</p>
<p>We get to see Captain America and Spider-Man taking out Annihilus' bug bros on the streets, Beta Ray Bill and the Silver Surfer handing out beatings in space, and even a handful of familiar foe faces like that of Thanos, Galactus, and Modok.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like Cosmic Invasion will go a long way to scratch a similar nostalgic itch that the developer/publisher duo hit upon with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> back in 2022. There's only one week to go until we find out.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nioh-3-developer-made-sure-there-won%E2%80%99t-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes-in-the-game.1363099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nioh 3 will be the first game in Team NINJA's fantasy action RPG series to be published by the studio's own parent company, Koei Tecmo. The first two games were published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, which meant they launched first on PlayStation consoles and only later on PC, whereas the new one will be available on PS5 and PC at the same time.</p>



<p>That's far from the only change in this third entry. Another big one is that it will offer an 'open field' environment instead of the relatively linear maps seen in the previous two installments. This, as explained by producer Fumihiko Yasuda <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/nioh-3-i-producer-del-team-ninja-ci-hanno-svelato-tutti-i-retroscena-del-progetto.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Multiplayer.it</a>, will make the game more accessible than the first two Nioh games, and the team also avoided sudden difficulty spikes that could make the game unpalatable to newcomers. However, the overall level of challenge remains as high as customary for an action game created by Team NINJA, a studio known mainly for the Ninja Gaiden series (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just received an excellent new release</a>).</p>



<p><em>There are players out there who probably invested thousands of hours in the Nioh series, but there are many more who may be interested in Nioh 3 as newcomers, and I'd like everyone to be able to enjoy the game. For newcomers, we have added a very thorough, albeit not excessive, tutorial. But the most important thing was to ensure that the game wouldn't have sudden difficulty spikes. Everything must happen gradually. The exploration has much more freedom, but there are also very tough foes to defeat on the open field. What we focused on was offering players many more ways to defeat the bosses, be it equipment or the exploration itself. But the challenge level typical of our games was not reduced.</em></p>



<p><em>I always thought that the focal point, which is really important for this game, is how you face defeat. Perhaps in a demo like the one we showed at Tokyo Game Show, you are defeated, and that can be frustrating. But what really matters is what the player thinks after being defeated. What do I have to get? How do I have to prepare to win? We chose to offer many options so that players could find their own way to victory, to defeat those powerful bosses. Ultimately, being able to succeed, the exhilarating sensation that comes with that, discovering that you could indeed beat that boss, is very important, and it was essential that we maintained that in Nioh 3, too.</em></p>



<p>Nioh 3 will be released on February 6, 2026 for PC and PlayStation 5. You can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our recent hands-on preview here</a>.</p>

              <p><span>I haven’t seen the full </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>stage play, but I was already well aware of the twists and turns we’d see in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>.</span></a><span> The musical sequel covers the events of the play’s second act, and it includes several direct ties to the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> story. As such, I was braced for it to reveal the brainless Scarecrow, but I was not prepared for how the guy would actually look when on screen, and neither were most people, it seems, as the reveal has caught fans off guard.</span></p>  <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>continuity, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people-final-fantasy-2000641145"><i><span>People</span></i><span>’s Sexiest Man Alive</span></a><span>), the carefree prince who starts growing a conscious after he meets Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), becomes the Scarecrow. He starts off as a dashing, charismatic narcissist, but as Fiyero grows to care for Elphaba and her battle for animal rights, he turns against the Wizard’s fascist regime and becomes a fugitive with the Wicked Witch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Later in the film, he is captured by the Wizard’s guards and tortured. Elphaba, desperate to save her lover, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTv_FrdBQ6A&amp;pp=ygUTd2lja2VkIG5vIGdvb2QgZGVlZA%3D%3D"><span>casts a spell to keep him from dying or feeling any pain</span></a><span>. We don’t see Fiyero’s face for almost the entirety of the second half of the movie because </span><i><span>For Good </span></i><span>goes out of its way to obscure it and hide his identity, but we unknowingly see the back of his head a few times. That’s because Elphaba’s spell turned him into the Scarecrow who accompanies Dorothy in </span><i><span>The Wizard of Oz</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We don’t actually see Fiyero as the Scarecrow until the final moments of </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, and while an eagle-eyed </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>fan may have caught onto this twist when he was strung up on a cross in a cornfield during Elphaba’s spell, plenty of first-time viewers were genuinely shocked by this reveal, not only because of Fiyero’s dark fate, but because Bailey straight up looks like a patched together version of Ryan Reynolds in his Scarecrow look.</span></p>       <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My entire theater burst out laughing when they saw the Scarecrow's design</p> <p>— 5 DAYS UNTIL DON CHEADLE'S BIRTHDAY (@Schaffrillas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Schaffrillas/status/1991721384129777945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">out mogged the wicked for good scarecrow <a href="https://t.co/CHKems9MTo">pic.twitter.com/CHKems9MTo</a></p> <p>— 👹 (@tummyhxrts) <a href="https://twitter.com/tummyhxrts/status/1992245081273991321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">also happy to report fiyero looks chopped asf as the scarecrow like even tin man boq is out mugging him <a href="https://t.co/lrDdCGEHAQ">pic.twitter.com/lrDdCGEHAQ</a></p> <p>— gelphie conquers all (@aIicentinchains) <a href="https://twitter.com/aIicentinchains/status/1990796884131426684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While some might be unsettled by Fiyero’s new face, others aren’t going to let some straw and burlap keep them from </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHed_tTvyhI"><span>recreating that one scene from </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i></a><span>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extract-rat-elevator-revive-defib-2000646958</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wild-arc-raiders-moments-like-these-show-why-people-love-it.1363093/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Extraction shooters are eager to take everything away from you. And though <i>Arc Raiders</i> has proven to be a more friendly approach with its multiple paths of progression, dying at the end of a successful run still sucks. Getting pushed 99 percent of the way to failure and then surviving, however, is a feeling like no other.</p> <p>As more folks pour into <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers to hopefully extract and craft their way to glory, they’re capturing epic victories snatched from the jaws of defeat and sharing them as reminders that even when you think you’re about to lose everything, luck (or a guardian angel) can always intervene.</p>

 <p>Last night, I came across one such clip from a few days ago of what would seem to be an unfortunate PvP instance during a Night Raid (usually a preem opportunity to score some great loot if you know where to look) suddenly turned on its head:</p>

   <p>Gunned down by a rando, Reddit user Over_here_vibin prepares to get sent back home with nothing to show for it. Then his assailant gets sniped in the head literally out of nowhere. Turns out, some folks must’ve been watching nearby and were quick to put down the threat while also escorting Over_here_vibin to extraction.</p>

 <p>Fun fact learned from this video? If you don’t have a defib to revive a stranger, you can use bandages to temporarily stabilize them, which is often enough to see someone successfully get out.</p> <p>Humans aren’t your only potential allies, though. As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-karma-doesnt-get-any-sweeter-than-this-extract-camper-gets-a-spoonful-of-justice-from-bots-accidentally-saves-his-would-be-victim-and-misses-his-own-extraction/">spotted by <i>Games Radar</i></a>, another fantastic clip sees someone gunned down literally as they’re standing in the elevator. If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, then you know getting shot in the elevator is literally one of the worst feelings (especially as it often happens right as the doors are closing, meaning your assailant doesn’t even have time to loot your body and just offed you seemingly just for the fun of it).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Beautiful ❤️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <br>🎥RedRiser <a href="https://t.co/RkAYVow0rL">pic.twitter.com/RkAYVow0rL</a></p> <p>— ARC Now (@ArcRaidersNow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersNow/status/1991792146995986490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As luck would have it, a Rocketeer (one of the most menacing of airborne threats in the game thus far) not only interrupts the execution animation, but knocks the assailant out of the elevator with a rocket, downing them in the process. While it is possible the assailant might’ve been able to crawl over and call in a new elevator, it’s likely their decision to shoot someone in the back led to their loss.</p> <p>My feeds are full of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueRaiders/comments/1ovl0bh/got_rescued_today_was_this_one_of_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">situations like this</a>. It just goes to show that, until the game literally sends you back to Speranza, don’t give up. A friendly human, or Arc, might just save the day.</p>   <p>Oh, and if you run solos, please carry defibs for your fellow Raiders!</p>

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-is-giving-off-serious-animal-crossing-and-minecraft-vibes/1100-6534702/" data-ref-id="1100-6534702">it was announced</a> in September 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a> appeared to be the franchise's cozy-game answer to Animal Crossing and Minecraft. But after the recently released extended trailer for the game, fans have pointed out intriguing and dark links to some of the previous titles in the franchise.</p><p>It's almost unsettling that one of the first things seen in the extended trailer is a devastated Pokemon Center and a generation-one Pokedex. As noted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-upcoming-pokemon-pokopia-may-have-a-deeper-link-to-classic-games-fans-believe-heres-what-we-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), one of the fan theories suggests that Pokopia is set on Cinnabar Island from the Kanto region, which was originally featured in Pokemon Blue, Red, and Yellow. As depicted in Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Cinnabar Island was devastated by a volcano eruption that left a Pokemon Center as one of the last remaining structures, much like the one glimpsed in Pokopia's trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDh6COB0Nqk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SDh6COB0Nqk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Professor Tangrowth--a character introduced in the trailer--mentions that he hasn't seen humans in a long time, but the island has other evidence that people once lived there including roads and other buildings. The strange Pokemon variations introduced in the trailer--like the stark-white Pikachu known as Peakychu--may have been created at Cinnabar Island's Pokemon Mansion. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pokemon Mansion was the place where Ditto could be found in the original Pokemon games.</p><p>Pokopia puts players in control of a Ditto that assumes human form and utilizes borrowed powers from other Pokemon to transform the landscape into a sanctuary free of human conflict. There don't appear to be any battles or a larger story in the game. But if it is set in a post-volcano explosion Cinnabar Island, it would be fitting if the land were healed by masterless Pokemon who weren't forced to fight each other.</p><p>Pokemon Pokopia will hit Switch 2 on March 5, 2026. In the meantime, fans of the franchise can immerse themselves in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. That game has introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-has-found-a-new-way-to-battle-but-it-needs-to-evolve-past-that/1100-6536431/" data-ref-id="1100-6536431">a new way for Pokemon to battle</a>, but it may need some work before it can become a competitive esport.</p>

                <p>After three years of mysteriously absent email-checking, Strong Bad has finally smashed his boxing-gloved fists onto the keyboard once more, returning with a brand-new message for his loyal fans. And in true Strong Bad fashion, it's about robots--again--and this time they apparently want to discuss their favorite sauces. His comeback feels like stepping back into Free Country, USA itself: chaotic, ridiculous, and somehow still deeply important to a generation. It also offers the perfect opportunity to revisit the era when Strong Bad and the rest of the Homestar Runner cast broke out of browser windows and into full-fledged video games.</p><p>The most defining gaming moment for the franchise came with the Telltale game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episod/1900-6195688/" data-ref-id="1900-6195688">Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People</a>, a five-episode point-and-click adventure released throughout 2008. The game played like an interactive Homestar Runner cartoon, built in close collaboration with the Brothers Chaps, who supplied writing, design input, and voice work. Guiding Strong Bad through his latest harebrained schemes--from band competitions to clumsy attempts at political takeover--gave fans a new way to revel in the character's larger-than-life personality, all while exploring familiar territory like the House of Strong and Bubs' Concession Stand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zhsNdk1_Vc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-zhsNdk1_Vc?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A large part of the game's charm came from its faithfulness to the original Flash cartoons. While it followed Telltale's traditional adventure formula, the world was loaded with oddball interactions, surreal conversations, and puzzles that functioned less on logic and more on the internal rules of Homestar Runner's absurdity. Each episode came packed with extra features, such as bizarre arcade minigames, collectible Teen Girl Squad cards, and hidden Easter eggs that rewarded longtime fans who had practically memorized the old website.</p><p>The success of that series helped cement the Homestar Runner universe as a surprisingly adaptable landscape for games. Beyond the Telltale collaboration, the franchise had already experimented with interactive experiences through its own iconic web games--Peasant's Quest, Stinkoman 20X6, and TROGDOR!--and later through the revival of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rMCkNgHa3c" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trogdor!! The Board Game</a> and its digital version. Even when Strong Bad wasn't hogging the spotlight, his attitude, snark, and tendency to go off the rails remained woven into the fabric of these projects. With his latest return to the inbox, he's once again reminding the world that Free Country, USA is only an email away.</p>

"What started as a few complaints has ballooned into a wave of litigation as families across the country realize they are victims of the same systemic failures by Roblox and Discord to protect their children," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Walsh, Section 230 is "irrelevant" to her clients' claims. "Roblox will invoke it and has invoked it because every tech company automatically invokes it when they get sued," she said. "But they are grossly-overinterpreting the application of that statute. In our view, that statue is designed to do is to limit liability in cases where an internet service provider is...publishing someone else's material."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-savvy-games-group-s-saudi-owned-parent-fund-is-running-low-on-investable-cash" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Savvy Games Group's Saudi-owned parent fund is running low on investable cash</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She described how the firm's cases center on how these apps are released without adequate safety features while purportedly misrepresenting a their safety protections for underage users. Adult predators were able to create profiles signaling that they were children, and children were able to sign up for accounts without going to their parents.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers might recognize however, that the phenomenon of underage users signing up for online games or services without a parent's permission is as old as...well, the internet. When asked about this, Walsh said there was a distinction in how other platforms like Instagram have "some attempt" to enforce their age minimum policies, and how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> provides minimal friction for when underage users sign up for the platform.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're not saying that any particular measure is going to be perfect 100% of the time," she said in allusion to age-gates that might, for example, require a parent's email address to create an account. "But at least it's some friction...at least it's making some kids pause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Walsh said it's "easy" for kids on Discord to turn parental controls off without their parents' knowledge. Predators take advantage of this capability to lure their targets into lowering protective barriers. A better system might be one that automatically notifies parents when these controls are turned off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two platforms are linked through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s Discord integration. The Florida-based predator who abused Ethan Dallas—the child of one of Walsh's clients—reportedly lured Dallas off of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and into Discord where he was able to further sexually exploit the teenager.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dallas died by suicide in April 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a gaming platform that is heavily marketed and promoted as being safe and appropriate for children," Walsh said. "At the same time, the company knows that every day, child predators are coming on the platform." She referred to regular reports that Roblox Corporation makes to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">news stories</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> covering the arrests of predators who targeted minors on their platform as evidence of this fact.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet despite all that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord may still be protected by Section 230 in these civil cases.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Proving Section 230 doesn't apply could prove difficult">Proving Section 230 doesn't apply could prove difficult</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Aaron Mackey—director of the nonprofit's free speech and transparency litigation efforts—acknowledged it's challenging to differentiate between responsibility and liability when it comes to protecting kids online. The Foundation has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ilt.eff.org/Defamation__CDA_Cases.html">been a strong advocate for Section 230</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, arguing that while some elements of the Communication Decency Act were flawed, the law has provided vital protections for freedom of speech on the internet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mackey declined to comment on the specifics of the cases against Roblox Corp. and Discord. But in a conversation with Game Developer, he explained communication platforms of all stripes have been repeatedly found not liable for abusive messages sent on their platform because of Section 230. It may sound counterintuitive, but these protections enable the existence of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>any</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> online moderation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before Section 230's existence, internet service providers CompuServe and Prodigy both faced lawsuits for their policies about moderating what users posted on their servers. The former company said it would not moderate any content, while Prodigy said it would. Both were sued, and Prodigy was the one to be found liable for content hosted on its servers even though it was the one with a moderation policy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mackey said the law was created to let services to decide for themselves about what kind of speech to allow on their platform, and offer protections when they enforced those policies. That raises the bar for civil suits about messages sent between users.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There appear to also be protections for generic promises about child safety on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord. "There are cases in which plaintiffs have tried to raise this claim, which is that they're not seeking to hold [platforms] liable for the content of the communication but for representations about what they would do to protect users," he said. "Those cases have not succeeded."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The courts have also ruled that Section 230 provides immunity for claims that cover the account creation process. "The courts ruled that 230 applied because the services decision to offer public accounts was inherently connected with the ability for account holders to create, view, share content on the service," Mackey said. "A legal claim that sought to change or limit the service’s ability to have the account-creation process it wanted would implicate 230 because it necessarily seeks to impose liability based on the third-party content on the site.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cases that have succeeded centered on specific promises made by online platforms to specific users. Mackey recalled a case reviewed by the Ninth Circuit about a user who faced online abuse, asked the platform owner for help, was promised assistance, and then the company took action. The Court ruled that section 230 did not apply to the case because it involved the failure of a service to follow through on its promise.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How can online platforms improve child safety?">How can online platforms improve child safety?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's tempting to view Section 230 as an obstacle for holding online platforms accountable for user safety—but there's a larger patchwork of policy gaps that led to this complicated status quo. Law enforcement has been slow to act on all manner of online threats. The closed ecosystems or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord prevent other companies from offering third-party safety tools to parents. And laws shaped around online "child safety" have been sharply criticized for their </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/surveillance-mandate-disguised-child-safety-why-guard-act-wont-keep-us-safe">potential</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to block all manner of undesired speech.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pair that with a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/meta-reduced-content-moderation-brand-safety/736779/">global retreat</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/inside-elon-musk-x-twitter-austin-content-moderation/">online moderation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and you </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/youtube-content-moderation-rules-1.7559931">create</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a porous online ecosystem that stops some predators—but lets others slip through the cracks. "A general industry trend of scaling back moderation would be an abhorrent excuse for putting children in harm’s way," Walsh said to Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Other companies have successfully implemented common-sense safety mechanisms like ID age verification, &nbsp;mandatory parental approval by default, and robust deterrents to prevent messaging between children and adults. Corporations marketing themselves as child-friendly have a non-negotiable responsibility to prioritize child safety."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When reached for comment, a Discord spokesperson declined to discuss on the specifics of these cases and if they planned to invoke Section 230 in their defense. "We use a combination of advanced technology and trained safety teams to proactively find and remove content that violates our policies," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox Corp. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
Right, has everyone got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> out of their system? I'm sure there's plenty of you that have scoured enough of its map to feel satisfied and ready for another hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>! A game that fits that bill precisely, albeit with its own, quite literally painterly flair, one which is out today.
</p>
<p>
Constance, as you may have gathered from looking at it, is the game's titular hero, one who wields a big ole paintbrush. To say this game is one that takes some cues from Celeste would probably also be apt, as Constance's main foe is, dun-dun-dun, herself. Or, well, her unconscious inner demons, that have imprisoned her within her own mind. These demons appear to manifest in a myriad of ways, such as evil robots, or sentient candles, or straight up bits of paper.
</p>
<p>
Those mental-health focused Celeste inspirations appear to translate to the game's movement puzzles a touch as well, as you do a lot of dashing around avoiding dangerous obstacles and the like. Of course platforming is a big element of many 2D metroidvanias, there's just an element of precise timing here that looks reminiscent of how Celeste functions.
</p>
<p>
I quite like the sound of the narrative framework around upgrades. This is a game about creativity, so you can find "inspirations" along the way to sketch in your journal, which then can improve Constance's abilities. There's just something quite nice, conceptually anyway, about the idea of going out into the world and taking in what it offers you to better yourself in some shape or form.
</p>
<p>
It's cheap as chips too with a 10% launch discount, so as I said, if you're ready for a new metroidvania in your life, Constance is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2313700/Constance/">ready and waiting for you on Steam</a>.

              <p>Picking up the M5 iPad Pro for the first time should come with a wary bystander asking, “are you sure you can handle this thing,” as if you were sliding into the driver’s seat of an F1 race car. The amount of power under the hood of the newest iPad Pro is&nbsp;<em>that</em> significant, and with Black Friday week kicking off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Amazon is handing you the keys to the 13-inch version with a first-ever $100 price drop to $1,195.</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, learning how to harness all of the crazy amount of power and features of the M5 iPad Pro won’t end with you pancaked into a wall. If anything, you won’t be able to put it down once you see just what the upgrade to the M5 chip — the very same one found in the newest MacBooks — has done for the iPad Pro. Everything from editing 4K video, precision art creation, and heavy-duty gaming is now firmly on the table.</p>

<h2>More Than Enough</h2>
<p>The best reviews on iPads or any tablets has always been that they’re “good enough” to take on visually challenging or work-intensive tasks normally done by laptops or desktops. The M5 iPad Pro isn’t merely “good enough” to be your primary device for streaming, photo editing, content creation, number-crunching, or anything else — it handles them all as easily as virtually any laptop.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the M5 iPad Pro falls in line with pretty much every iPad ever made by having an industry-best display. The 13-inch screen is a Liquid Retina XDR thing of beauty, and it’s not going to lag or glitch out on you while you stream or edit videos or play an action game, thanks to the GPU built into the M5 chip.</p>
<p>Take a deeper dive into the Apple ecosystem by adding the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard folio (both sold separately) and you have a truly formidable touchscreen laptop, but one that runs the clean, silky-smooth iPadOS 26, updated with Liquid Glass design, helpful widgets and improved interaction with the Apple Pencil.</p>



<h2>Best iPad Ever?</h2>
<p>Need more power? Take Apple Intelligence out for a spin to help you create and execute pro-level workflows, and the iPad Pro’s Neural Accelerators will have them up and running in no time. Browsing or streaming speed? This iPad Pro can run Wi-Fi 7 with Apple’s brand-new N1 chip to deliver stunning online speed. The landscape 12MP front camera and 12MP rear camera are top notch, and when you combine them with the elite-level built-in mics and speakers, your FaceTime calls and videoconferencing will be the best ever delivered by any iPad. There’s also a USB-C port that lets you connect to an external Thunderbolt or USB 4 monitor.</p>
<p>Call it a race car, a thoroughbred, a rocket, or any other analogy you want, and the M5 iPad Pro lives up to it. Simply put, it’s Apple’s best and by&nbsp;<em>far</em> most powerful tablet yet, and it should be at the very top of the Black Friday list for anyone who wants it all when it comes to portable smart-device power. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Hit Amazon now and grab the 13-inch M5 iPad Pro while it’s at an all-time low price of $1,195.</a></p>

              <p>Later this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-free-week-star-wars-fan-film-exodus-leaks-bf6-2000646871#:~:text=Battlefield%206%E2%80%B2,royale%20spin%2Doff."><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s conquest mode and some of its maps</a> will be free to play across all platforms. That means an influx of new players. So now seems like a good time to ask everyone, even the people already playing EA’s blockbuster online FPS, to please capture control points in Conquest. Please. I’m begging you.</p> <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em> since it launched in October</a>. And I’ve had a great time with it. The FPS is easily my favorite <em>Battlefield</em> in a few years and will likely be a game I return to a lot in 2026. But whenever I play Conquest, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Conquest">the franchise’s iconic mode</a> that’s been around since the OG <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, I get frustrated by how many players seem not to understand the point of the mode. That point being: Capture control points, hold and defend them, and if needed, take them back from the enemy. Hold more points, and your team will win faster. Let them control the battlefield, and you’ll lose just as quickly.</p>

 <p>Sounds simple enough, yet I’ve lost a Conquest match and skimmed the scoreboard afterward countless times, just to spot half or more of my team with zero captures.</p>  <p>Now, I understand that some people are sniping and aren’t capping points. Fine. And some are using tanks and aircraft to support the team and won’t have as many captures as some other players or me. I get that, too. My problem is that so many players who aren’t sniping or using tanks seem to just… not take control points.</p>

 <p>I’ve watched players run into the first control point at the start of a match and capture it, then just run around the next one, never going in to cap it or help their team hold it. These aren’t snipers either, but support or assault players. Other times, I see people run to an enemy base, help fight and clear it, and then leave when it’s neutralized but not fully capped. Or some players will cap a base and then never leave it.</p> <p>I don’t care if you only get three kills. I don’t care if you a dozen times. As long as you are helping our team cap points, push forward when it makes sense, and fall back when needed to defend, I’ll be happy. And you’ll likely get more XP and be higher up on the scoreboard, too, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> greatly rewards teamplay and objective support over kills. So help your team win, get to the top of the leaderboard, and have a fun time by capturing control points in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, okay? Please.</p>
