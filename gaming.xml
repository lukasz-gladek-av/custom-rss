		<p>It’s been another great week of gaming at TSA Towers, and for me, that’s meant more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. I’m taking my time rounding out my endgame loadout, as I don’t want to burn through literally everything before Title Update 1 drops with new enemies and quests. Other than that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, enjoying how different it is to my normal fantasy/sci-fi selections. I’m also hopping into Mecha Break, and Titan Quest II, while rounding out a retro-infused review of the Retroid Pocket 5.</p>

<p>First up, as is tradition, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Similarly, <strong>Aran</strong> has been in <em>his</em> gaming happy place by playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt again. He tolds us, “I’ve got the DLC left to do and the final parts of the main quest. All treasure hunts have been completed, all base game contracts fulfilled, and side quests done. Unlike my first playthrough, I have not subjected myself to uncovering all the question marks.”</p>
<p>It’s not all been a Geralt love in though, as he continues, “I’ve also started a new Football Manager 2024 save and a random team picker has pointed me in the direction of FC Brea. They play in the 5th tier of Spanish football, have a 900 capacity stadium, and have no transfer budget. My challenge is to make them a titan unless I get fired. Doesn’t help the board want me to just avoid relegation.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been glued to Mafia III this week and hopes to put a bow on it before the end of the month. He says, “As a sucker for third person cover-based shooters, it’s been a while since I’ve seen those mechanics in a modern AAA game and while Mafia III isn’t quite as fun or fluid as the GOAT, Uncharted 4, it’s got some seriously sharp writing and great set pieces.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been in the hospital this week – get well soon buddy! – which he pegs as, “playing real-life Theme Hospital”. He’s hoping to be well enough for some relaxing gaming, which will probably be Nintendo-flavoured.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing some Assassin’s Creed Shadows as part of our upcoming coverage, as well as Phasmophobia and Balatro.This has been mirrored by Ade who’s game-time has been pretty much non-stop 24-7 all encompassing Assassin’s Creed: Shadows to be review ready for next week. Are you excited?</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> is on his travels in Kanazawa, playing the game of parenting on holiday. He says, “I did see an awesome, original PS1 box in the lobby of this hotel when I checked in last night. Was very impressed. Will take a pic on the way out the door today so everyone can partake in the natsukashii!”</p>
<p>And rounding out the week,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has just got code for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/expelled-is-a-murderous-sequel-to-overboard-coming-out-in-march/">Expelled!</a> the boarding school sequel to Overboard! and he’s looking forward to checking it out over the weekend. Aside from that, he got an early look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">its new 6v6 game mode</a>, and took a trip to see Steel Hunters, the upcoming mech multiplayer game from Wargaming.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atelier-yumia-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Atelier</em> franchise has changed quite a bit over the last few decades. Starting as short, slice-of-life stories, modern entries now feature lengthier adventures and more open worlds. <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3637a1d4-7598-4900-8ea2-69bcc2be9585" href="https://techraptor.net/games/atelier-yumia-alchemist-of-memories-envisioned-land" rel="nofollow">Atelier Yumia</a> </em>brings these changes to their natural conclusion, featuring the largest areas seen in the series so far while also simplifying many of the mechanics to make them more appealing to a new audience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while not being particularly terrible, this leads to a final product that fails to excel in any area. <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> loses the little depth that was left in the <em>Atelier Ryza</em> trilogy, all for a stale open world and underbaked narrative.</p>



<h2>A World Where Alchemy is Taboo</h2>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia</em> sees the titular alchemist traveling across various regions of Aladiss, a place once home to a great empire before it fell to ruin. Joining the Aladiss Research Team, she makes use of alchemy — something considered taboo due to its perceived dangers — to pioneer this long-unexplored continent.</p>

<p>Alchemy’s role in the <em>Atelier</em> series is one that’s always changed, so having it be something that’s considered “evil” in <em>Atelier Yumia</em> doesn’t feel too out of place. There was definitely some potential for conflict with the main cast and the people that Yumia encounters during her journey across Aladiss.</p>

<p>In practice, this doesn’t actually lead to much. A few party members are slightly wary early on, with the negative history of alchemy having its moments during the story. And yet, there’s not really any depth to the conversation around alchemy at any point. Yumia ruminates over it multiple times, but it all boils to down to “what if alchemy is good… AND bad.”</p>

<p>Yumia herself is fine as a character. Even if the general discussion around whether alchemy is really evil isn’t handled in an interesting way, Yumia’s journey to find her place in the research team is often endearing. Other characters aren’t quite as lucky.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-characters.jpg?itok=yOHLw9Mw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-characters.jpg?itok=LziBlu_q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Facial expressions have been much improved in <em>Atelier Yumia</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>For the most part, <em>Atelier Yumia</em> fails to give characters interesting moments outside of the main narrative. There are only a small handful of events per party member, with most offering very little in the way of characterization or just rehashing what we already know about them thanks to the story.</p>

<p>Things are worse when you look outside of the main party. Other than the 6 core party members, there are surprisingly few characters that actually have any importance. This is especially true of the villains, who barely make an appearance for most of the game and have the depth of a puddle.</p>

<h2>The Open World Still Lacks Purpose</h2>

<p>In many ways, the Aladiss continent itself is intended to be the main star of the show. For the first time in the series, <em>Atelier Yumia</em> contains a fully connected map with no loading screens — well, it’s more like 4 distinct regions connected by short corridors, but the point still stands.</p>

<p>You’re free to explore each region as you reach them, roaming around for materials, chests, and collectibles. Outside of some areas requiring specific items and later regions being locked behind story, you have a lot of freedom in where to go.</p>



<p>After being left to my own devices, it was initially exciting having a less linear experience to look forward too. The <em>Atelier</em> franchise has attempted open worlds in their own ways a few times, but even <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e767a144-72f1-42ad-b6f0-926fbc24ca13" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atelier-ryza-3-alchemist-of-end-secret-key-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Atelier Ryza 3</em></a> didn’t make use of areas this large.</p>

<p>However, it didn’t take long for me to realise that there just isn’t that much to actually discover in each area. Sure, opening the map shows lots of “?” markers, but the world itself is devoid of actual unique landmarks or secrets.</p>

<p>Across a region, you’ll find the same sets of materials, the same enemies (or slightly resized/recolored ones), and chests with mostly useless items. You’re never rewarded for going off the beaten path, as all you’ll find are materials you have an abundance of already.</p>

<p>Adding to this repetition are the Prayer Shrines scattered across each region. Every single one works the same way: interact with them, go to the points marked on the map, and complete basic tile puzzles. I was already bored of doing these after the first few times, and there are over 50 in total.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-prayer-shrines.jpg?itok=GbuF05zD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-prayer-shrines.jpg?itok=wmBkjlzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Puzzle design never gets much more complicated than moving a block to the panel right next to it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the end, the world just feels like a checklist, something to fill in and move on rather than properly engage with. Some decent sidequests could have given purpose to more of the map, but most just require you to hand over materials or create a specific item.</p>

<p>Moving to a proper open world also comes with the question of how you’ll balance combat, since players could potentially encounter tough enemies early on if they’re not careful. <em>Atelier Yumia</em> tackles this by removing the challenge from battles entirely.</p>

<h2>Atelier Yumia’s Combat is a Bland Mess</h2>

<p>The <em>Atelier Ryza</em> trilogy started to shift battles to a more actiony style, with <em>Atelier Yumia </em>switching things over to full real-time combat. You can actively dodge attacks, or move out of the way of AOE markers. You don’t have complete control however, with movement constrained to inner and outer rings you can switch between freely.</p>

<p>Each character has access to 4 skills while standing in each ring, which charge up over time. Some skills can be used repeatedly as a combo, while others require recharging after a single use. Items also function this way, though finite consumables have not been a thing in <em>Atelier</em> combat for a while now anyway.</p>



<p>Skill can have certain effects (Yumia can buff her attack or debuff the enemy), but in practice, all you really do is mash your basic combo and then use one of the other skills while it recharges. There’s no depth, no thought you have to put in. What you see in the first few hours is essentially what you’ll be doing during the endgame.</p>

<p>A few systems have been implemented in a vain attempt to give combat some sort of interesting hook. Using physical or magic attacks on an enemy enough times will stun them, letting you follow up with stronger item attacks. But this is never actually needed since your regular attacks are always more than enough to take on every enemy.</p>

<p>It’s annoying that, despite the switch to action combat, everything is more restrictive. You can’t switch targets — a lot of enemies are even grouped together with a single health bar — and you rarely have a reason to switch between characters.</p>

<h2>Alchemy Lost Its Depth</h2>

<p>Another part of why combat is so easy comes down to alchemy. Alchemy has always allowed players to become super powerful if they made use of its systems, synthesizing broken gear or items as soon as possible.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-alchemy.jpg?itok=S59NyV1W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-alchemy.jpg?itok=zV8W0lVQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alchemy generally boils down to spamming the highest quality materials you have.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Atelier Yumia</em>’s issue is that alchemy has been simplified to a level where making overpowered gear requires very little effort. In the past, you’d have to think more about the types of materials used, taking traits from them and transferring them over to the finished product.</p>

<p>Now, most bonuses are determined by skills you select before synthesis, or via Trait Crystals you can equip after. Alchemy just boils down to throwing in your highest-quality items and making use of the building system to duplicate them for free (more on this in a minute).</p>

<p>By the second region, I was already making gear that easily destroyed anything I encountered — even the few bosses <em>Atelier Yumia</em> has went down in a minute. Again, this is not something completely new to <em>Atelier</em>. But the process of making gear has just been dumbed down completely, meaning that even tackling harder difficulties takes much less preparation.</p>

<h2>Building Had Potential But is Underutilized</h2>

<p>One bizarre aspect of <em>Atelier Yumia</em> is building. Some areas of the map are designated as areas where you can build structures. This system is surprisingly robust, letting you create multistory houses to fill with decorations and crafting stations. There are presets if you want to quickly create a base, and even the option to make random ones.</p>

<p>I call this bizarre because there’s essentially no reason to actually make a proper base. You get the same benefit from building a fully furnished base as you would from making a shack with 50 chairs stacked into each other. A strange choice, when a good chunk of chest rewards in the open world are more building items you’ll now likely never use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-building.jpg?itok=N3mg2MJ1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-building.jpg?itok=xszJi64o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might not like it, but this is what peak comfort looks like.</figcaption></figure><p>It has so much potential — imagine if you could build rooms for party members to unlock new events or create new towns for NPCs. Instead, you’re restricted to small squares of land that are spread far apart.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you’re better off using land for greenhouses or manufacturing plants. These let you duplicate raw materials and crafted items respectively, only taking time to do so. Greenhouses unlock incredibly early, reducing the need for gathering materials. It’s convenient, but it also doesn’t mesh with an open world that mostly just exists for gathering materials in the first place.</p>

<p>I can only hope that this is expanded upon in <em>Atelier Yumia 2</em> (or a potential spin-off), as freeform building really feels like it could be an interesting direction for the series to take.</p>

<h2>Some Visual Improvements, Though PC Port Might Have Issues</h2>

<p>Modern <em>Atelier</em> has never been at the forefront of graphic fidelity, though <em>Atelier Yumia</em> does try to improve in some aspects. For one, characters are far more expressive. Early 3D <em>Atelier</em> titles often had character models that could look lifeless, relying on great 2D character portraits to carry things instead.</p>

<p>For <em>Atelier Yumia</em>, it seems like a lot of work has been done to fix this. From subtle eye movements to cocky grins, the main cast are far more lively now. Granted, the actual models still have a few issues (namely, low-resolution textures at times), though it's a welcome improvement.</p>

<p>Environments, on the other hand, aren't a huge improvement, though some of this can likely be chalked up to the focus on bigger areas compared to previous games. Some areas suffer from poor draw distances and pop-in, too, though this isn't overly common.</p>

<p>One area that I'm not 100% sold on is performance. While I have confirmation that a day 1 patch is intended to fix this, I ran into a number of issues with performance. This was almost exclusively tied to travelling between regions or making use of fast travel, causing my framerate to drop significantly until reloading my save.</p>

<p>Outside of this, everything generally ran at a solid 120fps on an RTX 3060 TI, barring a couple of areas with heavier visual effects. Again, this is something that shouldn't be present at launch, though it's worth keeping in mind when looking back at other Atelier ports on PC pre-<em>Ryza 3</em>.</p>

<h2>Atelier Yumia Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia</em> has no elements that are inherently awful, but the changes it makes to the series don’t work overall. Future games need to rethink some of the simplifications to synthesis while also figuring out a way to make open worlds that are actually worth exploring.</p>

We discussed this Pokémon in detail already, but in short, the new Trainer cards in Space-Time Smackdown have shifted the fundamentals of competitive battling so much that Darkrai’s bench-sitting playstyle is simultaneously one of the safest and most dangerous options you can find.</p><p>That said, a single Pokemon can’t carry a deck, and Darkrai ex really needs a companion that can hit for huge damage on the front lines. You might think this calls for a heavy hitter like Nidoqueen or Toxicroak, but it turns out the answer is…Magnezone? An Electric-type Pokémon who consumes Electric Energy every time it attacks? How does that work?</p><p>It’s a weird card choice on paper, but in practice, Magnezone isn’t just a great companion to Darkrai ex; it’s a powerful card that you can theoretically fit into any deck, regardless of element.

The new variant of Magnemite found in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion only inflicts 10 damage, but you can use any type of Energy to activate it. Truthfully, you’ll hardly ever use this attack, but it’s nice to have the option in case it’s all you have in the early game. The real hero here is the Magneton variant found in the base Genetic Apex set, all because of its ability <strong>Volt Charge</strong>. This attaches an Electric Energy to the magnet monster every turn (so long as you remember to use it). <strong>Magneton and Magnezone both only <em>need</em> one Electric Energy, so you can still use Dark-type Energy to build up their attacks</strong>.</p><p>In a perfect world, the Darkrai ex and Magneton strategy looks like this: lead with a wall like <strong>Druddigon </strong>or <strong>Kangaskhan</strong>, and keep Darkrai ex and Magnemite on your bench. Evolve Magnemite into Magneton, stall the game so Magneton can passively accrue Electric Energy, and keep attaching Dark Energy to Darkrai ex to chip away at your opponent’s health. Switch to Magnezone once you can (either after your wall is knocked out or by using the <strong>Leaf </strong>Trainer Card), and start laying the smack down with its 110 damage <strong>Thunder Blast </strong>attack. If Magnezone goes down, or it runs out of Electric Energy, bring in Darkrai ex to clean up the rest of the game. Because Darkrai ex is the only ex card in this deck, it’s best used after your opponent has already scored two other KOs, unless you know you can lock in a victory by bringing it in later.</p><p><strong>What makes Magnezone so deadly is that, even if you can’t stall, it’s <em>still</em> very powerful</strong>. For example, let’s say you start the game with a Magnemite, Magneton, <em>and </em>Magnezone. Evolve Magnemite into Magneton as soon as you can, and activate Volt Charge upon evolution. Then on your following turn, make sure to use Volt Charge again <em>before </em>evolving Magneton into Magnezone, and just like that, you have two Electric Energy that are good for two uses of Thunder Blast. Slap Dark Energy on it to meet the three Energy minimum requirement, and you can immediately begin to pick up easy KOs. Alternatively, if your opponent has a relatively weak monster on the front lines, you can keep Magneton in play and use <strong>Spinning Attack </strong>to pick up a KO without consuming valuable Electric Energy. It’s surprisingly versatile!</p><p>Getting doubles of each Pokémon to use in a deck is undoubtedly a pain (I’ve been working with a single Darkrai ex myself, and I consider even that lucky). But once you’ve assembled those pieces, all you need are a handful of trainer cards to complete your deck. <strong>Professor’s Research</strong>, <strong>Poké Ball</strong>, and <strong>Leaf </strong>are common staples in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, and you’ll want two of each of them. You only need one <strong>Cyrus</strong>, and a <strong>Giovanni</strong> can help you lock in KOs. From there you can slot in a <strong>Sabrina</strong>, <strong>Dawn</strong>, <strong>Giant Cape</strong>, or <strong>Rocky Helmet</strong> to round out your support. Just keep in mind that, as the competitive landscape evolves, other Trainer Cards may become more prevalent to counter new threats.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-recommend-id="image://b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-recommend-id="image://b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As strong as the above cards are, they are absolutely vulnerable to counterplay. <strong>Grass-type decks</strong> can shake off Darkrai ex’s perpetual chip damage thanks to cards like <strong>Erika </strong>and the passive healing of Shaymin’s <strong>Fragrant Flower Garden</strong> ability. <strong>Exeggutor ex</strong> is a standout, boosting a whopping 160 HP while also inflicting 40 or 80 damage per turn at the cost of just one Grass Energy. Since Darkrai ex and Weavile ex are both weak to grass, cards like <strong>Celebi ex</strong> can be especially threatening with average luck.</p><p><strong>Fighting-type decks </strong>also offer some attractive counterplay options, despite being relatively niche in the current competitive landscape. In fact, player JeremiahTheGreat caused a stir in the recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/678569cc1c64910a07ac1929/details&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/678569cc1c64910a07ac1929/details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hooglandia &amp; Spragels Open Tournament</a></span> by building a deck around <strong>Aerodactyl ex </strong>and <strong>Lucario</strong>, which was the <em>only </em>non-Darkrai ex team to crack the top eight. Aside from those picks, <strong>Hitmonlee </strong>is practically tailor-made to counter stall strategies with <strong>Stretch Kick</strong>, which completely bypasses walls like Druddigon. Magnezone and Weezing are both weak to fighting attacks too.</p><p>Regardless of your deck’s type, <strong>Sabrina </strong>and <strong>Cyrus </strong>really help against Darkrai ex and Magnezone. Because these two Pokémon need to spend their first turns setting up, you can seriously put your opponent on the backfoot by causing disruptions in the early game. For instance, as long as you know you can get a hit on either of the two monsters by drawing them out with Sabrina, they’ll be vulnerable to your Cyrus card later to finish the job with a strong attack. Remember, while your opponent <em>wants </em>to start with a wall to hide their Darkrai ex behind, they won’t<em> always </em>start the game with the right cards. If you see an opening to hit Darkrai ex early, you can set up for a KO later that can seal the game for you. Your opponent is <em>specifically </em>counting on you to never claim those two points!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company went on to explain that the Rite of the Nine activities accidentally leaked in Update 8.2.5 were in an extremely early state with temporary art and "fake perk rolls."

<p>The Soulslike genre is adding another meaty release to its catalog in 2025—The First Berserker Khazan. There’s a lot to love from intense boss fights to a strong protagonist. Let’s see if Xbox Game Pass has the chance to add The First Berserker Khazan to the subscription service.</p>



<p>I’m very excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>—as are most Souls fans. It’s got a distinct and notable JRPG flair to its graphics, but FromSoftware—and contemporaries such as Stellar Blade and Black Myth Wukong—would be proud of its bullish combat. Each strike and movement is lit up perfectly by the dazzling and striking art style.</p>



<p>I think Khazan will go beyond being a “sleeper hit.” But if it can secure a partnership with Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, The First Berserker Khazan is on the way to a violent victory.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play The First Berserker Khazan on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gritty and gory. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan is sadly not coming to Xbox Game Pass anytime soon.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple: Not every title arrives on Xbox Game Pass (or PS Plus) on its first day. Whether it’s because the developer and publisher aren’t interested, or Microsoft isn’t, we do know Khazan is destined to be a solo release available across multiple platforms on March 27.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass hasn’t been mentioned in a single The First Berserker Khazan trailer. Another very telling sign is if you go to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-berserker-khazan-standard-edition/9NH8P6S460LD/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan’s Xbox Store Page</a>, you’ll see there’s no Game Pass label. It’s a standalone release not partnering up with any of the big brands for exclusivity.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will The First Berserker Khazan Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>The success of The First Berserker Khazan likely determines a future Xbox Game Pass nod.</strong></p>



<p>This doesn’t mean unsuccessful games are omitted from Xbox Game Pass consideration. Struggling titles gain a bigger, much-needed audience thanks to Game Pass. However, Game Pass doesn’t have too many AAA Soulslikes currently, but it’s silly to think Microsoft doesn’t want some piece of a successful pie.</p>



<p>2023’s Lords of the Fallen is on there. Plus, the semi-Soulsy nature of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is available. So it is hit and miss if this ever happens. My advice is to <strong>take a shot on Khazan and see if it’s for you</strong>.</p>



<p>We’ll update this page if The First Berserker Khazan does come to Microsoft’s service.</p>



<hr>



<p>Am I overplaying the potential of The First Berserker Khazan? Or can it knock on the Game of the Year door come December?</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared the announcement on social media, along with the news the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a> series has sold over 5m copies worldwide.</p>
<p>The sales figure further cements Final Fantasy as one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, even if sales have dipped in more recent years.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy is on a par with the likes of Assassin's Creed and The Sims, having sold more than the Sonic the Hedgehog series and the Legend of Zelda series. However, it remains far behind the Mario franchise, Tetris, Call of Duty, Pokémon, GTA, Minecraft, and FIFA.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, the PS1 era was collectively the most successful for Final Fantasy. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> sold almost 15m copies, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> sold 12m copies, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> sold 8.9m copies. Elsewhere Final Fantasy 12 sold 11.3m, Final Fantasy 15 sold 10.3m, Final Fantasy 13 sold 9.6m, and Final Fantasy 10 sold almost 9m (thanks <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy#Sales_history">Video Game Sales Wiki</a>).</p>
<p>However, they all pale in comparison to Final Fantasy 14 at 24m sales. In 2021 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">MMORPG was the most profitable game in the series</a>, and in financial reports since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-revenue-kept-afloat-thanks-to-final-fantasy-14">often kept the company afloat</a> where other games have failed to meet expectations.</p> <div>

<p>More recently, while Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">both follow-up Rebirth and the next series entry Final Fantasy 16 "did not meet expectations"</a> according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Still, the 5m sales for the Pixel Remasters - revamped versions of the first six games in the series - is good news for the company, proving both nostalgia and interest in older games from series fans and newcomers.</p>
<p>And with Square Enix's multiplatform strategy, sales are expected to increase. Most recently, Rebirth was released on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-pc-port-has-promise-but-too-many-problems">even if the port has issues</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Pixel Remasters were added to Xbox last September</a> in addition to their previous release on Switch, PC, PlayStation, and mobile.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Rockstar-approved GTA 5 modding tool is on the cars, I mean cards, for all of you PC players out there.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, and several years after the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">the game's next-gen features finally arrived on PC as part of a free update for all existing users</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Cfx.re - that is to say, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-hires-a-team-of-modders-it-had-previously-banned-from-playing-gta-5">Rockstar hired in 2023, and which was behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and RDR2 RedM multiplayer mods</a> - is working on a "conversion tool" which will "assist the modding community in making their assets compatible with the new upgrade". This is as any custom assets used on FiveM and GTA 5 Legacy are not "natively compatible" with Rockstar's newly-launched PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/coming-soon-new-official-modding-utility/5312475">laid out by Cfx.re</a>, the team's upcoming conversion tool will support the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictionaries of multiple drawables (*.ydd)</li>
<li>Generic models, geometry, optional embedded textures and lights (*.ydr)</li>
<li>Complex fragmented skeletons/models used for pedestrians, vehicles, destructible objects, etc. (*.yft)</li>
<li>Texture Dictionaries (also known as TXD) (*ytd.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cfx.re noted file types such as .ycd and .ybn will not require any conversion.</p>
<p>The tool itself does not have a release date as yet, with Cfx.re stating it still has a few bits and pieces it needs to sort out before it is ready to be debuted. For now, it just says "coming soon", and the team said it will share a more thorough breakdown of what the tool will include at a later date.</p>
<p>As to why this is a pretty big deal, well, Rockstar has been rather strict with mods in the past.  Back in 2017, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">called time on the 'Liberty City in GTA5' mod</a>, saying that while it "generally [would] not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties", it would not allow "use or importation of other IP", including its own. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, just this January, the creators of an impressive mod which added a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to GTA5 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">removed their own project from the public eye following a discussion with Rockstar</a>. </p>

<p>Following its debut on Steam, GTA 5 Enhanced has welcomed a healthy number of players. At the time of writing, there are still 108,568 of us heisting cars and getting up to who knows what over on Valve's platform.</p>

            <p>
Konami have given us our first proper look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, a new incarnation of the survival horror series from Hong Kong-based Neobards Entertainment, which takes place in 1960s Japan. You are Shimizu Hinako, a schoolgirl equipped with the trademark Silent Hill combo of a broken-off pipe and a cartload of psychological baggage, whose hometown Ebisugaoka is engulfed by a monstrous fog.</p>
<p>The choice of a non-US setting has ruffled the plumage of players who cherish Silent Hill's association with Twin Peaks and New England. Personally, I welcome the departure after the heady retro fidelity of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and besides, the overall ambience doesn't seem <em>that</em> far removed from the elder Hills. Look, they've even got Akira Yamaoka contributing to the soundtrack. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It looks like Silent Hill's trademark dimension shifts are back as well, but the new game's realm shifts appear to be more bio-horror-ish, with crimson roots and lambent, trumpet-shaped blossoms consuming the geometry rather than Silent Hill's usual flavour of blood, rust and toilet bowl detritus. It's almost pretty, as you might expect from a game that challenges you to "embrace the beauty hidden within terror, or succumb to the madness that lies ahead". Perhaps the "f" in the title stands for "flower". Or perhaps it stands for "face peeling off". Or perhaps it stands for "flipping get a move on and embed the trailer".

<p>

I've never heard of Neobards before, and naturally, I'm wondering whether they have the chops to pull a Silent Hill game off. Founded in 2017, they've worked in a support capacity on games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a> and several Resident Evil projects. They appear to have one first-party release to their name, the mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> M. I don't know what to make of them, but I will give them kudos for having a poem on <a href="https://neobards.com/game-maker/">their portfolio page</a> that (accidentally?) references the Three Musketeers.  
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f also features writing from Ryukishi07, author of the When They Cry visual novel series. The plot certainly seems to be in keeping with his taste for the macabre: according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/">the Steam page</a>, the game "contains depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence". The developers say that some of this difficult material reflects "the customs and culture" of the day. They're probably not talking about the dislocated dolls on stabby stick legs, which strike me as horrifying regardless of era.
</p>
<p>
If you're genuinely floored and flummoxed by this being set in Japan, you might prefer to see it as a spiritual successor to Forbidden Siren, the PS2 survival horror game Keiichiro Toyama directed and co-wrote after co-writing and directing the original Silent Hill. I remember having a ripe old time in Siren lurking behind barrels "sight-jacking" manky Shibito. If it had ever made it to PC, I'd have volunteered it for our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">best horror games</a>.

<p>Call of Duty 2025 zombies could have six fully-fledged round-based zombies maps throughout the games life cycle, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Call of Duty 2025, which will be led by Treyarch Games, could have a total of six round-based zombies maps during the games lifecycle. Details of what Call of Duty 2025 is shaping up to be is already an open secret, including that the game is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2 sequel</a> and that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original zombies crew is likely making a return</a>.</p>



<p>In the maps early development, it’s understood that the plan for zombies was to build the maps from the ground up to allow them to be played in different gamemodes including traditional round-based, grief, and outbreak. </p>



<p>Its understood that Treyarch was playing around with more “out there” settings this time around, including a map set in post-WW2 New York where the Nazi’s had dropped a nuclear bomb, with another map being described as being set in a Japanese temple at the foot of an erupting volcano. </p>



<p>Other ideas included a map set in Vietnam, one in Afghanistan, and another out-there idea of one being set in a space station in the Dark Aether. </p>



<p>As already leaked from a feedback session, it’s also understood that Call of Duty 2025 zombies will have one of its biggest maps to date and have a similar transportation system to Tranzit. </p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if Treyarch went with every idea, but we’d expect at least a few to make it into the final game.</p>



<p>What do you think of the map ideas and the original zombies crew returning to the Call of Duty zombies in some form?

            <p>DC Comics and Sega have released a first look at their Justice League and Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series, including Sonic dressed as The Flash and Shadow as Batman.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fragpunk-team-posts-%E2%80%98disgusting%E2%80%99-response-to-spectre-divide-shutdown-before-deleting-it.1134423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-team-disgusting-response-spectre-divide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, it was announced that after just a few months on the market and amid the failure of the game’s first season, both Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios will be shutting down next month. Spectre Divide, an ambitious first-person multiplayer shooter, was first released in August 2024, but the player base quickly dwindled.</p>



<p>The Mountaintop team revealed that, despite funding, the game isn’t making enough money to remain online or support the studio, so it’s being closed down. In response, the team at FragPunk, which is another free-to-play multiplayer shooter released just a week ago, posted an image on social media that has been slammed as ‘disgusting’ by the Mountaintop team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-might-not-age-well">That Might Not Age Well</h2>



<p>The FragPunk post has now been removed, but not before eagle-eyed gamers grabbed screenshots:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the first people to share this online was Marcus Schubert, one of the producers working at Mountaintop Studios. He <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/schuby_netease-games-this-is-disgusting-shame-activity-7306005072939794432-SxA6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NetEase Games, this is disgusting. Shame on you. For those unaware, the top post is our farewell letter indicating that Mountaintop Studios is shutting down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>FragPunk is published by NetEase, the same gaming titan behind the overwhelmingly successful Marvel Rivals. The post was likely the work of a social media intern or community manager somewhere, but that shouldn’t be used as an excuse to brush it under the rug. </p>



<p>At a time when studio closures, cancellations, and layoffs are tearing the industry apart, publishers and developers should support one another rather than mocking the downfall of a hard-working team. If recent trends are anything to go by (XDefiant and Concord, for example), then FragPunk shouldn’t potentially be casting stones in a glass house.</p>



<p>Presently, FragPunk has a peak on Steam of more than 110,000 players, while Spectre Divide peaked at just 26,200. However, XDefiant had millions of players, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/">we all know what happened</a> with that.</p>

It means the console is often processing audio and sending it to the CPU at a different rate than Nintendo has communicated, and as the DSP fluctuates, so too does the game’s speed even if it’s in small, unrecognizable ways.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/gettyimages-2189100477-1741939851931.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The SNES appears to be getting faster with age. Photo by Aldara Zarraoa/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all fine and good, but where things get interesting is how that number has changed in the last 34 years. Cecil <a href="https://nextcloud.tas.bot/index.php/apps/forms/s/TJDiEwP6J7HFfYbPRw4A7dHN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>asked SNES owners to record data</u></a> related to their SNES units after noticing slightly higher DSP rates that were even more out of the ordinary than previously documented. The more than 140 responses gathered so far show an undeniable trend in increased DSP rates in recent measurements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some previously recorded average DSP numbers for the SNES’s SPC700 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tas.bot/post/3lkbnvrccek2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hovered at 32,040Hz in 2007</a> — Cecil’s findings raise that average to 32,076Hz. Factors such as hot and cold environments do play a part in higher and lower stats, too, but not by enough to alter DSP in the way needed to yield these results. In other words, it looks like the SNES is processing audio faster as time goes on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Therefore, temperature is less significant. Why? How does it affect games? We do not know. Yet.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Based on 143 responses, the SNES DSP rate averages 32,076Hz, rising 8Hz from cold to warm,” Cecil explained in a follow-up <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tas.bot/post/3ljqmi5hwbc2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bluesky post</u></a> fit with <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/fpwWkqDcnxXR/SNES-SMP-speed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a layout of the data</u></a>. “Warm DSP rates go from 31,965 to 32,182Hz, a 217Hz range. Therefore, temperature is less significant. Why? How does it affect games? We do not know. Yet.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Any%</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Cecil admits that, while fascinating, more research is needed to determine not only how much faster SNES units are processing game audio but what exactly the cause is. Data related to how consoles performed in their first decade on the market, for example, is limited. For now, at least on the surface, Nintendo’s second major home console appears to be aging quite gracefully as it nears its 35th birthday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of what exactly might be behind these bizarre circumstances, the prospect of a popular gaming console gradually causing games to run faster has made waves in the speedrunning community. An SPC700 progressively processing audio to the CPU quicker than intended could, in theory, impact game performance by shortening load times in certain sections. Audio processing faster in 2025 than it did in an identical speedrun from 1990 could potentially send more than three decades of leaderboard rankings and records into question. Thankfully, how a wiser SNES might affect a Super Mario World speedrun isn’t so straightforward.</p><div id="nintendo-consoles" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Consoles</h3><h3>Nintendo Consoles</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">APU speeds aren’t a one-to-one translation to visual game speed. In reality, even the most extreme circumstances related to these new findings would likely only shave off less than one second of your average speedrun. How each game might benefit from altered audio processing is also up for debate, and there’s no indication of how significantly longer speedruns could be impacted at the time of this story’s publication. The speedrunning community's research is in its infancy, but even as further experimentation is conducted, the consensus for now is that players have little to fear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Cecil continues digging into what makes the SNES tick, Nintendo’s console is charging through its 30s and feeling better than ever.

			<p>Back in my day, branded storage solutions were lucky to have more than a small decal slapped onto the side of it. Even my Outsiders-themed external drive that powered my PlayStation 5's extra storage was little more than a silk-screened logo atop one of Western Digital's WD_Black P10 drive. For many gamers, picking a themed hard drive to match the aesthetic of their setup, or merely support their favorite character or franchise, meant sacrificing performance for style. Seagate has proven this wrong with their numerous Limited Edition HDD and SSDs to date. Their latest release is a special collaboration with mihoYo for Genshin Impact, which Seagate sent me to try out for an unboxing and to take on the road to GDC next week.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, we're unboxing the latest in Seagate's line of Limited Edition Gaming SSD's based on one of Genshin Impact's earliest Electro Units: Cyno. This pocket-sized 1TB external drive is smaller than your average deck of playing cards. Coming in at just under 100x50x11mm, this&nbsp; drive was a no-brainer to throw into my everyday carry for when I need to capture some footage or snag a recording off a capture station.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The bright purple styling representing Cyno immediately stands out among the packages of other drives and headsets on my office wall, but no one buys a hard drive just to leave it sealed in box. Inside the package are just enough goodies to take this drive for a spin and immediately start storing your favorite content on-the-go. All around the unit are some runic designs, with a logo on the underside not quite the usual icon you'd see for Cyno in game but recognizable enough by the Anubis motif. Similar to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/seagate-releases-starfield-xbox-game-drive-but-your-xbox-series-wont-play-the-game-from-it/">Starfield</a> line of Seagate's Limited Edition drives, there is a full LED bar across the front shorter edge of the SSD. A small status LED also pokes out through the short edge of the drive opposite the USB Type-C 3.2 port.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>With only a 65 gram weight, this Genshin Impact-themed drive can easily fit in a knapsack without even noticing it's there. Thumb drives used to be my transfer method of choice when it comes to snagging screenshots and video footage off my PlayStation 5 for reviews, but now that external SSD's like these have become more readily available and lightweight, I've reformed my ways. Seagate claims that the drive comes with both a three-year warranty and three years of their Rescue Data Recovery Services, so if one of my transfers does wind up going back, at least there's a chance to recover it.</p>

<p>The Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition SSD is truly a limited affair, being limited exclusively to their <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/special-editions/genshin-impact-external-ssd/">online webstore</a> at $139.99. While the price comes in higher than most of their other themed drives, this one is a unique bit of kit that I could see Genshin Impact fans picking up for more Cyno merch representation in their homes.</p>

		<p>When it comes to game studios that thrive on the personalities who founded and lead them, none are quite as exciting to me as Too Kyo Games. Founded in 2017, it’s a team that has spent the last seven years producing games and even anime based on the combined creative visions of three incredible figures of the industry – <em>Zero Escape</em> series director Kotaro Uchikoshi, <em>Danganronpa</em> director Kazutaka Kodaka and series character designer Rui Komatsuzaki. Since their careers skyrocketed off the cult success of the death-game focused visual novel thrillers all three spent years working on, they’ve developed a variety of other projects that have either been exciting advancements of the ideas from their prior works or entirely new visions altogether. None of these have been a major breakout hit on the scale of <em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape,&nbsp;</em>though. That fact and the common tone of detective death-game mystery that runs through them all has made it hard not to see a game like <em>The Hundred Line – Last Defense Academy,&nbsp;</em>sporting familiarly zany character designs by Rui Komatsuzaki, and assume it’s just another one of those. After spending time with its demo, though, it’s clear this game is so much more than that.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-｜English Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLjz8umrD1E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For one thing, this isn’t another game about a bunch of amnesiacs locked inside a school. Our protagonist Takumi Sumino is a regular red-haired anime teenager living in the totally normal Tokyo Residential Complex – which is a place separated from the rest of the world by a giant overhead dome but don’t even worry about that. You also shouldn’t worry about the daily siren alerts indicating nearby monster activity – except one day, those monsters actually break through the giant dome, and amidst the chaos and bloodshed, a weird little mascot character approaches Takumi and hands him a knife – instructing him to transform and fight off the invaders by stabbing himself in the chest with said knife.</p>


<p>Soon after, Takumi wakes up inside a mysterious classroom with no idea how he got there (okay so I lied there’s a <em>little&nbsp;</em>bit of amnesiacs locked inside school in this one), and no idea why he’s surrounded by a bunch of other people. It turns out, the stab-yourself-to-transform deal was pitched to a bunch of other people, and they’re now all tasked with living inside this school and fending off any invading monsters for 100 days in order to save humanity. It’s a pitch that leaves far more questions than answers – both for the player and the characters wrapped up in it. This is the kind of mystery and intrigue that made the very first&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>game so iconic – the story could go anywhere with how layered the mysteries of the game world are, and even after wrapping the demo up I could so the full release going in any direction.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the demo does paint a pretty clear picture of what you’ll be doing for each of those 100 days – and it’s a refreshing blend of tactical RPG combat, life-simulation hangout events, and environmental exploration that will hit hard for fans of <em>Persona 5</em> or&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses.&nbsp;</em>Tactics battles are pretty standard grid-based encounters, where each of your characters has a different shaped grid for their attacks – one character might strike in a straight line, while another hits in a wider cluster of grid squares. Each turn you’ve got a set amount of Action Points to spend to bust out your actions, but there’s a couple other options mixed in that keep things a little fresh. A Voltage gauge fills up as you attack, letting you spend a bar from it to either give a student an additional move or let them perform a special technique.</p>
<p>On top of that, though, characters can bust out an extremely powerful attack that comes at the cost of their own life – just for the battle, though. They’ll come back after the fight, and you even get additional level-up points from that sacrifice, encouraging a risk-reward balance where you’re tempted to axe your characters in every fight to grind out as much upgrade currency without losing so many characters that you can’t actually win the battle. I was surprised by how much this one mechanic improved the excitement of every battle for me – basic RPG bouts suddenly became resource management mania and I was addicted to min-maxing every encounter I could.</p>

<p>The demo for<em> The Hundred Line – Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>is an extremely small slice of the full cake, but it’s already promising to be a more feature-rich and varied experience than prior titles from the creators involved. I’m excited to see just how far this game goes when the full release arrives in April.</p>

            <p>Here's one for the sci-fi slurping doomers among us. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hello-sunshine">Hello Sunshine</a> is a "survival mystery RPG" from the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/draugen">Draugen</a>, in which you must navigate a blistering desert by sheltering in the constantly moving shadow of a friendly robot. A collapsed corporation called Sunshine has turned the planet into a scorched wasteland leaving behind only warring mechs and dusty vending machines. "You play the final employee," say developers Red Thread Games. "Walk in the shadow of a giant robot during the sweltering days; stay close to keep warm during the cold nights." I wonder if any of this is a metaphor. Ah, who cares, it's got a cool trailer.</p>

<p>You're trying to reach a distant tower, where you'll "help decide the fate of what remains of this world." But to get there you have to take advantage of your big metal friend's shadow to survive the otherwise skin-frying sun rays. Along the way you'll scavenge food, salvage mechanical bits 'n' bobs, upgrade your big bot, and deploy smaller drones to help map the surroundings and gather useful gear. When night falls the temperature plummets and you'll have to snuggle up to the robot, where you can cook food and tinker with equipment. </p>
<p>"At first, the colossus barely acknowledges you," says the blurb on the game's Steam page. "Over time, your bond strengthens. Assist the robot with repairs, install upgrades, and unlock new ways to interact. In return, the metal giant will aid you on your journey — locating secrets hidden in the desert, lifting you past obstacles, shielding you from threats, fighting back against hostile war machines."</p>
<p>You'll also be able to give your post-apocalyptic pal a paint job, and add decals to his shiny metal chassis. Interestingly, it looks like there'll be a co-op mode too, which seems to pit one player as the human and another as the sand-stomping big lad.</p>
<p>"Team up with a friend (or workmate) to experience the journey from different perspectives," say the devs. "Coordinate scavenging runs, trade resources, and explore how your peculiar partnership shapes the unfolding narrative."</p>
<p>Red Thread Games previously made road trip adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dustborn">Dustborn</a>, which saw a bunch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dustborn-is-the-latest-addition-to-the-nascent-misfits-on-a-road-trip-genre">misfits crossing a dystopian United States</a> with a comic-booky "words are magic" schtick. Before that they made first-person mystery Draugen, in which you explored an abandoned Norwegian village called Graavik for clues about your missing sister. Alice B (RPS in peace) thought it was OK. "Draugen does a lot of tropes very well," she said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/draugen-review">in her review</a>, "but it does others in a tired way that garners side eye from me... Graavik, meanwhile, remains a nice place to visit. But you wouldn’t want to live there."</p>
<p>Hello Sunshine doesn't have a release date yet. It's only listed as "coming soon". We'll let you know when more information comes trudging over the horizon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> hath been Patched, Adorning the Right Goode <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with the Wondrous Art of Barbering and the Dark Science of Steamworks Modding, together with Sundry Fixes for Quests, Crashing and Performance Problems, Skills and NPC Behavioure. Yes, I'm aware the previous sentence can't work out which century it's in. In a perfect world I'd have had the time to dig out a medieval dictionary and translate this introduction into proper 15th century English. As it is, you'll have to make do with the one middle English word I can reliably remember from university: ywys! It means "indeed". This latest Deliverance 2 update? A mighty addition, ywys.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The full patch notes are <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2">here</a>. Be warned that they are long. Easily as long as The Canterbury Tales, and almost as exciting, because while The Canterbury Tales has more scenes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miller's_Tale">paramours accidentally kissing their beloved's hairy bottoms</a>, the Deliverance 2 patch notes have Chaucer beat in terms of minutiae such as "improved physics of the parsnip". Here are a few other tweaks I enjoyed: "Shops no longer sell cobwebs"; "fixed looped drinking sound after being killed when drinking"; "fixed raining inside of a barn in Zhelejov"; "fixed the issue where a civilian would not stop banishing the player's horse".
</p>
<p>
As for the new features: you'll find the above-mentioned barbers across Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. They operate out of festive white tents, and offer a range of period-appropriate makeovers. No textured drop fades, I think. The patch notes also make mention of some significant tune-ups for the pickpockets and cat burglars amongst you: Warhorse have "created new clothing and equipment specifically supporting stealth gameplay and rebalanced stealth stats for all clothing".  That said, "stealth kills are now more likely to fail", and people now scream when they're stealth-killed. 
</p>
<p>
I don't think I ever did any stealthing in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 unless required to by a quest. I had my heart set on being an upstanding citizen who improves his prospects by way of honest industry and charisma. Being nudged to "break playstyle" by a quest is one of the chief criticisms in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review</a>, incidentally. Still, I'm happy that the shadow-hugging blaggards amongst you are getting some love.</p>
<p>Are you still playing KCD2, or have the draconic wiles of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> lured you away from rustic Bohemia? KCD2 does have "dragon bones", it must be said, though I've yet to work out whether they're from an actual dragon, or what they're even for beyond tantalising the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> players.

            <p>While Nintendo itself is still keeping any firm <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> details under wraps until its dedicated showcase next month, analysts believe the company is on course to deliver the biggest launch in game industry history.</p>
<p>According to several <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus">Bloomberg</a> analysts, it is expected that the Switch 2 will be more expensive than its predecessor, with the upcoming console potentially retailing for $400 or more - around £310 here in the UK.</p>
<p>"The original Switch's Nvidia chip is estimated to cost $80 per unit, while the Switch 2's chip is likely to be in the $130-$150 range," Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said. "I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo goes ahead with $499."</p>

</figure>
<p>While Yasuda expects a slightly higher price point than others, fellow industry analysts including Serkan Toto, Yijia Zhai of UBS and Robin Zhu of Sanford C Bernstein believe Nintendo's upcoming console will see an increase of around $100 or more over the original Switch's $299 price point. External factors will also be a consideration on the console's debut, such as the US tariffs.</p>
<p>But, even with this expected higher price tag, the analysts all agree that the Switch 2 will have an auspicious debut.</p>
<p>"They will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price," Toto said. "We can expect a great software line-up in year one, from new Mario Kart and 3D Mario after eight years to Pokémon Legends: Z-A and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>. There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like Call of Duty."</p>
<p>Zhu currently expects Nintendo to release its Switch 2 console this June, adding the company has a first-day inventory of 6m to 8m units, which would make it the biggest console launch ever. As Bloomberg notes, the Switch sold 2.7m units during its first month on the market, while Sony's two most recent PlayStation launches each sold 4.5m units in their respective first quarters.</p>
<p>Macquarie Capital analyst Hiroshi Yamashina, meanwhile, forecasts sales of 20m units during the console's first year on the market.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is overhauling its trade feature following pushback from players.</p>
<p>The ability to trade Pokémon has been a key feature of the series since its beginnings, and in January it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">finally added to the digital card collecting game</a>. However, due to new currency and restrictions, fans heavily criticised the trading feature calling it an "insult".</p>
<p>A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-admits-restrictive-trading-system-stops-players-enjoying-the-feature-as-intended">The Pokémon Company acknowledged the backlash</a>, admitting trading restrictions were "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" the game.</p>

<p>Now, massive changes are coming to the trade feature, including the complete removal of trade tokens. Instead, trading will use Shinedust, an existing currency found simply by opening booster packs.</p>
<p>However, the changes will be implemented by the end of autumn 2025, so exact dates are as yet unknown.</p>
<p>As per the announcement, the following changes will be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade tokens will be completely removed and players will no longer need to exchange cards to obtain the currency required for trading.</li>
<li>Instead, trading cards of three-diamond, four-diamond, and one-star rarity will now require shinedust.</li>
<li>When you open a booster pack, shinedust will be automatically earned if you obtain a card that is already registered in your Card Dex. Currently, shinedust is also required to obtain flair, so we are looking into increasing the amount offered since it will also be needed for trading. Altogether, this change should allow you to trade more cards than you could before this update.</li>
<li>Trade tokens you currently own can be converted to shinedust when the item is removed from the game.</li>
<li>There are no changes in how one-diamond and two-diamond rarity cards are traded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, a new feature will be included to allow players to share the cards they're interested in trading in advance.</p>
<p>"We hope that these changes will make trading cards more accessible and allow more players to enjoy making trades," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"In addition to the changes above, we are also looking into how to accommodate cards that are currently unavailable for trades, such as promo cards and two-star rarity cards. Keep an eye out for more information about this topic in the future."</p> <div>

			<p>Obsidian Entertainment has <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134488-patch-130-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new update for its action roleplaying game Avowed. Version 1.3 brings several community requested improvements, such as providing an extra talent point for the main character at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. Players who have already leveled up to the max won't have to worry, as their characters will also retroactively receive the extra talent points.&nbsp; While playing the game, I did have the feeling that the game was a bit stingy with talents. This will definitely help with build creation.</p>
<p>Obsidian also introduced several quality of life improvements with this Avowed patch:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new option to increase font size and apply bold styling to all documents, tutorials, in-game pop-ups, and the ledger's quest tab in an effort to improve readability</li>
<li>Improved customization for the HUD (Heads-Up Display), including a new keybind (set to backslash by default) that hides all interface elements to help with screenshot captures and an opacity slider</li>
<li>A new FOV (Field of View) slider for third-person camera</li>
<li>A static compass option that always points to the north instead of rotating</li>
<li>Full support to customize controller keybinds</li>
<li>A toggle between walking and running for mouse and keyboard users</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are also several balance tweaks, bug fixes, and minor performance improvements, too.</p>
<p>So far, Avowed has <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly done well enough</a> to satisfy Obsidian and Microsoft. It rightfully should. While perhaps not quite a masterpiece, it comes close, as I explained in my review:</p>
<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through. The visuals and performance are also praiseworthy. There are a few shortcomings, but if you're a fan of Western RPGs, you don't want to miss Avowed. It may have started as a spin-off, but it could go on to be the main series in Eora.</em></p>
<p>Will there be a sequel? It's too early to say. Game Director Carrie Patel shared her enthusiasm to do more with the team now that they had found their groove. However, in a more recent interview <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Eurogamer</a>, she seemed a bit more tentative, hinting that there may be a new IP in the cards for the studio, too.</p>
<p><em>The wonderful thing about the reception Avowed has gotten is it shows that there is certainly an appetite for new fantasy IPs. I recognise that some of our players are coming from Pillars and Deadfire, but I think for the majority of people, this is their first time in the world of Eora, so it's heartening to see that there is appetite for that novelty, that players are interested in jumping into something new. It certainly gives us a lot of enthusiasm and optimism for continuing to be ambitious, continuing to introduce players to new worlds, and bringing them into the games we're making and the things that are exciting to us. I know we're always excited to try new things.</em></p>
<p>Should Obsidian make a sequel to Avowed or something else entirely after they're done with The Outer Worlds 2? Let us know your opinion below.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's Silent Hill Transmission developer stream</a>, KONAMI shared a new trailer and many details about the upcoming horror game Silent Hill f. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-announced-60s-japan-higurashi-ryukishi07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2022 alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and the spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a>, it features an original story set in 1960s Japan, more specifically in a remote mountain town called Ebisugaoka.</p>
<p>Here, teenager Shimizu Hinako has led a fairly unremarkable life, until a thick fog descends, transforming her home into a desolate and terrifying place. With the town seemingly abandoned and an unknown, creeping menace lurking in the mist, Hinako must navigate the spectral remnants of her past, solve intricate puzzles and battle terrifying entities to survive. Faced with impossible choices, she must ultimately choose between beauty and madness, and face the horrors that await within the mist.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is being developed by NeoBards Entertainment, which previously worked as a developer partner on games like Resident Evil: Resistance, Resident Evil Re:Verse, Marvel's Avengers, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. This will be their first high-profile game as a lead developer.&nbsp;The producer is Motoi Okamoto, who has already worked on the highly successful Silent Hill 2 remake, while the writer is Ryukishi07, renowned for Higurashi When They Cry and Umineko When They Cry. On the developer stream, he said:</p>
<p><em>To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the strangling and oppressive atmosphere of SILENT HILL. It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It's an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I've poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don't think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote.</em></p>
<p><em>To me, the SILENT HILL series is more than just a collection of stories, it's a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person's heart and mind. It's my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. To all of our overseas friends, I hope you'll enjoy a look at what SILENT HILL might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.</em></p>

<p>Ryukishi07 is not the only famed artist involved with the creation of Silent Hill f. Illustrator and monster designer kera is working on the game's artistic style, while legendary series composer Akira Yamaoka returns to compose the music for the game's Fog World. He's splitting work with fellow composer Kensuke Inage (Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, Tekken 8), who's composing the music for the game's Otherworld.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with no announced release date. However, the game's Steam page already includes the minimum and recommended PC requirements.</p>
