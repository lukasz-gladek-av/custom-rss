			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are out later this month on October 16, 2025. Unless you're the person who got yours more than two weeks early thanks to Amazon France shipping it out way ahead of release.</p>



<p>At least, that's what seems to have happened in the photo shared by The Verge's Tom Warren now that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1num2ad/quick_review/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">original post was deleted from Reddit</a>.</p>







<p>It's not exactly the best start for ASUS and Xbox regarding the rollout of this device, but it's at least exciting for user Technical_Fun77, whose post was caught before it was deleted, and also left their own user review of the device, which <a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-has-already-shipped-to-some-lucky-gamers-and-the-first-review-is-in">The Shortcut</a> was able to catch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Technical_Fun77's user review of the ROG Xbox Ally X via The Shortcut.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Technical_Fun77 also isn't the only one who got their Xbox Ally X early, as another user (spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-amazon-france-release-two-weeks-early/">TheGamer</a>) shared they also received their new PC handheld from Amazon France over two weeks ahead of time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It seems that if you ordered your Xbox Ally X from Amazon France, it's worth keeping an eye on the order to see if it also is on its way to you ahead of time. Everyone else can simply hope and pray that their retailer made the same mistake, or just wait the remaining two weeks like the rest of us.</p>



<p>If you've not secured your own yet and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">have the pocket change to dump $599 or $999 on either of the new handhelds</a>, then it's still worth trying your local retailers to see who still has one in stock. </p>

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony launched an updated PlayStation 5 digital console in Europe, but instead of offering 1TB of storage for €499, it now comes with just an 825GB Solid-State Drive (SSD) at the same price, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-digital-only-ps5-now-comes-with-less-storage-in-europe-and-isnt-any-cheaper-to-buy">reported earlier by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. YouTuber Austin Evans discovered the change in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrxVnRxLo&amp;t=11s">a teardown video</a> posted earlier this week, confirming an earlier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770271/sony-rumor-says-it-will-reduce-ps5-slim-digital-edition-storage-space">report from gaming bargain hunter billbil-kun</a>.</p><p>Sony originally launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">slimmed-down version of the PS5</a> in 2023, coming with an upgraded 1TB SSD, as opposed to the original PS5’s 825GB of internal storage. At launch, the digital-only console cost $449.99 before Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647869/sony-ps5-price-rise-uk-europe-australia-new-zealand">raised the price</a> across the globe, bringing it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">to $499.99 in the US</a> and €499.99 in Europe.</p><p>Though the refreshed PS5 says it comes with 825GB on the box, Evan found that the console only has 667.2GB of usable storage due to the operating system and other apps included with the console. Meanwhile, the older, digital-only version of the console with a 1TB SSD has 848GB of usable storage.</p><p>Aside from the storage change, the updated PS5 comes with a new matte finish, along with smaller components that make it about 100 grams lighter than its predecessor. Sony hasn’t provided a reason for the change, but its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">recent post</a> about raising prices cites a “challenging economic environment.” There’s still no word on whether this updated console will launch outside Europe.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789686/sony-digital-ps5-slim-less-storage-europe]]></content:encoded>

Amazon Luna head Jeff Gattis <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna">announced in a blog post</a> on Wednesday that a “completely redesigned and reimagined Amazon Luna” service will be relaunched later this year, introducing a Jackbox-like “GameNight” social category that allows Prime subscribers to play together with family and friends.</p><p>Like Jackbox, GameNight players can join games by scanning a QR code using their phone, which will then serve as the game controller. The feature will launch with more than 25 multiplayer titles, including <em>Angry Birds</em>, Draw &amp; Guess, Exploding Kittens, and adaptations of board games such as Taboo, Ticket to Ride, and Clue. Amazon is also developing exclusive games for the GameNight feature, starting with <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em>. This is a “human‑built, AI‑powered improv courtroom game,” according to Gattis, which requires players to defend themselves in court before Judge Snoop Dogg.</p><p>GameNight will be available to Prime subscribers at no additional cost, with additional games being added to the feature over time. Amazon hasn’t specified when this future Luna relaunch will roll out, but given we’re already in October, it should be sometime in the coming weeks.</p><p>Aside from gaining a new social gaming category, it’s difficult to tell how significant the upcoming Luna redesign will be. Gattis says that bringing Snoop Dogg to GameNight is “just the beginning,” and mentions vague plans around Amazon using AI to help reimagine cloud gaming. It’s unclear if these developments would be exclusive to Luna’s GameNight feature.</p><p>“With advances in AI and cloud technology, we see opportunities to create entirely new kinds of games – experiences that were never possible before,” said Gattis. “We have an incredible pipeline of games in the works and can’t wait for you to play and experience the all-new Luna for yourself later this year.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming]]></content:encoded>

              <p><i>Silent Hill</i> is ascendant once more. Following Bloober Team’s well-received remake of <i>Silent Hill 2</i> last year, the studio has confirmed that a remake of the series’ 1999 debut, <i>Silent Hill</i>, has entered full production.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent HIll f</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-confirms-silent-hill-1-remake-in-production-and-wont-rule-out-a-cronos-sequel-just-yet">As noted by <i>Eurogamer</i></a>, Bloober Team shared the news <a href="https://www.stockwatch.pl/czat-inwestorow-gieldowych/piotr-babieno-prezes-karolina-nowak-wiceprezes-bloober-team-start-30-wrzesnia-o-godz-1100,797">during an investor call yesterday</a>. “We have two first-party production teams,” Bloober Team shared (via Google Translate), “one of which is working on the <i>Silent Hill 1 </i>project and the other has started work on the next project.” The studio also discussed its recently released horror title <i>Cronos: The New Dawn</i> which, much like the <i>Silent Hill 2</i> remake before it, has been received well.</p> <p>We’ve known about the <i>Silent Hill</i> remake since June of this year, when <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1933159748137828365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1933159748137828365%7Ctwgr%5Ef2a809ce836d796e0adb1769885c38dae3a3a4fd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fthe-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">Konami teased the project</a> with the briefest of teasers featuring little more than some eerie, familiar music and the acknowledgement that the game was in development.</p> <p>While many fans of the classic survival horror series were skeptical about whether or not Bloober Team could deliver a quality <i>Silent Hill</i> experience, the team has proved the doubters wrong. And on top of that, the recently released <i>Silent HIll f</i>, developed by NeoBards, and the remake of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> show that Konami is doing what it needs to do to facilitate quality video games these days.</p> <p>A remake of the original <i>Silent Hill </i>brings with it many opportunities. Originally released in the late ‘90s, the game is certainly a product of its time with its awkward camera and…<a href="https://youtu.be/diknIjVTKxo">interesting localization</a>. Not to mention, it’s kinda tricky to get your hands on it. You either need an actual PSX copy and a machine that’ll run it, or you have to snag it on the otherworldly, hellish lagscape that is the PSN store on the PlayStation 3. Terrifying.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-fire-emblem-shadows-mobile-flat-f2p-folly-with-simplistic-strategy-social-deduction.1313479/</guid>

<figure><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159249/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>I'm always suspicious, a little tiny bit at least, of games that I play on my mobile phone. Not because I'm somehow wise to something about the platform others aren't, but more because I'm old and remember the long and arduous 'Trash Years' (as I like to call them) of terrible, terrible games for your phone. You know the stuff. Games you'd try to play at work in the toilet, but then quickly realise that doing your actual job was more fun than your legs going dead on the bog. The good old days.</p>
<p>Of course, things have come a long way since then (I can sit on the toilet for hours now and my legs are fine, for example), and Nintendo already has some decent mobile titles out there, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_heroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a>. I know deep down that I'm entirely wrong to be concerned in any way about <em>modern</em> mobile gaming quality. I know it. So it's funny in a way (it isn't), that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a>, the first phone/mobile game I've played in blinking ages, is so terribly, terribly bad that it gives me immediate nostalgia for the Trash Years. Put me back on that toilet.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159242/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Yep. Unfortunately, and all joking aside, what we've got with Fire Emblem Shadows is a terrible waste of an amazing licence, and something that I am not surprised they just kicked out the door in the end. Unless you like incredibly simplistic, badly planned, poorly executed "tactical" turn-based combat with an awful art style and pay-to-win mechanics, I'd steer well clear of this one.</p>
<p>Rather than stick with any sort of tried and tested genre, or work within the perfectly reasonable confines of the tactical turn-based RPG, the devs have gone all in on a hybrid of turn-based FE stuff and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a>. Can I see what they were trying to do? Yes. Does it work as a fun thing to spend time playing? No. Is it trying to fleece me? I'd say, yes. Are my legs dead? It's hard to tell.</p>
<p>In Fire Emblem Shadows, you jump into the franchise's signature grid-based battles as part of a fairly rote genre story that tells the tale of Kurt, a prince and heir to the throne of Ast, who goes on the run in the midst of an attack by the evil empire. Tempted to the dark side as he goes, Kurt has two paths presented in the game: dark and light. Choosing to play light gives you the main thrust of the story, while the dark route provides some other perspectives on the events that take place.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159341/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The battles themselves, which adopt a simplified, colour-coded version of the series' signature triangle battle system (green beats blue, red beats green, blue beats red), see you and two other online players — this is an online-only venture, remember — placed on a small grid-based battlefield where you'll take on dull CPU enemies in auto-battler scraps.</p>
<p>Your units attack and do all the fun stuff by themselves, whilst you — <em>dingus</em> — drag and drop a selection of surprisingly bland attacks and items (heal, fireball, shove and so on) onto areas and units as and when they are cooled down and ready. Simple. Except that here they've added a crappy social experiment aspect that's been ripped from Among Us for no reason other than 'people seemed to like that in another game.'</p>
<p>You see, one member of your team is secretly designated a saboteur, so they are working against the other two players with some special shadow magic moves, the ability to kill and damage themselves, and friendly fire, making for ways in which they can try to hide themselves or make it look like someone else is at it.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159246/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The first round of the game, where you all fight and then guess the traitor's identity, whilst fine on paper, is already a total waste of time thanks to the wildly limited scope of the fights and the current online 'meta.' You can, if you choose, literally do nothing in this round, or maybe just repeatedly stab yourself as the saboteur to put others off your scent. By checking the social media and forums, and by sitting through many, many matches, it seems people are already playing this part of the game by not playing it properly at all. It blows, and the way Shadows is set up allows for it, I suspect, because the endgame here is getting you to blow your wallet on a battle pass.</p>
<p>As there are only three players, you only ever have a choice between two suspects, and the rounds are way too short to really do any meaningful study of behaviours. You only gain one extra HP for guessing the saboteur correctly, too. It's not exactly enticing me to be bothered, folks.</p>
<p>Once the first round ends and the saboteur has been identified (you even get clues to who it might be, if it wasn't simple or boring enough already), you then face them in a second battle where they can summon lots of annoying small enemies, resulting in you and your online partner spamming 'heal' ad nauseam on a timer in between firing off some underwhelming attacks that provide little to no visual feedback. This is not fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159241/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>It all falls apart so very quickly, it really does. There's no way to actually communicate with other players, so the social aspect, beyond being bland and overwhelmingly dull in its simplicity, is some seriously low-effort, low-energy stuff.</p>
<p>Also! Everything on the screen (you can only play in landscape mode, take note) — and maybe this is a me thing only — but on my phone screen, it's not particularly easy to see the tiny details, so how much time are you going to actually spend observing the actions of someone else? Not much before you get bored, I'd wager.</p>
<p>You have a premium battle pass, because of course you do (this is a free game after all), and it's got better characters, attacks, an exclusive combatant in Lyn, who'll be paid access only until the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkObQQGWkHA">Season 1: Wind of the Plains</a> (which runs until the 28th October), level skips, and all that stuff — so pay-to-win is in, baby — as well as the expected wide array of cosmetic items and outfits that you can then rock into battle on a cast of characters that include a good few franchise returnees. There are also coins and gems which unlock new moves and things like that, but the premium goods are locked off behind gems that cost real-world money.</p>
<p>Making your way along the free battle pass, well, you do get some rewards, and you can earn most of the stuff through digging in and playing, but pay-to-win is an issue, as Lyn brings powerful moves that can swing scraps. Now, with this in mind, the game has a "Souls" system in place so that you can technically pick Lyn up at a later point by collecting 12 subs from post-game chests, once Season 1 exclusivity for paid punters ends. However, even then, you're looking at a fight against drop rates. How long is this going to take?</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159244/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>They've made sure the outfit viewer in the store manages to look much better, more detailed graphically, than the fighting or anything else, too. Which I guess is good, as the outfits, even on special offer, are costing you a couple of quid. The battle pass, as things currently stand, shakes out at about six or seven British pounds, and honestly, I don't see how anyone will be roped into this, as the game itself provides little to no incentive to persist.</p>
<p>In fact, the only reason I can think of, unless you have a kink for this sort of thing, is that some hardcore Fire Emblem fans will want to watch the cutscenes and follow the story, which isn't worth it either. It's all very rigid and basic, there's nothing to be wowed by narratively here, not even close. Don't be fooled because you get to play the dark and light side of the tale, it's all tedious, no matter the route you forge. More of the same not-very-good thing.</p>
<p>In trying to be a little more positive to wind up, I will give it some points for serving up a few good-looking cutscenes that show flashes of the usual Fire Emblem style. There's no denying it looks polished in places, and it has a fine soundtrack and some voices for characters as you attack. It also has weekly content drops and challenges, new dungeon maps to fight on, and increased soul-drop rates for certain periods. So there is stuff to work towards for those interested.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159343/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>However, most of the fun bits here are gated off behind the winning of the game's core turgid battles, and this isn't something that's gonna change with new content or a few nice outfits. Overall, I've got to say — and even with the prospect that it could improve down the road — this feels like a one-off botched experiment that nobody will remember in a week or two.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fire Emblem Shadows is a turgid mobile game that serves up dull automated battles involving pay-to-win nonsense, timers, and cooldowns. The main selling point of a unique social experiment/turn-based battle hybrid is very weak in its setup, with neither enough players nor time in combat to create any semblance of actual strategy, and the game itself looks and plays poorly on the battlefield.</p>
<p>There are a few nice cutscenes for fans who persist, and outfits for the outfits fans. But beyond this, it's thumbs down as far as the eye can see for this failed experiment.</p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-luna-streaming-service-to-get-major-overhaul-later-this-year.1313476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced that it's introducing a major rework for its Luna streaming service later this year, including a brand new focus on social gaming and more.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the new Luna will focus more on the casual crowd; Amazon says Prime members have told it that "they want games to be a way to bring friends and family together", and so the multinational giant decided to "reimagine Luna".</p>

<p>The new version of the service will "combine innovative social party games with amazing blockbusters", and it's all built around a new feature Amazon is calling GameNight, which will be displayed when you boot up Luna on your smart device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amazon-luna-rework-family.jpg?itok=n0CxVtY3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amazon-luna-rework-family.jpg?itok=ElURt_K_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon Luna is rebuilding itself to be more family-oriented.</figcaption></figure><p>GameNight is essentially Amazon's version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/jackbox-games-10-years-of-laughing-quipping-and-fibbing" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Jackbox&nbsp;</em>series</a>; it'll launch with "more than 25 approachable multiplayer games", including adaptations of existing titles and "GameNight-optimized takes on favorites like&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>,&nbsp;<em>Draw &amp; Guess</em>,&nbsp;<em>Exploding Kittens</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Flappy Golf Party</em>".</p>

<p>In addition, the service will arrive with a new exclusive game featuring none other than Snoop Dogg himself.&nbsp;<em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg&nbsp;</em>is described as a "human-built, AI-powered improv courtroom game" in which you must defend your testimony before the Doggfather.</p>

<p>If you're concerned that Luna will be losing its library of more core audience-focused games, you needn't be. Amazon says the reworked Luna will also include "more than 50 popular classic, indie, and blockbuster games".</p>

<p>The likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hogwarts-legacy" rel="nofollow"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii" rel="nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>&nbsp;</em>will be available at launch, and a "rotating library" of games will be introduced to the service as time goes on as well.</p>

<p>You'll need a controller to play the aforementioned core titles, but the GameNight lineup can be enjoyed without one; you'll be using your smartphone to play those games, so you won't need to buy anything extra.</p>

<p>Amazon's Luna rework launches sometime later this year. We don't have a release date for it yet, so stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>Remember Prototype, the super hero game which saw Radical Entertainment explore what might happen if a hoodie enthusiast was given shape-shifting powers? Well, it's recieved a sudden and mysterious steam update which adds to its credits, fuelling a fresh bout of speculation that a remaster might be on the cards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Said Steam update, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/a-surprise-steam-update-for-prototype-broke-the-mods-making-the-16-year-old-game-playable-on-modern-systems-but-could-hint-at-a-potential-remaster/">Perfectly Cromulent Gamer</a>, is so mysterious that it didn't even come with a handy post indicating what it did, leaving modders and dataminers to try and work out what it was up it with its around 600 MBs of pure enigma.</p>
<p>Based on what they've discovered, the answer includes making some noteworthy additions to Prototype's credits. These include staff at Iron Galaxy, the Activision-owned studio that's worked on the likes of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy">Spyro Reignited Trilogy</a>, amid a lengthy history littered with numerous ports and support projects. Fellow Activision support studios Beenox and Demonware get mentions too, with the former seeing a huge number of folks credited. Finally, a Ubisoft Connect iteration of Prototype, which isn't a thing that currently exists, is also mentioned via references to supposed contributors to it that includes the Beenox devs.</p>
<p>You can find the old credits laid side by side with the revised ones <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/WV75q76C/">here</a>, thanks to the Prototype community's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/">super sleuths</a>. Naturally, the conclusion many of these folks have drawn is that some sort of re-release of the 2009 game may be in the works. There's no official confirmation as of yet, however, so make sure to keep your expectations in check.</p><p>I'll admit that for all I've enjoyed plenty of Infamous, I've never gotten around to giving Prototype a go. So let us peruse RPS co-founderperson Alec Meer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-prototype">late 2000s thoughts on it</a> together, in order to help decide whether it's worthy of a modern revamp:</p>
<blockquote> Morality is non-existent in this game of mass, consequence-free killing, after all. All I know: half of Prototype wants me to have sustained, undiluted fun. The other half wants to keep that fun from me at all costs. This is a game that regularly strikes close an unprecedented degree of fantastical wish-fulfilment, but similarly seems determined to punish anyone with the temerity to play it.</blockquote>
<p>I'd say that's a yes, especially given it's a ballache to play on modern PCs without relying on mods like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prototype/mods/52">PrototypeFix</a>, which in a fun twist the suprise update tempoarily rendered unusable. Luckily, the mod's creator was quick to update it, so you can hop into some working Prototype if this news leaves you keen to re-don Alex Mercer's hood of moodiness.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-just-launched-new-gadgets-yet-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-is-practically-free-at-50-off.1313464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can turn any TV into a smart TV with an Amazon Fire TV Stick.. That was the big selling point of these streaming sticks when they first came out. Though nowadays, you be hard-pressed to find a TV that isn’t already smart. That doesn’t mean though that these streaming sticks don’t have their place. Some Smart TVs honestly would be better off without any of their functionality due to an annoying user interface <em>*cough cough LG cough cough*</em>.&nbsp; This is just one person’s opinion, but I much prefer the Fire TV OS to any Smart TV on the market, plus you get Alexa support.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/"> Normally the Fire TV Stick 4K sells for $50, though right now Amazon has cut the price down ahead of Prime Big Deals Day to just $25. That’s a 50% discount.</a></p>
<p>This is the latest model of the 4K-supported Amazon Fire TV Stick. With it, you can enjoy 4K streaming&nbsp; with improved performance that’s been optimized for 4K TVs. Added Wi-Fi 6 support means you can enjoy smooth streaming over fast internet, even with a number of other devices connected to the same network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This Fire TV Stick, in addition to 4K, supports Dolby Vision, HDR10+, as well as the immersive sound provided with Dolby Atmos. You can get as close as you can to the cinema experience from the comfort of your living room.</p>
<p>A streaming media player will grant your access to close to two million movies and TV episodes across all of your favorite apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, HBO Max (if that’s what they’re still calling it this week), and more — provided you have an associated subscription. You can enjoy a number of free movies and shows on your Fire TV Stick 4K with channels like Tubi and Pluto TV.</p>



<h2>Alexa-enabled Search</h2>
<p>Search smarter with Alexa. One of the most annoying parts of looking up movies or shows on your TV is having to use that on-screen keyboard. It’s tedious and takes forever to move the cursor over one letter at a time to type out what you’re looking for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/">Well, with the Fire TV Stick 4K, the remote has a built-in microphone and Alexa button.</a> Just hold down the button and speak into it “<em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</em>” and before you know it, you’ll be watching Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo getting into all sorts of alcohol-induced hijinks.</p>

"I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools'.

Alternatively, the author suggested he could expand on the matter in a future work — something fans have suggested he might do to deliberately rein in the concept closer to his own personal vision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm still uncertain about what to do with this situation," Sapkowski concluded. "Perhaps, taking the path of least resistance, I’ll erase the sentence about the ‘school’ from future editions of The Last Wish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Or maybe I’ll want to expand and clarify the matter somehow in subsequent books? Perhaps I’ll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals?

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prototype-2009/">Prototype</a> fans believe that they've found new clues suggesting a remaster is on the way, as several updates to the game were recently spotted online.</p><p>As seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/10150/history/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a> and through recent data-mining (via the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prototype subreddit</a>), the game's credits have been updated to include Iron Galaxy and Ubisoft Connect. <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/WV75q76C/" rel="nofollow ">The new credits</a> highlight hundreds of additions and there are references to "downloadable content" and "Ubisoft Connect Version" teams.</p><p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-will-sell-activision-cloud-rights-to-ubisoft-in-latest-attempt-to-secure-its-acquisition/1100-6517056/" data-ref-id="1100-6517056">Microsoft sold Activision's cloud-gaming rights to Ubisoft</a> after it acquired Activision Blizzard. "For Prototype 1, they have added some test maps and quite a few new names in the credits. There might be some hope for a remaster after all," Redditor StanleyMitchel added.</p><p>Prototype was first released in 2009, and the game saw you take on the role of Alex Mercer, an amnesiac bioweapon seeking to uncover the secrets of his past. The only catch? New York City was under heavy quarantine since the Blacklight virus outbreak, leaving him caught in the middle of a war between the infected populace and a secret US army division tasked with containing the virus by any means necessary.</p><p>A sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prototype-2/">Prototype 2</a>, was released in 2012 and it featured a new protagonist, former US soldier James Heller. The franchise has been dormant since it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prototype-1-and-2-xbox-oneps4-now-available-indivi/1100-6429726/">ported to PS4 and Xbox One in 2015</a>.</p>

                <p>A new streak for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> called Gravemaker gives players the ability to one-shot kill enemies through walls, and it looks extremely powerful and annoying to be on the receiving end of.</p><p>Gravemaker is a one-shot sniper rifle. It was originally announced in August, but it wasn't until Call of Duty: Next this week that we actually got to see how it works in a real match. Footage from Call of Duty League professional player SimpXO shows how devastating the streak can be. Gravemaker shows an enemy's silhouette through walls when aiming down sights, and as you can see in the video, it's very deadly.</p><p>Beyond its default setup, it has <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two overclock settings</a> that juice it up further. Overlock 1 is a larger magazine for more ammo and Overlock 2 allows it to have reduced charge time before firing.</p><p>The developers are said to be <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1957910013030354954" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">watching feedback closely</a> to possibly make changes to Gravemaker if it's deemed to be too powerful or negatively affects the experience overall. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta begins on October 2</a>--and Gravemaker is among the included streaks--so Activision will soon have lots more data to look at.</p><p>People are also pointed out that Gravemaker appears to be just the <a href="https://perfectdark.fandom.com/wiki/FarSight_XR-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest evolution of the FarSight gun from Perfect Dark</a> that also allowed players to shoot through walls and aggravate their enemies.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 multiplayer beta begins October 2 and runs through October 8, during which people can try out a selection of the game's modes and maps, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-also-includes-zombies/1100-6534980/" data-ref-id="1100-6534980">along with Zombies. </a>The full game, meanwhile, launches on November 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <p>The breakout game development business co-owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Ubisoft finally has a name: Vantage Studios. Eurogamer understands from a source that it's starting operations today, and will be responsible for new games across many of Ubisoft's biggest IPs, such as Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>Vantage Studios is composed of 2,300 employees across multiple Ubisoft game development teams, including those from Montreal Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Sofia, and Barcelona. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">The studio will be run by the duo of Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot</a>.</p>
<p>Vantage Studios operate under a less centralised model compared to Ubisoft proper, with each development team having more ownership over its own respective project. This in theory would allow developers to be more fluid, and pivot according to industry changes and player expectations, per Eurogamer sources.</p>

<p>The formation of Vantage Studios comes as the climax of a tumultuous period for Ubisoft, which reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">was considering this new venture with Tencent in January of this year</a> following years of lacking performance. This new venture, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">which would bring many of Ubisoft's biggest IPs under a new roof</a>, was officially announced in March <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">with Tencent taking a €1.16bn stake in the new business entity</a>.</p><p>As for Tencent's involvement, the Chinese company will have a 25 percent stake in Vantage Studios, and will act in an advisory role to the subsidiary's leadership team. However, Guillemot and Derennes will retain control over both creative and business decisions. Ubisoft hopes this will allow its teams to have a better degree of creative freedom, per a source familiar with the subject.</p>
<p>How other studios, most notably Massive Entertainment, will operate going forward currently remains unlear. Eurogamer understands the publisher wants its devs to operate in a more decentralised way, with developers taking more ownership of the titles they're working on - the company employs approximately 20,000 staff at the time of writing (<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/our-people">per its site</a>), and how the other ~17,000 staff will fit into this new vision remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>Amazon will launch a "completely redesigned and reimagined" version of its Luna game streaming service later this year, which remains incorporated into the existing Amazon Prime subscription at no additional cost.</p>
<p>The service is aiming to deliver both a growing library of blockbuster, classic, and indie games, as well as social games through its new GameNight hub. These social games are designed to be played without a controller; instead players join on their phones using a QR code, a bit like Jackbox Games.</p>
<p>GameNight will feature exclusive family friendly games developed by Amazon, and will launch with over 25 games including GameNight-optimised versions of the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> and Exploding Kittens, as well as board game adaptations.</p>

<p>The first of these exclusive games will be Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg, featuring an AI powered version of the rapper. It should be noted <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/snoop-dogg-slammed-as-homophobic-after-bizarre-gay-comments-spark-outrage-online/articleshow/123507732.cms">Snoop Dogg has recently been criticised for homophobic remarks</a> about LGBT+ representation in children's media.</p><p>Elsewhere, Luna will offer a growing library of over 50 popular games, though a further subscription to Luna Premium will be required for the full catalogue. The library will include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>.</p>
<p>Luna will continue to be accessible without a PC or console. Instead, games are streamed using a Fire TV, smart TV, or tablet. Any bluetooth controller is compatible, though Amazon will continue to sell a specific Luna controller too.</p>
<p>"With advances in AI and cloud technology, we see opportunities to create entirely new kinds of games - experiences that were never possible before," said Luna general manager Jeff Gattis in a <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna">blog post</a>. "We have an incredible pipeline of games in the works and can't wait for you to play and experience the all-new Luna for yourself later this year."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-luna-game-streaming-service-now-available-in-the-uk">Amazon launched Luna in the UK back in 2023</a>. However it has so far failed to gain significant traction, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-amazon-games-boss-explains-why-it-couldnt-compete-with-valves-steam-goliath-lost">former Amazon Games boss Ethan Evans acknowledged earlier this year</a> as Amazon couldn't compete with Valve's Steam platform.</p>
<p>This update is something of a re-launch for Amazon, then, with its GameNight addition bringing an increased emphasis on social gaming.</p>
<p>"Gaming hardware is too expensive," said Gattis. "Games are intimidating and hard to learn... and expensive. Games can be isolating. But, at the same time, Prime members know that games don't have to be this way, and indeed, they tell us that they want games to be a way to bring friends and family together. To build connection. To bond. To have fun!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's report by Insider Gaming</a> that the employees of Electronic Arts subsidiary BioWare are already very worried about layoffs due to the company's $55 billion buyout, an EA employee FAQ <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> appears to promise that, at least for now, there's nothing to worry about.</p>



<p><em>There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work as a result of this transaction. Our focus is on driving innovation and expanding our global reach, all of which require world class teams, who are excited to shape the future of entertainment.</em></p>



<p>Of course, this is no guarantee there won't be any layoffs later down the road. After all, even Microsoft waited some time after acquiring Activision Blizzard to do its own mass layoffs.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the FAQ, the company tells its employees why the buyout will benefit EA's overall strategy going forward:</p>



<p><em>As a public company, EA operates within the framework of public market expectations. Being a private company allows Electronic Arts to adopt a longer-term investment horizon, with greater latitude to pursue bold strategies without quarterly public market response.</em></p>



<p><em>This partnership gives us the ability to move faster and unlock new opportunities on a global stage. With a longer investment horizon – and the same discipline, focus, and operational excellence that has fueled our success – we’ll have greater creative and operational flexibility to drive innovation and build the next generation of entertainment experiences. We will continue to take bold creative bets and invest in our largest growth opportunities in service of our global communities of fans and players.</em></p>



<p>Lastly, Electronic Arts claims the company is financially strong, and the deal allows the publisher to 'unlock new opportunities'.</p>



<p><em>EA is in a strong financial position. This partnership gives us the ability to move faster and unlock new opportunities on a global stage.</em></p>



<p>However, we know that the publisher actually has a lot of debt, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including $20 billion that partly funded this buyout from the Consortium (PIF, Silver Lake, Affinity Partners)</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>“There is a saying that when you depart from this world, the dog who went ahead will warmly welcome you.”</p><p>Bong-gu the Welsh Corgi was once an abandoned dog. Judging by his docked tail, someone had once cared for him, but for some reason, he became unwanted. As an eight-year-old senior dog with various illnesses, it was hard for him to find a new family. Trapped in a cage at an animal shelter, each day passed gloomily for Bong-gu.</p><p>Then one day, a miracle happened. Bong-gu met a new family. The man who took Bong-gu had a somewhat scruffy appearance and seemed slightly awkward, but Bong-gu loved his scent. From that day on, Bong-gu lived out his remaining days just like any other dog would: playing tug-of-war, running around, eating, and sleeping. In the end, he crossed the rainbow bridge, having lived out a simple yet joyful life.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Sniff sniff… this scent… One day in dog heaven, Bong-gu wakes from his nap to a very familiar scent. Sniff sniff… it’s dad! Though faint, surely it is dad’s scent he has been waiting for. Jubilant, Bong-gu escapes dog heaven and embarks on a journey to meet his dad—a journey that may hold unexpected dangers. Just as his dad once found him by some miracle, it is now Bong-gu’s turn to find his dad.</p><p>Will Bong-gu be able to see his dad again?</p><p><strong>An Adventure in a Beautiful World Filled With Stories of Dogs and People</strong></p><p>Teetering on the border between life and death, a world outside of dog heaven feels both familiar and strange. Embark on an adventure through beautifully crafted landscapes including deserts, snowy mountains, and beaches. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> diverse gameplay across adventure, action, <a title="Genres > Racing [284 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> genres. And remember, Bong-gu is a dog! <a title="Genres > Action [3,101 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>s like sniffing, barking, running, and jumping come with limitations. To overcome his limitations and reunite with his dad, he must meet, give, and receive help from people and other dogs, each with unique stories to share. Unlike cats, there is only so much a dog can do alone!</p><p><strong>In the End, This is a Story for All of Us</strong></p><p>At the end of his journey, Bong-gu finally reunites with his dad. The journey is filled with joy and excitement, but also moments of hardship and sadness. Yet, the ending has always been written: those destined to meet again will find their way back together. <em>My Little Puppy</em> may be a story about a dog, but it is also a story of relationships, farewells, and reunions that speaks to us all. For those waiting to see their once-in-a-lifetime friend or family member again, or those preparing for an inevitable parting that may come, we hope this story brings warm comfort. One day, we will meet again.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/my-little-puppy-launches-in-november-for-pc-in-first-half-of-2026-for-ps5-and-switch]]></content:encoded>

Now, Capcom is warning players that the impending conclusion of support for Windows 10 means that three of the most recent Monster Hunter games will no longer be guaranteed to work on that operating system.</p><p>Capcom shared a message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236777" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> that reminded players that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-ditches-32-bit-support-as-windows-10-nears-its-end/1100-6534864/" data-ref-id="1100-6534864">Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10</a> on October 14. Consequently, the publisher states, "we will no longer guarantee that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-world/" data-ref-id="5000-465583">Monster Hunter: World</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-rise/" data-ref-id="5000-519025">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, and Monster Hunter Wilds will run on Windows 10 systems."</p><p>The publisher went on to say that the games will still be playable on that operating system after that date. But any future game updates for those titles may render them incompatible with Windows 10 machines.</p><p>A Capcom executive recently blamed Monster Hunter Wilds' drop in sales on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">the high price of PS5 </a>consoles. Capcom acknowledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-monster-hunter-wilds-update-finally-addresses-poor-pc-performance/1100-6532814/" data-ref-id="1100-6532814">the game's problems on PC</a> in June, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sees-huge-jump-in-pc-players-after-free-title-update-2/1100-6532910/" data-ref-id="1100-6532910">Wilds saw a surge in players</a> after a subsequent update. Capcom dropped another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">new patch for Monster Hunter Wilds</a> last month, but the game's larger PC issues won't be directly addressed until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update coming this winter</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Capcom debuted a crossover collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-new-update-adds-final-fantasy-14-jobs-and-more/1100-6535012/" data-ref-id="1100-6535012">Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy 14</a>, which was released earlier this week. The publisher also teased the return of the elder dragon Gogmazios in December's Free Title Update 4.</p>

                <p>A new firmware update--Version: 25.06-12.02.00--for the PlayStation 5 console has gone live, and unsurprisingly, it doesn't do much. What this new update does is improve the security on your device, but don't expect to see any new major features added to your PS5 once it has been installed.</p><p>"We've made some security fixes to the system software," reads the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-za/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very succinct update notes</a>. There have been several other updates to the console throughout 2025, with notable examples being the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-update-brings-back-classic-console-ui-designs/1100-6531058/">return of the classic PlayStation console user interfaces</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-update-brings-big-changes-to-activity-settings/1100-6530365/">big changes to activity settings</a>. Beyond that, 2025 has been a year of incremental improvements and tweaks to the PS5 user experience.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the first system's launch in the US and Europe, and to celebrate, Sony has unveiled new collectibles. Gaming historians will want to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-30th-anniversary-history-book-announced-preorders-available-now/1100-6535087/">PlayStation: The First 30 Years</a>, a deluxe book chronicling the creation of the very first PlayStation console.</p><p>Anyone looking to celebrate in style <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/look-at-these-new-30th-anniversary-playstation-shoes/1100-6535089/">can also preorder new shoes</a> soon that "pay homage" to the PlayStation and are packaged inside of limited-edition boxes meant to evoke the console's original design.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei</a> also launches for PS5 on October 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-october-2025-revealed/1100-6535000/">and if you have a PS Plus subscription</a>, you can pick up Alan Wake 2, Goat Simulator 3, and Cocoon next week. Even more PlayStation classics are coming to PlayStation Plus Premium this year. Sony announced that Soul Calibur 3, Tekken 3, and Tomb Raider: Anniversary will be added to the Game Catalog for PS Plus Premium subscribers soon.</p>
