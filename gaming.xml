		<p>Nintendo has dropped a new trailer for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and called it Survive, showing snippets of combat gameplay in different scenarios including on the motorbike. Samus Aran is on the planet Viewros which is home to strange creatures and the remnants of an ancient race. Without further ado, here’s the new trailer.</p>

<p>Back in April, we went hands of with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, saying, <em>“For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.”</em></p>
<p>You can watch our video preview too.</p>

			<p>In Ninja Gaiden 4, Yakumo can use, at the end of the campaign, five different weapons all coming with unique properties and attacks, which are further expanded by their Bloodraven forms.While all of these weapons have their own unique uses, and are fully viable to complete the game at any difficulty, using some of them is going to make your life much easier. Here are the best of them.</p>

<h2 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Dark Dragon Blade is the best weapon in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-dark-dragon-blade">Dark Dragon Blade</h3>



<p>The Dark Dragon Blade is undoubtedly the <strong>overall best weapon</strong> Yakumo can use. Its damage output is only slightly lower than Ryu's Dragon Blade, but it combines that power with exceptional <strong>ease of use</strong> and high utility.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Damage &amp; Speed:</strong> Features very high base damage and one of the fastest light attacks in its Bloodraven/Shadow-gleam form.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Utility &amp; Crowd Control:</strong> Offers great utility with its circle motion input skills. Has an unblockable launcher to easily set up <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Izuna Drops</strong> and a powerful area-of-effect (AOE) ranged attack (B/Circle) in Shadow-gleam mode.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Defense:</strong> The fast Shadow-gleam form light attack can reliably stop most Power Attacks, making it excellent for boss battles as well.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> The only true downside is the time required to unlock it, as you<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/ninja-gaiden-ultimate-guide-dark-dragon-blade-unlock/"> must complete the game once and clear all of the Boss Trials challenges</a>. This effort, however, is well worth it.</p>



<h3 id="h-kage-hiruko">Kage-Hiruko</h3>



<p>Being the only ranged weapon in the game, the Kage-Hiruko grants great long-range combat capabilities that are extremely effective in the hands of expert players.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ranged &amp; Launchers:</strong> Excellent for long-range engagements and features a wealth of launcher attacks, including a quick light-heavy attack (X/Square - Y/Triangle) laucher string.</li>



<li><strong>Unique</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Flying Swallow:</strong> Has a unique version of the ever-useful Flying Swallow technique that also functions as a launcher.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Excellent Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The Nocturnal Rain AOE attack (A/Cross - X/Square) is massively useful, launching multiple enemies in a wide radius. The fast Bloodraven form light attack is perfect for stopping Power Attacks and break guards at all ranges.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">:</strong> The Kage-Hiruko loses out to the Dark Dragon Blade due to lower damage and moveset complexity.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Takeminakata twin blades are balanced weapons that hold their own at any difficulty level</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-takeminakata"><strong>Takeminakata</strong></h3>



<p>The twin blades are Yakumo's starting weapon, but they should absolutely not be dismissed. While their damage output is only acceptable, the weapon's strength lies in its <strong>incredible versatility and utility</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Provides quick access to multiple launchers and a handy area-of-effect (AOE) attack (circle motion - Y/Triangle).</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Offers amazing crowd control in Bloodraven Form. This includes the two heavy aerial attacks, which are easier to charge than ground attacks, and the Rising Stance: Spin technique (A/Cross - X/Square), which can decimate multiple enemies in a single strike while in Berserk State.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides</strong>: While utility trumps damage, the Takeminakata's lower damage makes it a less reliable choice at high difficulty levels, where fights must be ended quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-magatsuhi">Magatsuhi</h3>



<p>Heavily reminiscent of the glorious Lunar Staff in Ninja Gaiden 2, the Magatsuhi staff is a solid weapon that deals <strong>good damage</strong> via its ground multi-hit combos.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Thanks to the staff's hitboxes, these combos work well as crowd control attacks, hitting enemies behind and to the sides of Yakumo, making it invaluable against enemies that swarm Yakumo in greater numbers.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The massive hammer into which the staff turns into in Bloodraven mode has surprisingly fast and strong attacks. By pressing A/Cross, Yakumo can also launch high in the air to escape pressure and unleash damaging downward AOE attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong>: The Magatsuhi staff doesn't have easy access to a basic launcher attacker, mostly forcing a grounded playstyle. Its most damaging combos also require long execution times which are often interrupted at Hard and Master Ninja difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Yatousen isn't a bad weapon, but every other weapon in the game does what it does, and better</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-yatousen">Yatousen</h3>



<p>The Yatousen rapier is an interesting weapon characterized by its exceptional <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mobility and speed</strong>. However, its overall usability is extremely limited by a few core design conflicts.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Mobility: Many of the Yatousen combos have great mobility, which can help Yakumo get out of danger while keeping up the pressure</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides:</strong> The lack of a quick launcher to set up Izuna Drops, the low attack power in base form and the limitations of Bloodraven form, which requires Yakumo to stand still to deal max damage in any combo string, make it a situational weapon that works best against bosses only in Bloodraven form.</p>

              <p>Those familiar with Nintendo are likely aware of the company’s litigious proclivities (that is, except when <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222">a certain governmental body is using its intellectual property</a> to promote the brutalization of human beings). And <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">scoring a patent for summoning monsters</a> and having them fight on your behalf, known as the “397 patent,” was an essential victory in Nintendo’s battle against “<i>Pokémon</i> with guns” survival game <i>Palworld</i>. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/5-game-mechanics-legally-protected-by-the-companies-that-made-them/">Patenting a game mechanic</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/5-game-mechanics-legally-protected-by-the-companies-that-made-them/">is nothing new</a>, but this particular patent has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patent-pocketpair-court-2000640115">regarded by many as, well, <i>absurd</i></a>, and acquiring it hasn’t exactly been the victory the Pokémon Company seems to have been hoping for in its quest to deal <i>Palworld</i> an irreversible loss.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patent-pocketpair-court-2000640115">Nintendo Was Just Dealt A Big Blow In Its Battle Against <i>Palworld</i></a></p> <p>Joining the chorus of folks saying “this is silly” is Trump nominee John A. Squires, director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-patent-office-boss-orders-reexamination-of-nintendos-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-which-ip-lawyer-claims-further-undermines-credibility-of-its-case-against-palworld">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). Squires has highlighted two older patent applications from Konami and Nintendo as “prior art” that might invalidate Nintendo’s claim to owning the concept this particular patent focuses on. As a result, Squires has ordered the merits of the controversial 397 Patent to be reconsidered.</p>

 <p>It doesn’t look good for Nintendo’s aggressive efforts.</p> <p>Some, such as <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/"><i>Games Fray</i>’s Florian Mueller</a>, are describing this move by Squires as a major loss for the company. As Mueller notes, Squires has not ordered the patent to be yanked. Reexamination orders, according to Mueller, “can result in a patent being upheld.” But this specific <i>Pokemon</i> case seems unlikely to be one of those situations. Nintendo has two months to respond to the reexamination, and in that time other companies are free to challenge the merits of the patent.</p> <p>These days it feels hopeless to expect any sort of fairness or equitable decision-making to come out of the federal government, but it seems like, at the very least, Nintendo’s power grab might be reined in.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6’s ‘Take A Shower’ Screen, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-take-a-shower/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98take-a-shower%E2%80%99-screen-explained.1343467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’d like to think that everyone regularly showers to keep clean and healthy. While you may be sitting down for long Battlefield 6 sessions, we should be keeping that shower active. Players are reportedly being told by Battlefield 6 itself to take a shower, with the keyword being ‘reportedly.’</p>



<p>It can be hard to take anything for granted at face value in 2025. The overwhelming influx of AI means that so much of what we see online is up for debate. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-ps4-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> is an excellent shooter, and it’s easy to lose yourself, as Eminem once told us. But you definitely shouldn’t miss your opportunity to go outside, touch some grass, and keep on top of your personal hygiene!</p>



<p>Allegedly, EA is reminding you that this is the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-battlefield-6-s-take-a-shower-screen">What Is Battlefield 6’s ‘Take A Shower’ Screen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>To stink or not to stink, that is the question. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An image circulated on social media of a Battlefield 6 player’s screen featuring a simple message: “Take a shower.” They were allegedly banned for a “few hours” as a result.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the alleged Battlefield 6 in-game message in its entirety:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Take A Shower. You have been playing for 16 hours straight we cannot allow you to continue on Battlefield 6 servers. We have restricted your account for a few hours please take a break. We have an obligation to keep our players and community safe. This ban is only temporary polease try again soon.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This would be quite an unprecedented message from a developer to stop the community from enjoying their game. Still, because the image is out there, it’s raising questions about its legitimacy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-s-take-a-shower-screen-real-or-ai">Is Battlefield 6’s Take A Shower Screen Real Or AI?</h2>



<p><strong>We can’t officially confirm if the message is fake, but all signs and evidence point to the Take A Shower screen being a semi-convincing case of Photoshop or AI.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, we haven’t had a single session of Battlefield 6 for 16 hours or more. Officially, we can’t debunk this. But there are several factors that should reinforce that this isn’t a real image.</p>



<h3 id="h-grammar">Grammar</h3>



<p>Where do we even start with the grammar? There’s a random space before “You” begins the paragraph, there are missing commas galore, and the sentence’s construction feels very sloppy and inorganic.</p>



<h3 id="h-qr-code">QR Code</h3>



<p>Quite simply, the QR Code doesn’t work. That’s about as big a telltale sign as you need, really. Unless our device was malfunctioning when we tried to scan it, it highlights that this image probably isn’t real.</p>



<h3 id="h-restricted-button">Restricted Button</h3>



<p>We’ve allegedly been told about the ban, why it’s happened, and that you can’t play anymore. It makes sense to have a “Quit” button, so why would there be a “Restricted” option? It reeks of an AI prompt that hasn’t fully grasped the initial request.</p>



<p>Feel free to make up your mind on the Take A Shower Screen. We don’t advise this, but if you desperately need clarification, there’s an easy way to test this: Either play the game for over 16 hours, or keep it running for that time.</p>



<p>If you manage to do any of this, let us know. Send us a picture, or go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so we can solve this bizarre mystery once and for all!</p>

Whereas other car games allow you to create four-wheeled art with their livery editors, Bugbear is instead focusing on hurting the resale value of your digital jalopy with its car editor, fittingly dubbed the "CRAP-IT" toolset.</p><p>As demonstrated in the video below, you can create crimes against pixels by ruining the body of your car with bumps, watch the paintwork decay as rust sets in, and make car collectors lament the fate of your vehicle when you attempt to cover up the damage with badly placed decals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hWHQ2GpVjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-hWHQ2GpVjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the new feature that allows you to craft your very own car culture sins, the update has also improved the game's tire physics--"boing"--introduced faster loading times, added a new track called Crash Canyon 2.0, and introduced a new car in the form of a Volkswagen Beatle--an awful vehicle that deserves to feel the full force of the CRAP-IT system.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wreckfest-2-will-bring-its-penchant-for-destruction-to-early-access-in-march/1100-6529218/">The early-access journey for Wreckfest 2</a> kicked off in March this year, and the game is scheduled to be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S eventually. The original Wreckfest was a big hit with racing-game fans thanks to its impressive damage models at the time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wreckfest-2-officially-revealed-with-road-rage-fueled-trailer/1100-6525492/">and the sequel was first unveiled in August 2024</a> with a road-rage-fueled trailer during the THQ Showcase.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has unveiled a new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond trailer titled Survive, showcasing what awaits Samus Aran on the planet Viewros. The roughly 70-second video features the bounty hunter's gunship in aerial combat and a pretty slick motorcycle move by Samus that's an homage to <a href="https://x.com/GameSpot/status/1726305588693389790" rel="nofollow ">the Akira slide</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Metroid Prime 4 trailer--seen below--also highlights a variety of locales on the mysterious planet. Samus finds herself in a lush jungle, outside a spiky black building that would look at home in The Matrix, and what we can only assume is the obligatory lava area at one point. The bounty hunter also scans a new enemy mechanoid called a psy-bot soldier as well as fights the boss Aberax (previously highlighted during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/metroid-prime-4-beyond-17-minutes-of-official-gameplay-nintendo-switch-2/2300-6465874/">a Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>).</p>

Last but not least, Sylux appears at the end, teasing the rival hunter as the main antagonist for the Switch and Switch 2 game.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-metroid-prime-4-beyond-ad-shows-a-curious-new-boss-fight/1100-6535658/">leaked Metroid Prime 4 ad seemingly revealed a new boss</a>. The commercial in question shows a player using mouse controls with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/">the Switch 2 Edition</a> of the game before encountering the spherical Xelios foe.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, GameSpot got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/">hands-on time with Metroid Prime 4</a>. The game from developer Retro Studios is set to launch on December 4--exactly one month away. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">two of the game's Amiibo</a> arrive this week.

The description doesn't specify which massive dinosaur Brutosaur mount it is, but it's likely not the original Mighty Caravan Brutosaur that was available during the game's Battle for Azeroth expansion to the tune of 5 million gold.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22Nf00VN0WM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/22Nf00VN0WM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That leaves the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur, which was available during a three-month period for WoW's 20th anniversary, as the likely candidate. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rare-world-of-warcraft-mount-returns-but-itll-cost-you-90/1100-6527385/" data-ref-id="1100-6527385">The mount cost $90</a>, making it the most expensive single in-game-shop item in the MMORPG's history.

The datamine doesn't indicate what the mount might cost this time around, but it's hard to imagine it becoming cheaper, lest those who bought it the first time around feel like they've been tricked.</p><p dir="ltr">In other WoW micro (macro?) transaction news, another datamine indicates <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-looks-to-be-getting-a-new-premium-currency-for-housing/1100-6535888/" data-ref-id="1100-6535888">Blizzard will introduce a new premium currency for housing</a>.

And, because this is somehow the first-ever time a Dragon Quest game has appeared on a <em>Game Informer </em>cover, we have an 8-page deep dive into the history of the Dragon Quest series, as told by the man who created it, Yuji Horii.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to that historical retrospective and a 12-page Dragon Quest Reimagined cover story, which features my thoughts after playing the game for two hours alongside words from the game's various development leads, this issue is jam-packed with excellent features. Senior Associate Editor Marcus Stewart spoke with Edmund McMillan, the creator of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>, about his new game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>.

The entire GI crew banded together to create a round-up of the best co-op games to play during the holidays!&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of holidays, Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller scoured storefronts to bring you 10 pages of great gifts for the gamers in your life. Elsewhere in this exciting issue, we have a look at the history of games that <em>Game Informer </em>has awarded the prestigious 10/10 review score (because this issue features a review for a game we gave a 10!), the top five dragon quests, a look at Riot's upcoming League of Legends card game, Riftbound, a look back at 2025 aka The Year of the Ninja, and even a post-launch <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> interview with Sucker Punch Prodcutions.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you haven't seen it yet, here's another look at the beautiful and vibrant Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover, which features Prince Keifer, Hero, and Maribel avoiding the gaze of a stone golem in the game's unique visual style, which is based on real-life dolls Square Enix created:&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Dangen Entertainment and developer Friends of Safety have announced that the action horror RPG Kingdom of Night will be available from December 2nd on PC. A console version is due at a later date. Kingdom of Night is an isometric title that has a 1980’s theme to it, and in it players choose their class and abilities to deal with a variety of monstrosities, some of which can be seen in the new release date trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom of Night - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKuC0YZZhuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of Kingdom of Night follows John as he embarks on a mission to save the town of Miami from the forces of Baphomet who seeks to conquer. In addition to fighting Baphomet’s monsters, John also has to deal with high school bullies. John can be one of five classes, Barbarian, Knight, Rogue, Necromancer and Sorcerer, with each giving base powers and stats that can be improved upon in the skill tree. The game can also be played in local co-op, so someone else can accompany John to face the forces of evil and the high school bullies.&nbsp;Players will be able to freely explore the town of Miami, finding quests to tackle as they do so as well as secrets which could deliver some powerful gear.</p>
<p>Kingdom of Night will be available on Steam, GOG, Humble Store, and itch.io, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695580/Kingdom_of_Night_Demo/">with a demo currently available on Steam.</a></p>

And folks, it's looking and sounding <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>This is the third Hyrule Warriors game and is completely canonical, set long before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Taking place during the Imprisoning War, it follows Zelda after she's been transported back in time, basically filling in the gaps on what the princess was doing while she was stuck in the past.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>For our very own PJ O'Reilly, it's probably the best Hyrule Warriors game to date, with near-perfect performance, deliriously fun combat, and a pretty solid story, the only downside is that the maps are a little safe. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">PJ's 9/10 review</a> concludes that "Lessons have been learned from both Hyrule Warriors and Age of Calamity, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it."</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:192867 @ 1762275649 -->
<p>But of <em>course</em> we're not the only ones who have covered the game. While some outlets are holding back until launch day (due to embargo restrictions), there are plenty of critics willing to share their thoughts on Age of Imprisonment.</p>
<p>Let's start near the top, shall we? <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/">RPG Site</a> is equally as glowing as us on the game, rewarding it a <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18880-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-review">9/10</a>, with reviewer James Galizio even calling it "a sleeper hit for my personal game of the year." The story strikes a good balance between Zelda and the other characters, and the game is stuffed full of the best Musou combat to date:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Age of Imprisonment isn't just a great Zelda spinoff, but confidently stands among some of the singular best games in the entire Zelda series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming down a notch, <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/">CGMagazine</a>'s Chris de Hoog awards Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">an 8.5/10</a> and an Editor's Choice, calling the story "a fulfilling complement" to TOTK, with particular praise given to the blend of the mainline game's combat with the Warriors formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> had me hooked for its entire 30-hour+ quest, always torn between wanting to see what happened next in the story and seeking out the components to unlock new features for the characters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another outlet praising the game's combat is <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/">VGC</a>, with friend of the site and NL contributor Chris Scullion awarding Zelda's Musou outing <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">a 4/5</a>. If you're still worried about the frame rate, then here's another review stating that "noticeable" dips below 60fps are "rare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The combat is the best in the Hyrule Warriors series to date, and once you’ve reached the credits, about 18-20 hours in, there’s still a hell of a lot to do thanks to a large map filled with side-quests, unlockable characters, and other missions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TJ Denzer over at <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/">Shacknews</a> joins the performance cheers with <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/146650/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-score">an 8/10 review</a>, but is less enthusiastic about the sidequests and music. However, the combat is once again the star (we're also <em>big</em> fans of that headline, 'Ultrahanding out beatdowns'):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trying out Switch Skills and Sync Attacks between practically every pair of characters were some of my favorite things in this game and I hope Koei Tecmo tries something like them in future games..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slipping into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">7/10</a> scores we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">GameSpot</a>'s Richard Wakeling, who says that performance issues "are almost completely absent". The downsides come in the form of an inconsequential story and a lack of mission variety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story doesn't feel essential enough to satisfy pure Zelda fans, but by ironing out its predecessor's performance issues and introducing a varied roster of rewarding characters, Age of Imprisonment marks a high point for the spin-off series thus far."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/">Gamesradar+</a>'s Oscar Taylor-Kent is a little more muted, awarding the game a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">3/5</a> citing "underutilized" spaces and "bland maps" with many missions lacking "depth", but combat is "sharply improved" compared to previous Hyrule Warriors games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I have more fun revisiting the less fully featured Age of Calamity, something has gone amiss. They did call it Age of Imprisonment, I suppose – but I wish they'd let me off the leash a little. Zelda's beam sword hungers for more."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is sitting on a respectable <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">78 on Metacritic from 52 reviews</a> (at the time of writing this), but that number will change over the coming days. OpenCritic sits at a similar <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19291/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">77 but from only 18 reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Still, you'll be able to judge for yourself when Age of Imprisonment launches on Switch 2 on <strong>6th November 2025</strong>. What a treat, hey?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and other stuff you might care about. Don’t worry, I’m not mad that you didn’t call at all while you were away. I’m used to it, really. Anyway, let’s move on and talk about <em>Concord</em>, a new<em> Vampire Survivors</em> spin-off game, bad news for <em>PUBG</em> fans on PS5, and good news for <em>Battlefield 6</em> players craving a big new map to play on.</p> <p><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> finally has a big Conquest, but EA didn’t make it</strong></p> <p>Since <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s beta earlier this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803">players have been begging the devs to make bigger maps</a>. And a few fans have grown tired of waiting and have used <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s own in-game content creation tools to turn the shooter’s recently added (and very big) battle royale map into a few different massive conquest levels. You can see some gameplay of this below via Jackfrags.</p>

  <p>Watching gameplay of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/two_new_br_maps_with_three_conquest_gamemodes/">Golf Course conquest map created by Kurtinthegrind</a> and a few other players has me both excited for the future of Portal<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>BF6</em>‘s mode dedicated to user-created levels and modes<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and sad that we don’t have a big map like this in the official game yet. Portal, while fun, has various restrictions, including smaller XP rewards and less populated matches and servers. And from what I can tell, this big new conquest map made by fans runs well on console and PC. So the engine seems capable of handling this kind of experience.</p>

 <p>Honestly, if I were running Battlefield Studios, I’d be porting at least the Golf Course map into the main game ASAP as a bonus extra new level for this season. Don’t even tease it. Just drop it and watch fans go wild.</p> <p><strong><em>Concord</em> directly mentioned during UK government debate over consumer laws</strong></p> <p>Remember <em>Concord</em>? It was that short-lived hero-based FPS from Sony that <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">shut down just two weeks after launch</a>. Well, <em>Concord</em> was brought up in the UK House of Commons during a debate about consumer rights and laws regarding live-service video games, an issue raised by the Stop Killing Games movement. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-sudden-shutdown-is-such-a-big-deal-its-been-brought-up-during-uk-government-debates-on-video-game-consumer-laws">According to <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, MP Ben Goldsborough led the debate on Monday.</p>

 <p>During the debate, another MP specifically named <em>Concord</em>, stating: “A recent example is <em>Concord</em>, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn’t always the case.”</p>

 <p>Don’t expect any change to UK laws to come from this, as the government <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0195/">has already stated it has no plans to change consumer laws</a> in regards to live-service, online-only video games.</p> <p><strong><em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Warhammer</em> collide in new official spin-off</strong></p>  <p>As announced on November 4, the folks behind<em> Vampire Survivors </em>are teaming up with the <em>Boltgun </em>devs to create a new spin-off game officially known as <em>Warhammer Survivors.</em> In a press release for the newly revealed game, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/dmvj6ri9/tear-through-hordes-of-tyranids-and-skaven-in-upcoming-video-game-warhammer-survivors/">Games Workshop describes it</a>&nbsp;as a “brand new and completely standalone survivors-style game” that is set in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> universes. <em>Warhammer Survivors</em> launches sometime in 2026.</p> <p><strong>You’ll have to re-earn all your <em>PUBG</em> trophies on PS5</strong></p> <p>The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 ports of <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> will soon be dead and done, <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-bad-news-for-pubg-players-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-2000617500">as previously announced in August</a>. The devs are going to focus on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S ports of the battle royale game instead. But a new wrinkle for PS4 players is that when you leap to PS5, you’ll have to re-earn all your trophies again. This was confirmed in a new blog post from the devs who say they “explored various options with Sony Interactive Entertainment to make trophy transfer possible,” but due to how much data was involved, it would be “technically difficult to implement.” So they aren’t going to do it. “We kindly ask for your understanding,” <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9355">said the <em>PUBG</em> team.</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-perfect-creepy-dreams-ps4-2000640924">New<em> Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> fan game looks good</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-eternity-3-turn-based-mode-update-avowed-crpg-2000640875">RPG <em>Pillars of Eternit</em>y is getting a turn-based option a decade later</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-loot-hack-cheat-embark-studios-2000640831"><em>Arc Raiders</em> devs returning loot to people killed by cheaters</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Few characters in pop culture exemplify goodness like Paddington Bear. The Peruvian bear has captured the hearts of children and adults alike in his books, television series, and, most recently, his beloved live-action films starring Ben Whishaw. Now, the British icon has returned to the theater for the first time in 40 years with </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical</span></i><span>, and I’m so obsessed with how the show brings the anthropomorphic bear onto the stage.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The London production began this weekend, with its first show debuting in the West End on November 1. You can recreate the sets, cast brilliant actors as the human characters, and have excellent songs to bring it all together, but the entire show would have fallen apart if they couldn’t bring Paddington himself convincingly to life on stage. Instead of merely using a puppet, </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>utilizes a combination of animatronics, an on-stage actor, and an off-stage voice to bring the character to the show, and the results are so impressive that it’s almost uncanny.</span></p>

   <p><span>The actor you’ll see in costume on stage is Arti Shah, a little person who dons the full-body Paddington suit. While she’s interacting with the other actors, James Hameed stands off-stage and recites Paddington’s spoken lines. The costume is also fitted with animatronics so the little guy can move his mouth, blink, and be expressive on stage, which Hameed controls to match his line delivery. It’s a multi-person job, but it’s hard to argue with the results. Fans who have seen the show live are smitten with Paddington, and those of us unlucky enough not to be in London are desperate for the show to come stateside. I’ve only seen a handful of Broadway shows since moving to NYC, but I will be there for </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>if it comes over.</span></p>   <p><span>For now, </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>is only in London, so if you’re looking for a dose of marmalade-flavored feel-good joy and don’t live there, you can still boot up the excellent live-action movies on your movie streaming service of choice.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Are There Bots In Battlefield 6? Casual Mode & Lobbies, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bots-battlefield-6-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When you play Battlefield 6 online, you expect to face the wrath of human players. There’s been a lot of discussion about whether or not bots exist in Battlefield 6’s main online multiplayer modes, and we’ve got all the answers and more.</p>



<p>Barely a month into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-dlc-trophy-list-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>‘s launch, and the word bot has been used to death. It literally means nothing anymore; it’s been said or typed that much. A bot is an AI-controlled character, and you usually find them in training modes, single-player campaigns, and they’re seldom seen in online multiplayer. Which is why it’s more curious that Battlefield 6 players think BF 6 has a bot infestation.</p>



<p>There was a clear and obvious answer to this question for a long time, and then Battlefield Studios made it even easier.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-battlefield-6-have-bots">Does Battlefield 6 Have Bots?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For those seeking a chill time. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 does feature bots in its online multiplayer component, not just the campaign.</strong></p>



<p>It’s official, Battlefield 6 has bots. They were already appearing in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Portal</a>, and in multiplayer from the game’s launch (more on this later), but EA and Battlefield Studios made this mainstream information on November 1 with the addition of the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Breakthrough</a> playlist option.</p>



<p>Here’s what the Battlefield Comms page said about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough and this new mode is now live in the main menu under the Multiplayer tab.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Casual makes it so that the majority of the lobby is AI bots—with a sprinkling of human players. This is to give users a more relaxed environment without the worry of human sweats ruining their evening. Bots are very easily identifiable as they won’t move authentically.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing: Casual Breakthrough</p><p>We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Their movement patterns are more robotic and stiff. They also tend to stand on the spot and shoot, and you won’t find them jumping and sliding about everywhere in a bid to kill you with motion sickness. If you choose Casual Breakthrough, you’re guaranteed to come up against bots, but let’s find out why you’re coming up against them outside of this mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-bots-appearing-in-battlefield-6-matchmaking">Why Are Bots Appearing In Battlefield 6 Matchmaking?</h2>



<p><strong>Bots can be used to populate any Battlefield 6 server if the matchmaking system is struggling to fill the lobby.</strong></p>



<p>This has been an ongoing issue since day one: Lobbies being filled up with extra bots to make up the numbers. Battlefield 6 has a more than healthy player count, and will continue to do so for months, maybe years. The game is popular, everyone is enjoying the return to form, and it’s bizarre that bots can appear so regularly.</p>



<p>I’ve encountered my share of bots during later EU hours, and it’s been reported that “Outside peak hours, most lobbies are filled with bots in non-EU/US regions,” according to Reddit.</p>



<p>Multiple regions are reporting that they encounter bots outside of the peak windows, too. Adding bots is simply the most effective way to ensure lobbies are filled with players and there’s no team disparity—especially chaotic 64-player Conquest games, for example.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Worryingly, EA nor Battlefield Studios (as of writing) has yet to address the problem. The closest they’ve come to acknowledging bots is the Casual Breakthrough announcement, and that’s it. Given that a big goal for Battlefield 6 was complete player communication, we’re hoping for some feedback or acknowledgement sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>How frequently are you encountering bots in non-Casual Breakthrough matches? Is it harming your enjoyment of the game?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developer Epic Games has issued a fresh user survey polling players over its pet-like Sidekicks — and in particular, the need to rebuy each creature to get another version, after your basic design choices are made permanent. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, Fortnite forces fans to lock in their Sidekick's body color, shape and style upon first use, and warns players that their decision cannot be changed again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, just one Sidekick animal is available — banana dog hybrid Peels, which you get two of within Fortnite's current The Simpsons battle pass. Upon first equipping the pooch, you must decide from three banana skin colors (yellow, yellow-green, or mottled), an ear shape (pointy, less pointy, flat) and a body style (slender, or thicc).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After this, each Sidekick also comes with its own mini battle pass of cosmetic add-ons (Peels has an emote where it dances with maracas, and also a couple of shirt options it can wear  that can be equipped at will). But the creature's base design choices are indeed no longer changeable, leaving players who want to try other body options seeking a separate Peels incarnation to change from the ground up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later this week, on November 7, a selection of additional Sidekicks will be available separately via the Fortnite in-game shop, with upcoming creatures set to include more dog breeds, a dinosaur, and even a Fishstick fish in a bubble. Each will cost either 1,200 or 1,500 V-Bucks (around $10-$14), and each is expected to offer numerous permanent cosmetic options fans will have to buy numerous versions of to own them all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the backlash to this decision, Epic Games has sent a fresh user survey sent to Fortnite players, including myself, that specifically asks for feedback on Sidekicks' permanent customization mechanic — offering some fans a glimmer of hope that the whole thing is being reconsidered.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build the LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"How do you feel about the Sidekicks cosmetic?" asks one question. "Did you know that Sidekicks have basic features that you can only customize once upon claiming that Sidekick (e.g. its color and shape?" asks another. And then:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"How do you feel about having to purchase an additional copy of the same Sidekick if you want to customize your Sidekick with different basic features?" asks a third query, with various options to reply, from "strongly dislike" to "strongly like."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have suggested Epic Games originally envisaged buying Sidekicks to be like adopting a creature from a pet shop — with a specific design you bond with over time (and as you unlock their battle pass). Others have also said that the pricing here, while steep, is little different to Fortnite's also widely-disliked Kicks (digital shoes), which often cost upwards of 1,000 V-Bucks for licensed designs, and regularly require players to buy multiple copies to access different colors. (Around a dozen near-identical digital pairs of Crocs exist in the game, each of which must be bought separately.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But others have compared Sidekicks to the highly customizable nature of many character skins — and indeed, the color options available to Fortnite's more-basic Pets, which launched back during the game's earlier years, and can be customized at will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, it feels like the widespread response to Sidekicks' design limitations has struck a chord. Far from a fun new cosmetic type — and one that could prove hugely lucrative, when licensed Sidekicks like Grogu and Stitch arrive — launching to positive sentiment, their soft-launch via Peels has only stirred up a backlash, with various reddit threads and social media posts now encouraging other players not to buy more when they do go on sale later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Epic Games change course? Time will tell, though answers to that survey (and the sales from this week's shop update) may play a part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's why we're holding our full thoughts on the Switch 2 exclusive until launch.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You may have noticed reviews for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment start to pop up around the internet today, with one site’s take missing from the roundups: ours! But don’t worry – unlike Zelda’s 100-year-long wait for Link to emerge from the Shrine of Resurrection, our delay will only last a couple of days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/mrhurgy/reviews">Logan Plant</a> is reviewing Age of Imprisonment for IGN, and that review is basically in the can and ready to go live already. So why the wait? Well, the embargo restrictions Nintendo sent alongside a review code were particularly strict this time around, preventing reviews that publish ahead of launch from discussing <em>any </em>non-public story details whatsoever. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we always try to avoid spoilers in our reviews, and are generally happy to steer clear of specific surprises a developer wants to preserve if requested, not being able to discuss what happens in the story <em>at all </em>is something we simply could not agree to. So, we decided to hold the review until Age of Imprisonment comes out later this week so we can publish our full thoughts without those limitations. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t mean we're going to spoil anything major about Age of Imprisonment’s plot, because even being able to discuss non-spoilery details is important here. When Nintendo itself has put an emphasis on Age of Imprisonment telling the canonical events leading up to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in its marketing for this game, it’s pretty critical that we can clearly and candidly tell you how we feel about those events in our review.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll publish our review when Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment becomes available on the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop, which we’re expecting to happen at around 9 p.m. PT on Wednesday, November 5. While you wait, you can check out Logan's Playlist ranking every Zelda game released in the Switch 1 and 2 era so far down below, including new mainline entries, spinoffs, and remakes.

A few hints for Fortnite Chapter 7 have started to emerge, and signs point to the immanent arrival of The Bride, a character played by Uma Thurman in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2.</p><p>Fortnite content creator NickEh30 posted a teaser for Chapter Seven that has a set of coordinates that lead to the Hollywood sign. The text in the teaser says, "Now Playing / Zero Hour / Chapter Seven / Fortnite After Dark With Q&amp;U." In Kill Bill, Q&amp;U was the abbreviation that Tarantino and Thurman used for their collaboration.</p><p>The new season of Fortnite should arrive near the end of November, which be only a few days before the release of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair on December 5. Both halves of Tarantino's movie have been edited back into a single film of this limited theatrical event. That may explain the timing of The Bride's Fortnite debut. If other Kill Bill characters appear, we wouldn't bet against the Deadly Vipers, the Crazy 88, or even Bill himself.</p><p>Fortnite characters were also spotted at the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series victory celebration in Los Angeles. One of the signs held up said, "Game 7 first, Chapter Seven Next!!" The "Nov 29" date in the sign held by Big Dill may also be the launch point for Chapter Seven.</p><p>Fans have also noticed that Chapter Seven is breaking format slightly by listing the number as a word. That's led to speculation about the return of The Seven, an enigmatic team of helmeted characters who haven't been seen in the game for a long time. </p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, separate rumors about a desert biome and an Area 51-like location has some fans speculating that a Fallout collaboration may also be coming. However, that's pure speculation at this point.</p><p>For now, if you've had your eye on the the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kang_and_Kodos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kang and Kodos</a> glider, there's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-fortnite-glider-how-to-unlock-the-simpsons-dlc-right-now-before-it-costs-money/1100-6535889/" data-ref-id="1100-6535889">an easy way to get it for free</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher NetEase is planning to shut down <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/02/former-world-of-warcraft-league-of-legends-lead-greg-street-reveals-new-studio-and">Fantastic Pixel Castle</a>, a studio it founded in 2023 and led by Greg Street, formerly of Blizzard and Riot Games. The studio was developing a triple-A MMORPG codenamed Ghost.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/another-netease-games-studio-is-shutting-down/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>, Street announced the impending closure on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391147465636397057/">LinkedIn</a> yesterday. He states Fantastic Pixel Castle (FPC) will be shuttered on November 17, unless it's able to secure funding to continue working on its MMO project independently.&nbsp;</p><p>“Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17," reads Street's statement. "While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains. While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there.”</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVX2OfQ8LV0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVX2OfQ8LV0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This news comes a few weeks after Fantastic Pixel Castle announced it was parting ways with NetEase. A <a href="https://www.fantasticpixelcastle.com/new-detail/?id=806">community blog post</a> published today on the studio's website expresses cautious optimism for securing last-minute funding, saying "we still believe Ghost has a fighting chance."</p><p>"We are still 100% focused on finding new funding to make our game," reads the blog post. "Even if the state of the industry feels fairly dire we’re encouraged by the conversations we’ve been having and fortunate that we have a great playable demo already! So there is still some hope to be had - hold onto that hope because now we’re going to get kinda real."</p><p>Fantastic Pixel Castle is the latest casualty of the China-based NetEase's gradual shift away from funding international studios. This change in strategy has forced partnered developers such as the Vancouver-based <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/another-former-mass-effect-leads-studio-is-facing-funding-issues-as-worlds-untold-pauses-operations/">Worlds Untold</a>, the Austin-based <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mmo-veteran-rich-vogel-confirms-netease-has-shut-down-his-studio-t-minus-zero/">T-Minus Zero</a>, and the Seattle-based <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a> to either close or pause development in a scramble to secure new funding.</p>

<p>Though it never had a formal reveal, Fantastic Pixel Castle’s “Ghost” project was planned to be a fantasy MMORPG. Despite its genre, FPC’s website states Ghost would “avoid the tropes of fantasy that you've already seen hundreds of times,” and was centered on a setting called the Shardlands, with players alternating between realms known as Blue and Red Shards.</p><p>These functioned as player servers, with Blue Shards designed for private play with friends while Red Shards offered a more traditional, massively multiplayer experience. Ghost would feature a chapter-based narrative, character classes, &nbsp;and a more streamlined approach to make playing with friends easy, regardless of their character level and progress.</p><p>For more on NetEase, check out the June reveal of the publisher's first triple-A single-player title, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/20/netease-reveals-its-first-triple-a-single-player-game-blood-message-and-it-looks-awesome">Blood Message</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/04/fantastic-pixel-castle-a-studio-founded-by-former-world-of-warcraft-lead-faces-closure]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>On our recent expedition to the Tokyo Game Show, one of the most intriguing games we came across was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4131220/AKIBA_LOST/">AKIBA Lost</a>. This adventure game is set to revitalise the FMV genre, with over 20 hours of live-action footage and more than 100,000 images designed to build up a branching narrative where you take control. We were able to catch up with director Shinsuke Umeda as well as members of the cast, and we got to talk through this remarkable project.</p>
<p>AKIBA Lost is undoubtedly a post-modern production, a video game about video game development. Focusing on ‘genius creator’ Daiki Shinjo, he announces that he will produce a game based on a mysterious incident from the past where six girls went missing in Tokyo shopping district, Akihabara.</p>
<p><iframe title="AKIBA LOSTショートPV-新城大輝 / 北山宏光編-" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKxiI4O3nr0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The cast of the game includes Aoi Shinjo (portrayed by Sayuri Matsumura) as a maid, Yukimi Kurahashi (portrayed by Momoko Tanabe), who appears as a game streamer, Moe Kurosu (portrayed by Misato Ugaki) who’s a gourmet writer, Kokone Nagato (portrayed by Yui Oguri of AKB48) an underground idol, Chihiro Jimbo (portrayed by Azusa Ohara) a Shrine maiden and Wakana Yusa (portrayed by MINA) who takes on the role of a cosplayer. Umeda states, “The characters that you meet in this game represent different aspects of Japanese culture. So the people who play, not only get to know more about Japan, but I’m certain that they will also grow to love it.”</p>
<p>The mystery begins when Aoi disappears, and a phone call brings a terrifying warning, telling Shinjo to stop the production, or else the tragedy will repeat itself. It’s immediately a compelling mystery, and one that feels as though it will really resonate with gamers, especially as the team at IzanagiGames are targeting production values far higher than we’ve seen for this type of game before. That’s helped by the involvement of Nippon Television Network Corporation and Nippon Television AX-ON Inc., whose expertise in TV production is set to make this one of the best-looking live footage games we’ve ever seen.</p>

<div id="attachment_465562"><p id="caption-attachment-465562">Narrative choices –&nbsp;Yukimi Kurahashi portrayed by Momoko Tanabe</p></div>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the game is the fact that it has a branching narrative. Players will be able to make their own choices, and through a single run, you’ll likely experience a very different story to someone else. The team hoped that players would want to complete multiple runs through the game to see everything, and explore each character’s full arc too, especially as there is the potential for unexpected outcomes. Umeda said, “There are possibilities that some choices you make with one character affects their timeline but there is also a possibility that a choice you made with another character has an influence on somebody else. So you could end up stopping a timeline because of a choice.”</p>
<p>Players will ‘zap’ between the seven central characters, allowing them to build up a wider understanding of the events as they unfold, by seeing it from multiple perspectives. It sounds thoroughly intriguing, and with the TV-like framing for the live-action, there’s every chance that Akiba Lost will feel utterly unique.</p>
<p>When asked how much of his own experiences as a developer were being brought into the game, director Shinsuke Umeda stated,”100%”, continuing, “That’s because the circumstances are special, it’s a game about a game creator, making a game. As a game director, I don’t think that there would be circumstances that could relate to your own self so much!”</p>
<p>The cast were similarly forthcoming about their involvement in the game, and in its choice-based systems, with Yui Oguri saying, “It’s difficult to imagine how it feels to be a virtual character, and someone else controlling you, because it’s not something that’s normally done.” Azusa Ohara continued, “There are patterns to things that can happen, so it’s fun to see which person does what and how their character reacts accordingly.”</p>
<div id="attachment_465561"><p id="caption-attachment-465561">Moe Kurosu (portrayed by Misato Ugaki)</p></div>
<p>Misato Ugaki said, “I’ve grown up seeing games, Pokémon, Zelda, a variety of games, but it’s the first time I’ve been asked to be in one. It was definitely an exhilarating request, but, at the same time, new. It’s something I’ve grown up watching, and now I get to be in it!”</p>
<p>It was interesting to discover that the majority of the cast were also gamers themselves, giving them an insight and affection for the format and subject matter of AKIBA Lost that other actors may not have. It’s an eclectic mix too, from MINA, who plays Fortnite, to Misato Ugaki who cited Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom as her favourite. Azusa Ohara loved Hogwarts Legacy, but perhaps the person most in tune with the direction of AKIBA Lost will be Sayuri Matsumura, whose love for the classic Super Nintendo Visual Novel, Banshee’s Last Cry, seems like an ideal person to test out the game she’s starring in.</p>

<p>One of the clearest things from our time with the cast and director was how much fun everyone seemed to be having. While they’ve all worked on various projects, none of the cast have ever done anything like this before, and while some of the technical details made filming harder – the camera captured both the live action footage and the still images at the same time – it seemed that everyone was fully invested in the opportunity, and the possibilities that this format could bring.</p>
<p>AKIBA Lost is clearly an ambitious project, but after talking to the cast and team behind it, they’re clearly putting everything they have into it, from both a technical standpoint, and a personal one. If you’re a fan of visual novels, this might be a refreshing alternative, and a potential first step into a new and revitalised FMV genre.</p>

<p>Thought Nintendo had forgotten about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>? Think again! December's big release has just landed a brand-new trailer titled 'Survive' and, expectedly, it's still looking awesome.</p>
<p>Now, the trailer itself is only a little over a minute long, and you will have seen a lot of the footage before, but there are still some brief new snippets for those who have been going through every previous reveal with a fine-tooth comb.</p>
<p>We get a glimpse at some cool-looking psychic platforms, mysterious jungle vehicles, cutscene dogfights and more of that open desert area that we know we'll be speeding around on Vi-O-La. There's also a slightly different look at a fight with a pack of wolves, plenty of dramatic locales and Samus doing yet another <strong>Akira</strong> slide — because we can never get enough of <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>In short, things are still being kept pretty securely under wraps — hey, it's not like the game comes out <em>one month today</em> or anything... What we do know is that the long-awaited adventure is looking mighty fine. Let's just keep those fingers crossed that it can live up to the anticipation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for its GeForce graphics cards. This one is optimized for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, by far the biggest release scheduled this month. The game will launch on November 14, with Activision <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding itself in a bit of a pinch</a> following the releases of two highly successful shooters: Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The new Game Ready driver is also optimized for Europa Universalis V, the latest entry (following a hiatus of twelve years) in Paradox Interactive's premier grand strategy game. Europa Universalis V is out today on PC and will support DLSS Super Resolution with the option to enable the latest transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Lastly, the Game Ready driver is optimized for Ubisoft's Anno 117: Pax Romana, a real-time strategy game with city building elements. The game will debut on November 13 with support for DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Wreckreation, a massive open world racing game focused on destruction, launched a week ago with support for DLSS Super Resolution and optional transformer model via the NVIDIA app. Earlier in October, indie developer Jaw Drop Games released Deathground, a co-op horror game where players desperately try to survive against dinosaurs. Deathground supports DLSS 4 with Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Square Enix will update Final Fantasy VII Rebirth today with DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, accelerating frame rates in the popular action RPG for owners of GeForce RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs. The game already features DLSS Super Resolution, but it will now be upgradable to the new transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Lastly, on November 6, Finnish developer Channel37 will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783560/The_Last_Caretaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch The Last Caretaker in early access</a>. This is a first-person survival crafting game where players step into the role of a machine tasked with securing humanity's future after a cataclysm that has flooded the Earth. Players will navigate a dangerous ocean world to salvage technology that could save humankind. The game will support the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/warframe/">Warframe</a> will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next year, but the longer wait will be worth it, according to the developer.</p>



<p>In a new livestream, Digital Extremes confirmed that the Switch 2 native version of their popular game will launch sometime in 2026, disappointing those who had hoped the game would debut on the current-generation Nintendo console before the end of 2025. Although a precise release window hasn't been confirmed, the developer did specifiy they will release the game as early as they possibly can in the new year.</p>



<p>No matter how long the wait will be, it looks like it will be worth it. During the livestream, Digital Extremes shared new footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version running in handheld mode with NVIDIA DLSS on, and it looks quite promising. Unfortunately, the developer didn't discuss specifics such as resolution and frame rate targets, so there's still a lot we don't know about this new version of the game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Those who wish to play Warframe on the Nintendo Switch 2 and cannot wait for the native version to be released have the option of playing the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.nintendo.com/it-it/Giochi/Giochi-scaricabili-per-Nintendo-Switch/Warframe-1471859.html?srsltid=AfmBOopA0r6U6DlySfK3HhSAXcOWeZm6NLLExXaaaCbPqv7KSUGTVJuy">original Switch release</a> via backward compatibility. This version of the game doesn't look or run great, however, so those looking to have the best possible experience will inevitabily have to wait for the new version to launch. Hopefully, it won't take too long.</p>

            <p>"In a decaying society, art, if it is truthful, must also reflect decay," Austrian journalist and Marxist Ernst Fischer wrote in The Necessity of Art. "And unless it wants to break faith with its social function, art must show the world as changeable. And help to change it." I can't help but feel he'd very much appreciate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>'s fourth early access update, which has added in a tool you can use to brush detailed rust, dirt, and dents onto the canvas of your old banger. Said tool has been given a suitably glorious name: CRAP-IT.</p>

<p>Yep, developers Bugbear have finally made the destructive racer's car customisation more detailed than just picking a colour. CRAP-IT looks to work like your standard livery editor, but with a fitting focus on weathering effects that go beyond your usual set of stickers and paints. That said, you can still paste decals all over your ride and skimp on the rust if you're allergic to driving anything that looks like it belongs in a scrapyard.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm just glad to see Wreckfest 2's car customisation starting to take shape, as it's been one element missing as Bugbear have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-early-access-review">assembled a fun racing chassis</a> and begun to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-adds-new-cars-and-muddy-tracks-with-more-planned-next-month">bolt more cars and tracks onto it</a>.</p>
<p>On the topic of cars and tracks, this update adds in possibly the most important demo derby combatant of them all - the Volkswagen Beetle-esque Buggy. Ferdinand Porsche might be more well known for rear-engined sportscars, but damn could he and the likes of Hungarian engineer Béla Barényi design a car that's fun to lob around like a concrete egg on wheels to the exetent you sort of forget <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g15378761/volkswagen-beetle-models-by-year/">its origin</a> as a people's car envisioned by the Nazis. To be fair, I think slamming it around a track like Crash Canyon 2.0 counts as giving the moustache bloke the middle finger, give fascism's notorious disapproval of hairpins and head-on collisions that waste metal which could instead be used to prop up a far-right, authoritarian, and ultranationalist state.</p><p>Beyond these additions, Bugbear have also revamped how the game simulates tyres, as well as suspension and how cars deform when bashed into things. You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/600793783198549313?l=english">full notes</a> if you're keen to know the full bug fix rundown.</p>
<p>I'm off to wonder how I've managed to shoehorn references to two political schools of thought into an article about cars going vroom vroom, then smash. Then I'll go and spend three hours spelling out the word 'boom' in rusty dents.</p>
