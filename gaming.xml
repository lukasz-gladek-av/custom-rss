            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis group Circana has released its US sales data for the gaming industry in June 2024, and given the release of a certain high-profile DLC expansion, the month's best-selling game probably won't come as a surprise.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366822606786676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">always-dependable Mat Piscatella on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the best-selling game for June was&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, almost certainly driven by the release of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">on the 21st of that month</a>. Given that&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>had sold five million copies at last count (which was less than a week after the DLC's release), it's fair to say the expansion has been an unqualified success.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what's trailing behind&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>on the all-format sales chart, <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i>&nbsp;is in second place, and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>, a collection of many of the games in that venerable franchise that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam">launched on Steam in June</a>, is in third.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it looks like the strong sales performance of that collection is based entirely on its Steam release. Hey, publishers! Release your games on Steam!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-integrum-masterpiece-circana-us-sales-data-june-2024.jpg?itok=MojB0A26 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-integrum-masterpiece-circana-us-sales-data-june-2024.jpg?itok=q8tglr_M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece&nbsp;</em>was released on Steam in June, and it looks like it's done pretty well sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>On a year-to-date basis, the best-selling premium game as of June 2024 is still&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>taking the second and third spots.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was June's most-played game on both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, although on PC, the title goes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. Admittedly, that's probably because Circana is using Steam as the basis for its data, and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Steam.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>was also the best-selling premium game on both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S for June, while&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>was the month's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-financials-q1-2025">best-selling game on Switch</a>. Again, though,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>isn't available for Nintendo's platform, although it's pretty amusing to imagine what an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>Switch port might look like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-luigis-mansion-2-hd.jpg?itok=cdNeWhax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-luigis-mansion-2-hd.jpg?itok=pXv28L2A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>has done pretty well for Nintendo in June.</figcaption></figure><p>In hardware terms, the PS5 led June's sales figures for both unit and dollar sales. The Switch trailed behind in second place in unit sales, while the two Xbox Series models combined took second place for dollar sales.</p>
<p>As always, it's well worth reading Piscatella's <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366670282248225" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full thread</a> if you want some more nerdy stats about gaming industry sales. July's figures will inevitably be released in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for those as and when we get them.</p>

After a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173544/valorant-ps5-xbox-release-date-riot">brief beta period in June</a>, the console version of <em>Valorant </em>will be available in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Brazil and features all the same gameplay, heroes, and abilities as the PC version.</p><p><em>Valorant </em>on console won’t have crossplay support because Riot Games wants to maintain “competitive integrity.” That means PC players won’t be getting controller support, either. The game will support cross-progression, so any skins and progression will carry over between PC and console. Both PC and console players will also receive simultaneous platform releases, including balance patches, new agents, map updates, premium content, and more.</p><div><figcaption>Valorant<em> Xbox gameplay.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Riot Games</cite></p></div><p>Riot Games has also made some tweaks to the console version of its 5v5 tactical shooter, largely to make it more controller-friendly for hip-fire gameplay. “Focus is a new shooting mode that behaves essentially like hip-fire, but with reduced sensitivity,” explains Arnar Gylfason, production director of <em>Valorant</em>. “This way, players can use hip-fire whenever they need speed in moving their camera / aim, but utilize focus mode whenever they need precision. This also approximates the shooting mechanic to what console players are used to in shooters, all of this without losing the added value <em>Valorant</em>’s aim down sights provides.”</p><p><em>Valorant </em>is now available to play for free on PC, Xbox Series S / X, and PS5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie have reportedly cancelled Payback, an unannounced project in the Destiny universe from former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> game director Luke Smith and project lead Mark Noseworthy. Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">brutal cost-cutting</a> this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">Gamespot</a>'s Tamoor Hussain, Giant Bomb's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y">Jeff Grubb</a> and Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737">Jason Schreier</a> (the source of the "a while ago" quote), as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">Eurogamer</a>. Payback's existence came to light in April, though Bungie have yet to formally comment on the subject. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny2Leaks/comments/1c0c0zg/dont_read_too_far_into_payback/">According to one self-alleged leaker</a>, the name is a reference to "Bungie getting payback against themselves by creating something they hope everyone will love". I don't quite follow this explanation, but the leaker in question did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny2Leaks/comments/1b17fzi/comment/ksg63he/?context=3">correctly predict</a> the introduction of Destiny 2's Prismatic character subclass, so they're more trustworthy than the average redditor with a bridge to sell.</p>
<p>Payback's cancellation seems to have paved the way for Smith and Noseworthy's departures. Gamespot sources claim that executive restructuring during this week's layoffs means the pair have "no path forward at Bungie". </p>
<p>The shockwaves from Bungie's headcount reduction continue to spread. As Nic wrote earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">insiders allege that the cuts have been in the works for a while</a>, regardless of the success or not of Destiny 2's excellent recent expansion The Final Shape. Many of The Final Shape's senior team are now gone, including <a href="https://x.com/Sphynxian/status/1818677295424717041">senior narrative designer Robert Brookes</a> and <a href="https://x.com/kperng/status/1818703463645430268">narrative lead Kwan Perng</a> - a miserable reward for yanking Destiny 2 out of the nose-dive instigated by the disastrous Lightfall expansion.</p>
<p>Aside from laying off staff, Bungie have also transferred 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment. Some of those roles will form a new PlayStation studio working on an untitled "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe". Those remaining at Bungie will double down on development of the Marathon reboot and future Destiny projects.</p>
<p>This week's layoffs were announced by Bungie CEO Pete Parsons, who confessed that Bungie leadership have been "over-ambitious" in their handling of the business. Parsons has been lying low on social media after it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">discovered</a> that he'd spent $2,414,550 on cars since September 2022, including a Porsche costing over $200,000 in the wake of a previous round of layoffs last October.</p>
<p>$2,414,550 is a tiny dent in the outgoings of a video game developer that even now has around 850 people on the books, but still - I wonder how many narrative designers you can hire for $2,414,550? Payback is certainly the word: laid-off Bungie <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818677930622685516">developers</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MyNameIsByf/status/1818671790538809555">Destiny players</a> continue to call on Parsons to do the decent thing and resign his position.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/making-mythmatch-with-a-healthier-team-culture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having spent much of his career as a gameplay programmer, the inspiration around </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is as much about Team Artichoke creative director Moo Yu’s journey of moving into design, though it might not seem apparent when playing the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778050/Mythmatch/">Steam</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> demo. Rather than depicting a Chinese man’s personal struggles in the industry, it’s set in Greek mythology, if </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had a cozier vibe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are nonetheless parallels, as Yu says “being seen as a creative force is very difficult because the stereotypes around Chinese culture is that they just copy and steal” whereas he feels other developers have the benefit of the doubt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Artemis, the struggle is earning her place as goddess of the hunt where she isn’t taken seriously by the immortal men of Olympus while her twin brother Apollo gets fast-tracked. Both however also have their own sense of privilege, Yu as a man in a male-dominated industry, and Artemis as someone with godlike powers (also depicted as white) in contrast to the mortals of Ithaca where you actually spend most of your time with in the core community-building aspects of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“[</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch’s</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> protagonist] was never a Chinese man, so going from the struggles of a Chinese man to a white woman, I felt completely fine making that change,” he explains. “One of the things I also want to talk about was privilege. I wanted it to be clear that Artemis is an immortal with privileges that the mortals don't have, and that she’s [initially] blind to her privilege and how much harder life is for mortals, so I think that was a really important theme.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To make a game about belonging and community, Yu also wants to avoid the pitfalls we’ve seen from the likes of indie studios like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/new-allegations-of-sexual-assault-surface-against-established-game-devs">Mountains</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/steve-gaynor-steps-back-from-fullbright-following-toxic-work-environment-allegations">Fullbright Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, studios that have also released games focusing on a female perspective but led by male auteurs who have since been accused of abusive behavior. “I don't like over-concentrations of power,” says Yu. “I very much consider myself someone that helps and provides and builds community.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mythmatch "><span>Mythmatch </span>is a community sim about privilege and power</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yu wasn’t however blind to the fact that the characters meant the narrative, while analogous to his own experiences, including finding a community to belong to (he also cites the movies Legally Blonde and Amélie as inspirations), is ultimately centered on gender issues. It was therefore always important for him to build an inclusive studio whose team members reflected the game he wanted to make.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Specifically, the writer must be a woman, must be able to understand instinctively rather than me doing research and trying to vaguely understand,” he says. Indeed, almost all of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamartichoke.com/">Team Artichoke</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s members are women, including artist Beidi Guo, writer Lara Barbier, and content designer Albertine Watson. Although the team is made up of part-time roles, Yu being the sole full-time developer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (an arrangement admittedly down to what he’s able to afford to pay), they’re all equally credited as team members, as evidenced on the studio’s homepage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There’s this obsession with art having this magical intrinsic value outside of the people that create it, but for me, the goal is to bring the people together. There's so much joy in working with others and getting the best out of everyone but also watching stuff come together and seeing how ideas mix together constantly.”</span></p><p>Image via Team Artichoke.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One important perspective he had learned was shaping </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s arc, which was going to have a progression one might associate with other cozy community sims. “At the beginning it was like, Artemis is trying to impress the gods [until] she's finally good enough,” he explains. “But the more I spoke to [the team], the more it became, 'You will never be good enough'-that’s the whole point of gatekeeping.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making sure narrative aligned with the mechanics was also important. For instance, when art came back that depicted Penelope (queen of Ithaca and Odysseus’s wife) as a Black woman, having Artemis come down as this white immortal ordering a Black mortal around suddenly felt very wrong. “Artemis doesn't understand the troubles that the mortals are going through, she shouldn't have the solutions,” Yu explains. “It should be coming from the mortals themselves.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Subverting the usual expectations of other life sims where you go into a town and effectively become its mayor creating a place in your own image, Artemis is helping the community of Ithaca. But also rather than doing this as a white savior, the gameplay is designed so that the mortals are doing the work to solve their problems, while Artemis is more of a support in a collaborative effort.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Artichoke Studios values people and process">Artichoke Studios values people and process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a part-time team, that does mean a slower development process, with no set release date for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but Yu accepts and embraces this. “As long as we're making the game we want to make and it comes out okay in the end, I think that's the higher priority,” he explains. “I tell everyone on my team, this is the rate, this is what I can afford. If you can find work that pays better, always prioritize that. Even if it did harm the project, the people are more important than the project.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In getting the best out of everyone with what they can give to the project as fairly as possible, everyone is also paid a flat day rate, a practice Yu had learned from working with Die Gute Fabrik. “It’s great because it made it so you don't have a concept of juniors anymore,” he explains. “You never say, 'we'll just give juniors the junior tasks' - everyone just has tasks. Everyone asks questions to everyone else, everyone ramps up, you're never thinking, 'this person makes less so we expect less of them'. It was just such an incredible experience to be part of that, so I wanted to replicate that as much as I can.”</span></p><p>Image via Team Artichoke.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also a practice that means avoiding the alternative other studios might be tempted to take, lowballing staff or where they feel compelled to work for free. Yu even mentions a team member who, as a newcomer to the industry, had not been expecting to be paid the full rate advertised. “I'm like, of course I'm going to pay the full rate advertised - I hired you because you can do the work I need, and this is how much the work is worth to me.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to hiring people, it has also been important that job descriptions do not exclude people based on arbitrary parameters like number of years of experience or number of games shipped. “It's like, here's what we need you to do, and if you think you can do that, please apply,” he says, adding that this has also attracted people both new or outside of the industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“When you don't pay well, you naturally add bias and discrimination into your process for people, you can easily weed out certain massive demographics of people,” Yu concludes. “If you're trying to tell a story that's about gatekeeping and exclusion, you need those people on your team because they have these great stories to share about it.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Yu acknowledges his decisions may not be 100% satisfactory for everyone, and not all studios can afford to work slowly, at least not if its team members don’t have other projects to sustain themselves, the intention is there to make an environment where people can enjoy working in where they’re treated fairly, an issue he still thinks isn’t very common in the industry.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Riot Games' free-to-play hero shooter Valorant launches today for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-hero-shooter-valorant-is-running-an-open-console-beta-and-its-live-right-now">recent console open beta</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game will not offer crossplay between its existing PC version and consoles "to maintain Valorant's renowned standard for competitive integrity", Riot has said.
</p>
<p>
In a press release issued today, Riot did at least promise future game updates would release simultaneously, so all additional maps and characters will arrive at the same time.

<p>
Today's launch caps off a four-year journey for Valorant from PC to consoles, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-is-prototyping-valorant-on-consoles-but-only-if-its-certain-the-console-port-can-deliver-the-experience">previously saying it was not "entirely sure" the game translated to console play</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Riot Games delivers a masterclass in competitive integrity, soulless precision and zealous, life-consuming obsession," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-review-exacting-infuriating-sublime">Eurogamer's Valorant review</a>, published back in 2020. "By design Valorant is a severe, soulless and uncompromising experience. That's often to its detriment, but it's more often to its success."

Valorant has repeatedly hit the headlines as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-outlines-plans-to-start-monitoring-valorant-voice-chat-in-a-bid-to-combat-disruptive-behaviour">Riot grapples</a> with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-pledges-harsher-more-immediate-punishment-for-voice-and-chat-toxicity">toxic elements</a> of the game's community. In May this year, Valorant's studio head said toxic players should go "play something else, we won't miss you." Said Riot Games boss Anna Donlon: "If you want to make evil statements under the guise of s**t talk, you aren't welcome here."

<p>GTA+ members that haven’t tried Bully yet are in for a ride. Bully follows the story of Jimmy Hopkins, a delinquent expelled from every school he has attended. His seemingly negligent mother has dropped him off at Bullworth Academy, where Jimmy has to steer through a whole year of chaos, pranks and classes. Your goal will be to climb the social ladder and eventually become the king of this school, but the journey isn’t easy. The whole institution is filled with some of the wildest personalities you have seen.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Four years after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/">Valorant</a>'s PC-only release, Riot's first-ever live-service shooter is now available to play on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Console users have been patiently awaiting Valorant's release on PlayStation and Xbox since the game first launched in 2020, and excitement grew when the console launch was officially announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">Summer Game Fest</a>.

		<p>Frontier Developments has shared a 15 minute deep dive into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> and the new water parks that are the new star attraction in this them park management sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet Coaster 2 | Deep Dive 1 - Coasters and Water Parks Combined" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/82gEWEdDn78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game Director Rich Newbold and Senior Executive Producer Adam Woods are on hand to give the demonstration, showing off a work-in-progress sandbox from a development build of the game.</p>
<p>They show off the geometric and custom shape pools you can make, the way that water flumes can be constructed – still balancing excitement, fear and nausea, just like the regular coasters – the new needs for things like changing rooms, wider concourses and more. Guests have also been redesigned to give more diversity of character models, broader animations to show how they’re feeling, and even the ability to get a nasty sunburn if you don’t supply sun screen for your guests!</p>
<p>Flat rides and coasters are obviously still very plentiful, and Frontier have made new rides and revamped previous ones. The humble teacups ride is now more plain to allow you to apply more customisations and themes, such as adding more of an underwater theme with scenery that can animate and move around with the ride. All rides will come with pre-defined, selectable patterns, too.</p>

<p>The next deep dive video will be exploring the new and the improved tools that players will get to use to create and manage these parks, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more on show in the deep dive, and we got a chance to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/planet-coaster-2-preview-slip-and-slide-into-the-wet-stuff/">preview</a> the game ahead of its big announcement last month. I said, “It’s been a hot minute since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> released back in 2016, and since the last expansion arrived in 2019. It’s high time to dive back in, and Planet Coaster 2 looks set to delight with its new options and deeper management.”</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 is coming out this autumn across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-blizzard-aa-team-might-give-microsoft-its-smaller-games-report-says.943200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-blizzard-aa-team-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new internal studio has reportedly been formed at Blizzard, with a view towards making smaller AA-level projects within the company's existing franchises and IP.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report by Windows Central</a>, Microsoft and Activision have created a "new smaller team within Blizzard comprised of King and various other employees", and that team will work on games in franchises like&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em>,&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>,&nbsp;<em>StarCraft</em>, and more.</p>
<p>Windows Central's report points to the fact that many employees of King.com, which is a Microsoft subsidiary thanks to its inclusion within the Activision Blizzard umbrella, have recently changed their LinkedIn profiles to reflect a move to Blizzard. According to Windows Central's "sources", those moves represent the creation of a new internal development outfit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-blizzard-aa-studio-charge.jpg?itok=wA_FTyiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-blizzard-aa-studio-charge.jpg?itok=Y2UbnCCo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New games based on Blizzard franchises like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>might be coming soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The report says that the new studio, which mainly comprises employees from King, is part of a desire on Microsoft's part to "curate and serve these franchises more prolifically than Activision itself did" prior to the tech giant's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">record-breaking acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>As Windows Central points out, King's involvement in the creation of this studio could indicate that the games being created are intended for mobile, but given that Microsoft appears to be adopting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-microsoft-financials-q4-2024">platform-agnostic approach</a>, we might also see them on PC and Xbox consoles as well, and perhaps even on other platforms in future.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Microsoft is keen to create games that avoid what Windows Central calls "the monstrously ballooning costs facing AAA game development", a subject about which Microsoft is reportedly anxious. Creating smaller studios that can collaborate with the larger organization is one way in which Microsoft is looking to alleviate these costs.</p>

<p>Well, according to Windows Central's report, Tango was indeed the right kind of studio for the job, but its location in Japan made "inter-studio collaboration logistically difficult". Seems like a bit of an overreaction to close the studio down completely for that reason, but I'm not privy to Microsoft's internal conversations, I suppose.</p>
<p>Microsoft's decision to create smaller games, and its reported concern about the spiraling costs of AAA development, come amongst widespread layoffs and studio closures in the gaming industry, including staff being let go at companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft itself</a>, among many others.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of games this new Blizzard studio creates. Stay tuned for more.</p>

        <p>It is expected sometime later this month, though.</p>

            <p>Once Human's maintenance is now complete, and the F2P open-world shooter is back online with a plethora of QoL improvements and optimisations, including a desperately-needed revision to vehicle handling.</p>
<p>Whilst players received a bundle of Stardust and health-related items to make up for the downtime, Once Human's long-promised controller and Steam Deck support is still nowhere to be seen (although, confusingly, the "controller" in-game item remains in place).</p>

<p>In terms of Memetics, you can now pick up memetic specialisation memory fragments in the wild and trade them between players. All memetic fragments will be destroyed at the end of the season – which is in a couple of weeks time – and cannot be sent to Eternaland, so be mindful of that.</p>
<p>The team has also "enriched" the Highway Pursuit game mode, added a new route, and fixed the starting time to 9pm local time on all servers. The map has also been revised to make it easier to see landmarks, as well as send invitations to other players via chat channels.</p>
<p>There's loads more – combat, planting, trading, wilderness, deviations, cosmetics, performance, camera; pretty much everything's had a tweak, it seems – so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/">head on over to Steam for the full details</a>.</p>
<p>Starry Studio has also provided a new storage crate to all players in compensation for "recent server stability" when unsuccessfully trying to implement cross-character paid content sharing.</p>
<p>The team also outlined what to expect from the new August Event.</p>
<p>"On Nalcott Island, the month of August itself is an anomalous event," the team teases. "During this 'forgotten summer', we will receive additional produce from harvesting every week. More events will be gradually unlocked in the game. All Metas are welcome to participate!"</p>
<p>In terms of controller support; despite a lot of players hoping support would come in this patch, the team says it's hoping to roll out functionality by "mid-August".</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460?emclan=103582791472471292&amp;emgid=4329732329530020404">players affected by the territory glitch</a> should find any resources they used to build their base returned to their backpacks.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it earlier this month for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back.</p>
<p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-activision-form-new-team-in-blizzard/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-and-activision-form-new-team-in-blizzard.943194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-activision-form-new-team-in-blizzard/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In recent weeks, King employees have swapped their LinkedIn information, saying that they are now working specifically in Blizzard. This comes in conjunction with <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-doesnt-agree-with-ftc-comments-regarding-price-hikes/">Microsoft</a> and Activision's new team, which has been created within Blizzard.</p>
<p>This team takes employees from King and other various Blizzard employees and is now a focused team dedicated to working on Blizzard's "AA" games, such as World of Warcraft, Overwatch, StarCraft, and more.</p>
<p>The expansion doesn't come as much of a surprise, as Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard last year for a hefty $72 billion. This gave Microsoft leverage over some of its major franchises, such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. With the acquisition, Microsoft has already seen a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2024-q4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge 61% growth year-on-year</a> in its gaming division, largely driven by Activision Blizzard's current games.</p>
<p>To continue boosting their growth, Microsoft and Activision have teamed up to create a new team within the Blizzard subsidiary. The aim is to continue curating and keeping their most beloved franchises alive, such as Diablo, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch. StarCraft has been dead in the water for some time, and it is possible that this new team will revive the beloved franchise and give it a new lease of life instead.</p>
<p>Since many of the employees joining the team are from the King subsidiary, it's very possible that they are working on mobile ports of these games or on making Diablo Immortal a better game for those who continue to play it. Alternatively, it's possible that they will be working on new mobile games that are set to be released in Xbox's mobile game store, which is planned for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Microsoft is keen to experiment with utilizing smaller teams that are more agile and have more potential when working on AA games. These teams will also be integrated into the larger teams, giving them access to bigger projects as and when they need it. There is plenty of potential for AA games at the moment, with games like Balatro, Palworld, Vampire Survivors, and Stardew Valley doing extremely well in current markets, regardless of age.</p>
<p>Despite their willingness to try and experiment with smaller teams, Microsoft is also responsible for closing down Tango Gameworks, the developers behind the well-loved title Hi-Fi Rush. The decision to make smaller studios and work on indie-style games may come as a shock considering the brash decision to close down Tango Gameworks, but we'll have to wait and see what's in store for the players with this new team.</p>

Since then, the Olympics has somehow kept producing shooters who all seem like they could be the main characters of some game or movie. Yusuf Dikeç, a shooter from Turkey, is the latest phenomenon to emerge from the Games, and let me tell you, I think <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/hitman&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/hitman"><em>Hitman</em></a></span>’s Agent 47 should be very scared of this man.<br></p><p>Similar to Ye-ji, Dikeç began going viral for his shooting stance. However, unlike the South Korean crackshot, Dikeç started making the rounds for his relaxed appearance and lack of any significant equipment. Ye-ji became a quick favorite for her stylized pose and steely-eyed look, but by comparison, Dikeç’s star is ascending because homeboy looks like he could barely be bothered to show up. Dude straight up doesn’t look like he gives a fuck, and yet he managed to take home silver in his category.</p><p>When asked about his lack of equipment, do you know what Dikeç said? “I did not need special equipment. I’m a natural, a natural shooter.” The aura coming off this guy is <em>unbelievable</em>, and just like Ye-ji, it’s inspired people around the world to now idolize him, turn him into a meme, produce fan art, and reinterpret him and his stance into their favorite video games and anime. </p><p>Ye-ji and Dikeç have emerged as the stars of the shooting category, but they aren’t the only competitors to have popped off online. Sarabjot Singh from India has also been turned into a bit of a meme, as well as Choe Daehan, another shooter from South Korea, whose very pronounced shooting style is probably best seen rather than described:</p><p>And then there’s this legend.

Whether it's Respawn's recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> or Zynga's free-to-play arena shooter, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-review">Star Wars: Hunters</a>, we're visiting a galaxy far, far away more frequently than ever before and getting some great games along the way.</p><p>Better yet, it seems this current pipeline of big new Star Wars releases won't be drying up anytime soon. Looking forward, there are still a bunch of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-games-in-order-canon-timeline">canon Star Wars games</a> on the way, ranging from remakes of iconic RPGs to sprawling, open-world adventures and interactive story experiences. To keep you clued in on all the intergalactic action yet to come, we've made a list of every major Star Wars game currently announced and in active development as of August 2024.</p><h2>Every Upcoming Star Wars Game</h2><p>As of right now, there are a total of <strong>six </strong>upcoming Star Wars games currently announced to be in development. The list below will run through each of these games, noting everything we know so far.</p><h3>Star Wars: Outlaws - August 30, 2024</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/07/25/star-wars-outlaws-world-1690314393129.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Starting with one right around the corner, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars: Outlaws</a> is slated to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC on August 30, 2024. Developed by Massive Entertainment, the studio behind The Division series, it'll tell the tale of Kay Vess: a wandering outlaw looking to assemble a team to pull off the heist of a lifetime as she attempts to rob the powerful head of one of the galaxy's most threatening crime syndicates.</p><p>Boasting a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-the-final-preview">massive open world to explore</a>, freeform combat encounters that can be completed stealthily or all-guns-blazing, and narrative choices that affect your reputation with factions, Outlaws appears to be a massive playable heist movie that throws you directly into some of the most wretched hives of scum and villainy in the galaxy.</p><div catalogid="e75dd931-1911-43db-b0fb-8e7c20d016dc" id="198974"><div id="198974" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><h3>Star Wars Eclipse - Early Development</h3><p>Announced back in 2021, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars Eclipse</a> looks to be Quantic Dream's twist on the Star Wars universe, with the Detroit Become Human developer promising a narrative-focused adventure that reacts to your decisions.</p><p>Although details are currently pretty slim, we do know that <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/how-star-wars-eclipse-links-the-high-republic-to-prequel-trilogy-jedi-fallen-order">it'll take place in the High Republic Era</a>, meaning it will be set around the same time as the recent Disney Plus show, Star Wars: The Acolyte. Quantic Dream also revealed that, despite their previous games focusing largely on dialogue and storytelling, Eclipse will definitively be an action-adventure and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-eclipse-fundamentals-quantic-dream-action-adventure">the team has made changes to accompany the heavier focus on action sequences</a>. </p><p>Although we don't know exactly what that means for the game just yet, we could be looking at the studio moving away from its heavy use of quick-time events and embracing a new approach to combat and chase sequences. Regardless, it's safe to assume Eclipse's core focus will be telling a branching narrative that evolves and adapts to your choices, so be prepared to make tough decisions and live with the consequences.</p><h3>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake - In Development</h3><p>The return of a bonafide classic, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a> was first revealed back in 2021 as a PlayStation 5 and PC exclusive. Developed by Saber Interactive, it aims to be a full, from-the-ground-up reimagining of BioWare's seminal 2003 Star Wars RPG of the same name.</p><p>The original Knights of the Old Republic dropped players into the Old Republic era, casting them as an amnesiac soldier who wakes up on a crashing Republic ship. Escaping the craft before it's destroyed, the protagonist sets out on a quest to uncover their murky past and defeat Darth Malak: a ruthless Sith lord and the commander of an army of Sith warriors. Boasting tactical combat, a deep morality system and a full galaxy to explore, Knights of the Old Republic was heralded as not only one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-games">best Star Wars games ever made</a>, but one of the best RPGs of all time.</p><p>Despite recent reports that the remake's development had halted, Saber Interactive revealed to us in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">an interview back in April</a> that it's still "alive and well." Although the full details of the remake aren't currently known, it's sure to try and recapture the magic of the original game, while updating its systems, visuals and gameplay for modern audiences.</p><h3>Amy Hennig's New Star Wars Project - In Development</h3><p>First announced back in 2022, Skydance Media unveiled that it was working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amy-hennig-star-wars-skydance-new-media">a new game set in the Star Wars universe</a>. Better yet, the studio revealed it would be bringing in former Uncharted director, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-captain-america-black-pather-amy-hennig-game-revealed-state-of-unreal-2024">Amy Hennig</a>, to work on the project. </p><p>With Hennig currently hard at work on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-captain-america-black-pather-amy-hennig-game-revealed-state-of-unreal-2024">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, details on her venture into the Star Wars universe are few and far between, although the announcement did reveal that it will be a cinematic action-adventure that tells an original story. Considering Hennig has an aptitude for thrilling adventures with engrossing narratives, her take on a galaxy far, far away is definitely one to watch, even if it seems to be in the very early stages.</p><h3>Bit Reactor's Star Wars Strategy Game - In Development</h3><p>Another Star Wars title that's still in early production, EA announced back in 2022 that Respawn Entertainment was producing a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-respawn-bit-reactor-strategy-project">Star Wars strategy game</a>, with developer Bit Reactor taking the reins.</p><p>Similar to Skydance Media's Star Wars title, outside of the base details, we know very little about what to expect from the project other than it'll tackle the series from a strategy perspective. However, Bit Reactor is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-respawn-ea-jedi-fallen-order-sequel-fps-strategy-xcom">comprised of former Firaxis veterans heralded for their work on the XCOM franchise</a>, so there's a very good chance we're in for a treat.</p><h3>Star Wars Jedi 3 - In Development</h3><p>One that shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering the acclaim of its two predecessors, EA and Respawn Entertainment have confirmed that they are indeed working on a third Star Wars Jedi game. Following the cancellation of Respawn's in-development Star Wars first-person shooter earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-fps-is-canceled-but-work-on-next-jedi-game-black-panther-and-iron-man-will-continue">the company confirmed they were committed to offering a sequel to the Jedi series</a>, announcing it was in the works.</p><p>Considering it's definitely early days for the threequel, there's very little to go off, although it appears <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-jedi-survivor/Cal_Kestis">Cal Kestis</a> will be back in the saddle as the lead protagonist. Cameron Monaghan, the actor who potrays Kestis, revealed during the Star Wars: Jedi Game Series Panel at Ocala Comic Con last year that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cal-kestis-actor-in-the-process-of-making-star-wars-jedi-3">he was already working with Respawn on a third entry</a>.</p><p>If the previous two Jedi games are anything to go off, this third title will likely focus on players once again exploring the galaxy as Cal Kestis, going head to head with enemies in intense third-person lightsaber combat, using force-based abilities to traverse precarious environments and solving physics-based puzzles.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

                <p>There's another Silent Hill game reportedly in development, this time being worked on internally over at Konami. After years of the Silent Hill series being dormant, Konami recently let other third-party studios tackle it. However, it looks like Konami will still continue to make its own Silent Hill games.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1819243908007624765" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insider Dusk Golem</a>, Konami still has a couple other unannounced projects in the works, including a new Silent Hill game. However, they didn't provide any other information, such as whether it'd be another remake.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 Remake Extended Gameplay Showcase | Silent Hill Transmission May 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>Konami is committed to releasing new Silent Hill games after a strong Q1 2024 performance, with the Silent Hill 2 remake launching later this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-townfall-teaser-trailer-revealed/1100-6508442/" data-ref-id="1100-6508442">Silent Hill Townfall</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-release-date-trailers-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6510045/" data-ref-id="1100-6510045">Silent Hill F</a> are still in development with no official release window announced yet. There's not much information about former, but the latter is the nineth mainline entry in the series.</p><p>The two most recent entries in the series are <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-ascension/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill: Ascension</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-the-short-message-review-in-my-restless-dreams-i-flee-that-town/1900-6418173/" data-ref-id="1900-6418173">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>. Unfortunately, the reception for both games has been negative from both fans and critics alike.</p><p>Silent Hill 2 remake is set to launch on October 7 for PC and PS5. A new Silent Hill movie is also in production right now, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-shares-return-to-silent-hill-movie-teaser/1100-6523860/" data-ref-id="1100-6523860">Return to Silent Hill</a>, which will see both Pyramid Head and Dark Nurses returning from the original movies.</p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has shared the unfortunate news that they have delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2</a> indefinitely.</p>
<p>Prison Architect 2 had already been delayed a couple times, most recently aiming for 3rd September and with the announcement that the development was being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/prison-architect-2-developer-double-eleven-breaks-up-with-paradox-interactive/">handed over from original studio Double Eleven to new team at Kokku</a>, but even that has been pulled back as they “re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready.”</p>


<p>There will be minimal communication about the game’s development through the coming weeks and months, until such a time that Kokku and Paradox feel ready to share something substantial.</p>
<p>Given the form of this delay, all pre-orders are being refunded automatically, though you will be able to request an expedited refund, as <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/">detailed in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the latest blow to Paradox’s game line up. Cities: Skylines 2 launched last year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">to great dissatisfaction from players</a>, with developer Colossal Order having now spent the better part of the year optimising the game and reworking gameplay elements. Last year’s The Lamplighters League also underperformed, and more recently, Paradox cancelled and shut down the studio behind their The Sims competitor, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-cancelled-by-paradox/">Life By You</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the Prison Architect 2 statement in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have some difficult news to share: unfortunately, we will not release Prison Architect 2 on September 3rd because we need more time to improve both the game’s performance and its content. Our continuous internal reviews and beta test groups have highlighted areas that we need to focus on more, mainly performance and content, which we need to address before launch to ensure that you, the players, get a good experience in the game. We need to raise the quality a bit more to meet the standards we’d like to achieve with this sequel.</p>
<p>We are confident that the sequel to Prison Architect will be great, and we’re looking forward to showing you all the new ideas brought into it: the switch to 3D, multi-floors, and the new behavior system that all bring a new dimension to the game and open new gameplay possibilities for the players. However, we want to make sure the game lives up to the franchise’s legacy and is released in a state that satisfies both you, our players, and the Prison Architect 2 teams at Kokku and Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>At this stage, we can’t commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready. Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>With this indefinite delay, preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and the preorder items will be added to the base game.</p>
<p>This decision aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to reviewing and improving the quality of our released content. We are confident that delaying Prison Architect 2 is the best path forward for the game, allowing us more time to deliver a high-quality experience that honors the legacy of Prison Architect.</p>
<p>This is not the announcement we hoped to make, but it is necessary, as we believe this will result in a better game for you. Thank you for your patience, and we’ll see you again soon.</p>
<p>The Prison Architect 2 Team</p></blockquote>

Its 2005 release made it the last <em>Pokémon </em>game on Game Boy Advance, and the first of seven in the ongoing series. However, it wasn’t the first <em>Mystery Dungeon</em> game, Chunsoft having used the same name for many previous crossovers, including <em>Final Fantasy</em> and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/shiren-the-wanderer-isa-mystery-dungeon-game-withoutpokmonor-chocobos-thats-all/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/shiren-the-wanderer-isa-mystery-dungeon-game-withoutpokmonor-chocobos-thats-all/"><em>Shiren the Wanderer</em></a></span> series of games, since 1993. While those games all have the same core systems, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team Red</em> was a perfect combination that makes it shine.</p><p>After three generations of mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games, one of the biggest draws of<em> Red Rescue Team</em> was that it put you in the shoes of the Pokémon. There is a mystical story that begins with you, as a normal human in the world, being somehow transformed into a Pokémon. The specific monster you transform into is decided by a short personality test. I remember starting over the game multiple times the first time I put in my cartridge, in order to get exactly who I wanted: Mudkip.</p><p>The world of <em>Red Rescue Team</em> is a quaint town populated by talking Pokémon, all with their own lives. It’s all adorably rendered in the GBA’s beautiful graphics, and even two decades later there’s a wonderful charm to it.</p><p>The gameplay loop centers on exploring multi-floor roguelike dungeons, with the aid of your team (all cute talking Pokémon), in search of specific NPCs you have been hired to rescue. You progress through dungeons by moving on a grid via a turn-based system, and enter combat against enemies you encounter. Exploring every crevice of a dungeon is a thrilling and sometimes dangerous adventure, and it offers a different take on <em>Pokémon </em>battles. As a little kid who had played her copy of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/think-pokemon-omega-ruby-and-alpha-sapphire-are-too-eas-1663809165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/think-pokemon-omega-ruby-and-alpha-sapphire-are-too-eas-1663809165"><em>Pokémon Sapphire</em></a></span> until the internal battery died, it felt so fresh and exciting.</p><p><em>Red Rescue Team </em>also has an amazing story. On top of figuring out how and why you were turned into a Pokémon, every NPC you meet is a great character to spend time with as you unravel their own secrets. Mixed with a fun story about chasing down a rival rescue team, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</em> packs a lot of narrative into its deceptively small package.</p><p><em>Red Rescue Team</em> actually has a Switch remake in the form of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/being-the-one-human-in-a-world-of-pokemon-is-pretty-coo-1842084962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/being-the-one-human-in-a-world-of-pokemon-is-pretty-coo-1842084962"><em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</em></a></span>. It’s pretty great and has its own unique painterly art style. It does cost $60, though. So if you are intrigued by the game, just wait till the original version drops on Switch Online on August 9. I’d also recommend the GBA version over the remake, just for the endlessly charming graphics. Now when are we getting a <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky</em> remake?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, the Dead by Daylight team revealed its 2024 roadmap for live updates coming to the game through November 2024.</p>



<p>These live updates will include various improvements for quality of life, as well as tweaks and updates for perks and killers.</p>



<p>August will be the busiest month in the roadmap, with 10 new updates. Players will see quality-of-life and gameplay updates for scratch marks and Midwich Elementary School. </p>



<p>The first killers to receive new tweaks are Doctor, Nemesis, and Dredge. The first perk tweaks include Dance With Me, Deception, Diversion, Chemical Trap, and Mirrored Illusion.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're more than halfway through the year 📅 time to check in with the live updates the team will be working on for the rest of 2024. </p><p>As always, timelines may change, but we'll keep you updated as we progress. <a href="https://t.co/Dnw68eMpqp">pic.twitter.com/Dnw68eMpqp</a></p></div>— Dead by Daylight (@DeadbyDaylight) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>In a highlight from the roadmap of live updates, the Dead by Daylight team is planning perk updates for Leverage, Hex: Crowd Control, Distortion, and Blood Rush. </p>



<p>These changes will arrive sometime between September and October 2024, and they could shake up the meta more so than minor tweaks.</p>



<p>Naturally, the developers did warn fans that “timelines may change, but we’ll keep you updated as we progress.” There are no exact release dates, but the roadmap adds that the monthly release windows are “subject to change based on development needs.”</p>



<p>Most recently, Dead by Daylight kept the summer season busy with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-roadmap-revealed-for-july-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major July updates</a>.  Those included the anticipated 2v8 mode and cross-progression. It also featured the somewhat divisive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lara-croft-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-july-16-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addition of Lara Croft</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-pokemon-mystery-dungeon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that beloved dungeon-crawler&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>is making its way to Nintendo Switch Online next week.</p>
<p>Naturally, just like any <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba">other</a> Game Boy Advance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online">game</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-gba-mario">service</a>, you're going to need the Expansion Pack addon to play this one, but assuming you've got it, the dungeon-delving RPG will be available to enjoy on August 9th, which is next Friday.</p>
<p>Like many other&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>has a different-colored counterpart, but&nbsp;<em>Blue Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>was a Nintendo DS exclusive, and since DS games haven't yet come to Switch Online (and are unlikely to do so, although we can hope things will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">change for the Switch 2</a>), you'll have to content yourself with&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-red-rescue-team-nintendo-switch-online-pelipper.jpg?itok=G8nBSiAs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-red-rescue-team-nintendo-switch-online-pelipper.jpg?itok=wWVFoia8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>brings dungeon-delving shenanigans to Nintendo Switch Online next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Like other games in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>revolves around roguelike-style dungeon-crawling, with dungeon layouts and enemy placements changing each time you and your team of Pokemon explore them.</p>
<p>Storywise, the game sees the player transformed into a Pokemon themselves and stricken with amnesia, setting out on a journey to discover their true identity alongside a partner Pokemon. It's essentially a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>isekai story. What's not to love?</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Blue Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>were remade for Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-coming-in-march">as&nbsp;<em>Rescue Team DX&nbsp;</em>back in March</a>, but needless to say, this version isn't the Switch remake; it's the GBA original in all its crunchy retro pixel goodness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=yenwi_zt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=sMsSkLe8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX&nbsp;</em>is a remake of&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Blue Rescue Team</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>is coming to Nintendo Switch Online on August 9th. It joins a Game Boy Advance lineup that also includes&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem</em>,&nbsp;<em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/golden-sun-nintendo-switch-online"><em>Golden Sun&nbsp;</em>games</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to play&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team</em>, you'll need the Switch Online Expansion Pack, which also grants access to libraries of N64 and Sega Genesis games, as well as DLC for games like&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>.</p>
<p>The game's announcement for the service comes at the same time as the release of Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-financials-q1-2025">first-quarter financial information</a>, which has seen profits and sales drop ahead of an expected Nintendo Switch 2 announcement sometime in the next few months.

			<p>Compared to other games like Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield doesn't look as good, but the game developed by Bethesda can still be made to look great with select mods that improve its visuals</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> on YouTube shows the latest RPG by Bethesda running at 8K resolution on an RTX 4090 GPU with the Beyond all Limits Reshade ray tracing preset and over 50 mods, including the Natural and Atmospheric Space LUT. Besides showing how good the game can look with mods, the video also shows how the RTX 4090 GPU is an absolute beast of a graphics card, as it can run the game at 8K resolution at above 100 frames per second, save for more populated areas like cities, with the help of NVIDIA DLSS 3.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Starfield - DLSS3 Raytracing Beyondalllimits - Ultra Modded Graphic Gameplay - 50+ Mods" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIyFvuM1w8k?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been almost a year since Starfield released on PC and Xbox Series X|S, and soon enough, players will be able to experience additional content thanks to the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/">Shattered Space</a> expansion. More content is also rumored to be coming as part of the next free update, which will supposedly add the<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-update-leaked/"> land vehicles</a> that were revealed a while back to be in the works. A second expansion named <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a> also seems to be in the works.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the game by checking out my&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

<p>Head of Xbox communications Kari Perez reportedly said that “testing has begun for our browser-based mobile store.” They also added that “our work is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.”</p>



<p>Warren also pointed to the recent <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1817944795127419045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> from Klobrille, who spotted a notable Xbox Insiders message earlier this week. </p>



<p>The message claimed that the Xbox Mobile Store is “coming soon,” and mentions holdback groups for a testing process.</p>

<p>In May 2024, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-launching-xbox-mobile-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> the anticipated mobile store with a July 2024 release window. The mobile store was notably absent as July came to a close. </p>



<p>Perez did not offer further details about the cause for delay, nor a concrete date for more updates.</p>



<p>During Bond’s original announcement, Xbox confirmed the mobile store would first launch with a first-party portfolio. As a result, fans can expect popular titles like Minecraft to appear first.</p>



<p>Bond also said that “we’re going to start on the web,” since that will be “accessible across all devices, all countries.”</p>



<p>Xbox is currently preparing to bring its “biggest booth yet” to Gamescom 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-gamescom-2024-details-bringing-over-50-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting over 50 titles</a> for the event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-financials-q1-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial summary for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year (since the company tracks its year starting from April), and profits aren't looking great, although there's arguably a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Per the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802_2e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial highlights</a>, "ordinary profit" and net profit are down 55.3% on a year-over-year basis, while operating profit has fallen by 70.6% compared to the first quarter of last year, which is a pretty precipitous drop. Net sales, meanwhile, are down 46.5%.</p>
<p>Arguably, however, that's to be expected. We're in what is probably going to be the final year of the Nintendo Switch's life <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">before the Switch 2 is released</a>, and so major releases for the existing console are drying up, although both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-switch-version-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</em>&nbsp;were released in this first quarter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=JLFqnDBw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=oX58gr0H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>were released for Switch this quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that, as Nintendo itself points out in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supplementary document</a>, sales were buoyed last year by the release of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-shipped-13246-million-units-tears-of-kingdom-sold-almost-20-million">huge seller</a> for Nintendo (as you'd expect given that it belongs to one of the company's tentpole franchises).</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, which was released last year and which proved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats">phenomenally popular among moviegoers</a>, further bolstered Nintendo's sales in the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, and it's obviously unable to do so again this quarter. In short, Nintendo had a pretty extraordinary year last year, and there's nothing quite as totemic to help the company out so far this year.</p>
<p>However, that's not to say that Nintendo is doing poorly.&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>has sold 1.76 million units to date, according to Nintendo, and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting at 1.19 million, both fairly respectable figures for games that aren't mainline&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-financials-forest.jpg?itok=bNYudOYg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-financials-forest.jpg?itok=5PJKfmZ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>has been a respectable seller for Nintendo.</figcaption></figure><p>In general, Nintendo's latest financial report paints a picture of declining profits and sales for the company, but given that we're at the end of the Switch's lifespan (and a hugely successful lifespan at that), this kind of decline is entirely predictable.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Nintendo does anything to turn things around, but it's likely that the next major Nintendo franchise releases will arrive alongside whatever the Switch 2 turns out to be. Stay tuned for more.</p>
