			<p>A new STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl mod now available for download enhances the game's visuals considerably by improving shadows, lighting, and more.</p>
<p>The True Epic Graphics settings mod,&nbsp;<span>a tweaked configuration file that can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/580?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, not only improves some of the game's visual elements such as shadows, lighting, vegetation draw distance, and reflections</span>&nbsp;but also enables GTAO for considerably better visuals, as showcased in the comparison screenshots below. With the enhancements it features, however, this mod should only be used when running the game on high-end hardware.</p>

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally launched last month, and the long wait was totally worth it, as the latest entry in the series by GSC Game World is as uncompromising and unique as ever. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl&nbsp;is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. The game is also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library on PC and consoles.</p>

            <p>Among my last-resort tactics for generating precious PC gaming news is to go on holiday - for as sure as toast lands buttered side down while cats always land on their feet, as sure as the number 13 breeds calamity and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> committing to a release date guarantees a delay, myself going on holiday will always, <em>somehow</em>, conjure a big story from the crevices. It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a "bogus" phishing report, sent by "AI-powered" brand protection software.</p>
<p>The situation has now been <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866209409246110126">resolved</a>, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose <a href="https://digital.funko.com/faq">NFT</a>-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires. So here's a quick recap if you, too, missed the drama.</p><!--more-->
<p>The trouble started on Sunday, when Itch.io mysteriously went offline. According to a post from Itch.io's owner Leaf Corcoran on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oy37ivqnriw6nx3lrbcht2u3/post/3lcu6h465bs2n?ref_src=embed">Bluesky</a> (Twitter's relatively unspoilt cousin), the culprit was a phishing (i.e. internet scam) report automatically sent on Funko Pop's behalf to Itch.io's domain registrar, who proceeded to cork this wellspring of arty smallscale game development without due process.</p>
<p>"I kid you not, itch.io has been taken down by Funko of 'Funko Pop' because they use some trash 'AI Powered' Brand Protection Software called Brand Shield that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain," reads the post. "I hope you're all having a nice Sunday evening."</p><p>Using my advanced journalist brain, I deduce from this communique that Corcoran was <em>not</em> having a nice Sunday evening, and would strongly prefer that Itch.io stayed online. He had more to say over on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033">Hacker News</a>, commenting that the provocation for the BrandShield report was probably a Funko Pop fan project created by an Itch.io user.</p>
<p>"From what I can tell, some person made a fan page for an existing Funko Pop video game (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/funko-fusion">Funko Fusion</a>), with links to the official site and screenshots of the game," the message reads. "The BrandShield software is probably instructed to eradicate all "unauthorized" use of their trademark, so they sent reports independently to our host and registrar claiming there was "fraud and phishing" going on, likely to cause escalation instead of doing the expected DMCA/cease-and-desist. Because of this, I honestly think they're the malicious actor in all of this.</p>
<p>"About 5 or 6 days ago, I received these reports on our host (Linode) and from our registrar (iwantmyname)," the post continues. "I expressed my disappointment in my responses to both of them but told them I had removed the page and disabled the account. Linode confirmed and closed the case. iwantmyname never responded. This evening, I got a downtime alert, and while debugging, I noticed that the domain status had been set to "serverHold" on iwantmyname's domain panel. We have no other abuse reports from iwantmyname other than this one. I'm assuming no one on their end "closed" the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days."</p>
<p>Funko Pop leapt into action following these complaints. They've seemingly clarified the situation with iwantmyname, hence Itch.io's return to the web. They also agree with Corcoran's assignation of blame to BrandShield, though they're more diplomatic about it.</p>
<p>"Recently, one of our brand protection partners identified a page on http://itch.io imitating the Funko Fusion development website," reads <a href="https://x.com/OriginalFunko/status/1866255848366039468">a Xitter post from last night</a>. "A takedown request was issued to address this specific page. Funko did not request a takedown of the @itchio platform, and we're happy the site was back up by this morning. We have reached out to @itchio to engage with them on this issue and we deeply appreciate the understanding of the gaming community as the details are determined."</p>
<p>The real shocker here, of course, is that Funko Pop has fans. Who are you people, and why do you covet shrunken petroleum-derivative incarnations of popular entertainment characters with eyes as blank and pitiless as the Mariana Trench?</p>
<p>Don't those hideously swollen heads balanced atop wasp-thin necks make you wince? Why would you permit such creatures near your children? And have you thought of the plastic waste? Funko Pop recently consigned <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/dumping-30-million-funko-pops-landfill">$30 million's worth</a> of these malevolent garden gnomes to landfill. Picture it: somewhere in the world, thousands of unblinking chibi abominations lie in shallow graves, hidden from the world of light only by a perilously frail layer of miscellaneous rubbish. Spill a vampire's blood or some nuclear isotopes in the wrong place, and who knows what might emerge. We should deploy warning pictograms and apocalyptic sculpture near the burial site, to keep our ignorant descendants at bay.</p><p>More immediately and practically, we could ask why it's so easy for some digital watchdog to auto-nuke a whole independent gaming community over a fan project, especially given that fan projects abound on Itch.io. Hopefully it's a one-off. Imagine if Sega had similar protections in place for Sonic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a recent interview, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle revealed that CD Projekt Red was unhappy with him for stating that Geralt will be a part of Witcher 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a conversation with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WiKrmDmyL8&amp;t=1161s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geektown</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/the-witcher-4-polaris/220849/news/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-char" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Doug Cockle revealed how he “got slapped by CD Projekt” for stating Geralt was in The Witcher 4. Cockle added that he wasn’t sure about “how true it is” and “went off a rumour”. He thought that he had “seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4, but he won’t be the main character”; however, he wasn’t sure how true this was. CD Projekt Red came to him stating, ‘We haven’t put anything out there, don’t say anything.’</p>



<p>Cockle explained that he doesn’t know “what it’s going to be” he thought he had an ‘idea’ about what it was, but then he was told by CD Projekt Red, ‘We haven’t put anything out there, don’t say anything.’ He also pointed out that his information might be “from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago”. Currently, Witcher 4 is a “complete mystery” for the Geralt voice actor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s some context for those wondering what Cockle had stated about Geralt and Witcher 4. During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkl5T0pMFb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fall Damage</a> on YouTube about four months ago, Cockle stated, “Geralt will be part of the game.” He wasn’t sure how prevalent his role would be, but he knew the game wouldn’t focus on the character. Cockle also added that he hadn’t seen the script yet and could be lying through his teeth.</p>

Chief among them is the feeling that Path of Exile 2 isn’t rewarding enough, something GGG acknowledged is a problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the major problems that players have been experiencing is feeling that the game is not rewarding enough,” it said. “This is an area that we have to be very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, GGG felt that rare monsters were not rewarding enough, especially in the endgame where unique monsters are less common. GGG also saw that the reward players received for the increased difficulty of rares wasn't lining up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it's doubling the rarity bonus per rare mod, increasing the quantity bonus per rare mod by 10%, and increasing the chance of rare monsters inherently having more modifiers as players progress through endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These changes will cause rare monster rewards to naturally scale up as you get to higher levels because the number of mods a monster can have increases throughout the campaign and into endgame,” GGG explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In addition, many other forms of map juicing will indirectly cause rare monsters to have more mods as well, increasing the rewards of these other mechanics too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, GGG is changing the game to make sure each map has a minimum number of rares, which will also increase the average number of rare mods and thus increase drops further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another major issue GGG has identified is outlier "unlucky" drops. “A single unique boss dropping badly, especially early on can significantly affect your character,” GGG admitted. Changes here include no more than 50% of a unique monster’s drops can be gold, and act bosses and map bosses will now always drop at least one rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, GGG is making dodge roll changes after players complained about being trapped in by monsters. “While it is intended that monsters are able to trap and kill you, we felt that the frequency of this was a little too high,” GGG explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GGG has posted <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611708" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first set of patch notes for these changes</a>, with more to come as they’re rolled out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-5-makes-big-balance-changes-completely-reworks-blocking-weapons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Patch 5 is out now across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and it makes a number of significant balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to pick through, but the highlight here is a complete rework of Blocking weapons, which were deemed useless by players ever since Space Marine 2’s record-breaking September launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, by blocking enemy attacks, the player accumulates up to three stacks of melee damage buffs. Attacking while having those stacks of buffs will spend them and will result in massive AoE Damage discharge. Check out the patch notes, below, for more detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/128-patch-5-0-obelisk-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on publisher Focus Entertainment’s website, game director Dmitriy Grigorenko explained that Fencing weapons will remain good versus limited numbers of enemies, Balanced weapons will be good versus big crowds, and Blocking weapons are now “damage dealer” type weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accompanying this change is a buff to all melee weapons, with normal melee damage increased across the board. Developer Saber Interactive hopes this change will give combat less reliance on the Parry -&gt; Gun Strike flow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a big one: Space Marine 2’s Operations mode now has an Extermination Bonus, which increases the amount of XP players get in PvE missions “if they are zealously exterminating enemy waves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea here, according to Grigorenko, is to incentivise players to not skip encounters (Space Marine 2 Operations players have a habit of skipping entire chunks of the PvE missions to finish as fast as possible and get on with the grind), without punishing those who want to skip, and make the game less grindy in preparation for new features coming down the line, such as Prestige Ranks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I’d like to pick out this one change I am particularly happy about: Shielded Zoanthrope will now attack much less frequently. Praise the Emperor!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Saber has said it’s happy with firearm balance, but promised minor tweaks in Patch 6. Importantly, a big rework of weapon perks is coming with Patch 7. “Weapons perks are underwhelming compared to class Perks right now, and the issues with some weapons are actually a result of them having a bad Perk tree rather than their basic stats,” Grigorenko explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grigorenko admitted a lot of the Class perks are not as good as we wanted them to be, and some Perk tree choices are really more efficient than others.” Patch 6 will “massively rework” a bunch of lacking Perks to make more builds viable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a big problem with the Grenade Launcher that makes it overpowered, so Saber will look to make changes there in a future patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a big day for Warhammer 40,000 fans, with Henry Cavill’s Amazon film and TV series based on Games Workshop’s grim dark universe finally proceeding to production, and the release of the Space Marine 2 animation as part of Amazon’s Secret Level anthology series. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-review-prime-video-tim-miller"><u>Secret Level review</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Update 5.0 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">NEW FEATURES</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Operation: Obelisk</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">In this new Operation, you’ll be sent to Demerium and your mission is to rotate a replica of the obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. This operation takes place in parallel to the final events of the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To reach the console control of the obelisk, you’ll have to make it through a tomb plunged into darkness.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Enemy: Tzaangor Enlightened</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A new Majoris enemy can spawn in all Operations featuring the Thousand Sons.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“The Tzaangor Enlightened is a disk-flying, melee/ranged-hybrid unit. They are fearsome opponents, especially when met in greater numbers. However, catching them after parry or during a long animation makes them an easy target.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We strongly advise you to use Target Lock to face this enemy!”</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Season Pass Content: Dark Angels Chapter Pack</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Added</strong>: Dark Angels Successor Chapters cosmetics </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Added</strong>: Dark Angels Champion skin (Bulwark)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Added</strong>: Dark Angels–themed weapon skins for:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Auto Bolt Rifle</li><li>Plasma Pistol</li><li>Power Sword</li><li>Bulwark’s Storm Shield</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">GAMEPLAY &amp; BALANCING TWEAKS</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Melee</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“The melee system has been our main focus recently. The issue that we saw is that, on higher difficulties, the melee combat relied too heavily on the “Parry -&gt; Gun Strike” flow. This also made Fencing Melee Weapons a universal choice for almost all situations, and we want to give players more options. To try and achieve that, we’ve made the following changes.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>First, </em><em><strong>normal Melee Damage has increased across the board</strong></em><em>, so there will be more options instead of just Parry -&gt; Gun Strike.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Second, </em><em><strong>we are drastically changing how Blocking Weapons work</strong></em><em>. In short, by blocking enemy attacks, the player will accumulate up to 3 stacks of Melee Damage buffs. Attacking while having those stacks of buffs will spend them and will result in massive AoE Damage discharge.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>With these changes, Fencing Weapons will still be great versus limited numbers of enemies, Balanced Weapons will be good versus big crowds, and Blocking Weapons will become ‘damage dealer’ type weapons.”</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Perfect Block</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>All Block Weapons have been reworked with a new mechanic: </strong><em><strong>Perfect Block</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Adrenaline Surge</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfectly timed blocks grant up to 3 <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> stacks. <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> stacks greatly increase Melee Damage and are consumed after the next melee attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attacking with 3 stacks of <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> deals massive AoE Damage, staggers enemies, and restores 1 Armour Segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note that the right wrist glows in yellow after the Parry, which signifies that the Adrenaline Surge is ready to use. When used, a red explosion detonates on the enemy hit, deals AoE Damage, and regenerates an Armour Segment.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fencing Weapons:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Perfect Parry AoE stagger radius slightly reduced.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Balanced Weapons:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Perfect Parry AoE stagger radius greatly increased.</li><li>Master-crafted versions: Damage increased by 10%.</li><li>Artificer versions: Damage increased by 10%.</li><li>Relic versions: Damage increased by 10%.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Blocking Weapons:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Master-crafted versions: Damage increased by 20%.</li><li>Artificer versions: Damage increased by 20%.</li><li>Relic versions: Damage increased by 20%.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Unarmed/Firearm Melee:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Stomps can now be chained indefinitely.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Firearms</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“We are quite happy with recent updates to firearms. Pretty much all firearms are viable on the hardest difficulties now, and our win rate/pick rate data shows drastic improvements.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Still, there are a few weapons that are better than the others, and </em><em><strong>minor tweaks will be coming with Patch 6.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Further into the future, </em><em><strong>with Patch 7</strong></em><em>, we are planning to focus on </em><em><strong>reworking Weapons Perks</strong></em><em>. Weapons Perks are underwhelming compared to Class Perks right now, and the issues with some weapons are actually a result of them having a bad Perk tree rather than their basic stats.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The other big outstanding problem that we have is the </em><em><strong>Grenade Launcher</strong></em><em>. There are quite a few bugs/misconfigurations that make it the way it is.</em></p><ol data-cy="list"><li><em>Due to a bug, a certain Perk restores its full Ammo when it shouldn’t.</em></li><li><em>Due to a misconfiguration on our side, its Artificer and Relic versions deal 4x more damage than the Master-crafted version, which was not intended.</em></li><li><em>Due to a bug, Perks that increase Auspex Scan damage stack buffs inconsistently. Normally all damage stacks buffs additively, thus providing consistent and predictable results. This bug results in crazy damage numbers with Auspex Scan Perks depending on the order they were activated. This is why </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1gdrabj/ok_ill_admit_it_the_gl_might_be_a_little/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>bosses get erased</em></a><em> by Grenade Launchers with certain builds.</em></li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If we approach this directly and fix all 3 bugs, it will make the Grenade Launcher useless and will hurt the entire Tactical class. We will be very careful with how we address this issue. </em><em><strong>We do want to keep the fun element of destroying entire waves of enemies with the Grenade Launcher.</strong></em><em> At the same time, no other weapon can match a Grenade Launcher with potentially unlimited Ammo.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Because of these complications, we want to take the time to carefully analyse and make the best decision possible about the Grenade Launcher, so we’re not modifying it in this patch.”</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Neo-Volkite Pistol</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“We unified enemy sensitivity to Volkite Damage with Bolter Damage. This means a massive damage buff to certain Majoris and Extremis enemies that were more resistant to Volkite Damage than others.”</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Volkite Damage sensitivity has been increased from 1 to 1.5 for these enemies: </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Devourer Tyranid Warrior</li><li>Barbed Strangler Tyranid Warrior</li><li>Venom Cannon Tyranid Warrior</li><li>Rubric Marine</li><li>Flamer Rubric Marine</li><li>Zoanthrope</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bolt Carbine:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Max Ammo of all SMG-type Bolt Carbines increased by 1 magazine.</strong></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Extermination Bonus</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“This change simply increases the amount of XP players are getting in Operations mode if they are zealously exterminating enemy waves. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This aims to:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>1. incentivise players to not skip encounters, without punishing those who want to skip, and</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>2. makes the game less grindy in preparation for new features coming down the line (e.g., Prestige Ranks).”</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Added a new feature that increases the amount of XP players gain based on % of enemies killed during an Operation:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rank A: killing more than 85% spawned enemies grants +120% XP pre-patch value.</li><li>Rank B: killing more than 60% spawned enemies grants +110% XP pre-patch value.</li><li>Rank C: killing less than 60% spawned enemies grants +100% XP pre-patch value.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>*The rank is common to the party, everyone gets the same.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">GAMEPLAY QOL</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dodge invulnerability logic is now client sided, meaning that <strong>Dodges will be responsive and more accurate with higher ping</strong>.</li><li>Players are now <strong>invulnerable to new instances of damage while in Knockback animation</strong>.</li><li><strong>Added 10 frames of invulnerability at the start of Jump Pack launch animation</strong> (Campaign and Operations only).</li><li><strong>Dodge and Parry</strong> <strong>sound</strong> notification clarity has been greatly improved.</li><li><strong>Heavy’s Barrier can be activated in more player states</strong> (e.g., during stagger animation).</li><li><strong>Player controls</strong> are slightly <strong>more responsive</strong> after using <strong>Vanguard’s Grapnel Launcher.</strong></li><li><strong>Added</strong> spawn protection in PvP. </li><li><strong>Added</strong> Neo-Volkite Pistol in PvP.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">AI</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Zoanthrope</strong>: <ul data-cy="list"><li>Shielded Zoanthrope will now attack much less frequently.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Enemy Spawn Director</strong>:<ul data-cy="list"><li>You will no longer fight Extremis-level enemies on your first encounter right after the start of a Mission.</li><li>Lots of minor animation fixes for various enemies.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">CUSTOMISATION</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Added</strong>: Lenses colour customisation.</li><li>Fixed shading of Balthasar Gold and Ushabti Bone colours.</li><li>Fixed a number of small bugs with certain armour pieces not applying colours correctly.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">OPERATIONS</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fall of Atreus:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Made adjustments to scripting to make this level shorter and more in line with the duration of other levels:<ul data-cy="list"><li>The second sequence with the Dreadnought (Repel the Assault) is randomised now and may not happen.</li><li>The fusion battery needs to be charged only once in the final sequence.</li></ul></li><li>Large amounts of small fixes in level geometry collision and Terminus enemies getting stuck in some areas.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">PERKS</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“In this patch, we are only fixing bugs with existing Perks, but trust me, we are seeing the issues with them.

                <p>Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, CD Projekt Red's smash hit that has spanned two console generations. Even during The Witcher 3's development, CD Projekt Red was paving the way for its futuristic follow-up title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Now, a new report suggests that The Witcher 3 almost had a direct crossover with Cyberpunk 2077 in a quest that would have temporarily sent Geralt of Rivia to Night City.</p><p>This revelation comes from a new eBook series, <a href="https://github.com/glassfish777/WhatLiesUnseen/tree/main" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">What Lies Unseen</a>, a multi-volume chronicle of the development of The Witcher 3 by modders and data miners Crygreg, Ferroxius, and Glassfish. According to the first volume of the book, the quest called Through Time and Space originally had Geralt and his ally, Avallac’h, appear in Cyberpunk 2077's Night City during their journey into the multiverse for answers about the Wild Hunt.</p><p>In one of the lost lines of dialogue, Avallac'h describes Night City as "technologically advanced, but broken... dying." Geralt initially wonders if the city is in the afterlife before expressing his disgust for the stench and the noise. Intriguingly, Geralt would have inadvertently left his mark on the city by giving some coins to a beggar who he took pity on. Those coins would have proven more valuable than Geralt realized, as the initial plan was reportedly for the character to reappear in Cyberpunk 2077 as a wealthy individual.</p><p>While that crossover didn't ultimately take place, Geralt has appeared in games outside The Witcher's universe including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-deadliest-catch/1900-6416842/" data-ref-id="1900-6416842">Monster Hunter: World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soulcalibur-6-review-the-new-legend/1900-6417012/" data-ref-id="1900-6417012">Soulcalibur 6</a>. Presumably Geralt will also return in some fashion in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which recently began its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">full-scale production</a>. That sequel may be several years away, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-gwent-card-game-is-heading-to-the-real-world/1100-6528284/" data-ref-id="1100-6528284">a physical version of The Witcher's Gwent card game</a> will be released in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-movie-actor-who-leaked-role-in-first-film-hasnt-heard-anything-about-returning-for-sequel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
An actor who leaked his obscure role in Nintendo's then-top-secret Super Mario Bros. Movie has said he's yet to hear whether he's coming back for the sequel. 
</p>
<p>
Actor and comedian Sebastian Maniscalco played Mario's foreman boss Spike in the Super Mario Bros. Movie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-animated-movie-actor-lets-slip-his-obscure-role">a fact he let slip more than a year before the film was released</a>, before Nintendo had shown anything of the project publicly.
</p>
<p>
The random announcement by Maniscalco - and the deep cut nature of the character's inclusion (Spike appeared in NES game Wrecking Crew back in 1985, and little else since) made headlines. Perhaps Nintendo is keen to keep things more tight-lipped this time around?
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Maniscalco says he doesn't rate his chances for a return in the Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel - though not because of his previous statements. Instead, he says, it's because there's yet to be a stuffed toy of him.
</p><p>
"We went to Universal Studios and they had a Super Mario store with all the merchandise," Maniscalco recently told <a href="https://screenrant.com/super-mario-bros-movie-2-foreman-spike-return-sebastian-maniscalco-response/">ScreenRant</a>. "I was with my kids, I go, 'Guys, come on. I'm going to show you daddy's character in a stuffed animal.' No Spike, no nothing. It stopped at me. It was every other character, and then me, I have no animal, no stuffy, no nothing. 
</p>
<p>
"So, the fact that I didn't have a stuffed animal is not giving me a lot of confidence that I'm coming back for the sequel," he continued. "I haven't heard anything, so your guess is as good as mine."
</p>
<p>
Spike could easily be featured in a sequel should Nintendo want to. After all, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-post-credit-scene-hints-at-potential-sequel-chris-pratt-says">post-credits teaser was set back in Mario and Luigi's native Brooklyn</a>, where Spike lived. 
</p>
<p>
But, as yet, Nintendo is still to say exactly what its plans for the next Mario movie are. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Due to launch in April 2026</a>, rumours abound that the sequel will focus on Donkey Kong this time around - although, as Eurogamer previously rounded up, there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-the-mario-movie-series-may-go-next">plenty of dangling plot threads from the Super Mario Bros. Movie which could point to sequels</a>.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4.1056600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It comes as absolutely no surprise that Season 4 of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> will be the end of the game’s support as a live service.</p>
<p>Rocksteady has revealed that Season 4 will feature Deathstroke joining the roster, introduce a new Elseworld to explore with a medieval theme, and have some new narrative content attached to that, with Episode 7 arriving on 10th December. The second half of the season will arrive in January in Episode 8, rounding out Warner Bros. and Rocksteady’s obligation to support the game with new content and fulfil the promises of paid battle passes and content road maps.</p>


<p>The update for Season 4 Episode 7 will also introduce an offline mode, allowing all game content (both in the main game and seasonal) to be played without an internet connection – you’ll either have to start a new character profile or duplicate your online profile. See the <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36119520746515-OFFLINE-MODE-FAQ">offline play FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>However, the game servers will remain live and active for the foreseeable future, maintaining the possibility to play the game in online co-op. WB has also stated in <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">a Season 4 FAQ</a> that they are not planning to remove the game from sale, and that the LutherCoin premium currency will also remain available.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was one of the biggest video game flops in recent memory and could have been the most ignominious entertainment industry disasters of the year, were it not for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> and maybe the Joker film sequel. Warner took to discounting the game to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/28/steam-autumn-sale-black-friday-best-deals/">just £3 in the recent Steam Sale</a>.</p>

<p>After years of delays, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League finally released on February 2nd, 2024 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Was it worth the wait? Well, in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad review</a>, Gamoc said, “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience. The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/overthrown-early-access-review-theyre-really-chucking-these-houses-up/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Overthrown has just entered into Early Access, bringing to life a new city builder for people to try. What makes this one different from all the others is that you’re not simply placing buildings and letting the world get on, you’re actively part of it trying to help it flourish. Oh, and you also have a crown that imbues you with all sorts of powers like super strength and super speed, letting you throw buildings all over the place. So, that’s pretty different.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overthrown – Game Preview Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijjXJK1PZMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the opening, you can choose one of three worlds to generate in which to build up your kingdom. The Lost Isles is the smallest map, followed by the medium-sized Foothills, while the largest is Seaside Cliffs. Each has a different make-up in terms of terrain, but the overall goal is the same. Start with nothing and build up a kingdom that can see off the incoming threats of bandits and wild animals. First, you grab the crown before building a town hall from which your first three inhabitants will emerge. Then, as is custom, you’re tasked with building sawmills to start gathering wood with which you can build houses and outhouses. In multiplayer, only one person can have the crown giving them bonus benefits, but everyone has the same base powers to work together and build up the kingdom.</p>


<p>Overthrown is one of those titles that is simple to get to grips with but becomes steadily more complex as you progress There’s a research tree that opens up more buildings like different food shops, farms, and mines. On top of that, you have the buildings that turn resources into materials to help you build up. People will start coming to your kingdom as it grows, taking on the various jobs that are created by the buildings.</p>


<p>To speed things up, you can just grab a giant sawmill and sprint around to collect wood, cutting down trees like a giant saw. That is one example of how Overthrown encourages you to experiment with the world. One of the first buildings I unlocked was the butchers, which needs a steady supply of meat. Now, since the game is in Early Access not everything is unlocked yet. The research tab helpfully showed me that Woolies, the sheep of this world, will not be available until January. Another solution had to be found for the lack of meat. One of the wild animals that inhabit the world are Tuskers, essentially wild boars. They have nests dotted about, generally pretty far from town. Not that that is an issue when you have super speed. My solution was to pick up a Tusker nest, bring it closer to town, build a fence around it, and pop a sniper tower next to it. Tuskers would regularly generate and my hunter would take them out to provide meat. A good little option to consider if you’ve got a town full of hungry people to feed.</p>
<p>The movement in Overthrown is excellent. Sprinting like a speedster is smooth and the large maps have plenty of open space. If anyone is developing a superhero game, Overthrown’s movement should act as a base to build on. Being able to pick up buildings with your character and just move them if you don’t like where they are makes the building element nice and easy to handle. The combat is merely fine when armed with a sword or greatsword, but it’s also very basic.</p>
<p>Resource management is a major part of the game and things can get complicated fast. The population grows pretty quickly in Overthrown, and you need to balance that with resources to make sure the inhabitants don’t starve, or suffer from exhaustion and collapse. You need to get farms up and running, fuel produced, and create stockpiles ahead of winter. Once winter comes, you cannot produce crops and your stores will get you through. Raiders will attack in an attempt to steal the crown, but you can find their camps in the woods before they mount an attack and dismantle them. If you have a military you will need to balance their pay with the taxes you put on your citizens. Tax too high and people may leave. Don’t pay the military and they may just quit soldiering.</p>

<p>With Overthrown being in early access things have a way to go yet. You’re bombarded with notifications as things develop and your kingdom grows, whether they’re telling you that lines of there’s not enough houses, outhouses, or food being created. While it gives you an idea, it’s not clear enough. For example, one notification showed an insufficient number of houses with the number 1 in a bracket, so I built another house. The notification remained. I built a lot of houses, The notification remained. There are also other notifications like repair required. I thought looking at the overworld map would show me which building needed repair, but it didn’t, requiring me to check each one individually. Similarly, when you come under attack there is a notification of fighting. While the compass banner will show a red dot to indicate an enemy, it will only do so if you are close by. Again, it would be helpful for an enemy dot to appear on the world map to stop any confusion. Overthrown did crash a couple of times too, and in one instance the world just starting flickering while assets disappeared. It is, at least, all things that can be improved by a patch.</p>
<p>Overthrown certainly has potential but after just a few hours I felt like I had seen all I could see in the Early Access stage, at least until the next batch of new content is added in January. It doesn’t take long to unlock all the research available and once you have the town starting to thrive you’re waiting for raids to hit or explore a big but rather sparse world. Regular content updates will be needed to keep people invested in their worlds, otherwise the inhabitants will face more than a harsh winter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-logos-unleashed-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Final Fantasy XVI mod currently in development promises to bring its battle system to new heights, introducing features that are common in character action games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.</p>
<p>The Logos Unleashed mod, which is being developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mThund3R_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mThund3R</a>, the same developer behind the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/89?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eikonic Equipment</a> mod, which introduces deeper RPG elements in the game, will expand combat options by introducing new Eikonic Feats that can be activated with directional inputs. With the Phoenix Eikon, for example, it will be possible to unleash an air launcher attack, a Shift Wave projectile attack, and a quick lunging finisher by pressing corresponding buttons. With Odin, to give another example, it will be possible to use the useful Rift Slip ability with a direction input without having it equipped.</p>
<p>While the Final Fantasy XVI Logos Unleash mod only integrates parts of certain skills into an Eikon basic moveset, it will open up a lot of interesting gameplay possibilities to make the game's excellent combat system even more engaging. You can check out some of the new options the mod will offer when it launches on a yet to be confirmed date in the video below.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review of the PlayStation 5 version.</a></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Goblin-hitting bonanza <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a> launched into early access last weekend and the devs Grinding Gear Games have dropped some big patch notes that outline some things they've updated already, or things they plan on updating in a future patch. Things like dodge-rolling, checkpoints, items, currencies, and other stuff I can't list here because the intro to this article would expand and pop into a flurry of common rarity boots and bones, maybe with the odd purple rarity sword mixed in.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Among the first things on the agenda are dodge roll changes in response to players being frustrated at the frequency of being trapped by monsters. Once implemented, these tweaks should make the ol' roll a better tool for sneaking out of the grasp of pesky monsters, and even pushing small creatures like the Adorned Beetles in Keth. This doesn't mean you won't ever get trapped - there's no phasing through monsters - but the devs say the changes should mean you "can get through even the smallest gap".</p>
<p>As for checkpoints, they're taking action to save you backtracking to spots you've already discovered. In a future patch, you'll be able to teleport to other checkpoints, and checkpoints will be added to all entrances and exits of zones for those easy teleports.</p>
<p>There's been some major item drop changes, too, since players have felt that the game hasn't been rewarding enough. The devs say they've had to be "very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much". So here's a quick blast of what they've deployed now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killing rare monsters has been made betterer. Rewards should naturally scale up as you reach higher levels, with rare monsters having an increased chance of having more modifiers as you progress.</li>
<li>Currency drops have largely been buffed. For instance, Regal orb drop rates have been increased by around 40%, and Gemcutter's Prism drop rates have been upped by 500%.</li>
<li>There's been a significant increase to the value of all prefix map mods.</li>
<li>"Unlucky" drop protection (when a boss drops bad loot) has been increased, so no more than 50% of unique monster drops can be gold. "Act" and "Map" bosses will always drop at least one rare, as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a final flourish, an upcoming Path Of Exile 2 patch will add more rare monsters to the endgame maps.</p>
<p>If you want a quick summary of the changes that are live right now, I recommend having a glance at their official <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611708">patch notes page here</a>. As for all the planned changes (with those that have been deployed, too), I recommend deep-scanning this <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">official forum thread</a>.

CD Projekt originally planned for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> to briefly visit Night City from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, years before the latter launched.
</p>
<p>
The idea has been discussed by the developer before, but an impressive datamining project has now uncovered the work-in-progress script for the scene, which would have seen Geralt and Avallac'h turn up in CD Projekt's future setting - and not be overly impressed by what they found.
</p>
<p>
This moment would have come as part of The Witcher 3's Through Time and Space questline, and acted as an Easter egg for fans hoping to get a glimpse at what CD Projekt was building next.

As found by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/witcher-3-modders-just-upended-everything-we-know-about-how-it-was-made-with-a-584-page-breakdown-of-an-early-prototype-that-had-a-150-hour-main-quest-all-thanks-to-a-database-containing-almost-every-single-line-of-text-from-its-development/">What Lies Unseen</a>, and highlighted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/witcher-3-modders-datamine-a-quest-where-geralt-would-have-teleported-to-night-city-from-cyberpunk-2077-technologically-advanced-but-broken-dying/">PC Gamer</a>, the script for the sequence - as it was back around 2012, three years before the final version of The Witcher 3 launched - would have been as follows:
</p>
<p><code>Geralt: What... What is this place? Is this the afterlife?<br>
Avallac'h: No. Just another of the realities the Spiral leads through... Technologically advanced, but broken. Dying.<br>
Geralt: Disgusting. This stench, noise... How can you live here?!<br>
Avallac'h: You should know better. This world is inhabited by humans, not elves.<br></code></p><p>
Insight from What Lies Unseen includes that CD Projekt also planned to have Geralt toss a coin to a begger who would then turn up in Cyberpunk 2077, rich from your Novigrad gold.
</p>
<p>
In the end, Through Time and Space remained in The Witcher 3 - albeit with different sequences that saw Geralt pingpong between the Ddiddiwedht Desert, a poisoned valley, an underwater section and an icy tundra. Less exciting.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, now Cyberpunk 2077 is out, this idea might be easier to make happen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-trailers-will-both-be-at-the-game-awards.1056573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-trailers-will-both-be-at-the-game-awards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two of 2K Games’ biggest upcoming titles will have new trailers released during The Game Awards 2024 this week, with both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> to feature among the many, many, many game trailers and announcements.</p>
<p>The Mafia <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406">social media</a> account kept things pretty tame, just saying “See you at [The Game Awards].” A full game reveal is expected for the game, which is due to launch in 2025 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>


<p>It was a lot more… verbose from Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford though, who <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866164877665919396">eagerly chirped</a>, “It’s happening, you guys! I will be at The Game Awards with a new trailer for Borderlands 4. I can’t wait!”</p>
<p>He continued, “Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer! Also, in addition to a lot of in-game footage, I will share a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence depicting a moment that occurs about half way between the end of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> and the beginning of Borderlands 4. I AM EXCITE!”</p>
<p>I think he’s pretty hyped? It’s difficult to tell.</p>

<p>This should hopefully get the franchise and studio back on track, though. Borderlands 3 was a big success for the studio in 2019, followed up a few years later with the well received spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/30/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a>, but the company itself has gone through some turbulent times. It was acquired by Embracer in 2021, who decided to balloon it in size by adding sub-studios, bolstering a publishing arm and stuffing it with acquired IP… before the financial house of cards started to teeter and they were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/11/report-embracer-groups-exploring-sale-of-gearbox-entertainment/">forced to try and sell off divisions</a>. That led to Gearbox being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">acquired by Take-Two</a> earlier this year, which made the most sense since the Borderlands IP had remained tied to 2K Games publishing label anyway.</p>
<p>Through all of this there was the 9 year production of the Borderlands movie, which ended up just being a massive folly, vanity project and waste of money. At least it gave Cate Blanchett something to do after going a little stir crazy during the 2020-21 lockdowns.</p>
<p>The Game Awards 2024 will be marking the show’s 10th anniversary, as Geoff Keighley launched a replacement to the Spike Video Game Awards in 2014. It will be a late one for UK and Europe, the show starting at a hospitable 7:30PM ET / 4:30PM PT for the US, but 12:30AM GMT in the UK. And that’s not even the main show, but rather the “opening act”.</p>
<p>If I were you, I’d just catch up on things the day after.</p>

			<p>The United States Federal Trade Commission started issuing refunds to consumers impacted by Epic Games' practices in Fortnite, which led to unwanted purchases of perks, emotes, and other in-game elements.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ftc-starts-issuing-refunds-to-epic-games-users-following-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a>, the FTC confirmed that it is sending its first batch of payments to impacted users, totaling 629,344, half of them in checks and the other in PayPal transfers. The remaining payments will be sent at a later date. The average payment is around $114.</p>
<p>This first batch of refunds for Epic Games users is being set as part of a settlement reached back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-to-pay-520m-to-the-ftc-as-settlement-over-fortnite-privacy-case/">December 2022</a>. The FTC charged the publisher with deploying shady tactics to drive unwanted purchases of virtual currency in Fortnite to purchase outfits, perks, and emotes. For this violation, Epic Games had to pay $245 million in fines, which the FTC is using to issue the refunds that started making their way to impacted users today.</p>
<p>This isn't the only violation Epic Games was fined for by the Federal Trade Commission. The Fortnite publisher was also charged with violating the COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), collecting information from children under 13 who played the popular battle royale game without verifiable consent from a parent and making parents jump through hoops to have their children's data deleted, an issue that has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-ftc-settlement-and-moving-beyond-long-standing-industry-practices?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been addressed</a>. This violation cost Epic Games $275 million, bringing the total fine to $520 million.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ewcf-club-partner-program-expansion/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ewcf-club-partner-program-to-award-%E2%80%98six-figure-funding%E2%80%99-to-40-esports-organisations.1056564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ewcf-club-partner-program-expansion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed by the Esports World Cup Foundation that the EWCF Club Partner Program applications for 2025 are now open – and that the scheme has been massively bolstered. The EWCF Club Partner Program will now invest $20 million into organisations, and this year, the scheme has been expanded to cover 40 members, up from 30 last year.</p>



<p>The top eight teams from the EWC’s Club Championship automatically score an invite, but the remaining 32 slots are up for grabs now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prestigious-program">Prestigious Program</h2>



<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program isn’t open to <strong>every organisation</strong>. Some prerequisites must be met by applicants, including having a high level of fan engagement and ‘creative excellence’. </p>



<p>Here’s the spiel from <a href="https://esportsworldcup.com/en/clubprogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program 2025 will focus on Clubs around the world that show high levels of fan engagement and creative excellence. Through this partnership, the EWCF and the participating Clubs will jointly invest to tell the EWC 2025 stories. Partnered Clubs are expected to have an established track record of elite competitive performance across multiple games, as well as a substantial social media presence with the ability to engage and grow a global fanbase. </p>



<p>Participating Clubs will be able to access the Program funding by engaging their fanbase with their brands throughout the esports year – so fans can follow storylines leading up to the Esports World Cup, watching tournaments online and experiencing live matches during the season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All participating clubs will receive a six-figure sum to help grow their organisation ahead of the Esports World Cup 2025. If the participants see immense success as part of the EWCF Club Partner Program, they’ll receive additional funding. It was stressed that being a member of the scheme <strong>doesn’t </strong>grant instant qualification into next year’s Esports World Cup, though.</p>



<p>Per the terms of the application process, organisations have until the 10th of January to get their forms filled out. </p>



<p>In a statement, Faisal bin Homran, the CPO of the EWCF, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program represents a significant step forward in our ongoing mission to foster a thriving ecosystem for esports Clubs worldwide while unlocking opportunities for organizations from some of the world’s fastest-growing esports markets, like China. </p>



<p>Through this program, we enable partnered Clubs to attract fans with engaging content beyond the games, showcasing the personalities and talent of players, alongside their origin stories, while also developing their Clubs’ brands as fan-favorite powerhouses in esports entertainment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers, Netease, have just released the game’s first post-launch update, version 20241210. The new patch brings some hero balancing changes, map and game mode fixes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-general-changes-nbsp">General Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Marvel Rivals version <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1866393674554527800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20241210</a> update introduces a fix for lag and significant crosshair deviation while playing highlights and recordings. Saving highlights will no longer cause the game to crash.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players observed that heroes equipped with costumes were not visible when joining a quick match as a replacement; this issue has been fixed. Additionally, mission progress on the Season Event screen will be displayed correctly after the latest Marvel Rivals update.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Moreover, fixes related to textual errors, relatively common crash issues, and game freezing have also been released; more will be added in a future update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-maps-and-game-mode-changes">Maps and Game Mode Changes</h2>



<ul>
<li>Clipping or becoming stuck during special collisions in specific maps, such as Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface, have been mainly fixed. However, some areas are still affected, and the developers will continue to work on fixing these problems.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The new Marvel Rivals update also introduces fixes for foggy areas of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa. These places will not have fog disappear from Hela and Storm’s perspectives after the new patch. Also, enemies and teammates will be able to see the effects of Joyful Splash when Jeff the Land Shark is revived while in the fog.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Regarding Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven—Frozen Airfield, players will observe that lighting no longer behaves abnormally when a player is knocked out near a target area. Also, disconnecting and reconnecting during matches will not cause the desynchronisation of some doors.&nbsp;</li>



<li>There are several fixes for Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven – Eldritch Monument. Adam Warlock’s ultimate will no longer lead to teammates being revived and stuck beneath the terrain when the target area ascends or descends. In the exact location, if Thor and Loki were revived through Hela’s team-up ability, they would not get stuck under the terrain.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Moreover, the Marvel Rivals update also ships characters from getting stuck under the terrain when Jeff the Land Shark uses his Ultimate while ascending or descending. In the same situation, Winter Soldier’s Ultimate will no longer lose damage if it’s right on the target.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coming to Competitive mode changes, the new Marvel Rivals patch will display the vehicle range when switching between rounds. Also, when you reach the third round, Competitive Convoy or Convergence Heroes will not carry over their Ultimate Energy from the second round.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-hero-changes-nbsp">Hero Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>When players equipped the Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume for Wolverine, they observed that no ability voice lines instead of Undying Animal would play. This update fixes this issue. Also, Star Lord Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’s MVP animation does not have sound effects on the result screen, but it has been fixed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The Marvel Rivals patch also fixes Iron Fist’s voice lines not playing when using pings. Regarding Black Widow, the description of her ADS sensitivity has been fixed. Also, she will recover energy as intended in every situation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coming to the last bit of Heroes changes in the new Marvel Rivals update, Captain America’s Ultimate wouldn’t end as intended in specific extreme situations; this problem has been fixed. Now for the most significant change: Doctor Strange’s portals were causing terrain KOs, which restored the character’s ultimate energy. After the new patch, the portals’ terrain KO attribution was disabled as a temporary fix. A proper fix will be ruled out to restore this attribution in a later update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-pc-and-console-changes-nbsp">PC and Console Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players would observe memory leaks and blurry models on PCs when using FSR 3 frame generation technology to improve the resolution. The new Marvel Rivals update will fix this issue.&nbsp;</li>



<li>For consoles, players observed that restarting the game when wearing the PlayStation bundle’s Scarlet Spider costume would cause the outfit to not display correctly. This issue has also been fixed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>This morning, Amazon Studios and Games Workshop finalised a deal that was cooking for an entire year. The completion of this deal means that Amazon Studios now has exclusive rights to any movies or television shows set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe – and per a follow-up update from Games Workshop, there are <strong>multiple </strong>productions in the pipeline.</p>



<p>The news was also shared on social media by Henry Cavill, who has been aligned with a Warhammer 40,000 project for the longest time. He’ll be producing and starring in a series of his own, giving him another outlet through which to explore a passion he’s tracked for 30 years.</p>

<p>It’s official – Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have finalised their deal – the creative guidelines are nailed down, and we’re all set to bring Warhammer to the screen.</p>



<p>But what does that actually mean?</p>



<p>Well, it means we now have synopsis and ordering for the stories we’re going to tell… yep, we said&nbsp;<em>stories</em>! It might have taken a year but it was a year well spent! And what fun – sifting through the enormity of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, debating characters, story arcs and the thematic grit that underpins it all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the legal release</a>, it was stated that Amazon also has the option to license rights in the Warhammer Fantasy universe <strong>following the release </strong>of any Warhammer 40,000 production – so this deal could eventually run much deeper.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the team at Games Workshop and Amazon Studios stressed that it’ll be many years before production surfaces in full. What has been dubbed as ‘Project One’ is only just preparing to enter the scripting stage, so there’s still a long time left to wait before the fruits of this deal are realised.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years.’</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have now officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">companies have long been in discussion</a>, with actor and Warhammer superfan Henry Cavill set to star and executive produce thanks to his "lore expertise".</p>
<p>Now we have an official statement, with Games Workshop offering Amazon the exclusive rights to both films and television series, as well as merchandising rights.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224">legal notice</a> adds: "Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years."</p>
<p>However, a more <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/">casual statement to the community</a> notes that multiple "stories" are planned, with synopsis and ordering finalised. The first project is "about to go into development proper" - the script is next on the agenda.</p>
<p>"Of course, as with all carefully crafted things, this all takes time... and trust us when we say, everyone involved is las-focused on getting it all just right," reads the statement.</p>
<p>Cavill also shared the news on Instagram, together with his own "pilgrimage" back to the model shop where he bought his first Warhammer models.</p>
<p>"My incredible team and I, alongside the brilliant minds at Games Workshop, have been working away in concept rooms, breaking down approaches to the enormity and magnificence of the Warhammer world," he wrote in the post.</p>
<p>"Together, we've been sifting through the plethora of incredible characters and poring over old tomes and texts. Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though - more to come in time!"</p>

<p>This won't be the first time the companies work together, though, as there's a Warhammer 40K episode in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Amazon's forthcoming Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate the series, Warhammer 40K: Space Marine is one of a handful of games available for free through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-second-batch-of-december-titles-to-celebrate-secret-levels-arrival">Amazon Prime Gaming this December</a>.</p>
<p>Its sequel, released earlier this year, was hugely successful, becoming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">most successful Steam launch for the Warhammer 40K series</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-ceos-supposed-comments-raise-eyebrows-for-saying-games-should-be-about-glory-kills-not-imposing-morals">comments supposedly from the CEO of developer Saber Interactive</a> raised eyebrows for stating that games should be about "glory kills" instead of "imposing morals on gamers".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s what he said at the time:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Witcher 4 has been announced. I can't say anything about it. What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game, we just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt. So it's not about him this time. We don't know who it's about. I'm excited to find out. I want to know! I have not seen any script yet — I mean, I couldn't tell you if I did. This is the thing, so I could be lying through my teeth. But I'm not. Or am I?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt had long made clear that Geralt's saga had come to an end, meaning a new protagonist was fully expected for Polaris, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-stars-geralt-of-rivia-but-not-as-the-main-character">this was the first confirmation he'd be in the next game at all</a> — and fueled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-4-story-fan-theories-ciri-vesemir"><u>some rampant fan theories</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a single teaser image, below, has otherwise been revealed for The Witcher 4, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-confirms-teaser-is-a-brand-new-witcher-school">but it was enough to suggest Ciri will be the protagonist this time around</a>. What's considered the "true" ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, thanks to its story being continued in canon comics, sees her become a witcher herself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/untitled-2-1648052443071.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Witcher 4 teaser image. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But now, Cockle has revealed those comments raised a few eyebrows at The Witcher developer CD Projekt, and he now insists he has no idea if Geralt is in The Witcher 4, or who the main character is — although he admits that a non-disclosure agreement would force him to lie about it if he did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I did go online and I said something about this and then I got slapped by CD Projekt,” Cockle said. “I don't know how true it is. I went off a rumor. I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character. And I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, ‘We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the truth is, the answer to your question is, I don't know what it's going to be. I have ideas. I thought I had an idea what it was. And then I was kind of basically told, ‘We haven't told anybody what it is, so where you got that information we don't know.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it might be from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago. So Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me. I actually don't know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, Cockle said Ciri as protagonist in The Witcher 4 would make sense, pointing to her ability to travel between worlds. He also reveals that years ago he spoke with someone at CD Projekt about what a future Witcher video game might look like, and discussed a Witcher origin story, among other ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, Cockle is keeping his cards close to his chest here. “The truth is I can’t answer the question because I’ve signed an NDA,” he said. “So even if I did know, I’d have to lie to you.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/gettyimages-1356685274-1733820615489.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doug Cockle insists The Witcher 4 is a mystery to him.

			<p>Yesterday, Croatian game developer Croteam announced The Talos Principle: Reawakened, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the first entry in the adventure franchise. A substantial visual upgrade is the first thing you'll notice, but there's a lot more, according to the studio.</p>
<p>Reawakened includes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/talos-principle-dlc-road-gehenna-announcned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Road to Gehenna expansion</a> and adds a brand new chapter called In the Beginning. Croteam says the new content explores the Simulation's origins and the challenges of its first test, adding new layers to the game's philosophical and narrative depth. Moreover, the developer will release a puzzle editor with The Talos Principle: Reawakened to empower&nbsp;modders to build unique worlds and challenges for the whole community.</p>
