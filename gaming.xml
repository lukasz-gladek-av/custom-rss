			<p>In a short and sweet post on X by CD Projekt Red on the official Cyberpunk 2077 X account, they confirmed that there are no plans for a PS5 Pro patch. For many, this comes as a huge disappointment, especially since the game has come such a long way from how it was when it was first released. When Cyberpunk 2077 was first released, the game was incredibly buggy and wasn't performing the way many had expected from CD Projekt Red. After all, this is a company that made award-winning games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. However, since that time, the game has improved significantly, with a smoother performance, stunning graphics, and a great story for many to get lost in.</p>
<p>With the release of the PS5 Pro, many huge titles on PlayStation have been confirmed to be getting a PS5 Pro patch, which will enhance the game to work with the new hardware within the PS5 Pro to provide frame rate boosts and better-looking graphics. To celebrate the PS5 Pro, Sony has proudly announced that there are at least 40 or 50 games that will get the PS5 Pro patch on launch. However, there has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch/">an updated list</a> since then that confirms over 80 games will be getting the PS5 Pro patch when the console launches or when the game is set to release.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red confirmed that there will be no PS5 patch anytime soon after a user named <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextGenNero reached out on X</a> to ask whether it will be getting one. They stated, "We currently have no plans for the PS5 Pro patch," which led to a lot of fans of the game being disappointed by the news.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 has no plans for getting a PS5 Pro patch, games such as Silent Hill 2, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Alan Wake 2 have been confirmed to get patches to supposedly enhance the game on the new expensive version of the PlayStation 5. However, these games, in particular, have had mixed results, as confirmed by tests by Digital Foundry. That being said, they have tested some other top games on the PS5 Pro and given the new patches a whirl, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some games have performed as expected</a>, providing improved frame rates and better graphics.</p>
<p>Whether CD Projekt Red is just waiting it out and plans to do a PS5 Pro patch once audiences have had a chance to experiment with games that are enhanced for the Pro, or they just don't plan to do a patch at all remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-res-arcana-duo-two-player-board-game-spin-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asmodee Group</a> is releasing <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> at the end of the week. The global tabletop publisher known for producing many beloved titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-flight-games-announces-marvel-champions-next-evolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Champions</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>River of Gold</em></a> has announced a unique spin-off of Sand Castle Games' competitive board game series, one designed for two players.</p>

<h2>The <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the store page listing, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is a standalone installment in the <em>Res Arcana</em> series. Like the main series, players take on the roles of powerful magicians caught in an elaborate game of mystic supremacy. A visual trademark of the series is the detailed artwork provided by Julien Delval.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/res-arcana-duo-board-set-up.jpg?itok=dPuX4Fa1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/res-arcana-duo-board-set-up.jpg?itok=r9HzZtpP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name implies, a game of <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is framed as a wizard's duel. Each player chooses a Mage (Druid, Alchemist, Necromancer, etc.) and gets a deck of unique artifact cards. Using these artifacts helps you claim Monuments and Places of Power, providing resources that fuel the art of magic. Make your moves wisely and you can conquer your enemies.</p>

<p><em>Res Arcana Duo</em> contains a new set of game pieces, cards, and mechanics. These include a new set of Mages, Artifacts, Monuments, and Places of Power designed for the spin-off's one-on-one format.</p>

<p>If you own the base game of <em>Res Arcana</em>, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> can function as an expansion. In addition, the <em>Lux et Tenebrae</em> and <em>Perlae Imperil </em>expansions can be used with the game to provide a more robust tabletop experience.</p>

<p>A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>4 New Mage Cards</li>
	<li>16 Artifact Cards</li>
	<li>7 Monument Cards</li>
	<li>2 Double-Sided Place of Power Tiles</li>
	<li>5 Magic Item Tiles</li>
	<li>1 Starting Player Tile</li>
	<li>5 x5 Essence Chips</li>
	<li>60 Essence Tokens</li>
	<li>1 Storing/Sorting Tray</li>
	<li>1 Rule Booklet</li>
</ul><p><em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is available right now for pre-order at an MSRP of $24.99. The game will ship to players on November 22, 2024.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is making changes to how it handles mods in order to address server stability issues. Come the next big update in December, mods "will be prohibited from public online sessions," according to an update from the game director.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We wanted to make a game that was moddable from the start (this is why our game pack files are not encrypted, for example). It's always a pleasure for me, as a developer, to see what our community can create. Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity," writes Dmitriy Grigorenko <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/114-mod-support-a-message-from-the-game-director">on the Focus Home Interactive forums</a> (also shared <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957">on Steam</a>).
</p>
<p>"However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players. Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don’t have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods.
</p>
<p>"This is why, starting with our next big update in December, mods will be prohibited from public online sessions. That means that you will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed."
</p>
<p>The update goes on to explain that mods will "still be allowed in private Operations lobbies". Grigorenko also says they'll release some of their own tools to make it easier for people to make mods.
</p>
<p>I'm not clear on what kind of mods people were taking into public servers, but it's a Warhammer 40,000 game, so naturally <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/?BH=2">Nexus Mods</a> has several pages of cosmetic re-paints of your soldiers. It also sounds as if a lot of players are hacking at the UI, blood effects and FOV options.
</p>
<p>Brendan had a lot of fun with his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a>, finding it a spectacular jaunt and "pure ambrosia" for 40K fans.

The final mission, called Here Lies the Abyss, ends with a big decision between leaving Hawke or a Grey Warden ally in the spirit realm called the Fade to fight a demon as the rest of the team escapes. Depending on choices made in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, that ally can potentially be <em>Origins</em> party member Alistair, <em>Origins </em>villain Loghain, or Stroud, a supporting character from <em>Dragon Age II</em>. The person who stays behind is presumed dead, but according to <em>The Veilguard</em>’s art book, BioWare considered bringing whoever you chose back as an ally. </p><p>One piece of concept art in the book shows someone—a pretty generic character who I would not immediately recognize as Hawke or any of the potential Grey Wardens—in what looks like the Fade. The character has glowing yellow eyes and a wolf approaching them, and the caption reads: “What if we return to the Fade and rescue whoever was left behind? How would their time in that alien landscape change them, and what insights could they offer into Solas’s plans?”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-recommend-id="image://9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-format="png" data-width="650" data-height="366" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-recommend-id="image://9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-format="png" data-width="650" data-height="366" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If this had come to pass, anyone who’d left Hawke in the Fade back in <em>Inquisition </em>would get two old heroes showing up in their <em>Veilguard </em>playthrough. The Inquisitor’s role changed throughout development, as evidenced by early concept art of players working for the <em>Inquisition</em> protagonist, but they always seemed to be part of the story. Hawke, however, doesn’t appear at all in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and is only mentioned in passing a few times so as to keep their fate in <em>Inquisition </em>ambiguous.

While the update details various adjustments, such as new inclusions for Fortnite Crew subscribers, the thing that’s likely to affect most battle royale fans is the slight increase in cost for the Battle Pass. Fortnite has long offered its standard pass for 950 V-Bucks, but starting December 1, the price will increase by 50, bringing the total asking number to 1,000 V-Bucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Epic Games for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/03/fortnitechapter4seasonoggameplaytrailer-ign-blogroll-1699018654708.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite Battle Pass V-Bucks price increase arrives in December.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a small increase in price but still undeniably notable considering Epic hasn’t altered the cost of the Fortnite Battle Pass in the past. The studio does clarify that the real-world cost of its popular digital currency will remain unchanged (you can pick up 1,000 V-Bucks on the Epic Games Store for $8.99 right now), and you’ll still be able to earn chunks of V-Bucks by reaching certain Battle Pass levels, too. While any increase in price may be worrying for fans, Epic adds that the price of its 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle is going down from 1,850 to 1,800. IGN has reached out to Epic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These tiny but fundamental changes arrive ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-confirms-og-experience-returns-in-december-but-this-time-its-here-to-stay"><u>highly anticipated launch of Fortnite OG: Chapter 1 – Season 1</u></a> on December 6. Part of the shift to allow players to enjoy the classic battle royale experience will see the $12.99 Fortnite Crew deal sweetened to include even more goodies. The bundle currently grants subscribers the standard Fortnite Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks, monthly Crew Pack outfits, Crew Pack outfit styles, and Rocket League’s Premium Rocket Pass. Starting December 1, it will be expanded to include the Music Pass and LEGO Pass without asking subscribers for a penny more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an enticing offer that will no doubt keep players investing their time in Epic’s gaming ecosystem, especially considering that earning XP in any one of the related games will progress all of their battle passes simultaneously. A Crew subscription will also grant access to any additional passes that arrive in the future, including the new, yet-to-be-detailed Fortnite OG Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The catch with the Fortnite Crew upgrade is that new subscribers who sign up after December 1 will no longer be able to unlock premium rewards from the passes after their subscription is no longer active. It means that if you sign up for Crew and then cancel shortly after, you’ll only be able to claim rewards for the remainder of your billing period. Players are currently able to cancel Crew and still reap the benefits of the remaining Battle Pass as long as it’s live, and this won’t be changing for those who are currently subscribed and remain subscribed after the changes take effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic is making major changes as it looks to the future with the permanent nostalgia-fueled Fortnite OG mode. The company is currently in the midst of Chapter 5: Season 5, which will conclude when Chapter 6: Season 1 kicks off next month. Details on its theme and exact contents remain under wraps, so while we wait for more information, be sure to check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-limited-edition-fortnite-dualsense-controller"><u>Fortnite-themed PlayStation 5 DualSense controller</u></a> that released earlier this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>In the NFL, when players pull off something special on the field, fans occasionally refer to it as a "video-game move." But Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley took that to another level earlier this season when he evaded a defender by jumping over him while looking the other way. EA couldn't resist adding that no-look hurdle to the latest update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a>, but Barkley is the only player who can use it and it's not easy to pull off.</p><p>As part of the notes for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25/news/title-update-november-20-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the new Madden NFL 25 update</a>, EA explained that the development team immediately decided to put Barkley's "once-in-a-lifetime move" in the game by combing through hours of motion-capture footage. From there, they determined which animations could be modified to recreate Barkley's leap, with some additional help from "animator magic" to complete the move.</p><p>While that move would be incredibly useful for any player, the developers have put some restrictions on it beyond limiting to Barkley's in-game avatar. In order to perform a Saquon spin hurdle, the defender has to approach the front of the player at a 45-degree angle. The move also requires very precise timing, as well as close proximity between the player and the defender. So it's possible, but it may not be the guaranteed outcome of every play under those circumstances.</p><p>Later this month, Amazon's Prime Video will debut <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-trailer-for-its-in-the-game-shares-the-history-of-madden-nfl/1100-6527695/" data-ref-id="1100-6527695">It's in the Game</a>, a four-part documentary series about the history and development of the Madden NFL games.

            <p>
Five years after announcing the feature was on the way, Microsoft has finally launched the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to play "select" games they already own outside the Xbox Game Pass library via cloud streaming.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft originally announced the feature back in 2019, with the goal of launching it alongside Xbox Cloud Gaming (then known as Project xCloud) the following year. It was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-let-game-pass-subscribers-bring-their-own-games-to-xbox-cloud-gaming-later-in-2022">re-announced for launch in 2022</a>, but again failed to materialise, with The Verge later reporting its arrival had been "complicated by having to prepare key infrastructure for thousands of games" .
</p>
<p>
However, word <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-will-reportedly-let-players-stream-any-game-in-their-library-from-november">began circulating last month</a> that the long-in-the-works feature was finally almost here - and those reports have now been proven true. Microsoft has announced Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can use Xbox Cloud Gaming to stream games they own starting today - albeit only if they appear on its 50-strong list of currently compatible titles.

<p>
That's not, admittedly, a huge number of games when you consider the size of the Xbox catalogue, but it's a pretty solid list, mixing blockbuster titles old and new with acclaimed indie games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Warhammer 4K: Space Marine 2, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> all feature, as do Balatro, Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, Dredge, Phasmophobia, The Plucky Squire. The full list, as it currently stands, is available at the bottom of this story, and Microsoft adds its "library of cloud-playable titles will continue to grow, as we work with our partners around the world". 
</p><p>
It also notes it'll only be possible to stream games through TVs and browsers on supported devices such as tablets, smartphones, and Meta Quest headsets to begin with, but says the feature will expand to Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on Windows sometime next year.
</p>
<p>
You'll find <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/">instructions and a list of supported devices</a> for Microsoft's new Xbox Cloud Gaming feature (which coincidentally arrives just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">PlayStation expands its own cloud gaming options</a>) over on Xbox Wire.

Just what it will mean for gamers around the world, however, may not be clear for some time. </p><h2 id="h76631"><a id=""></a>A History Of Streaming</h2><p>For about 20 years now, companies have been trying (and mostly failing) to let gamers stream console and PC titles via the internet without having to download anything. As early as 2005, a service called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-cluster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-cluster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G-Cluster</a></span> was  offering this. Perhaps you’ve heard of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnLive</a></span>, which let players stream games from big publishers starting around 2009. (Both services are now defunct.) </p><p>However, things didn’t start heating up in the video game streaming space until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now#:~:text=PlayStation%20Now%20was%20launched%20in,coming%20later%20in%20the%20year.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now#:~:text=PlayStation%20Now%20was%20launched%20in,coming%20later%20in%20the%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 and the arrival of Sony’s PlayStation Now service</a></span>. That was the first time one of the bigger players really got involved. In the decade since, Xbox has started offering more ways to stream games, Sony has expanded its offerings, and Amazon, Google, and Nvidia have hopped into the streaming wars, too. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">Google’s Stadia service famously flopped</a></span> and is no longer around.) </p><p>Through all of this, streaming games has never felt like it was really a <em>thing</em>. It was an option, sure, but I rarely met anyone who used these services. It seemed like a neat idea, but not something anyone was really using.</p><p> That’s changed recently, however, as I now know more people who stream games on their phones and other devices. This shift has happened as Xbox has ramped up its cloud streaming offerings alongside Sony and the other tech giants. </p><h2 id="h76632"><a id=""></a>Xbox and PlayStation expand their streaming services</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376">On November 19</a></span>, Sony announced that its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-ps5-resell-ebay-sold-out-restock-1851031015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-ps5-resell-ebay-sold-out-restock-1851031015">PS Portal</a></span> handheld device would now be able to stream some games without a console. Xbox has been letting players do that for a few years now, letting you stream Game Pass titles on your phone or browser. But on November 20, the day after Sony’s announcement, Xbox declared it was also going to start letting people stream games they own on supported devices. </p><p>Game streaming is now a part of many different video game ecosystems. You can stream Xbox titles on your phone, and PlayStation games on your PC. Some publishers have even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-comes-to-switch-via-cloud-stream-1847800725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-comes-to-switch-via-cloud-stream-1847800725">released streaming-only games on the Nintendo Switch</a></span> to get around the aging console’s weaker specs. It’s clear that cloud streaming is no longer an oddball experiment, but instead a key part of multiple company strategies moving forward. </p><p> “Our biggest growth in Xbox players is on PC and cloud,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20consoles,in%20more%20places.%E2%80%9D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20consoles,in%20more%20places.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rolling Stone</em> in a recent interview</a></span>. </p><p>“The console space isn’t growing, across all of them. We love those customers, but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it’s about PC, it’s about cloud, and it’s about making our games more available in more places.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-says-it-will-soon-reveal-agressive-plans-for-cloud-gaming/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-says-it-will-soon-reveal-agressive-plans-for-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In May 2023</a></span>, PlayStation’s then-CEO Jim Ryan said during a business call that “cloud [gaming] will be fundamental” and explained that Sony has “fairly interesting and quite aggressive plans to accelerate our initiatives in [game streaming].” </p><p>Amazon, one of the biggest companies around, is investing heavily into streaming with its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tweaktown.com/news/91358/activision-ceo-says-amazon-luna-has-the-most-game-streaming-customers/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/91358/activision-ceo-says-amazon-luna-has-the-most-game-streaming-customers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own Luna service</a></span>, which lets you play big and small games across multiple devices. GPU maker and tech company Nvidia has continued to expand its own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/geforce-now-video-game-streaming-service-doubles-in-pri-1846502676&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/geforce-now-video-game-streaming-service-doubles-in-pri-1846502676">Geforce Now streaming service</a></span>, too.</p><h2 id="h76633"><a id=""></a>The Future Will Be Streamed </h2><p>And we can’t ignore that during the various court hearings involving Microsoft’s bid to buy Activision, streaming games was a key subject. A lot of people, both inside and outside these tech companies, seem to expect cloud streaming to become more and more popular in the coming years.</p><p>In 2024, more people are playing games via the cloud. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1760300717334462498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1760300717334462498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in February that at least 10 percent</a></span> of all hours spent on Xbox are now via players streaming games on their phones or other devices. It makes sense that as games get bigger, consoles get more expensive, and phones get better, a lot of people might decide to just stream the latest <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> instead of spending money on a new console, downloading the game, and playing it in one spot. </p><p>Anecdotally, a lot of younger people I know stream games on their phones and prefer it over playing with a controller or keyboard on their TV or PC. That might send a shiver down your spine, but the reality is that this is our future. I don’t think offline games are going away, but it’s clear that as console sales stagnate, cloud gaming looks like a potential goldmine to big game companies, publishers, and tech giants, if they can make the tech work and keep their costs reasonable.</p><p>Today, I know plenty of people who stream games via Xbox cloud or their PS Portal. I’ve now started streaming some games to my phone when I’m lazy and just want to do some grinding in an RPG or online game. It’s easier than ever and works better than it once did, too.

<p>With the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro here, players have been eagerly awaiting details on what games will be getting PS5 Pro improvements, and how they’ll be implemented. One game that won’t be getting any sort of PS5 Pro upgrade, however, is Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In a response to a <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan on social media</a>, the game’s official account confirmed that players shouldn’t expect an update for the game.</p>



<p>“We currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch,” the post reads. </p>

<p>The reveal shouldn’t come as a surprise as CD Projekt Red has moved on to work on the next installment in The Witcher franchise as well as a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Still, the news wasn’t met without its fair share of disappointment.</p>



<p>“Please reconsider this decision,” <a href="https://x.com/ThatGuyNamedTre/status/1859264991620206790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one fan said</a>. “The demand for a Pro patch is high and would give everyone an excuse to do another playthrough.”</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/RightChandMan/status/1859315618752741738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another</a>: “Really hope this gets reconsidered! It’s one of the best modern games and it deserves a pro patch.”</p>

                <p>A lot of big games are getting patches to take advantage of the PS5 Pro's power, but CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077 is not among them. The Polish developer confirmed this on social media in response to a question from a fan.</p><p>"We currently have no plans for [a] PS5 Pro patch," <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio said</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>). The wording here leaves the door open for these plans to change at some point down the line, but for now, no one should expect a PS5 Pro patch.</p><p>CD Projekt Red did not go into any further detail as to why it won't release a PS5 Pro patch for Cyberpunk 2077. However, it might have something to do with how there is<a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1795474940520550428" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> no one at CD Projekt Red working on Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and that's been the case for months now. These staffers have moved on to other projects, including the next Cyberpunk and Witcher games.</p><p>When the PS5 Pro launched in early November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5758">a number of high-profile games were patched to support the console</a>, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Hogwarts Legacy, and Spider-Man 2. However, some PS5 Pro users reported that for games like Silent Hill 2, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, the PS5 Pro patches <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-owners-say-some-games-look-worse-after-upgrades/1100-6527847/" data-ref-id="1100-6527847">actually made these games look worse.</a> For its part, EA <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1858635462577172846" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged the issues with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and said its teams were investigating the issue.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is available now, priced at $700 USD. It's still early days, but Sony reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-huge-price-didnt-negatively-impact-sales-sony-says/1100-6527685/" data-ref-id="1100-6527685">the system's price tag didn't negatively impact sales.</a> In other PlayStation news, the next wave of the 30th-anniversary limited-edition slim PS5 model goes on sale via PlayStation Direct on November 21, starting at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-hate-that-i-care-about-these-anti-trans-bathroom-bills.1041126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bathroom-bill-nancy-mace<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Trans people using the bathroom has been… well, I was going to write “a going concern since I came out in the early 2000s,” but that’s not entirely the case. It was very much a concern for <em>me</em> back then, particularly following the <a href="https://www.deanspade.net/2016/12/16/interview-about-drugs-and-sex-and-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2002 arrest</a> of one of my friends in Grand Central, and it’s always been an issue in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/grimm-v-gloucester-county-school-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schools</a> and other spaces where, like so much of today’s anti-trans panic, concern about children can be invoked as cover. But, at the risk of sounding very very old, I am kind of astonished by the level to which it has now become <em>a thing</em>.</p><p>I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that this is <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/11/lgbtq-trans-issues-trump-second-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a great time to be trans in America</a>. I’ve always struggled to articulate how I feel about this–there’s a confusing way in which I tend not to panic about the new slates of bans and laws, because I came out at a time when many of the things they outlaw weren’t legal anyway. But I always follow this up with: it didn’t matter so much what the law said, because even if medical care or hormones or document changes weren’t protected by law, in my experience, no one in power knew or cared enough to actually <em>stop</em> you from doing them. Insurance wouldn’t cover <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1507171607747481609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hormones</a> or surgery, but there could be ways around this. The letter I got from my doctor to change the gender marker on my documents was artfully vague enough to work. You could be fired or discriminated against–I was once rejected from a job in the very last phase after a background check revealed what it clearly revealed, and there was no recourse for this but to feel shitty about it–and the world was still the world, but as much as legal and medical neglect made things harder (and as much as I will never forgive Barney Frank for <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/06/10-years-later-firestorm-over-gay-only-enda-vote-still-remembered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ENDA in 2007</a>), I’ve always a little bit thought they made it easier, too. “Visibility was a mistake,” I sometimes joke crassly, even as the world spins–or, <em>was</em> spinning–forward into a level of protection and acceptance I honestly never thought possible, and, as much as I like to pretend I am a jaded old man, sometimes brings me to tears.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a long-winded way to introduce how messed up I feel about the latest turn in anti-trans bathroom laws, in which South Carolina Representative Nancy Mace is trying to introduce the “<a href="https://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-nancy-maces-resolution-protect-womens-private-spaces-united-states-capitol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protect Women’s Private Spaces Act</a>,” which would ban trans women–<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/nancy-mace-defends-anti-trans-bathroom-bill-says-absolutely-targets-sa-rcna180805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specifically</a>, and I cannot believe I am writing this, incoming Representative Sarah McBride–from bathrooms in the Capitol. Today, Mace announced that she’s “<a href="https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/1859260706144539077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubling down</a>” on this to extend the ban to all federal facilities; journalist Erin Reed <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erininthemorning.bsky.social/post/3lbfe65yshs24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that this would include “bathrooms in DCA and Dulles airports, national park bathrooms, museum bathrooms, and all federal building bathrooms.” <a href="https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/1859263432123633697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Screenshots</a> of the proposal would seem to include trans men in these bans, though of course–<em>of course</em>–it is trans women that Mace seems most concerned with.</p><p>As a trans man, it’s always hard for me to know what to say about this kind of thing. I have been on hormones for a little over 21 years; bathrooms are still a source of stress for me, but not nearly as much as they used to be, and at a distinctly different level than people who present to the world differently than I do. On a practical level, these kinds of bans are unlikely to affect me personally all that much. It’s hard for me to think about this without bringing complicated ideas about “passing” into the mix, a concept that has never been important to me but which I cannot pretend I do not benefit from. (My joke about this is usually, it isn’t so much that I “pass” as it is that no one knows what a trans man looks like; I move through the world generally assuming everyone knows I’m trans and am shocked when they don’t, though obviously that is a simplistic summary.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For other people, it’s hard to say what these bans would mean if they go into law. (Well, except for McBride I guess? Which is, I must again stress, mind-blowing.) Are regular people going to police bathrooms in this way? Is anyone going to take time out of their one and only life to enforce this? Part of me wants to not take these kinds of things seriously because it lends them legitimacy, but at the same time, they aren’t Tinkerbell; they don’t go away if I just ignore them.</p><p>For me–the only perspective from which I can confidently speak–these bans do what they are clearly intended to do, which is make me feel shitty and like I don’t belong. As unlikely as <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/know-your-rights/know-your-rights-floridas-public-restroom-changing-facility-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida</a>’s trans bathroom bans are to affect me, they–along with <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/gov-desantis-signs-slate-of-extreme-anti-lgbtq-bills-enacting-a-record-shattering-number-of-discriminatory-measures-into-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> laws–have stopped me from visiting my aging parents who live in the state, which has become a regular, painful argument between us. The idea that I would feel unwelcome in the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-road-goes-ever-on-and-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">national parks</a>–in, not to get religious but to get religious, places on this earth that belong to me as much as any other person in this world by virtue of being born into the world in the first place–is upsetting to me in a way that’s embarrassing because it means I care what Nancy Mace does, it means that she has the ability to affect me, and I do not want to give her that.&nbsp;</p><p>This is how these people <em>want</em> trans people to feel, and I don’t want to let them win by feeling those ways. But hardening my heart against it <em>also</em> does what they want it to. It separates me from my emotions, it cuts off my connection to a core human part of myself and to part of being alive that–let’s get religious again–I believe God put me on this earth to experience in its fullness. I’m in that <a href="https://mckitterick.tumblr.com/post/181377996055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tumblr meme</a> camp of “you cannot kill me in a way that matters” when it comes to these people, again because of my faith, but that doesn’t mean they can’t do their best to really fuck me up anyway. And I don’t want to give them the power to fuck me up! But then… well, here we are.</p><p>Who knows what will actually come of this garbage, which we can only hope is performative hate that will fizzle out before being replaced by whatever new horror. I do not care about this bill, but I also care about it a lot, more than I want to, and I hate that. I hate that I’m writing this, and that you’re reading it, but I also hate the idea that we <em>wouldn’t</em> write and read about it. What–sorry–a shit show.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Microsoft smoothly launch a videogame challenge 2024</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I've been looking forward to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> since it was announced, but I might wait a while longer before trying to play it. It launched yesterday and currently sits at "overwhelmingly negative" Steam reviews due to long loading times caused by server issues.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response to the issues, developers Asobo posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuMd7udCyFM&amp;ab_channel=MicrosoftFlightSimulator">video message discussing the launch issues</a>.
</p>
<p>"We knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but frankly we completely underestimated how high and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure," says Jorg Neumann, head of Flight Simulator.
</p>
<p>Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch then explained that the issue was due to the number of players trying to access the game.
</p>
<p>"In Flight Sim 2024, there are a few new systems in the sim," Wloch says. "People have noticed in the career mode there's all sorts of missions, and when players at the very beginning when they start, they're asking a server for some data, and that server is going to cache it in a database. It's a pretty big database and there is a cache, and that cache is currently getting saturated.
</p>
<p>"It's a cache that has been thoroughly tested during the whole Tech Alpha. We've done load tests simulating 200,000 users, and tonight it's just completely overwhelmed."
</p>
<p>Wloch explained that they've had some temporary success with attempted fixes so far, but that soon the "cache collapsed again". They're continuing to investigate in search of a permanent fix.
</p>
<p>In an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2537590/view/4456969803786092545">posted to Steam about the launch issues</a>, the developers said that the problems are now "solved" and players should steadily be able to join the game. "We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience," says the post.
</p><p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 expands on the foundation built by the 2020 release, adding more detail to its simulation of the earth, and adding various kinds of aviation careers which add structure to your time in the skies. Edwin spoke to Neumann prior to the game's launch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-uses-machine-learning-ai-and-how-much-of-your-data-it-might-need">about its machine learning tech and data streaming</a>. 
</p>
<p>We'll have a review of Flight Simualtor 2024 soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Inin Games and Ys Net have announced that they received the publishing rights for Shenmue 3 from the game's previous publisher, Deep Silver. Inin Games has also teased more plans for Shenmue 3.</p><p>"Inin Games is excited to shepherd Shenmue 3 into its next phase," they said in a statement. "This collaboration marks the beginning of a new chapter for Shenmue 3, with Inin Games working closely alongside Ys Net to honor the series' legacy while ensuring its accessibility to even more fans around the world."</p><p>It's unclear what plans Inin Games and Ys Net have in store for Shenmue 3, but it's possible that it could come to additional platforms such as Xbox and Switch. The game has been a console exclusive for PlayStation since 2019, as Sony helped fund the game.</p><p>In 2022, Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki said that he'd make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shenmue-creator-yu-suzuki-wants-to-make-shenmue-4-more-approachable-if-it-happens/1100-6503038/" data-ref-id="1100-6503038">Shenmue 4 more approachable</a> if given the chance to develop it. Although Shenmue 3 ends on a cliffhanger, he explained that a follow-up could tell a story completely separate from the events of that game. Earlier this year, Shenmue fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-campaign-for-shenmue-4-with-times-square-ad-in-new-york/1100-6523961/" data-ref-id="1100-6523961">bought a 15-second ad on a Times Square video billboard</a> to campaign for a Shenmue 4, which managed to briefly get Shenmue trending on Twitter.</p><p>Shenmue 3 is currently available on PS4 and PC.

                <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks is ready to get work and play. A Microsoft veteran who joined Hasbro in 2016 as president of its Wizards of the Coast division--which includes Magic: The Gathering and all things Dungeons and Dragons--and wants to double down on bringing those worlds to the hands of video game players with new Magic and D&amp;D games in the works.</p><p>Cocks took the reins of the company in 2022 and saw an initial boom under his leadership during the pandemic, but as kids went back to school, sales slumped, and the company issued over 1,000 layoffs since. Hasbro had previously dedicated $1 billion to video game development. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> about this focus, Cocks indicated that $100-$150 million a year would be spent on games like Exodus, which will be developed by Archetype.</p><p>"We want to reach fans where they want to play, and increasingly that is through digital expressions of their favorite brands," Cocks explained. The CEO also confirmed that Hasbro was developing its own D&amp;D video game as well as the Wizards branch working on a video game focused on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/boost-your-magic-the-gathering-collection-with-these-early-black-friday-discounts/1100-6527839/" data-ref-id="1100-6527839">Commander format for Magic: The Gathering</a>. That's on top of a GI Joe action-adventure game that's already in pre-production.</p><p>D&amp;D games are nothing new with TSR working with Black Isle Studios and BioWare more than 25 years ago on the first Baldur's Gate game, which was set in the Forgotten Realms campaign and used the 2.5 Edition rules. There was even a video game for the Intellivision by Mattel. However, with the white-hot popularity of last year's Baldur's Gate 3, taking another stab at the franchise seems like a logical solution.</p><p>"What makes Magic so successful is what will drive Hasbro's future success," Cocks added. "It's grounded in play."</p><p>Cocks oversaw the sales growth of Magic leap to $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2023. That number has been attributed to Cocks' love for the game as he introduced new card packs for Magic and an online video game version called Magic: The Gathering Arena.

The $5 sandwich apparently isn’t tempting fate enough for some enthusiasts, so for just $20 more, people can also pick up a half-gallon of the McRib sauce to do god knows what with. I can already see someone livestreaming the first McRib hot tub session. Nudity is banned on Twitch, but highly processed sauce-related acts of depravity are not. </p><p>The McRib was first introduced at the fast-food chain back in 1985. It was so disgusting, even for the sons and daughters of the Reagan Revolution, that it was removed from the menu just a few years later.

It’s “boneless” pork, aka pork product molded into the shape of bones, comes on a long bun with sliced onions, pickles, and lots of sauce.

<p>EA Sports has released its latest title update for Madden 25, and it includes dozens of updates and changes for players.  </p>



<p>From a gameplay perspective, the biggest changes come in updates to various zone defense concerns such as deep fourth defenders, AI defenders not keeping their depth in zone, prevent defense issues, and more. The developers also add the Saquon Barkley backwards hurdle to the game after the Philadelphia Eagles running back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qha5Sjamgr0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pulled off the move</a> against the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>



<p>Other changes with the update include playbook adjustments, player likeness updates, new X-Factors, new Superstar players, and more. You can check out the full Madden 25 title update notes below <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25/news/title-update-november-20-2024?utm_campaign=mad25_hd_ww_ic_soco_ig_mddn25tu&amp;utm_source=instagram&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=82540&amp;ts=1732122408863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">courtesy of EA Sports</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-madden-25-title-update-details-november-20-2024">Madden 25 Title Update Details – November 20, 2024</h2>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Triggering the Saquon Spin Hurdle – To trigger the spin hurdle the ball-carrier must be Saquon Barkley, the defender must be incoming from a 45 degree angle in front of the ball carrier, the defender must be within a close proximity to the ball carrier, and the user must press the hurdle button with the right timing.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed an issue where users were able to create illegal formations by motioning the tight end after an audible
<ul>
<li><em><strong>DEV NOTE: </strong>This tactic was most effective when having the offense audible into formations like Trips TE or Bunch TE. Users could motion the tight end over to the same side as the trips receivers and create offensive overloads. The formations created were not legal formations and this functionality has been removed.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed the QB walking through the center on QB Kneel plays. The QB now is in the correct position to start and walks into the correct position behind the center</li>



<li>Fixed the defensive end lining up in the same spot as the defensive tackle in the 4-3 Over Solid formation</li>



<li>Addressed an issue where no power kicks would land at spots in the front of the landing zone that were difficult for the kicking team to recover
<ul>
<li><em><strong>DEV NOTE:</strong> There has been a change made to kick power and ball placement so no power kicks will now fall short of the landing zone. There will need to be at 25% power for the ball to make it to the landing zone</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed an issue with outside deep fourth defenders biting down on return routes instead of staying deep</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where deep zone defenders would not keep depth when they had no receiving threat in their zone and would allow Post Routes from the other side of the formation to get behind them</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where deep third defenders in Prevent defense were not all staying deeper than the deepest across the field</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the inside deep fourth safety would leave the slot receiver unguarded, going vertical in the Empty Bunch Verticals play</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the inside deep fourth safety allowed the slot receiver in bunch formations on a streak to run past him for a TD</li>

            <p>
If you were hoping CD Projekt's already eye-catching <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> might be getting an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>-specific spruce-up, there's some bad news; the studio says it has "no plans" to release an update for Sony's shiny new console.
</p>
<p>
Sony, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-upgrade-patches-for-around-40-or-50-games-at-launch-this-november">proudly trumpeted</a> "about 40 or 50 games" would be getting PlayStaton 5 Pro upgrade patches to coincide with its launch earlier this month, introducing everything from frame rate boosts to graphical refinements when played on the new machine.
</p>
<p>
So far we've seen the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, Demon's Souls, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-ps5-pro-update-adds-8k-resolution-at-30fps">The Callisto Project</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">No Man's Sky</a>, and Silent Hill 2 all add support for the PlayStation 5 Pro, but one company that won't be following suit any time soon, we now know, is CD Projekt with Cyberpunk 2077.

<p>
The studio <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122">shared the news on social media</a> in response to a fan query, simply stating, "We currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch". That's perhaps not entirely surprising given development of the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">ended quite some time ago</a> - with the bulk of the studio now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">working on a new Witcher title</a> - but it'll doubtless be disappointing news for fans hoping to see the already stunning game get an extra glow-up on their new £700 console.
</p><p>
That said, it's been a uneven start for PlayStation 5 Pro upgrade patches so far, with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">Silent Hill 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-star-wars-jedi-survivor-on-ps5-pro-brings-rt-to-performance-mode-severe-image-quality-problems-everywhere">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-alan-wake-2-how-does-ps5-pro-handle-one-of-the-best-looking-games-of-this-generation">Alan Wake 2</a> all having delivered mixed results in Digital Foundry's tests, while other titles have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it">fared better</a>. As for the console itself, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-playstation-5-pro-review-across-the-board-improvements-but-is-it-really-worth-the-money">recently concluded</a>, "The standard PS5 is still the best choice for most people... but for the core enthusiast looking for the best possible experience, the Pro option is there for you, albeit with a substantial premium."

The publication sent a cease and desist letter to the owner of <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/">a website</a> that lets you make your own <em>Connections</em> games. The site also has a full archive of all of the <em>NYT’s</em> past <em>Connections</em> puzzles, which the <em>NYT</em> keeps behind a paywall.</p><p>The <em>Connections</em> creator website is built and run by Anthony Salazar, a freelance web developer who runs the creative studio <a href="https://swellgarfo.com/">Swellgarfo</a>. Earlier this month, striking <em>New York Times</em> tech workers used Salazar’s <em>Connections</em> tool to make their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289634/nyt-tech-guild-connections-strike-edition-custom-creator">own strike-themed puzzle</a>. Salazar previously told me that he built the archive using the <em>NYT’s</em> publicly available API.</p><p>In the letter, which Salazar shared with <em>The Verge</em>, the <em>NYT’s </em>counsel alleges that the website “unlawfully copies and reproduces” <em>Connections</em>, which constitutes “trademark and copyright infringement in violation of The Times’s intellectual property rights.” The letter also says that the <em>NYT</em> has three trademark applications pending in connection with <em>Connections</em>.</p><p>Salazar has been given three business days to take down the site. If that doesn’t happen, the <em>NYT’s </em>counsel says it’s “prepared to take further action if necessary to protect its valuable intellectual property rights,” such as filing a lawsuit.</p><p>Salazar tells <em>The Verge</em> that he will “definitely take down the archive.” But he wants to keep the creator open, saying that it’s used by schools globally. “It’s not like I am getting paid for it or competing with their users (of which I am one),” Salazar says. He’s not sure about the specific timeline for when things might happen, though.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> says people should just play <em>Connections</em> on its website. “Mr. Salazar’s website violates the intellectual property rights of <em>The New York Times</em>,” spokesperson Jordan Cohen says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Anyone looking to play the original <em>Connections</em> game can do so for free on <em>The Times’s</em> own platforms. Those looking to solve puzzles from the <em>Connections</em> archive can do so by subscribing to <em>New York Times</em> Games.”</p><div><p>The <em>NYT</em> targeted <em>Wordle</em> clones with legal takedowns <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094234/ny-times-wordle-clones-files-dmca-copyright-takedowns-knockoffs">earlier this year</a>. The publication has also warned AI search engine Perplexity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270774/new-york-times-cease-and-desist-letter-perplexity-ai-search-engine">to stop using its content</a> and is suing OpenAI and Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">for copyright infringement</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And although the opening fortnight’s craziness is beginning to calm down, it’s still a surprisingly pricy collection.</p><p>Cards have held their value well into the second week, when we’d normally see them crashing down, though I still strongly suspect we’ll see a bunch of those prices dropping by the end of November.</p><p>However, I think what we’re seeing with Surging Sparks is another of the <em>Pokémon TCG</em>’s occasional peaks, those moments when it grabs the zeitgeist once again and everyone’s jumping in for a bit of speculation. That’s likely driven in part by the expectations for January’s new set, Prismatic Evolutions—a set that has already sold out on early pre-orders because of its focus on Eevee-lutions. Everyone always goes nuts over those, and it’s likely to see prices that make Surging Sparks’ look minimal.</p><p>I’ve ripped open about 60 packs of Surging Sparks (in part thanks to The Pokémon Company, who sent <em>Kotaku</em> a hefty pile), and haven’t had good luck at all. Pull rates seem about standard for 2023-24, a disappointing one in five for a standard ex or better, and far lower if you want to see any of the astonishing number of gorgeous artworks in the set.</p><p>It’s getting to a point where it just feels silly to let artists create so much beautiful work, and then make it so phenomenally difficult for anyone to see any of it. And given Pokémon isn’t seeing any of the profits made by those reselling them, the financial incentive is only in hoping that people will just buy more packs to try to find them. But given that everyone’s getting used to the horrible chances, that’s not a great long-term strategy. Grimly, I managed to get <em>three</em> of the ghastly full-art Bruxish cards (the art is great, the Pokémon is hideous), and comprehensively missed out on any of the 35 different cards I’d hoped to pull. The full-art Castform is lovely, though, and I’m pleased to have it.</p><p>Still, you may have been far luckier. Usually when we put these articles together, there’s one card teetering at around a hundred bucks, and then it’s down into the teens by card five or six. Not so in Surging Sparks.</p><p><em>As ever, all prices are correct at the time of writing, but these things change pretty rapidly.

Swinging Sphene then gives you a 50:50 chance to knock out your opponent’s active Pokémon (albeit Basics only), and even if it misses you knock out one on the bench!</p><p>Sorry, I’ve got to go build an Exeggutor deck immediately.

<p><br>After first being announced in 2010, STALKER 2 is out now for Xbox Series and PC. And despite more positive reception than negative, there are still technical issues with STALKER 2 that have caused some problems for players. </p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859265478276894856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the game’s developers at GSC Game World expressed their joy of the game finally being available to players. That said, they did acknowledge that the game has some “rough edges” that will be worked on as they monitor the feedback of players.</p>



<p>“We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven’t released anything of this scale before,” they said. “We’re absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention.”</p>



<h6 id="h-guides-improve-your-stalker-2-experience">GUIDES: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Improve Your STALKER 2 Experience</a></h6>



<p>They continued to say that over the next few days, they will be working on various hotfixes for the game and will release them “as precisely as possible” while still being as frequent as they can. After those are out, the focus will move to larger updates for the game.</p>



<p>“There will also be free in-game content — we’ll share its roadmap later in December,” they said. “We have big plans for the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Taylor-Hill reviewed the game</a>, and says that despite any technical hiccups early on, STALKER 2 is “the cream of the crop, and it’s a bar to which every developer in the genre should aspire to reach.”</p>

IGN has reported on Space Marine 2’s modding scene already, shining a light on everything from customization to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-solves-one-of-the-games-biggest-problems">a fix for one of the game’s biggest problems</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, the changes Space Marine 2 mods make to the Space Marines themselves, whether they’re a purely aesthetic customization not normally possible or certain classes using weapons and equipment they’re not supposed to, can be seen online by other players in public PvE sessions. While Space Marine 2 uses dedicated servers, a lot of the game elements are client-side controlled. So if you’re playing with random players, there’s a chance you might see things like Bulwarks wielding Thunder Hammers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-update-40-secretly-clamped-down-on-pvp-modding-publisher-confirms-but-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-pve-modding"><u>Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment had confirmed to IGN that it had no problem whatsoever with PvE modding</u></a>, but now, in <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/114-mod-support-a-message-from-the-game-director" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a message to modders</a>, game director Dmitriy Grigorenko has announced changes that impact how Space Marine 2 mods work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grigorenko said Saber had found that a “non-negligible” amount of recent server stability issues were related to mods, and pointed out that instability impacts even those users who don’t have mods installed. Saber has also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with the release of Space Marine 2’s next big update in December, mods will be blocked from public online sessions. That means that you will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed, Grigorenko warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods will still be allowed in private Operations lobbies, however (Space Marine 2 includes three-player co-op missions as part of Operations mode). “We will continue to provide all necessary server infrastructure so you can play online with your friends with mods,” Grigorenko promised. “Once we add custom Eternal War lobbies, mods will work for them as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber will also help Space Marine 2 modders out by providing an easy entry point to its backend for games with mods installed, “so modders won’t have to spend time hacking the game executable after each patch.” “If we somehow break this pipeline for mods by accident in the future, we’ll fix it,” Grigorenko vowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the big one: Saber will release “some” of its tools to modders so they can develop mods with greater ease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tom, aka Warhammer Workshop, creator of the popular Astartes Overhaul mod for Space Marine 2, hailed the news, saying official modding tools means no more reverse-engineering. “With official tools on the way, we’re entering a new golden age of modding,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By moving mods to private and custom lobbies, public servers will stay smooth while modded games get the infrastructure they deserve,” Tom said. “Mods are now a supported part of Space Marine 2, ensuring our creativity continues to enhance the game for years to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tom acknowledged some Space Marine 2 players and modders might feel disappointed that mods won’t work in public lobbies anymore. “But let’s be honest,” he countered, “the other alternative was mods getting shut down completely. Instead, Saber has embraced our community and creativity. This is a huge win for everyone!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

And it's using data collected by Pokémon Go players to do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official blog post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/right-wing-social-networks-don-t-work?ref=404media.co" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garbage Day</a> and reported on by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">404 Media</a>, Niantic revealed that it's building something called a "Large Geospatial Model." You may already know what a "Large Language Model" is - it's Chat GPT. It's an AI that is trained on enormous amounts of existing text so that it can then produce text on its own that sounds normal, and conceivably like what a user might want to hear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Large Geospatial Model is essentially the same idea, but applied to the physical world. It's trained on what real-world places look like (a church, a park, a house, etc), and then it can use that data to produce information on what actual places it hasn't seen yet might look like. Niantic claimed this will be useful for technology such as AR glasses, robotics, content creation, and other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or as Niantic put it:</p><blockquote>Imagine yourself standing behind a church. Let us assume the closest local model has seen only the front entrance of that church, and thus, it will not be able to tell you where you are. The model has never seen the back of that building. But on a global scale, we have seen a lot of churches, thousands of them, all captured by their respective local models at other places worldwide. No church is the same, but many share common characteristics. An LGM [Large Geospatial Model] is a way to access that distributed knowledge.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But to make this work, Niantic needs lots of data to train that AI on, and it can only do so much on its own. Google's been collecting location data for years via Google Maps and those funny cars it uses to get street view info, but that's not sufficient in this case. Cars can only drive on roads, and Niantic needs pedestrian information from places cars can't go. Fortunately, Niantic has thousands of people globally pointing their phones at things and sending that information back via its various projects and apps, Pokémon Go included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Niantic said in its post that it's been building something called a Visual Positioning System (VPS), a technology that uses an image from a phone to determine the position and orientation of a location on a 3D map. The technology is supposed to allow users to position themselves in the world with "centimeter-level accuracy," which allows them to then see digital content overlayed on the physical world "precisely and realistically." Again, from Niantic:</p><blockquote>This content is persistent in that it stays in a location after you’ve left, and it’s then shareable with others. For example, we recently started rolling out an experimental feature in Pokémon GO, called Pokémon Playgrounds, where the user can place Pokémon at a specific location, and they will remain there for others to see and interact with.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But all of this technology exists because users are constantly scanning the world with their phones while using Niantic's apps, including Pokémon Go, and have been for years now. Niantic said it currently has 10 million scanned locations around the world, one million usable with its VPS service, and gets one million new scans every single week containing hundreds of discrete images. That's a lot of data.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Niantic said it's using the data explicitly to develop its own technologies that it then turns around and implements into its existing products. However, in recent years there have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/27/23808499/ai-openai-google-meta-data-privacy-nope" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous concerns</a> over how companies collect data, use it to train AI, and what those AI models might eventually be used for.

                <p>Activision has revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players can get a nice bonus in Call of Duty: Warzone. A new trailer called "Maximize Your Gameplay" confirms the people who buy Black Ops 6 receive a 30% XP boost in the free-to-play battle-royale title. GameSpot understands that people who play through Game Pass can also get the XP boost.</p><p>The fine print in the trailer specifies that the 30% XP boost is only available during the seasonal content for Black Ops 6, which suggests it'll end in time for 2025's inevitable Call of Duty game. Still, the 30% XP boost should last for nearly a year, which is a nice perk if you want to spend $70 to buy the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW01Rr3rMDw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BW01Rr3rMDw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In other XP news, the legacy double XP tokens that were removed from Black Ops 6 have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-reveal-return-of-legacy-xp-tokens/1100-6527868/" data-ref-id="1100-6527868">reinstated</a>, and that's good news for people hoping to level up faster.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/">Season 1 of Call of Duty</a> continues to add new content to the game, with Ranked Play mode arriving to multiplayer on November 21.
