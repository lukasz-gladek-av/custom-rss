                <p>The year is 2025 and the Angry Birds franchise is not only still around, but still getting new games. Developer Rovio has launched the newest Angry Birds game, Angry Birds Bounce, via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-apple-arcade-games/2900-5678/" data-ref-id="2900-5678">Apple Arcade</a>.</p><p>That's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=A+New+Angry+Birds+Game+Is+Out+Now&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-07-03+08%3A44%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-07-03+09%3A05%3A40&amp;fnarticle_id=6532947&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapps.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fangry-birds-bounce%252Fid6462195757&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fa-new-angry-birds-game-is-out-now%2F1100-6532947%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the only place you can play the game</a>, so you'll need to sign up for for $7/month subscription service to try it out. Apple Arcade offers a seven-day free trial, too, while three months of Apple Arcade are included when you buy a new iPhone or iPad, so you might want to check to see if you're eligible.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRQk2gyvONE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SRQk2gyvONE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In Angry Birds Bounce, the pigs have banished the birds from their islands, so the birds--Red, Chuck, and Bomb--are doing whatever they can to get them back. Players fling the birds at the pigs, but they can now bounce off the walls for a new layer of strategy. Players need to strategically assemble a group of birds and go after specific power-ups to have the best chance at success. In essence, it appears to be a block-breaker game in the mold of Arkanoid.</p><p>Apple Arcade games have no microtransactions or ads, which is a big change from most mobile titles, and this applies also to Angry Birds Bounce.</p><p>Some of the other new additions to the Apple Arcade library in July include Kingdom Rush 5: Alliance TD and Suika Game+.

            <p>Sega president and CEO of Sega America and Europe Shuji Utsumi has admitted live-service games are the company's biggest challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-continue-to-dominate-accounting-for-40-of-time-spent-on-ps5-and-xbox-in-us-last-month">Live-service games dominate playtime</a>, but at present Sega does not have a competitive offering in this space.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZDinRJa2C4">The Game Business</a>, Utsumi stated: "One of the biggest challenges is the GaaS [Games as a service] business for us. The game companies with a strong record tend to have a strong GaaS business globally. Console/PC standalone business is getting to be better but we are still working on making the GaaS business global. So that's one of the big challenges."</p>

<figcaption>Sonic Rumble - Pre-Registration Trailer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckFLOcCsO_I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In response to what the company is doing to address this, Utsumi cited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">Sega's acquisition of Angry Birds maker Rovio</a> in 2023. "They have deep knowledge of the global mobile business and they have very strong IP like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a>," he said.</p>
<p>That's why the company is now working on the mobile party game Sonic Rumble, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/angry-birds-maker-and-sega-delay-sonic-rumble-release-once-again">this was delayed earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Added Utsumi: "We are giving [Rovio] access to our IPs including Sonic to come up with nice welcoming GaaS titles."</p>
<p>It's important that Utsumi mentioned global business in his comments. Later in the interview, he discussed emerging countries as an opportunity for growth, particularly with mobile games - including the likes of countries in the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>Sega did, of course, have looter shooter Hyenas from Creative Assembly, which was intended to be a live-service game. However, Hyenas <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">was cancelled in 2023</a>, due to "lower profitability of the European region".</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-is-aiming-to-create-a-super-game-by-march-2026">Sega announced the development of a "Super Game"</a>, though little has been revealed since.</p>
<p>"The ultimate goal in the 'Super Game' strategy is to create a game so revolutionary that it attracts far more active users than any of the Group's games to date," reads the company's strategy report from the time. "One key to achieving this goal is whether we can draw together a large community, involving not only players but also streamers who stream the game and viewers who watch their videos.</p>
<p>"That kind of community expands and further develops game content, adding value to the game that is unimagined by developers, and sparking a broader movement - which can then draw in even more users and grow the game's presence dramatically."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-the-phantom-x-coming-to-pc-and-mobile-next-month">Atlus and Sega released Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> on PC and mobile, a free-to-play gacha spin-off of its RPG series. Perhaps this could build on the heights of the Persona series to find global success.</p>
<p>Sega isn't alone in struggling with its live-service ambitions. Sony infamously cancelled Concord last year, as well as other unannounced projects. Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">PlayStation's Hermen Hulst recently stated the company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live service games</a> - Marathon and Fairgames in particular.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-president-admits-live-service-games-are-the-companys-biggest-challenge]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neil-druckmann-is-stepping-back-from-hbo%E2%80%99s-the-last-of-us-to-bring-his-%E2%80%9Ccomplete-focus%E2%80%9D-back-to-naughty-dog-and-its-future-projects.1235274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann has announced that he is stepping back from his role with HBO's The Last Of Us to bring his full focus back to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including the studio's upcoming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a statement from Druckmann and Naughty Dog on the <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">official X account</a> for the studio. "<em>I've made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in The Last of Us on HBO,</em>" Druckmann began. </p>



<div><p>"<em>With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative.</em></p><p><em>Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It's been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I'm deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting The Last of Us Part I and the continued adaptation of The Last of Us Part II</em>."</p></div>



<figure></figure>



<p>Since HBO began working on its adaptation of The Last of Us, Druckmann has been straddling his work at Naughty Dog with work on the show. He's written and directed episodes alongside his duties as an executive producer, and been the co-showrunner alongside Craig Mazin over the course of the first two seasons. With Druckmann stepping away from the show, Naughty Dog is officially not meaningfully involved in how HBO's adaptation of The Last of Us Part II continues with season 3 and beyond.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if Druckmann returns to the show to direct an episode here or there in season 3 or season 4, or if he really is watching from the sidelines for the rest of the adaptation. That he's made this announcement at all is also a bit surprising, considering how involved he's been so far. His first responsibility was always to Naughty Dog, so perhaps it became evident that he could no longer dedicate time to the show while things ramped up at Naughty Dog on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>



<p>If that is the case, then that raises questions as to how successful Druckmann was at being able to juggle his duties at Naughty Dog and on the show, and if this decision to step back from the show is due to him ultimately being unable to properly balance the two. That's all just speculation of course, and we'll likely never know the real truth of the matter, but for Druckmann to leave before the job is done on the adaptation, so to speak, shows that he had to make a choice about where he's spending his time.</p>

            <p>It never rains but it pours, as we say in old London town. Hard on the heels of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">gargantuan mass layoffs</a> yesterday, which accompany <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">several game cancellations</a> and have also seemingly led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts">layoffs at Romero Games</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a> developers Techland have reportedly cancelled two projects. They've haven't said which, but in the absence of known alternatives, one of them could be their untitled open world fantasy action-RPG from former employees of CD Projekt.</p><!--more-->
<p>Techland, who are a subsidiary of Tencent via majority stake, are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-in-august-with-the-usual-mix-of-rooftop-parkour-and-zombie-blasting">currently working</a> on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, a game of wide open horizons and puckish zombo head-platforming, which I played at Summer Game Fest and mostly enjoyed. Highlights: fleeing super-mutant cadavers in the dark, from rooftop to rooftop. Less fun: having cars thrown at me by a bullet-sponge boss. That's him in the picture there. Up yours, you greasy Bruce Bannerlike.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Techland <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-2s-developers-are-ramping-up-work-on-an-open-world-fantasy-rpg">also announced "a new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world"</a>. Last we heard, it was being made by former developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and The Witcher series, amongst them open world director Bartosz Ochman, narrative director Karolina Stachyra, and narrative lead Arkadiusz Borowik. But all that may be no more, for Techland have just reported losses of 130 million Polish złoty or roughly $37.3 million, according to Polish business site <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">Puls Biznesu</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dying-light-developer-techland-has-reportedly-cancelled-two-games/">VGC</a>). These losses stem from "our decision to discontinue further work on two projects."</p>
<p>I'll ask Techland for comment. If you're wondering why there are so many layoffs happening, it's not just the games industry's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">general enshittification</a> - it's the end of a financial quarter, a season in which book-balancers like to get out their red pens and polish the old cost/revenue ratio for the investors.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-developers-techland-are-cancelling-two-games]]></content:encoded>

Eat the food and you change into another outfit that looks even better than what your character was wearing before.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will be featured at Summer Games Done Quick 2025.</p>
<p>Games Done Quick, for those unaware, is a series of charity video game marathons, which promise "high-level gameplay" from those with a lot more skill and patience than I have. </p>
<p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 will run from 6th - 13th July, with all donations raised going towards Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders. This organisation provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disease outbreaks, and disasters globally. Last year, Summer Games Done Quick raised $2.5m for Doctors Without Borders.</p>

<p>The event will include Knockout Tours in the Nintendo racer. Considering the amount of shortcuts found out in the game's open world, it'll be intriguing to see if world record times will be beaten.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy CEO Leslie Benzies reportedly finally addressed staff after the launch of MindsEye, blaming internal and external saboteurs for the game's and the studio's current struggles.</p>



<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"> IGN</a>, the former producer of the Grand Theft Auto series addressed staff at the development studio yesterday, July 2, in a short video call. During the call, the Build a Rocket Boy CEO insisted the studio would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye while blaming both the game's and the studio's struggles to internal and external saboteurs. This is the second time a similar suggestion was made by a BARB exec, as last month, co-CEO Mark Gerhard talked about a supposed concerted effort by some to trash the game and the studio.</p>



<p>Though there seems to be plans to relaunch MindsEye at some point, things are looking dire at the studio. At-risk emails have been sent to around 300 employees at Build a Rocket Boy and to staff at PlayFusion, which was acquired by BARB in late 2024. As such, the situation seems to be far worse than what it seemed<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> last month</a>, when it was confirmed that a layoff process began at the studio.</p>



<p>Few should be surprised to see MindsEye becoming more and more one of the most disastrous game launches of all time. The writing was on the wall even before release, when two BARB chief executives left the studio a few days before the release of the game. With a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">technical</a> and gameplay issues, relaunching the game will be a real challenge, and with layoffs looming on the horizon at the development studio, it remains to be seen if there are real plans to do so and how they will be realized.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is expected to have sold well in its first week of availability, moving close to 1.5 million units in just a few days.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/us-consumers-will-cut-back-on-buying">The Game Business</a>, market research and analytics firm Ampere estimates that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach sold 1.4 million copies by the end of June in one week of availability. The game had a slower start than its predecessor in terms of physical copies across Europe, but digital sales are reportedly stronger. Considering how the original game continued to sell well even years after its launch, the second entry in the series by Kojima Productions seems set to become a success.</p>



<p>Although Death Stranding 2: On The Beach doesn't significantly shake up its predecessor's formula, the huge number of quality-of-life additions and the much faster pace make it a more accessible and ultimately more enjoyable experience. Stealth and combat have also been improved significantly, and by taking advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-make-stealth-and-combat-way-more-enjoyable-with-this-one-game-changing-trick/">a mechanic</a> that is not properly explained in-game, the entire experience turns into the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V we never got.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is now available on PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review-in-progress.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Distinct Possibility Studio, a new development team comprised of industry veterans including longtime Sony Online Entertainment boss John Smedley, has announced its first project: a large-scale persistent online open-world first-person shooter called Reaper Actual. It's in development for PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a PvPvEvE game – sort of akin to an MMOFPS – set on the fictional island of Marova, which Smedley tells IGN is four times the size of Call of Duty Warzone's biggest map. You play a Reaper – effectively, a mercenary – and work for different factions. Up to 200 players can be on one server, and you'll be able to join Outfits (read: clans), use vehicles, and own bases – and of course raid them. Meanwhile, the AI is also playing against each other, and the human players can choose to get involved. Check out the first trailer for the Unreal Engine 5-powered game above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Reaper Actual - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Distinct Possibility describes Reaper Actual's persistent online island as such: "Victories and defeats reshape the island’s control between PvP fights and NPC factions in real-time. Players will have a progression and crafting system to build the best gear, all of which stays in the world." Meanwhile, the studio's chief creative officer, Matt Higby, said, “We are moving toward the next level of persistent FPS combat. Players want a world they can live in and build upon. Having a solid base is only the start in Reaper Actual. Once faction missions interweave with PvP combat, the world becomes a swirling battleground of options for players. Mix that with a full crafting system and Reapers will grow every time you log in to play.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Left 4 Dead Director-style AI, Cerberus, will dynamically put players in conflict with each other by dishing out competing objectives for different Outfits.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Core player experiences are being designed around 3-4 player groups, with larger-scale Planetside 2-type scenarios as well. Meanwhile, their Left 4 Dead Director-style AI, Cerberus, will dynamically put players in conflict with each other by dishing out competing objectives for different Outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, they're extending the in-game economy outside of the game with opt-in web3 elements; the Steam and Epic Games Store versions of Reaper Actual won't have any web3 components, but players who wish to participate can opt-in to user-generated content by crafting guns and gear, with renting and modding servers also an option.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Professional wrestling is arguably one of the most involved forms of entertainment. In tandem with the gymnastic soap opera of never-ending stories, performers have to <a href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-aew-mason-madden-mxm-ring-of-honor-interview-1851634328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">constantly reinvent themselves by concocting new gimmicks</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tricking out their toolkits</a>. One understated yet equally important part of a wrestler’s presentation is their theme song. A good theme song will rouse fans from their seats to cheer for their favorite wrestler as they either make an unexpected run-in, long-awaited return, or meteoric debut in a new company.&nbsp;</p><p>When a wrestler receives a new theme, there comes the threat of upending the aura they have worked so hard to garner with fans. Who writes these theme songs? YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRByFN6eWfRjUH0MajJhBw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James “Little V” Mills</a> made a career out of making metal covers of popular video game songs before becoming the architect behind the theme song of AEW’s “God of Pro Wrestling,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Omega" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenny Omega</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bring Me The Horizon - Can You Feel My Heart (GIGACHAD Cover by Little V)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0wXU2PwY9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mills is prominently known on YouTube as a musician from Alberta, Canada, who creates “epic metal covers” of popular music from video games, anime, and internet memes. Since joining the platform in February 2010, Little V has amassed over a million subscribers, all tuning into his covers of songs like Casey Edward’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJqWFXCDEg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Devil May Cry 5</em> “Devil Trigger</a>”, Halogen’s 2017 internet earworm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8xoV-v1Yl0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“U Got That,”</a> and Yoasobi’s <a href="https://youtu.be/ko9M-K5FJnQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Oshi no Ko</em> anime theme song, “Idol.”</a> Ahead of Omega’s big match against longtime New Japan Pro Wrestling rival Kazuchika Okada at its upcoming PPV <a href="https://www.allelitewrestling.com/aew-event/aew-all-in-texas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AEW: All In Texas</a> on July 12, I spoke with Little V about how he came up with what would become the most popular theme song in the company for its golden wrestler.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Little V Mills</span></figcaption></figure><p>As fate would have it, Little V’s reputation as the artist behind metal video game covers preceded him, leading Omega to DM him on Twitter and ask if he could make him a new theme song to debut at AEW’s inaugural pay-per-view Double or Nothing in 2019.</p><p>“I believe the message was, ‘Hey, sorry to just slip into your DMs, but you’re Canadian, I’m Canadian’… and I said ‘I’m down,’” Little V recalled. “He had seen my work through YouTube and that’s why he reached out.”</p><p>Like WWE’s Megapowers, their out of the blue Canuck connection spurned Little V’s new responsibility for engineering a theme song for one of wrestling’s modern greats. However, despite that bond, Little V had a bit of an uphill battle in creating the theme. The musician had only a tertiary knowledge of wrestling; he watched it from time to time, and he was well aware of Omega, but he hadn’t tuned into Omega’s star-making time in NJPW. As a result, Little V felt he needed to do his due diligence to learn as much as possible about the wrestler. To do so, he turned to a fellow YouTuber and sicko for professional wrestling, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@supereyepatchwolf0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Eyepatch Wolf</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Professional Wrestling is Stupid and Beautiful and I Love it" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQCPj-bGYro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“As soon as [Omega] reached out, I reached out to another adjacent to the world we belong to, Super Eyepatch Wolf,” Little V told me. “EyepatchWolf was a huge fan of Kenny Omega's, and I was just like, ‘Hey, so, can you give me some background on him? I'm trying to get him a theme.’ I believe [Eyepatch Wolf’s messages were, ‘What? Huh? Um. Er. What?’ in a row.” Little V said EyepatchWolf sent him a “short novel” that incorporated everything about Kenny Omega to get him up to speed on the lore.&nbsp;</p><p>In the international wrestling community, themes often walk a fine line between iconic and generic-sounding. Case in point: WWE superstar CM Punk’s visible confusion at Logan Paul’s theme song, a common <a href="https://www.bloodyslam.com/news/fans-demand-wwe-to-fire-def-rebel-amid-reports-of-talents-frustration-over-the-new-music/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticism that fans levy at the company's theme composer Def Rebel.</a> To ensure his first foray into crafting a wrestling theme song wouldn’t fall into the same trap, Little V and Omega came up with some ideas that they felt celebrated Omega’s wrestling career as well as the video games his moveset are an homage to, like <a href="https://youtu.be/ooMm_xsRRyw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Street Fighter</em></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/E_WNaso8A_w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>. Omega specifically requested that the anthem sound “synthwavey” with musical stylings comparable to “Turbo Killer” by Carpenter Brut.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="† Carpenter Brut † TURBO KILLER † Directed by Seth Ickerman † Official Video †" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/er416Ad3R1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Independent of Eyepatch Wolf’s extensive Omega lore dump and the wrestler’s suggestions, Little V conducted some research by listening to Omega’s previous NJPW theme, “<a href="https://youtu.be/n2dVbk0iROM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devil’s Sky</a>”, and drew sonic inspiration from wrestling themes like Shinsuke Nakamura’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjZM5zFGuA&amp;pp=ygUbd3dlIHNoaW5zdWtlIG5ha2FtdXJhIHRoZW1l0gcJCcMJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rising Sun</a>” and CM Punk’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buafAa8Gobo&amp;pp=ygUlbGl2aW5nIGNvbG91ciBjdWx0IG9mIHBlcnNvbmFsaXR5IHd3ZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cult of Personality</a>” by Living Colour.</p><p>“I need something catchy, fun, and memorable. As soon as you hear it, it's recognizable and gets everybody excited,” Little V said. “I'm a sucker for a good hook—something you can chant along with it.”</p><p>Ultimately, it took Little V around a month to piece together the song, “Battle Cry,” from concept to final track.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kenny Omega entrance at AEW Double or Nothing HD" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5XkY_RsJ8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“We actually nailed it pretty much immediately. I think I sent him the first draft, and he said, 'Yeah, no, this is great.' But, really funny thing with that, ‘Battle Cry’ was an instrumental at first. It did not have any lyrics,” Little V said. “It wasn’t until the first Double or Nothing when he was facing Chris Jericho, and Kenny came out to the instrumental that I was like ‘Hold on.’ I literally got up—I didn't even finish watching the match— and walked over to my office and wrote the lyrics and recorded them that night.”</p><p>“The next day, I was like, ‘Kenny, I made lyrics. I re-recorded it here, tell me what you think.’ And he's like, 'This is great, this is fantastic,' and that's how it continued,” Little V said. “It was originally an instrumental, [but] watching it in the context, I'm like, ‘This needs something. This needs lyrics. This needs something to grab onto. I need to make it so it's chantable and fun to sing along with.’”</p><p>He continued, “It was interesting how it evolved literally from the first match of like, ‘Oh God, I gotta do something ‘cause right now— it's not that it sounds generic—it's missing something for the whole package.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Little V - Battle Cry (Kenny Omega's AEW Theme)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KOLiZ6qAWPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When it came to writing lyrics to “Battle Cry” that referenced video game lingo and Omega’s wrestling career, Little V made no qualms about the song being “pretty cheesy.”</p><p>“Let’s call a spade a spade, but I feel like it’s really appropriate. I literally called it ‘Battle Cry’ because of [Omega’s theme] ‘Devil’s Sky.’ [From] ‘one wing angel’ [to] ‘best bout machine,’ I was just like, ‘Let me throw as many references as I can in here. I’m not even gonna be subtle. I’m just gonna slap everyone in the face with it,’” Little V said. “I think it turned out well because a lot of people still love ['Devil's Sky'] even though it's been almost six years since he initially reached out.”&nbsp;</p><p>Little V recalled that Kenny Omega had some initial hesitance around the lyrics, primarily because he’d never worked with a vocal theme before. For Little V, though, crafting a wrestling theme didn’t feel far off from composing a song like a boss battle track for a video game. The real pressure came from knowing the track had to live up to Kenny Omega’s legacy for the IWC—as Omega warned him, wrestling fans are fiercely protective of their favorites, and any sudden change, especially in a theme song, would take them some time to warm up to.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's Kenny Omega. Everyone knows his previous theme song and everyone knows Kenny Omega [so] I'm like, ‘Oh crap, I gotta make sure I don't make something bad.’ I figure it's kind of like anime themes where everyone hates the new theme until about a month in, and then everyone loves the new theme opening,” Little V said. “I've been on the internet long enough to have people yell at me. I think I'm OK with this.”</p><p>As evidenced by “Battle Cry” currently ranking as the most popular song on All Elite Wrestling’s Spotify with over seven million listens, Little V is delighted with how the song panned out. Moreover, he’s touched by how full circle it's all become, leading to folks posting their covers of his track on YouTube.<br></p><p>“As a guy who does primarily covers, it's been very nice to see that,” Little V said.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kenny Omega returns to in-ring action vs Callis Family’s Brian Cage! | 1/15/25, AEW Dynamite" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUklBIJRhR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Even after Kenny Omega introduced an alternative theme, “Take Flight”—a collaboration between <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-ff-final-fantasy-14-composer-kenny-omega-new-theme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>’s Masayoshi Soken, vocalist Jason Miller, and the legendary Nobuo Uematsu</a>–to mark his return after recovering from diverticulitis surgery, Little V remains deeply humbled by fans who continue to celebrate his original mainstay anthem.</p><p>“It wasn't just like a complete like, ‘OK, this is a new theme song now,’” Little V said, regarding “Take Flight.” “It's been really cool to see that I was able to have that big of an impact on people and it makes me feel happy that I did a good job, because I don't want to screw up someone's wrestling theme song. That would suck.”&nbsp;</p><p>Little V said that he doesn’t make residuals for the track anytime AEW broadcasts it on TV.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was a one-time deal. I won’t go too far into it. There were some discussions of other things in the background, but it panned out that way, and I’m okay with that. I got paid a pretty good amount. No royalties—doesn’t work that way.”</p><p>Regardless, having created the theme song for one of the flagship wrestlers and executive vice president of a company that stands as <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-elite-wrestling-has-made-professional-wrestling-fun-1847651647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the counter-culture to wrestling’s longtime oligarch, WWE</a>, Little V feels a sense of pride in having left his footprint in the burgeoning company’s legacy and identity.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s incredibly humbling. The fact that it turned into being such a really popular theme, I'm really thankful that I had the opportunity to do it. It's led me to also write themes for other wrestlers as well,” Little V said. “Six years later, and it still gets me excited when I tune in, it pops on, and I hear the whole crowd losing it. I'm really glad I had the opportunity to do that.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer"><h3>Has Xbox Considered Laying One Person Off Instead Of Thousands</h3></a><p>None of the people being laid off were responsible for the decisions that have led to these layoffs</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble"><h3>Microsoft Layoffs Hit Blizzard, Warcraft Rumble Put On Life Support</h3></a><p>No new content for Warcraft Rumble as Blizzard departments like marketing and customer service are also impacted</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july"><h3>Microsoft Layoffs Sweep Xbox [Updating]</h3></a><p>Several in-development games have been canceled, including Perfect Dark and Everwild</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is coming to Xbox Series X|S consoles on 26th August, Arrowhead has announced, the game still being published by PlayStation and ported with the help of Sony’s porting specialists at Nixxes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 – Deploying on Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Helldivers 2 will arrive on Xbox with full cross-play to PlayStation and PC, and both Helldivers 2 standard edition and Super Citizen Edition are now available to pre-order on the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>Writing in an announcement post, game director Mikael Eriksson said, “We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p>
<p>While Microsoft has wholly embraced multiplatform game releases, bringing a number of their core franchises and new releases to PlayStation over the last few years, Sony has always resisted this. Or they’ve resisted propping up their competitor with their key single player titles. While Sony’s ambitions for more live service hits have floundered, the nature and need of these games to have a large player base to sustain them has meant that Sony’s been more open to cross-platform releases… they’ve just not really had the chance to prove it outside of Bungie still being allowed to announced Marathon for Xbox.</p>

<p>This is a pleasant surprise, then, and one that I’m sure many Xbox gamers will be keen to jump aboard and try out. Over the past year and a half, Helldivers 2 has continually evolved, first through the initial flurry of interest and early narrative twists in the Galactic War. As the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/13/helldivers-2-bugs-can-fly-now-despite-what-arrowheads-boss-tells-you/">Terminid</a> and Automaton threats were pushed back, late last year saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-is-out-now-a-new-faction-and-trucks/">the Illuminate start to emerge</a>, building up to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/war-comes-to-super-earth-in-helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update/">a full scale invasion that reached Super Earth itself</a>.</p>
<p>What kind of story will play out next, we don’t know, but having fresh Xbox gamers will certainly help.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 was one of the must-play games of the start of 2024, rapidly becoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/helldivers-2-sells-12-million-to-become-playstations-new-fastest-selling-game/">PlayStation’s fastest-selling game</a>. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">our Helldivers 2 review</a>, I said, “A naked shower scene away from being an official Starship Troopers game, Helldivers 2 is gloriously daft fun when you can get a group of friends together to play. It’s just a shame about the matchmaking and crash bugs at launch.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-bricking-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-challenged-in-brazil/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-ability-to-brick-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-is-being-challenged-in-brazil.1235190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo was clearly determined to improve some of the core failings of the original Nintendo Switch, including how easy it was for players to get pirated software onto the console. In the beginning, all it took was a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44106-nintendo-switch-hack">paper clip</a> to dismantle the Nintendo Switch, while Nintendo could do nothing but watch, and eventually release an updated model of the original Switch to stop the paper clip trick from working.</p>



<p>Nintendo has upped its game, so to speak, in its fight against piracy on the Nintendo Switch 2, with the threat of Nintendo bricking the device remotely hanging over the head of anyone willing to try and use their Switch 2 in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/">"<em>unauthorized</em>" way</a>. Players have described this kind of power to brick the whole device and not just ban the account of someone attempting to jailbreak their console as an overreach from Nintendo, but individual players can't exactly do much to get in Nintendo's way over it.</p>



<p>Procon-SP, however, is trying to get in Nintendo's way on behalf of Brazilian Nintendo Switch 2 owners. The Sau Paulo branch of Brazil's Consumer Protection and Defense organization has <a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/">published a press release</a> (spotted by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/02/brazil-nintendo-is-now-facing-legal-action-over-ability-to-brick-switch-2-console/">My Nintendo News</a>) in which it calls the clauses around bricking the device in the contract that every Nintendo Switch 2 owner and Nintendo Switch Online account holder agrees to "<em>abusive</em>."</p>



<p>To be clear, Procon-SP's issues with Nintendo are more around how the company can remotely and permanently cut off services that Brazilian consumers have paid for without a proper explanation. Procon-SP is asking that Nintendo change the wording in its EULA per its requests, with Nintendo now saying it will review Procon-SP's complaint and respond within the next 20 days. Nintendo's current EULA reads "<em>You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions, Nintendo may render the Console and/or the Software permanently unusable in whole or in part</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see if Nintendo changes the wording, or if Procon-SP takes this complaint even further, prompting potential legal action.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Hideo Kojima <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already">reiterated</a> that he'd really like to make a video game in space, much to Mark's despair and outrage. Perhaps "how do we send Hideo Kojima into outer space" can be one of the problems they solve in the Spaceship Game Jam, a collaboration between the Finnish Game Jam and the European Space Agency, in which starry-eyed developers "design and prototype games or playful concepts inspired by real-world space issues". </p><!--more-->
<p>The event runs August 29th to August 31st. You can join the proceedings in-person at specified sites around Finland, or participate online. There's no entry fee, nor do you need to know what "outer space" is to apply. "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/curiosity">Curiosity</a> and a desire to explore are the only requirements," the organisers explain (yes, I'm aware this website's fiendish autotagging software has just linked "curiosity" to Peter Molyneux's smartphone-chiselling abomination; no, I do not know how to stop it). I think "cosmic dread" should be one of the entry criteria as well. I mean, half the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space games</a> on Steam are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a>.</p>
<p>Why not just host my own damn spacejam, you imperiously enquire, rather than waiting for those stuffed shirts at the ESA to give their blessing? Well, "participants will gain exclusive access to a rich collection of data and assets generously provided by ESA," <a href="https://spaceshipgamejam.org/faq/">according to the project's website</a>. "This collection will include data from satellites, research missions, telescopes, and more, to inspire and enrich your games."</p>
<p>I find the Spaceship Game Jam interesting inasmuch as I'm interested in the overlap between private or public sector space exploration and the video games industry. I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nasa-video-games-call-of-duty-mars">wrote a bit about that for Eurogamer</a>, back in the day, though frankly, I think the piece in question is a sanctimonious blatherfest, so let me extract some highlights: NASA have a sideline in video games development or partnerships with developers as part of their campaign for greater public awareness and, thereby, funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare">Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</a> was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/06/27/why-infinite-warfares-space-battles-are-more-grounded-than-you-think.aspx">designed with input from NASA consultants</a>, and NASA has also teamed up with Blackbird Interactive, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Eagle">construct a simulation of a hypothetical 22nd century Martian colony in the Gale Crater</a>. NASA have also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/jedis-to-astronauts-how-nasa-tapped-video-game-maker-for-training.html">made use of educational games for astronaut training</a>.</p>
<p>As for the European Space Agency, they've <a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Branding_and_Partnerships/ESA_connects_space_exploration_and_video_games_at_Gamescom_2024">hosted stands at Gamescom</a> in a bid to recruit the next generation of geeks, and are presently working with Life Is Strange developers Don't Nod on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dontnod-are-working-with-the-european-space-agency-to-make-sci-fi-adventure-game-aphelion">sci-fi adventure game Aphelion</a>. Perhaps if you take part in their game jam, you'll be able to reboot yourself as a professional rocket scientist and help poor, befuddled Kojima escape the tyranny of gravity. He'll get his arse to Mars someday.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-hither-wannabe-astronauts-the-european-space-agency-are-doing-a-spaceship-game-jam]]></content:encoded>

This marks the first appearance of the series on a Microsoft platform.</p><p>The cooperative third-person shooter was first released on February 8, 2024, for PlayStation 5 and PC. As soldiers defending Super Earth in 2184, players work together in three-person squads to fight in the never-ending Galactic War against the insect-like aliens, the Terminids (among other threats). Helldivers 2 on Xbox will support cross-play on all platforms.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," says Helldivers 2 game director Mikael Eriksson in a press release. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><p>This announcement is notable because while we've seen several first-party Xbox titles make the jump to PlayStation hardware in the last year, this is a more uncommon instance of a Sony-published game migrating to Microsoft's console. Helldivers 2 was one of our favorite games of 2024. We scored it a 9 out of 10 upon its release (check out our<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven"> review</a>), and it also landed a spot on our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/20/game-informers-belated-top-10-games-of-2024-awards">Top 10 Games of 2024</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-airdrops-on-xbox-series-xs-in-august]]></content:encoded>

<p>Surprising nobody, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is <em>still</em> in first place after having put up an additional 145,069 sales in its fourth week in the top spot. But it's not quite as one-sided as you might expect this time, thanks to a staggering debut from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tamagotchi_plaza">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>, which combined for a sweet 128,685 units across its Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2</a> releases. As it turns out, yes, Tamagotchi <em>is</em> still A Thing.</p>
<p>It wasn't a complete Switch-fest, of course, with Kojima's latest, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, squeezing the PS5 onto the podium after pulling in a cool 71,964 sales in its first week. AQUAPLUS's remastered visual novel <strong>ToHeart</strong> and the physical release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a> managed to break the top 10 in the debut week, too. <em>Cor</em>, what a time for new releases!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-to-focus-on-naughty-dog.1235136/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Neil Druckmann, best known for his work as creative lead on Naughty Dog's successful&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series, has announced he will step down from his "creative involvement" with HBO's adaptation of the games in order to focus on his work with Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Druckmann says the decision to step away from the show was "difficult", but that he wants to "transition [his] complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">upcoming <i>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</i></a>, on which Druckmann serves as writer and director.</p>

<p>Druckmann says that working on HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series as a co-creator "has been a career highlight", and that now, after the completion of series two and "before any meaningful work starts on season three", is the "right time" to step away.</p>

<p>When the second season aired earlier this year, the response from audiences, as well as some critics, was decidedly more muted. Our very own Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow">awarded the season a 7 out of 10</a>, praising its set dressing and Pascal's performance but criticizing "pacing issues".</p>

<p>A third season of the show is on the way, and given that the second season didn't conclude the story of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II</em>, we can reasonably assume that the upcoming season will do so.</p>




<p>As for the games, as far as we know, there's no third installment in development, although Druckmann has said before that he believes there <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-creative-director-there-is-probably-one-more-chapter-to-this-story" rel="nofollow">could be "one more chapter"</a> to the story the games tell.</p>

<p>Given that Naughty Dog is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, however, and given the sheer amount of time games take to make these days, I wouldn't bank on seeing a third&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>game for quite some time yet.</p>

            <p>Romero Games have announced in the wake of mass layoffs at Microsoft that funding for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">next shooter</a> has been pulled by its publisher. A number of former staff at the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero have since written on social media that they've lost their jobs as part of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">MS cuts</a>.</p>
<p>A statement posted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/romero-games">Romero Games</a>' Twitter account attributed to Brenda Romero asserts that the game's publisher, which it didn't name, had opted to pull the funding for it "along with several other unannounced projects at other studios".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control," Romero continued. "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome. This absolutely isn't a reflection of our team's work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we've worked with.”</p>
<p>Following the statement being put out, a number of now-former Romero Games devs have posted on social media that they've lost their jobs as part of the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft and Xbox. These include hard surface artist <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128">Christoph Redl</a>, senior 3D character artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477302404329472/">Conor Jordan</a>, and senior producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477777308573697/">Emily Winters</a>.

<p>"The mass Microsoft layoff effectively cancelled funding for Romero Games and as a result the whole team was laid off," wrote former Romero Games UI artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346535464591355909/">Ana Mitrovic</a>. Meanwhile fellow former artists <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346495054519173120/">Sadbh Flanagan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346522896481034241/">Eric Wong</a> both referenced the studio closing in their posts.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>"We appreciate any attention you can bring to our talented team who are now looking for work," Romero Games community developer and communications manager Maezza Romero wrote in response to a request for comment RPS made to the studio. "I have to refer you back to our public post, which is in keeping with our confidentiality agreement."</p>
<p>The original statement closes by saying that Romero Games are "currently evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team. Many of us have worked together for more than a decade, some for more than 20 years," it goes on. "It’s an extremely difficult day, and we’re heartbroken it’s come to this."</p>
<p>"These people are the best people I've ever worked with," John Romero added on social media, "and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts]]></content:encoded>
