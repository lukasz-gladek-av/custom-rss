			<p>It's been announced today by Virtuos, a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading video game developer</a>, that they have strategically acquired three studios across the globe. Virtuos has helped co-develop games like Crash: Mind over Mutant, The Outer Worlds, Dead Island 2, and Hogwarts Legacy, for example. They have now announced that they have acquired Pipeworks (USA), Abstraction (Netherlands), and Umanaia (Canada). They have all worked on some very significant games, which will be detailed down below so you can get an idea of the kind of developers they are.</p>
<p>In the acquisition, they will each have their own role to play in the bigger picture, with Virtuos wanting to become a globalized powerhouse for "sustainable, flexible game development solutions." By acquiring these studios, it now allows Virtuos to offer a broader range of services across game development and live operations across the globe, with studios in Europe, Asia and North America. Thus far, Virtuos' has a network of studios across 26 locations worldwide, with their specializations being at the forefront of the big picture.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.pipeworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pipeworks</a> will now be Virtuos' lead game development studio in North America, as they have a 25-year strong legacy, with experience working on titles such as Terraria and Call of Duty. The team is extensive, with nearly 200 employees working at the company to help co-develop titles for console, PC, and mobile. They currently have multiple AAA titles in development with studios such as Xbox Game Studios, PlayStation Studios, and Warner Bros. Games.</p>
<p><a href="https://abstraction.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstraction</a> has a significant co-development expertise, as their portfolio consists of major titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Dune: Awakening, with the company elevating Virtuo Labs' engineering capabilities. Their team consists of over 90 industry veterans, with their mission being focused on founding new technology and game prototypes to benefit and enhance the game development process.</p>
<p>Finally, there is <a href="https://www.umanaia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umanaia</a>, who has a focus on original IPs and uses its experience in creating major titles such as Assassin's Creed and For Honor, and will be helping to bolster the ongoing process of creating Virtuos Originals. Their team is the newest, as it was founded in 2021. For the most part, they will be utilizing their expertise in Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) as well as their successful post-launch strategies. Alongside this, they will be refreshing beloved IPs and creating new experiences with the gamer in mind. Umanaia is also the smallest team, with over 40 senior developers, and will be working hard in the Virtuos Originals initiative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you are looking to get a brand new Nvidia RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 at launch, it may be tougher than you expected. According to multiple rumors circulating, the release of the next-generation of graphics cards from Nvidia is gearing up to be the “worst when it comes to availability” in the company’s history.</p>



<p>One board partner, Zotac, confirmed supply issues in an <a href="https://tagtag.co.kr/article/notice/1/18681/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message online</a>. The AIC says that their card won’t be available on January 30 as expected, instead it will be coming in early February. Still, Zotac says that “due to external factors” there’s the chance the card may not come until mid-February.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://benchlife.info/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-launch-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, they state that “communication issues” between Nvidia and its various AIC partners have resulted into limited supply for consumers.</p>



<p>Said gaming PC builder <a href="https://x.com/PowerGPU/status/1881758554836877675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerGPU</a>, “Warning you all now. The launch of the RTX 5090 will be the worst when it comes to availability. Already being told to expect it to be that way for the first 3 months.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on these claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-announces-geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were revealed during CES</a> in early January. In addition to the two high-end graphics cards, Nvidia is set to release the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 sometime in February. An exact date, however, has yet to be announced by the company.</p>



<p>What do you think of the claims that launch availability for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 will be the worst in the company’s history? &nbsp;Let us know in down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games-armchair-generals-shouldn%E2%80%99t-miss.1089006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the ongoing Steam festival focusing on real-time strategy games, now’s the perfect opportunity to score a few titles you could potentially spend hundreds of hours playing. There’s a fair number of discounted RTS games I have personally spent up to 1,000 hours playing, and some are just too good of deals to pass up. Here’s a look at five highly recommended games on Steam’s Real-Time Strategy Fest!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-worth-buying-on-steam-s-rts-fest">Best Games Worth Buying on Steam’s RTS Fest</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of the strategy genre, you’re in luck because there are countless releases annually, many of which shine. Despite the new releases and innovative indie studios taking a chance at refreshing the genre, a few old standbys tend to keep most players’ attention. With the current Steam Fest, now’s a good time to jump in for yourself!</p>



<h3 id="h-hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron IV</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you ever watched a documentary or read a history book about WW2 and thought, “I could do it differently?” If so, then <strong>Hearts of Iron IV</strong> is your game, as it allows you to take economic, political, and military command of an entire nation, prepare for the upcoming war by building weapons and cementing alliances, and then fight in a global conflict. It’s challenging, rewarding, and expansive!</p>



<h3 id="h-stellaris">Stellaris</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like Hearts of Iron IV, but in space, with more operatic moments and interesting setpieces. I mean, look at the screenshot above as a science vessel scans a planet with a red sun in the background. <strong>Stellaris </strong>is beautiful and one of the most straightforward Paradox titles for new players. It allows you to tell a grand story of a space-faring empire, which speaks to many!</p>



<h3 id="h-warno">Warno</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If taking command of an entire nation or galactic empire isn’t quite your speed, <strong>Warno</strong> offers a more grounded approach to real-time strategy by placing you in charge of a fighting force full of tanks, armored vehicles, infantry, helicopters, and even fighter jets. You’ll conquer territory on the map, fighting small-unit skirmishes and endure large-scale bombardments alike, for a bombastic and entertaining RTS experience!</p>







<h3 id="h-they-are-billions">They Are Billions</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>They Are Billions</strong> proves to be a highly challenging yet rewarding strategy game that took me by surprise. I didn’t think I’d spend hundreds of hours trying to survive the zombie apocalypse in a city-building survival and real-time strategy game, but this one kept me playing. You are the last bastion of humanity, surviving seemingly endless waves of the undead as they attempt to wipe humanity from the planet.</p>



<h3 id="h-total-war-rome-2">Total War: Rome 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>While there are certainly newer entries in the long-running Total War franchise, I will always retain a soft spot for <strong>Rome 2</strong> as one of my favorite historical strategy games in the series. It’s expansive, grand, and memorable, allowing players to restore the glory of Rome by conquering the Gauls to the north or moving into Greece to the east. The world is your oyster, so long as you have the coin and men to take it yourself!</p>

<p>Prepare yourself, strategy gaming fans! <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7 has gone gold ahead of release</a>, and it’s almost upon us!</p>

        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Design and Build a Towering Ocean City</strong> – The world is dying, overtaken by the endless ocean. You are the leader of a small group of survivors stranded on a rusty boat. You find a small land area, solid enough to serve as a building foundation. And now, step by step, you build a city. This city will go up to the sky, weather many storms, and become a home for the last remnants of humanity. For your people.</li><li><strong>Master Physics-Based 3D Construction System</strong> – The game’s physics-based building mechanic challenges you to consider real-world construction aspects when building your intricate multi-level city in all three dimensions. While easy to grasp, this unique system introduces deeper simulation aspects and more creative freedom to the city-building sandbox, allowing you to bring numerous vertical city design ideas to life.</li><li><strong>Every Building Can Collapse</strong> – While building, you’re essentially playing Jenga with human lives at stake. Each structure can crumble, so you must provide enough support and find creative ways of using different building materials. There is a high-risk, high-reward aspect to it, though. For example, you can find various ways to reach much-needed resource nodes by building elaborate bridges or ladders. Or—save some space for more production by stacking the housing quarters on top of each other. If you fail, the state of the building can be reverted to before the collapse, so you can fix the mistakes and avoid tragic consequences – at least on lower difficulties!</li><li><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge a Bustling Colony of Survivors</strong> – Besides building and maintaining the city, you will also manage a colony of survivors. As their leader, navigate the wants and needs of several factions—Engineers, Sailors, and Workers—each with its own unique traits. For example, only Engineers can operate cranes, while Sailors have access to boat navigation, making resource gathering and logistics easier.</li><li><strong>Make Difficult Yet Necessary Decisions</strong> – Sometimes, you will have to make difficult yet necessary decisions to lead your people to prosperity. Try to feed every mouth generously, or be strict with food rationing. Establish martial law during the unrest, or show mercy and let people voice their frustrations. Go down in history as a benevolent shepherd or strong-hand tyrant—as long as the city prevails.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> New Challenges Every Time</strong> – Each colony you build will deal with unique challenges, foundation layouts, circumstances and random events—like storms, mysterious structures emerging from the ocean, political coups, unexpected newcomers, food shortages, and more. Learn from your mistakes, unlock new locations on the global map, and embark on the next dangerous <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,004 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> once the inevitable calamity comes to destroy the city.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

So, like I said, I feel like they really did a great job of balancing, and could they keep adding more and more characters? For sure, there’s definitely enough characters to go around.

<p>Some new footage of DOOM: The Dark Ages has leaked online ahead of the Xbox Developer Direct on January 23.</p>



<p>The footage was uploaded by YouTube Gougaru, who seemingly has recorded some footage of DOOM: The Dark Ages at a behind-the-scenes presentation. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MORE NEW DOOM:THE DARK AGES FOOTAGE HAS BEEN LEAKED!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NogvFk4gmI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><br>The gameplay footage gives a brief walkthrough of some of the locations in the game. Still, while the footage leaked before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox developer direct</a>, it’s understood that the gameplay originates from a tech demo of some kind, likely showcasing the latest series of graphics cards.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who have seen a preview of DOOM at the Xbox Developer Direct, the in-depth look will show more gameplay instead of map overviews.</p>



<p>Yesterday, DOOM: The Dark Ages <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked to be released on May 15, 2025</a> for the Xbox Series S|X, PC, and PlayStation 5. SOOM: The Dark Ages marks the game as one of Microsoft’s first “exclusives” to release day and date on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for what else to expect during the Xbox Developer Direct, Xbox has announced that South of Midnight and Expedition 33 will also be having in-depth showcases, while a fourth “unknown” game will also be revealed.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>The game is narratively set as a prequel to the 2016 DOOM title, which sold 2 million copies by July 2017 (before Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda, where the game released multiplatform). </p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Season 7, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, has arrived, bringing Diablo 3 Witch Doctor powers to the dungeon crawler. The new seasonal content features Headrotten enemies, which you will need to work with The Coven to defeat, increasing your standing with the faction. This means you'll need to partake in the revamped Tree of Whispers activities tied to the seasonal content. Completing these objectives will grant you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/diablo-4-battle-pass-season-7-rewards-all-cosmetics-titles-and-emotes/2900-6147/">battle pass</a> XP and loot for each chapter completed. The final chapter includes Dorian, a pet raven.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Your progress on objectives in chapters you haven't reached does track, but your progress in each chapter won't be reflected until that chapter has been reached.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4431857" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4431857"></a><figcaption>Each chapter has two more objectives than are required to complete the chapter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">A Witch's Debt: Increase standing with The Coven to Rank 1 by completing Whispers.</li><li dir="ltr">Trinket's from the Nest: Obtain 1 Cache from the Raven during a Headhunt by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Veteran of Ashes: Acquire 666 Aberrant Cinders during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Spoils of Hell: Open 1 Tortured Gifts during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Trouble in the Wilds: Complete 5 World Events</li><li dir="ltr">Forager: Collect 100 Bundled Herbs from Harvest Nodes, Cellars, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Tanner's Apprentice: Collect 50 Rawhide from salvaging Armor, defeating Monsters, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Prospector: Collect 100 Iron Chunks from various sources</li><li dir="ltr">Deafening Whispers: Complete 10 Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Just a Sip: Upgrade your Potion to Tiny at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">In the Back Pocket: Discover the Armory to save and access builds</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These challenges are all fairly simple and should be completed without much effort, especially if you are skipping the campaigns with your new season character. The Armory might be one you need to go out of your way since it's a new feature, but shouldn't take much effort to complete. <strong>The Coven ranks appear throughout the Season Journey chapters and can be leveled by completing Tree of Whisper tasks, do not ignore these if you want to complete the Season Journey.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor (battle pass XP)</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Cache: Contains Consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Crafting Cache: Contains Crafting Materials, such as Herbs and Gem Fragments</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">In Service to the Tree: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 3</li><li dir="ltr">Taste of Power: Collect 5 Witch Powers from any Altar of Witchcraft found near the Tree of Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Twilight Dream: Acquire 1 Nightmare Dungeon Sigil</li><li dir="ltr">Pilgrimage of Nightmares: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Test of Mettle: Defeat 5 elite monsters</li><li dir="ltr">Prelude of Doom: Defeat 5 Harbingers during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Notarized Nuisance: Increase your Threat Level to Max by defeating monsters during the Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Risk and Reward: Buy 3 pieces of equipment from the Purveyor of Curiosities</li><li dir="ltr">A Master at Work: Complete 1 World Event with Mastery</li><li dir="ltr">Ruins Reclaimed: Clear 1 Stronghold</li><li dir="ltr">Capable Craftsmen: Learn 1 recipe of Rare or higher rarity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Another set of relatively easy goals here. The most likely ones to ignore are the Strongholds, just because you don't have to do those unless you really care about potential world activities there. The rest of these are fairly simple, if luck based, like the recipe of rare rarity, or are tied together, like multiple Helltide activities and Nightmare Dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, wish as Herbs and Veiled Crystals</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Sacrificial Blade: INcrease your standing with The Coven to Rank 5</li><li dir="ltr">Rot Cleanser: Complete 5 Rootholds</li><li dir="ltr">Cave out the Necrosis: Defeat 5 Thrall of Rot, which can be found during Headhunts or in Rootholds</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Ancients: Unlock 10 aspects in the Code or Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Miracles of Alchemy: Craft 5 Elixirs at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Confront the Creature: Defeat the Blood Maiden summoned during Helltide with Baneful Hearts</li><li dir="ltr">Champion of the Lost: Clear 3 Strongholds</li><li dir="ltr">Basic Needs: Temper 5 Affixes onto gear at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Forsaken Offerings: Obtain 5 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Hard Fought Victory: Complete 1 Legion Event</li><li dir="ltr">Band of Killers: Defeat a World Boss while in a party</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 is where the tasks start to get a bit more involved, but the majority here are all tied to the seasonal content of The Coven and the related activities. The Blood Maiden is easier to defeat during a Helltide than you might expect, just because there are almost always other players grinding out kills as it's a good source of loot. An easy one to skip here is Band of Killers, as it requires you to have friends online at the same time as a World Boss is active, although you can try inviting nearby players while waiting for it to spawn.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge the Blood Maiden during Helltides</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">In the Eyes of The Coven: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 8</li><li dir="ltr">Power Primordial: Upgrade 5 Witchcraft powers to Rank 10 through the Seasonal Powers Panel</li><li dir="ltr">Damnation's Downfall: Defeat 1 Helltide Commander during Helltides, summoned after completing Helltide Events</li><li dir="ltr">Third Eye Open: Consume 5 Draught of Whispers to increase the likelihood of encountering Forgotten Altars and Fugitive Heads</li><li dir="ltr">Penitential Path: Defeat 666 Monsters in Penitent or Higher</li><li dir="ltr">Endless Nightmares: Complete 10 Nightmare Dungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Tree: Obtain 10 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Form and Function: Upgrade 5 gear by adding Sockets at the Jewler</li><li dir="ltr">Forged in Blood: Craft 5 Blacksmith Cache at the Blacksmith after reaching Level 60</li><li dir="ltr">Ceremonial Smoke: Craft 1 Incense at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Strength in Numbers: Complete 1 Legion Event while in a party</li><li dir="ltr">Born in Torment: Defeat 10 Hellborne spawned by reaching Max Threat Level during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This set of objectives should take you up through level 60. If you haven't swapped over to Penitent difficulty at this point, you should, as the added bonus loot and XP is a big bonus and your equipment is likely powerful enough. You need to prepare for Torment 1, which is required for one task here. You could ignore it, but you will need to move to Torment 1 for the next chapter anyway. The Legion Event in a party is also skippable, but these occur more often than World Bosses, so it isn't entirely difficult.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Wound and Woe Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li><li dir="ltr">Otherworldly Player Title</li><li dir="ltr">Raven Player Title</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Slayer__Chapter_5_">Slayer (Chapter 5)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 12 of 14 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Slayer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Rite Keeper: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 15</li><li dir="ltr">A Tortured Gamble: Open 1 Tortured Gift of Mystery during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Shards of the Fiends: Collect 5 Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">The Hordes Falter: Defeat the Fell Council 1 time in the Infernal Hordes on Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Finder of Secrets: Find 1 Forgotten Altar</li><li dir="ltr">Headhunter: Collect 8 Fugitive Heads during Headhunts</li><li dir="ltr">Cultivate Fear: Collect 100 Obducite from such sources as Nightmare Dungeons or Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Lucid Nightmare: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">No Mere Mortal: Unlock a Legendary Paragon node after reaching level 60 using Paragon points</li><li dir="ltr">Precious Shards: Salvage 100 Ancestral Legendary items</li><li dir="ltr">Transfer of Power: Imprint 8 Aspects onto Gear at the Occultist</li><li dir="ltr">Preamble: Complete Artificer's Tier 20 or higher in the Pit of the Artificer located in Cerrigar</li><li dir="ltr">Guilt: Defeat Tormented Echo of Varshan 1 time</li><li dir="ltr">Shock and Awe: Defeat Tormented Echo of Grigoire</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This chapter basically requires you to be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-difficulty-options-explained-for-season-6-and-vessel-of-hatred/1100-6527180/">Torment 1</a> and max level. There is a large variety of activities here, but most only require you to run them a few times. The Obducite can be obtained from only a couple of Nightmare Dungeon runs and you need to do five anyway. The only ones you may want to hold off on are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-how-to-summon-endgame-bosses/1100-6518613/">two bosses Varshan and Grigoire</a>, just because you may need to do the other activities to get your gear good enough to win those fights, but you will eventually want to do them for the loot regardless.</p><p dir="ltr">Slayer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Champion__Chapter_6_">Champion (Chapter 6)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 11 of 13 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Champion objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Unholy Coffers: Open 1 Greater Spoils of Hell chest after defeating the Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Warden of the Swamp: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 20</li><li dir="ltr">Warbringer's Wealth: Craft 10 Occult Gems learned from Grimoires</li><li dir="ltr">Drink Deep from the Chalice: Upgrade 10 Witchcraft powers to Rank 20 through the Seasonal Powers Panel</li><li dir="ltr">Glyph Expert: Improve 5 Paragon Glyphs to Rank 15 by completing The Pit</li><li dir="ltr">Echoes of the Ancients: Unlock 50 Aspects in the Codex of Power</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Challenge: Defeat 666 Monsters on Torment 2 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Forgiveness: Defeat Tormented Echo of Lord Zir</li><li dir="ltr">Harbinger of Ice: Defeat Tormented Echo of The Beast in the Ice</li><li dir="ltr">Horadric Smith: Masterwork 5 pieces of gear to Rank 5 at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Preeminence: Reach Paragon Level 100</li><li dir="ltr">Thorn in Hell: Defeat 666 monsters while at Max Threat Level during Helltide on Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Coordinated Kill: While in a Party, defeat 25 Lair Bosses</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Depending on if you play Diablo 4 with friends or solo, the 25 Lair Bosses in a party is an easy skip. That does mean you will need to take on the two bosses listed here, but you should be in pretty good shape in terms of gear at this point, and you can leave them for last if you haven't. The most time-consuming task here is likely the 5 Paragon Glyphs at Rank 15, just because it will require quite a few runs of The Pit, even at high tiers, but that will help you get enough XP to reach Paragon level 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Champion rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Cache: Contains Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destroyer__Chapter_7_">Destroyer (Chapter 7)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 out of 10 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Silencer: Complete 5 Whispers within 15 minutes during Headhunts in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Roots Ablaze: Open 15 Exposed Roots within 15 minutes during Headhunts in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Root Pulverizer: Activate 2 Legendary Ceremony Shrines within a single Roothold in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Waking Horrors: Defeat 50 Elite Monsters while in Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 4 without dying</li><li dir="ltr">Triumph of the Tormented: Defeat 666 Monsters in Torment 4 without dying</li><li dir="ltr">Bloodstained Hoard: Collect 750 Aether in a single run of the Infernal Hordes in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">With Sand to Spare: Complete Artificer's tier 75 or higher in The Pit, with more than five minutes remaining</li><li dir="ltr">Assassin's List: Defeat 5 Lair Bosses within 5 minutes in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Hell's Fury: Defeat 250 monsters before the Hellborne's arrival after increasing your Threat Level to Max in Torment 4</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This list is pretty tough across the board, fitting for the final chapter. As for which ones to ignore and which ones to do, there are too many tough ones here to really make that call. Most of these require Torment 4, and you not only need to complete tasks, but do so quickly and without dying. This will require your build to be near complete, Paragon boards finished, and a strong understanding of your ability rotations.</p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Dorian pet Raven</li><li dir="ltr">The Raven Familiar Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Cache: Contains a Resplendent Spark and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge Bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual.</li></ul>

                <p>Obsidian Entertainment has started a new series of animated YouTube videos to give Avowed players a refresher on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pillars-of-eternity/" data-ref-id="5000-156288">Pillars of Eternity</a> franchise lore. After watching Lore of Eora - Species, you will be familiar with every kind of Kith you'll encounter during your time with Avowed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedO6SJURK0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jedO6SJURK0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That’s because the first entry of this five-part series provides an overview of the human, aumauan, orlan, dwarven, and elven species that populate Avowed’s world. Lore of Eora - Species begins by explaining that Kith is the term used to refer to Eora’s people. While humans, dwarves, and elves are species of Kith fantasy fans should be familiar with, the aumaua and orlan species are unique to Eora.</p><p>The aumaua are the sea-faring species of Kith with “unparalleled strength and imposing size” and blue or green skin. Meanwhile, orlans are small, furry people with large ears and incredible mental prowess. No matter what species of Kith someone is, there is a chance they can be born as a godlike. Godlikes have “unusual physical characteristics and mystical powers” based on one of Eora’s gods, with the one featured in this video sporting antlers on her head. The player-created character in Avowed is a godlike, considered a rare sight in Living Lands of Eora where Avowed takes place.</p><p>This series of Lore of Eora videos is helpful because Avowed takes place in the same universe as the isometric RPG series Pillars of Eternity. While playing Pillars of Eternity and Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is not required to understand or enjoy Avowed, Lore of Eora helps color in the details of this universe established in previous games. Obsidian Entertainment lays out video series' goal in the description of this first video: It wants to make the franchise’s dense lore “accessible for all.”</p><p>Avowed launches for PC and Xbox Series X|S on February 18 and will be part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog from day one. You can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-steelbook-premium-edition-is-up-for-preorder-comes-with-five-day-early-access/1100-6527801/" data-ref-id="1100-6527801">Avowed preorder guide</a> to learn more about its various editions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-set-to-launch-on-steam-despite-playstation-pulling-it-from-store<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Grand Taking Ages, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> "parody" that uses AI artwork and voice acting, has done enough to convince Valve it should launch on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
That's despite Sony recently stepping in to remove a PS5 version of the project set to launch on the PlayStation Store.
</p>
<p>
Originally titled Grand Taking Ages 6, the now re-named game has a July 2025 release date on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/">Steam</a>, and there's fresh detail on what the game actually is. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam">IGN</a>, developer Violarte said Grand Taking Ages would be a management simulator, where players attempt to run a game developer. (Presumably you are not rewarded for getting booted off the store of a major console manufacturer.)
</p>
<p>
Adjustments have been made in order to convince Steam owner Valve that Grand Taking Ages is actually a legitimate project, with changes to the game's logo and presentation "to clearly differentiate the game" from Rockstar's own GTA 6.

According to Violarte, its project was taken down by Sony despite the defence that it was clearly a parody. Indeed, the developer suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">the recent Grand Theft Hamlet project</a> - a film in which a production of Shakespeare's classic play is performed within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> - proved just this.
</p><p>
"We genuinely believe that, with the recent updates, Grand Taking Ages is now ready to be relisted on the PlayStation Store," Violarte concluded, saying it had requested Sony now reinstate the game's store page. "We strongly believe that there will be no issues with Sony this time, given the adjustments we've implemented."

Eurogamer has contacted Sony for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unlike what has been rumored for a while, Jill Valentine won't play a major role in Resident Evil 9, according to a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, Dusk Golem commented on the rumors that have been circulating online on the yet-to-be-announced new entry in the survival-horror series, saying that Jill will not play a major role in the game, and the current hospital rumor that's circulating online is completely false, as are <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vast majority of rumors</a> circulating on the game. The information provided by the leaker is also fresh, as they have been updated on things more recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wait for actual RE9 news, nearly every RE9 rumor that's been floated around has been bullshit.</p>
<p>What's not bullshit is Silent Hill f did get rated in Korea today, and that's exciting.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1882066902023086459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides working on Resident Evil 9, CAPCOM is also continuing work on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil Zero Remake</a>, which, much like the ninth main entry in the series, has also yet to be officially confirmed. The development of this remake saw a big change in the people involved, but development is still proceeding, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-new-resident-evil-9-details-surface.1027635/post-134699286">according to the insider, </a>so there's plenty for fans of the series to look forward to.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Resident Evil series is the Resident Evil 4 remake, which was launched in 2023. The remake is extremely faithful to the original, if not a little too much, as Nathan highlighted in his review. The game is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 4 was the ultimate test of CAPCOM remake skills, and unfortunately, they buckled a bit under the pressure. The game suffers from minor mechanical issues and doesn’t reinvent or elevate the original material as boldly as some might have hoped it would. That said, CAPCOM hasn’t broken anything either as this is still a fun, inventive thrill ride that has been brought up to modern technical standards in striking fashion. The new Resident Evil 4 is well worth it for fans of the series, just keep your hopes slightly in check and you won’t be spin-kicked by inflated expectations.</em></p>

			<p>The multiplayer games lists are always different since they necessarily intermingle with other genres. Looking at what's coming from the releases scheduled for the calendar year 2025, we have a mix of action, RPG, Soulslike, shooter, and more. Here's the five titles that stand out the most before their respective releases.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Monster-Hunter-Wilds.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Most of the early multiplayer games action this year will likely kick off with CAPCOM's Monster Hunter Wilds. Like Borderlands 4, it's a game that you can absolutely complete solo, but it's just that much more fun when played with friends. Like in the massively successful Monster Hunter World, players may launch a flare to ask for help from other players in the middle of a monster hunt. The much larger zones and dynamically shifting weather should make multiplayer sessions even more exciting in the new title. Lobbies will also get a significant increase in the maximum player count, supporting <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lobbies-100-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 100 players at once</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dune-awakening-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Dune Awakening (Q1 2025 PC, Consoles Later)</h2>
<p>Long before the two Dune movies were released in theaters, Funcom secured the license to develop games based on the franchise. They have since published the real-time strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-spice-wars-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Spice Wars</a> (developed by Shiro Games), but the project they've really focused on is Dune Awakening. The studio is trying to funnel all its prior expertise in the MMORPG (Anarchy Online, Age of Conan, The Secret World) and survival (Conan Exiles) genres into a hybrid game that brings out the best of both in the context of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Yes, players will have to survive the hazards of the desert planet, but there's also plenty of social play, where clans can be created and then affiliated with one of the major houses (Atreides or Harkonnen, to begin with). The key to everything will, of course, be the spice. Harvesting it will bring great rewards, as it can be traded or even consumed to gain powers (at the risk of addiction), but players will have to contend with other clans to secure the harvest - all the while trying not to rouse the dreaded sandworm. Dune Awakening is undoubtedly one of the most promising multiplayer games on this list, and it's also the closest to release. Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to launch it in the first quarter on PC</a>, with console versions to follow. For more info, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom Q&amp;A with the developers</a>, and stay tuned for further coverage in the coming weeks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BL4-The-Game-Awards.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Borderlands 4 (TBA 2025 PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Let's face it - Borderlands fans may have fun with the single player, but the reason the franchise became popular in the first place was the chaotic cooperative multiplayer action. After all, any loot-based game gets instantly more addictive when you're playing with friends with whom to boast about the latest legendary drop you got after a crazy boss fight.</p>
<p>Gearbox hasn't shared specific multiplayer info for this new installment, but the confirmed presence of new tools like the grappling hook and the seamless zones will certainly bolster the cooperative portion of the game even further.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring Nightreign (TBA 2025 PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>FromSoftware caught everyone by surprise with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of Elden Ring Nightreign</a> at The Game Awards 2024. Most people were betting on an immediate sequel to the massively successful Elden Ring, but the Japanese studio is first working on this intriguing spin-off. Based on what they've shared, it seems like they will be mixing elements from various genres, including survival and even Battle Royale (the shrinking map, specifically), to create an entirely new multiplayer experience. Players will have to survive for three in-game days before facing a final boss to end the session.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PromoNewN1.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>PIONER (TBA 2025 on PC, Consoles Later)</h2>
<p>The upcoming MMOFPS by GFA Games was already featured in last year's most anticipated multiplayer games list. Now, though, it seems we are closer than ever to the release of PIONER, following the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise</a> to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a> at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>The premise of a STALKER-like online shared world where players can cooperate to create clans, fight in PvE raids, and even compete in PvP areas, remains incredibly enticing. We'll have to evaluate the quality of the execution, of course. Hopefully, it won't be long until we get to play it.</p>

<p>Ted Price, founder and president of Insomniac Games, is retiring from the company he started in 1994. The news comes via an <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on Sony’s website.</p>



<p>Price is set to leave his position in March after 31 years.</p>



<p>“I actually made this decision last year,” he said. “For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades.”</p>



<p>With Price leaving the company, Insomniac Games will be lead by three new Co-Studio heads: Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang.</p>



<p>“I believe strongly that for us to continue our success, we need leaders at the top who are intimately familiar with how we do things, leaders who have helped build our culture and our processes, and who have earned people’s trust,” Price said.</p>



<p>“There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.”</p>



<p>In a statement on the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, Dezern, Schneider, and Huang expressed gratitude for the opportunity to head the studio moving forward.</p>



<p>“Our shared intention is to preserve what has made Insomniac special for 30-plus years while exploring how we can strategically evolve to succeed for decades to come,” they said. “We’ll continue prioritizing our studio culture, built around transparency and collaboration. We strive for a workplace where employees can do the best work of their careers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>First started in 1994 as Xtreme Software, Insomniac Games is known for franchises such as Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and, more recently, the Marvel Spider-Man games. The studio is currently working on a number of projects, including Marvel’s Wolverine. Insomniac was acquired by Sony in 2019.</p>

            <p>
Ted Price, the founder and CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> and Marvel's Spider-Man developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, has announced his retirement from the games industry, saying he "felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team."
</p>
<p>
Price founded Insomniac (then known as Xtreme Software) in 1994, and the studio released its debut title - first-person shooter Disruptor - two years later. Soon after, the studio embarked on a run of releases that would cement its position in the video game hall of fame, establishing beloved franchises including Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance.
</p>
<p>
Insomniac's close relationship with PlayStation eventually led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-has-bought-spider-man-developer-insomniac-games">Sony's acquisition of the studio in 2019</a>, after which it saw continued success across three Marvel's Spider-Man games.

Now though, after 30 years steering Insomniac, founder and CEO Ted Price is stepping down. "After having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games," he <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/">wrote on the Sony Interactive website</a>, "I'll be retiring from the industry at the end of March."
</p>
<p>
"I actually made this decision last year," Price continued. "For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team."
</p>
<p>
Price added a "succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades" has been in the works for some time. As a result, Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/">been announced as Insomniac Games' new co-studio heads</a>.
</p><p>
"I want to thank every Insomniac for having a positive and lasting impact on my life," Price concluded. "Working side by side...for so many years has been a gift that I'll cherish for the rest of my days. I also want to thank our fans who, for three decades, have shared their enthusiasm, their encouragement and their support - inspiring us to take every game farther than the last. We do what we do for you. And I can assure you that we won't be slowing down."
</p>
<p>
Insomniac is currently developing Marvel's Wolverine, which still doesn't have a release date despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-reportedly-due-2025-darker-than-spider-man">previous reports it was targeting 2025</a>. Footage of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">unannounced live-service Spider-Man game</a> also surfaced last year following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-leak-lays-bare-spider-man-developer-insomniacs-plans-for-the-next-decade">major security breach</a> - but it's believed that project, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">host of other first-party PlayStation live-service titles</a>, is now cancelled.

			<p>Despite the high minimum system requirements of the PC version, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is playable on Steam Deck, although with some major compromises in terms of frame rate and image quality.</p>
<p>As highlighted in a new review by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SteamDeckHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck HQ</a>, the second entry in the Remake trilogy which launches tomorrow on PC, is more than playable on Steam Deck, keeping a 30 FPS framerate throughout the game, which is stable even in the more demanding open areas of the game. Unfortunately, plenty of compromises had to be made to keep this relatively solid 30 frames per second framerate, as dynamic resolution scaling had to be enabled, which leads to a blurry image here and there and some ghosting. Framerate in towns with a lot of NPCs is also unstable, dropping into the 20s range depending on the city, and one of the biggest issues seen in the PlayStation 5 version, the aggressive pop-in in the open areas, is also present on Steam Deck. Still, everything considered, it is definitely impressive to see Final Fantasy VII Rebirth run as well as it does on the handheld system.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on PC tomorrow, January 23rd. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-ceo-founder-ted-price-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After more than 30 years with the company, Insomniac Games CEO and founder Ted Price is stepping down. His role will be filled by three of the studio's executives, who are stepping up as co-studio heads.</p>

<p>In a Sony <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Price says he's retiring from the industry as a whole rather than moving on to new opportunities. He says he's leaving the studio in "one of the strongest positions we've experienced in years", and that he's put a succession plan in place that will provide "continuity, stability, and strong leadership".</p>

<p>To that end, three execs will be stepping up to fill Price's shoes: marketing and brand head Ryan Schneider, finance head and CFO Jen Huang, and head of creative Chad Dezern. It's not clear whether they'll also continue those roles in addition to heading up Insomniac.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-insomniac-games.jpg?itok=r4AAaSQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-insomniac-games.jpg?itok=c4ZUgwac 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Insomniac's most recent game is&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Schneider, Huang, and Dezern share their vision for Insomniac, which, it turns out, is "to preserve what has made Insomniac special for 30-plus years", although they do also say they're looking for ways to "strategically evolve to succeed for decades to come".</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like a great deal is going to change in an operational sense with Price's stepping down. It's likely that you'll notice the difference far more if you're an Insomniac employee than if you're a fan of their games.</p>

<p>The three do eulogize Price's career in a rather touching way, though, calling him "not just our leader" but also "our longtime friend" and praising his "ability to inspire everyone around him to grow".</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for that one yet, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things Insomniac Games.</p>

I wanted to open even more packs, OK!? Was it worth it? No! Of course not! But I got to watch the little ripping animation so many times, and the dopamine feedback loop is real. But I’ve spent maybe $50 total? With that, I’ve pulled a total of 1,476 cards.</p><p>Of course, Hajimesyacho is playing with YouTube money. He has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@hajimesyacho/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@hajimesyacho/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15.5 million subscribers on his channel</a></span>, with regular viewing numbers in the seven digits, so he’s spending money to make money. (Why he’s playing in French, I have no idea.) It’s the sort of goof you can do in that situation. But it also really underlines just how ridiculous the spending limits are on the game.</p><p>I go back and forth on this subject—catch me in an hour and I might have changed my mind—but when something is so gambling-adjacent, I feel like there should at the very least be a way to set personal spending limits within the app. It’s currently possible to spend $38,235 per year opening packs in <em>Pocket,</em> and I’m not entirely convinced that half the average U.S. salary is the amount Pokémon should be willing to take off any one customer. And to be clear, this is how much you can spend just opening packs—you can keep on buying more Gold if you want to.</p><p>Obviously, there’s no way to financially benefit from playing <em>PTCG Pocket</em>, so at least it stops short of having any of the real-world game’s resale market. Even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-rules-gold-cards-date-1851741957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-rules-gold-cards-date-1851741957">when trading finally arrives this month</a></span>, it can’t be converted to cash via third-party apps or the like. But there’s still this residual ickiness given how the more packs you buy, the better chance you have of pulling the ultra rare cards, and believe me, the pull is strong. There are these pretty things just out of your reach, and if you only pay a <em>bit more</em>, they could be yours!</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">You can fully enjoy the mobile game without ever spending a penny</a></span>, but obviously The Pokémon Company doesn’t want you to. Although let me attest, while I’ve been weak a couple of times, I’ve still managed to pull a pretty impressive array of very  pretty cards, mostly on the daily grind.</p><p>In fact, given we’re learning that so many seemingly random elements in the game are in fact not (the pack you get from the carousel seems to be pre-determined, and it’s now widely believed that Wonder Picks are equally decided for you), I’m noticing that in the last few days I’ve been very coincidentally suddenly filling in a whole bunch of conspicuous gaps in my Genetic Apex Pokédex. And yes, it could just be random fortune, but there sure have been a lot of them showing up. And yay! But also, hmmmm.</p><p>Anyway, point is, don’t be like Hajimesyacho, unless you, like Hajimesyacho, have more money than you know how to spend. Maybe open a couple of packs a day and then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://immigrantjustice.salsalabs.org/donatefy2025/index.html?utm_content=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://immigrantjustice.salsalabs.org/donatefy2025/index.html?utm_content=PANTHEON_STRIPPED" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give some money to charity</a></span>?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new 3D Mario and A Legend of Zelda remake are coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025. At least, that’s according to one store listing online.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">popular e-tailer Newegg</a>, the product description for a $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card mentions a number of games coming in 2025. According to that description, which you can see below, 2025 will feature “Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, Pokemon Legends: Z-A”.</p>







<p>A new Mario Kart was already confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-9-could-feature-new-24-player-races/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the reveal trailer</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2. A new 3D Mario and A Legend of Zelda Remake have been rumored and expected, but there’s been nothing in the form of a confirmation from Nintendo. While this can’t be viewed as a confirmation, either, it’s still something from a major storefront.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Newegg and Nintendo regarding the store posting and its accuracy. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly as well as posted on Insider Gaming’s social media channels. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially revealed</a> on January 16. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full Nintendo Direct</a> on the new system is set to air on April 2, which is expected to reveal full specs, pricing, release date, and more. There are also rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major AAA games</a> coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the system</a>, though it’s unknown if any will be announced during the Nintendo Direct.</p>

                <p>Big changes are taking place at Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games, and with new leaders stepping in to take over the studio, the team is once again interested in bringing some of its video game properties to the big screen.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Insomniac's new co-studio head Ryan Schneider looked back on the studio's first foray into Hollywood--2016's Ratchet and Clank--and how Insomniac got an "early start" on game-to-screen adaptations at the time.</p><p>"I think back to the Ratchet and Clank film from several years ago," Schneider said. "And we kind of got an early start on that. So, of course, we're interested in that kind of thing.
