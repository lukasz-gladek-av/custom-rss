            <p>Citizen Sleeper 2 is coming in early 2025, publishers Fellow Traveller have announced, and it's also going to be releasing on PlayStation 5 and Switch alongside the already confirmed Xbox Series S/X, Game Pass and PC versions. </p>
<p>Unveiled at tonight's PC Gaming Show during its first proper gameplay trailer, Citizen Sleeper 2 will see you wake up in the body of a brand-new Sleeper android who's fighting for survival out on the Starward Belt on the edge of the Helion System. We've known for a while that Citizen Sleeper 2 is going to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-update-reveals-first-new-location-game-pass-release">much bigger game</a> than the original, but tonight's trailer gave us a taste of just how large the Belt actually is, as it will have its own navigable map screen, along with lots of different space ports and unique locations to visit along the way.  </p>

<p>We also get to see some of the characters we'll be meeting when we get there. Unlike the first game, though, they'll be joining your crew as valuable team mates here, and will live alongside you in your ship as you travel between locations. You'll also be able to draw on their unique skills and character traits when taking on big contract jobs, too, as each crew member you recruit will have their own set of dice rolls to use to help you complete tasks and get the job done.  </p>
<p>Contracts will take place in dedicated locations, too, far away from the hustle and bustle of the spaceports where you'll have heard about them in the first place. As such, you'll need to prepare accordingly before you take one on, as they can quickly blow up in your face (literally, judging by the gameplay trailer) if you attempt them before you're ready. </p>
<p>There looks to be plenty of double-crossing and wavering loyalities to navigate, however, and making peace with all of your newfound stablemates will form a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-is-real-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">big part of Citizen Sleeper 2's underlying story</a>. </p>
<p>Beyond these new additions, Citizen Sleeper 2 will no doubt feel very familiar to returning players. It's still chock full of the same tabletop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-rpgs">RPG</a> inspirations that defined the original game, and you'll still be rolling plenty of dice to determine the outcome of your actions. </p>
<p>Of course, we already know that you won't be dependent on keeping your health topped up with stabiliser shots in this sequel, but there are new systems at play here that you'll need to keep an eye on instead. It's easy to miss from the trailer, but Stress looks to play an important role in Citizen Sleeper 2, and managing this (both across yourself and your growing number of crew members) will no doubt prove to be quite the balancing act when it launches early next year.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/2024/6/9/24173143/generation-exile-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7p8OEf">Steam is flooded with city builders right now (I’m playing <em>Fabledom</em>, for instance), and most of them are relatively similar. Which is why, for me, the excitement of starting a new city builder comes in the form of new art styles, interesting combat mechanics, and compelling stories. But former Klei Entertainment developer Nel Anderson’s new company, <a href="https://sonderluststudios.com/">Sonderlust Studios</a>, is bringing novelty to the genre with its first game, <em>Generation Exile</em>, announced with a trailer on Sunday.</p>
<p id="Qghi8g"><em>Generation Exile</em> is a pretty city builder like any other, but this one has a distinctly anti-colonialist, environmentally sound aspect: Rather than bore into your new land for resources, ultimately destroying what it once was, <em>Exile</em> challenges players to use only the resources they had with them when they left their old world in the last-ever generation ship.  That includes water, food, and even air. Gameplay will also include turn-based combat as well as the typical tasks of creating abodes and amenities, amassing resources, and keeping your residents content.</p>

<p id="ES1gil">Over email, Anderson, who works as Sonderlust’s creative director, aptly explained to Polygon what the game’s trying to do: Lots of city builders, he explained, are “fundamentally extractive and reward — if not demand — growing infinitely.” That means in order to continue in the game, you have to continuously bore into the earth, cut down trees, mine caves, etc. <em>Generation Exile</em>, on the other hand, pushes players to work in tandem with the new environment.</p>
<p id="Aqt8Vc">“Rather than simply ‘number get bigger’ we wanted to make the problem-solving space more about seeking balance,” Anderson said. “Rather than pulling more raw materials out of the ground for refinement, progress might instead look like developing a series of anaerobic lagoons that transform the biological waste (that must be stored and managed regardless) into nutrients for growing food or source crops for bioplastics.”</p>
<p id="MJH2mf">Time will move ultra-fast to account for several generations of your in-game society, which is comprised of procedurally-generated characters so no two games are the same. In fact, the generation of new maps and characters is a major part of how Sonderlust’s developers plan to accomplish that balance.</p>
<p id="gd0HRP">“While the player of course interacts with the map portion of the game from a familiar birds eye-ish viewpoint, they aren’t some disembodied force of civic will or an otherwise nameless and uncharacterized overseer,” Anderson said. Instead, player characters will have reputations and bespoke interactions with NPCs “triggered procedurally in reaction to the game’s state and decisions the player has made.”</p>
<p id="VLWjXK">The premise is enough to pique my interest, but the lineup of devs and designers is even more impressive. Sonderlust is also calling in its chief operating officer, Karla Zimonja, co-creator of <em>Gone Home</em>, and some developers who worked on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23837019/baldurs-gate-3-review-dungeons-dragons"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/26/17164878/far-cry-5-review-ps4-pc-xbox-one"><em>Far Cry 5</em></a><em>. </em>As for sound design, Ben Prunty from <em>Into the Breach </em>will collaborate with the audio team from <em>Celeste</em>, Power Up Audio.</p>

<p id="TnahkF">The early looks at the game are moody in a late-summer-afternoon type way, with an intriguing honeycomb city structure and lots of overgrown ’50s-looking buildings. The UI also looks modern (and <em>big enough to read</em>, ahem) — a welcome change from your average city builder. </p>
<p id="XjAoyD">“The art style of Generation Exile was inspired in part by fauvism,” said Pier-Olivier Desbiens, 3D environment artist for Sonderlust Studios. “It’s a polygonal stab at the bold colors &amp; flat strokes of the movement, with a heavy emphasis on simplifying shapes and objects so only the essential remains. The main goal was to create a world that feels familiar yet mysterious through the use of unusual, saturated color palettes.”</p>
<p id="KEdiy3"><em>Generation Exile</em> doesn’t have a release date yet. When it’s released, it’ll be available on Steam and other consoles to be announced. </p>

<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches, everyone starts from scratch. That means load-outs, skins, weapons, and gear won’t carry forward from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 to Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>“We want to make sure that everybody starts fresh, together, as we move into an all-new experience with the launch of&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-worldwide-reveal-announcement#Carry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision said</a>. “Allowing everyone to experience the&nbsp;Black Ops&nbsp;universe the way it’s meant to be played, learning the era-specific weapons and gear, learning the gameplay innovations like Omnimovement, and keeping that signature&nbsp;Black Ops&nbsp;style is important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Therefore,&nbsp;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare®&nbsp;II&nbsp;and&nbsp;Modern Warfare III&nbsp;content will not carry forward to the&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;Premium experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be one exception to the rule, however. The Black Ops 6 Vault Edition Woods Operator Pack that includes the Classic Woods Operator Skin will be available in Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 6. Also, Warzone players will still get Carry Forward content for Season 1 of the next game including content from Modern Warfare 2, 3, and Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Game Pass.</p>

<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches in October, players will be required to be online at all times no matter what they want to play. That means even playing the campaign requires an internet connection.</p>



<p>“To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes,” Activision says. </p>



<p>“This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign. If you’re on a console, Campaign can be played without a premium subscription service such as Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus.”</p>







<p>With the need to always be online, that means those in areas with poor network infrastructure, or those who may lose connection for whatever reason, won’t be able to play any aspect of the game.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. It will also be the first Call of Duty game to come to Xbox Game Pass on Day 1.</p>

That’s for Xbox Series X and S, with sizes for the game on other platforms yet to be announced. While Call of Duty players are well used to huge install footprints for games in the series, and indeed the shooter franchise is now infamous for how much hard drive space it takes up, Black Ops 6 appears to beat them all.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Black Ops 6 will sit within Call of Duty HQ, Activision’s game launcher for all the current Call of Duty experiences, so it remains to be seen exactly how the install size will break down once the game is fully downloaded. It may be the case that this 309.85 GB is a 'worst case scenario' for Black Ops 6 if the other Call of Duty games are also installed, or indeed includes battle royale Warzone. IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p>Call of Duty lets players reduce its overall footprint somewhat by picking and choosing which parts of the game are installed. However, it seems clear that if you want the full fat Black Ops 6 experience on the go, complete with campaign, multiplayer, and zombies, you’re going to need to make a significant amount of room to pack it all in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Microsoft fully unveiled Black Ops 6 during its Xbox Games Showcase and subsequent Call of Duty Direct. We now know Black Ops 6 acts as a “fresh start for everyone,” which means <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-does-not-carry-forward-into-black-ops-6">Modern Warfare 2 and 3 content does not carry forward into the game</a>. Black Ops 6 content will, however, carry into Warzone.</p><p>Black Ops 6 is set in the early 1990s after the events of Black Ops Cold War and tied to the 1980s flashbacks in 2012’s Black Ops 2. Multiplayer launches with 16 new maps, including 12 core 6v6 maps, and four smaller Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6.</p><p>For more details, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-new-omnimovement-turns-call-of-duty-into-max-payne"><u>everything we know about Call of Duty Black Ops 6</u></a>, including its brand new movement systems.

They are on the run from the corporation that made them and the gang that seeks to control them. To stay ahead of their pursuers, the player will have to commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as they seek to build a future for themselves.</p><p>Your crew starts with Serafin, your fellow escapee and a rock-solid pilot. But you’ll need scrappers, engineers and all sorts to take on the contracts that’ll keep you flying. Contracts take place far from the bars and shops of the Belt’s many hubs, and these high-risk jobs each have their own challenges, where failure is just a few bad dice rolls away, so you’ll want to make sure you pick the right crew for work.</p><p>Players will choose a class, configure their skills and assemble their crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Their future depends on the roll of a dice, as they make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of <em><a title="Games > Citizen Sleeper [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a></em>, the sequel is a deep narrative RPG that will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As previously revealed in last year’s animated trailer, this is a different Sleeper to the one you play in the original game. Soon after escaping from their corporate overlords, this Sleeper fell under the control of a local <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal gang and its leader, Laine. After a desperate attempt to free themselves from servitude, they’re on the run again – this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on their head, and no memory of their past.</p><p>Revealed today are details of the brand new and expanded gameplay elements, building on the original’s compelling table-top RPG-inspired systems…</p><p><strong>Reboot / Rebuild / Repair</strong></p><p>Nothing in the Belt ever runs smooth, including the artificial body of a Sleeper. <em>Citizen Sleeper</em>‘s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Players will have to manage their stress or risk taking damage to their dice. They’ll also have to deal with glitches as they accrue in their system.</p><p><strong>Do the Job, Get Paid</strong></p><p>Contracts offer a new kind of focused, tactical gameplay to the <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> experience. Players will need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle high-risk/high-reward jobs – but they’ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.</p><p><strong>Push Your Luck</strong></p><p>Each character class now has a unique “Push” ability, which can help players turn the tide of a difficult job or send them into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when they choose to use it. Push skills are upgradable and customizable, and include abilities like dice rerolls or single die augments. With the addition of Push, each class in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> will offer different tactical possibilities.</p><p><strong>Navigate the Belt</strong></p><p>The Starward Belt offers a bigger, more varied world than the original game. Instead of living on a single station, players will chart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as they see fit. A living world, the Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it’s up to players to decide which locations and stories deserve their time and resources.</p><p><strong>Choose Your Future</strong></p><p>Player choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow players to express their class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask them to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you!</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Revealed during today's PC Gaming Show,&nbsp; Ancient Forge is launching a Kickstarter for Hotel Galactic next month on July 9 that will run through the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Hotel Galactic, players are tasked with restoring a rundown cosmic hotel drifting amongst the stars to its former glory. "Entice alien guests from around the galaxy by dreaming up beautifully quirky designs," a press release reads. "Craft elegant guest rooms, grand dining halls, and other rooms crucial to keep guests satisfied during their stay. Purchase furniture from visiting merchants or build them from scratch using wood, metal, and other materials."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Hotel Galactic reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5PjZNMq6Do" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Elsewhere in the game, you can feed guests by cooking meals created by berries, plants, and cosmic ingredients scattered "throughout the great beyond." You can experiment with new dishes, cater to guests' "sophisticated palates," and perfect recipes for even the pickiest of eaters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must also hire and manage staff to keep the hotel running at its best, and you do so by dragging and dropping workers around the hotel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outside of that, you can "take a reprieve from managing a hotel by exploring an underground complex within the floating island," according to a press release. "Become a part of the local ecosystem by growing plants in the hotel's backyard and raising myriad livestock. Welcome eccentric, alien travelers from across the galaxy, and run the next five-start inn featuring a charming soundtrack and Studio Ghibli-inspired visuals."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some screenshots from Hotel Galactic</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ancient Forge plans to launch Hotel Galactic on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC sometime in the future. The game's Kickstarter campaign begins on July 9 and runs through July 30. The company says that with each milestone achieved, it promises to deliver new content, such as unannounced in-game mechanics, new VIP guests, and more.&nbsp;</p>

Developed by Polaris Team, an offshoot of Variable State, which is the studio behind 2021's Last Stop and 2016's Virginia, the developer formally unveiled Polaris during today's&nbsp;<em>IGN Live&nbsp;</em>showcase with a cinematic trailer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the trailer, we get a glimpse of this sci-fi world, which takes place in a region of space overtaken by a ruthless force known simply as the Regime. In the game, players must reclaim their homeworlds and bring every enemy stronghold down.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the game's first look in the Polaris reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/esYJY5iSJHQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Polaris Team says, "All in-game structures – installed by the Regime, but not yet inhabited by their indoctrinated citizens – can be crushed, blown apart, and otherwise annihilated over the course of every match, and the same is true of the natural environments and terrain upon which they've been constructed."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players control superpowered freedom fighters who utilize guerrilla tactics to take back their territory while flying through dynamic open levels, destroying enemy infrastructure, and unearthing coveted mysteries that drive the Regime's war of conquest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Since I first played Bullfrog's Syndicate Wars, I've always dreamed of working on a game that featured hi-tech squads of futuristic soldiers, causing mayhem and destruction in an original sci-fi setting," Polaris Team creative director Jonathan Burroughs writes in a press release. "Sprinkle in a deep appreciation for the Halo series – particularly its blend of on-foot and in-vehicle co-op action – and you can begin to get a sense of what we hope to achieve with Polaris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're only a small and scrappy team of 11 people, but have been plugging away at this project since early 2023. Aided by the tools and technologies of Unreal Engine 5, Polaris Team has built a tight 4-player PvE combat game with a dynamic, destructible environment set in our own unique sci-fi universe. With the release date arriving later this year, the team and I couldn’t be more excited to share Polaris with players worldwide!”</p>

<p><strong>Here are some Polaris screenshots to check out</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polaris is due out on PC via Steam sometime this year. You can sign up for a beta playtest starting today.&nbsp;</p>

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will require a "continuous internet connection" - even when you're playing its campaign mode. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions">blog post</a> published by Activision today, the publisher advises that the Cold War-set shooter uses "texture streaming across all game modes".
</p>
<p>
"This means you'll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign," Activision wrote.

<p>
Why does Call of Duty require the internet to stream textures? Activision's answer is two-fold, in that it allows "the highest-quality visuals" while also "reducing the game's overall storage space on your hard drive". 
</p>
<p>It seems Call of Duty's typically meaty hard drive footprints are at least partly to blame - and indeed, Xbox's store page for the game reveals Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's install size is an eye-watering 309.85 GB. </p>
<p>
All of which begs the question - how big would it have been without always-online texture streaming? And also, is keeping your console always online even just to play Campaign a better alternative?
</p>
<p>
Other details mentioned by Activision include that the game's Campaign can, at least, be played without an online subscription service, such as Game Pass Core (formerly Xbox Live Gold) or PlayStation Plus. 
</p>
<p>
Split-screen gameplay will also be supported - but not on all consoles. Instead, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 will allow you share a screen with a second player, but Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will not - "to ensure performance integrity".

Grainy, VHS-esque visuals, narrative-driven gameplay, and simplistic puzzles are reminiscent of early PlayStation horror titles or point-and-click PC mysteries, and the two lead characters (Vivian and Amy) look like they’d be hanging out near the fountain at your local mall, fishnet top and pentagram t-shirt included.<br></p><div data-video-id="191253" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Evil West Looks Like Good, Old-Fashioned, Vampire-Punching Fun" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="191253,196447,191188" data-current="191253"><div><p>Evil West Looks Like Good, Old-Fashioned, Vampire-Punching Fun</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191253/191253_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191253/191253_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191253/191253_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191253/191253_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17262.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Blumhouse, the horror production studio that announced it’s delving into games in a big way by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blumhouse-horror-games-summer-game-fest-1851527353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blumhouse-horror-games-summer-game-fest-1851527353">showing off five different games</a></span> during the 2024 Summer Game Fest presentation, noticed how cool <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> was on Steam last year and offered the two-person development team (Cozy Game Pals) an opportunity to expand it. So, they pulled it from Valve’s marketplace to flesh it out even further, and will release it in full later this year. I got a chance to play a little slice of the demo at Summer Game Fest, and it left an incredible impression, one that’s lingering even as I head to other hands-on appointments.<br></p><p><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> is set in a school at night—a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_en&amp;oq=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE4MzFqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_en&amp;oq=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE4MzFqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liminal space straight out of a 4Chan creepypasta</a></span> whose creepiness is only elevated by the game’s VHS grain filter. Vivian and Amy have broken into the school to get a Ouija board out of a locked case in the library while a thunderstorm rages outside (I noticed that the sounds of the storm grow louder as you walk closer to the library’s windows, a tiny little detail that was a delight to discover). You have to hide from the school’s security cameras (<em>Fear the Spotlight</em> has very basic movement mechanics: walk, jog, crouch) and gather things to help facilitate your seance much like you might in a <em>Resident Evil</em> game: to get the key for the display case you need to track down a keycard to get into the librarian’s office.<br></p><p>As the girls sit down to start their séance, you’ve got to light the candles on your side of the table with a box of matches, a small moment that offers an incredibly satisfying tactility.  But naturally, as soon as Vivian and Amy begin to convene with the dead, things go awry—the candles blow out, Amy disappears, a fire breaks out. The quiet, slow-burn anxiety <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> was brewing for the first two-thirds of my hands-on immediately shifts into heart-pounding fear, as you have to run through the library to escape the fire and end up sprinting through a bizarre tear in the fabric of reality.<br></p><p>When my brief hands-on ended, I turned to the duo dev team and simply said, “Fuck yeah.”<br></p><p><em>Fear The Spotlight</em> is shaping up to be a brilliant melding of old and new, a clear marker of Blumhouse’s excellent taste. It’ll relaunch later in 2024 for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will launch day one into Game Pass on 25th October 2024, but with four different versions of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, Microsoft has given <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Pass">a handy explainer</a> for what version you should subscribe to in order to get access to what for Xbox and PC gamers.</p>
<p>You can obviously buy the game outright as well – and PlayStation gamers will have this as the only option – but Xbox and PC gamers could see Game Pass as a more cost effective way to get into Black Ops 6 at launch.</p>


<p>Essentially, Game Pass Ultimate is what you want for the full experience on console, as it grants access to both the library of games and online gaming, but if you only game on PC, you can just stick with Game Pass PC as multiplayer is not tied to a subscription. Game Pass Console doesn’t include online gaming access, so it’s Black Ops 6campaign only, and Game Pass Core has a limited game library but does grant online console multiplayer, so is required for people buying the game on Xbox still.</p>
<p>Here’s Microsoft’s breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Game Pass Ultimate: </b>This offers the most flexibility as it allows you to play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign as well as the Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles, and on PC. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will have access to the Digital Cross-Gen Bundle on Xbox consoles and the Standard Edition on PC Microsoft Store.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass PC: </b>Play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign as well as Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on your PC. Game Pass PC subscribers will have access to the Standard Edition on PC Microsoft Store.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass Console: </b>Play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign only on your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles. Online console multiplayer access (sold separately) is required to play the Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles. Game Pass Console subscribers would need to upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate or additionally subscribe to Game Pass Core (sold separately) to access these modes. Game Pass Console subscribers will have access to the Digital Cross-Gen Bundle on Xbox consoles.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass Core: </b>Game Pass Core includes online console multiplayer access, which is required to play <i>Black Ops 6 </i>online modes (Multiplayer and Zombies) on Xbox consoles, but does not qualify you to access the full game. Also note that all of the benefits of Game Pass Core are included in the Game Pass Ultimate plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone subscribing to Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console before 25th October you can also snag two preorder benefits: Woods Operator Pack and Open Beta Early Access.</p>

<p>COD Black Ops 6 was given a full reveal during the Xbox Games Showcase today with a Black Ops 6 Direct following on and diving deep into core gameplay changes and revealing new details for both multiplayer and zombies. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/cod-black-ops-6-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Check all those details here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-look-at-assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Tonight's Xbox Showcase brought us a first glance at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> gameplay, and a better look at its feudal Japanese world. 
</p>
<p>
A fresh trailer for Ubisoft Quebec's upcoming action RPG began with quick scenes showing the changing of the seasons - the ubiquitous Japanese blossom of spring, snow in winter, torrential rain on a muddy battlefield full of corpses.
</p>
<p>
Next we saw shinobi protagonist Naoe yanking enemies down into the long grass like raptors picking off tourists in Jurassic Park, then quick shots of her performing the Assassin's Creed series' trademark rooftop parkour, aided by a grapple rope. You also now appear to be able to peer around corners.
</p>

<p>
Exactly a minute in, the trailer switches to show Shadows' samurai hero Yasuke, stomping through scenery then turning another set of enemies into kebabs on his shiny sword. 
</p>
<p>
The trailer concludes with quick shots of both Naoe and Yasuke in combat - the former extinguishing lanterns to strike in the dark, the latter slicing necks as easily as bamboo.
</p>
<p>
A final couple of shots appear to show a black and white (don't call it Kurosawa Mode) version of the game where the only colour on-screen is the claret red of blood. Is this going to be a visual option players can toggle on? 
</p>
<p>
An extended look at Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay is set to arrive tomorrow, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">as part of Ubisoft Forward</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-does-not-carry-forward-into-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It's a fresh start for everyone."</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> acts as a “fresh start for everyone,” developer Treyarch has confirmed.</p><p>2023's Modern Warfare 3 carried forward content from Modern Warfare 2 into the game. However, in Black Ops 6, fully revealed during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase</a> and Call of Duty Direct, only Black Ops 6 content will be available to use across Multiplayer and Zombies.</p><p>In an interview with IGN, Miles Leslie, associate creative director at Treyarch, said Black Ops 6 is “a fresh start.” This means that when Black Ops 6 comes out in October, players will not be playing Multiplayer and Zombies modes in the many and varied skins they’ve already bought for Modern Warfare 3 and Modern Warfare 2. Yes, that means you don't have to worry about killer clowns and Warhammer 40,000 soldiers ruining that early 90s look and feel.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It also means you won't see operators from the Modern Warfare sub-brand, which is currently set years after the events of Black Ops 6, confusing matters.</p><p>“So, day one, you won't be running around with any of those skins, so that it doesn't break that immersion in that narrative we want,” Leslie explained. “Now, of course, we're going to add those things into post-launch. We know players like those stuff, and then we'll find really cool things that tie to Black Ops lore and also new exciting stuff as well.”</p><p>There is one exception to this rule: the Black Ops 6 Vault Edition Woods Operator Pack preorder benefit. It is currently available in Modern Warfare 3 and will carry forward into Black Ops 6, Activision said.</p><p>When Modern Warfare 3 launched last year, some players complained that it was cluttered with fully leveled weapons carried forward from Modern Warfare 2. On the other hand, some players said they appreciated the fact the money they'd spent on content for Modern Warfare 2 did not go to waste just a year later.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Activision further explained the decision in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. Here's the statement:</p><blockquote>We want to make sure that everybody starts fresh, together, as we move into an all-new experience with the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</blockquote><blockquote>Allowing everyone to experience the Black Ops universe the way it’s meant to be played, learning the era-specific weapons and gear, learning the gameplay innovations like Omnimovement, and keeping that signature Black Ops style is important.</blockquote><blockquote>Therefore, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 content will not carry forward to the Black Ops 6 Premium experience.</blockquote><p>Despite this fresh start for "premium" Call of Duty players, as Activision calls it, Black Ops 6 content will integrate into Warzone and sit alongside all the Modern Warfare 2 and 3 content already available in the battle royale. Warzone is a Call of Duty mash-up that seemingly has no restrictions when it comes to skins.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Black Ops 6 is set in the early 1990s, after the events of Black Ops Cold War and tied to the 1980s flashbacks in 2012’s Black Ops 2. Multiplayer launches with 16 new maps, including 12 core 6v6 maps, and four smaller Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6.</p><p>For more details, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-new-omnimovement-turns-call-of-duty-into-max-payne">everything we know about Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a>, including its brand new movement systems.

            <p>
Singing roses, warbling willows, trumpeting daffodills. From rearranging furniture to creating a musical garden, here's a first proper look at Tempopo - the next project from Australian indie developer Witch Beam, studio behind the brilliant Unpacking.
</p>
<p>
A melody-infused puzzle game, it sees you collecting a garden of musical flowers across 60 whimsical floating 3D levels that look a little similar to Nintendo's own Captain Toad. 
</p>
<p>
Tempopo is set to launch later this year for PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S (yes, curiously there's no mention of a PlayStation release for now).

<p>
"Use your wits or trial and error to find the perfect configuration, solving puzzles with inventive solutions involving multiple Tempopo performing different roles," Witch Beam's description of the game reads. "Once returned to Hana's garden, the flowers put on a unique musical performance for players to enjoy."
</p>
<p>Unpacking was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is">Eurogamer's Game of the Year for 2021</a>, and remains a solid favourite around these parts for its subtle storytelling and mindful gameplay. Eurogamer previously sat down with Witch Beam to discuss the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-creators-of-unpacking-on-developing-a-weird-queer-bafta-winning-game">making of its "weird", queer, BAFTA-winning</a> game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Xbox Showcase event, publisher Square Enix and developer Deck Nine Games announced a new entry in the Life is Strange series - Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>
<p>According to Square Enix, Double Exposure is an all-new supernatural murder mystery that will appeal to both new and players familiar with the franchise. The game tells the story of Max Caulfield - photographer-in-residence at the prestigious Caledon University. She "discovers her closest new friend, Safi, dead in the snow. Murdered. To save her, Max tries to Rewind time – a power she’s not used in years… instead, Max opens the way to a parallel timeline where Safi is still alive, and still in danger! Max realizes the killer will soon strike again – in both versions of reality.<br>
Only Max can Shift between the two parallel timelines to solve and prevent the same murder."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>

<p>More details about the title will be revealed during a live stream on July 13 at 9 am PDT/5 pm BST/6 pm CET on the <em>Life is Strange</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lifeisstrange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is slated for a release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year on October 29. The game is also slated for a Switch release - more details are to be announced. More information about the title can be found on the official Life is Strange website.</p>
<p>The most recent main entry in the Life is Strange series is 2021's True Colors&nbsp; - here's what we wrote about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-true-colors-an-emotionally-painted-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> back then. "Life is Strange: True Colors is another success for Deck Nine, highlighting how well they understand the source material and its connection with the audience. The new characters, location, and power are an instant classic of the series and we can only hope they continue to develop this world alongside DONTNOD."</p>

        <p>Rebellion Development associate head of design Ben Fisher added, “The quarantine zone in <em>Atomfall</em> has been cut off from the outside world for some time. This means that you’re dealing with a bunch of people that have been left to their own devices and it’s safe to say that things have gone a bit ‘Lord of the Flies’ in places. You’ll need to explore this hostile world and navigate bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and murky government agencies. Your interactions with these are important and will shape your story. Investigate clues to piece together events, be prepared to scavenge to survive, and remember that every encounter is a matter of life and death.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p data-characters="362" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Frost Giant Studios revealed its upcoming RTS <em>Stormgate</em>‘s third playable faction today as the Celestial Armada. An ancient and advanced civilization, the Celestial Armada traverses the universe in massive world-ships ruled by the Sovereigns, immortal beings. Frost Giant also announced an August 13 release date for the RTS Early Access to begin.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Stormgate faction reveal trailer and developer interview | PC Gaming Show 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hnq6SQnYk94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Essentially space nomads, the playstyle of the Celestial Armada looks rather unique compared to the two other factions. The Celestial Armada is built around the Arcship, a flying HQ that assists with the creation of new bases rather than utilizing builder units like the other factions. Similar to the Protoss from <em>StarCraft</em>, buildings constructed by the Celestial Armada will generate a cascade field that expands the possible building area for the faction.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Interestingly, the Celestial Armada does not have to worry about supply. This faction starts with the max cap of 300, and can build as many units as their resources allow. Primarily focused on buildings rather than units, the Celestial Armada also has to juggle maintaining an efficient power grid by building power-generating structures to support the many buildings it will construct.</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="false">Those wanting to try out the upcoming RTS early can do so by purchasing a Founder’s pack for access on July 30, or wait until it releases for free into Early Access on August 13, 2024 on PC via Steam.</p>

            <p>The maker of superb village builder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dorfromantik-review-gentle-elegance-from-a-deceptively-challenging-village-builder">Dorfromantik</a> has lifted the lid on its next game, Star Birds.</p>
<p>Unveiled at the PC Gaming Show this evening, Toukana Interactive's new space puzzler is being made in collaboration with German YouTube science channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell">Kurzgesagt: In a Nutshell</a>, who are providing the cheerful, cartoon visual style for this asteroid-themed base builder.</p>

<p>Designed to offer a "fresh and accessible" approach to resource management games, Star Birds is all about helping its titular avian explorers establish a thriving mining empire on as many asteroids as they can sink their beaks into. The asteroids in question will be procedurally-generated, and you'll need to work around their unique shapes, sizes and terrains in order to tap the precious materials they hide beneath the surface.</p>
<p>This involves building all kinds of whimsical-looking contraptions, connecting them up with cables and pipes, and keeping them powered by hooking them up to various energy sources - I spied generators and solar panels to name but two of these in the reveal trailer (above), but these machines will no doubt evolve over time as you start to gain access to bigger and better technologies.</p>

<p>You'll also need to look after your birds' various needs and wants as your enterprise starts to grow (rocket-fuel fatballs, anyone?), and from the looks of the reveal trailer, there will be larger mysteries to solve along the way, too.</p>
<p>Toukana say Star Bird's resources and production processes have all been inspired by real science - no doubt informed by Kurzgesagt's expert knowledge on the subject - but you won't need a degree in rocket science to have a good time with it (looking at you, Kerbal Space Program). Rather, the aim is to hopefully teach us something as we get to grips with its colourful building tools, and to pique our interest about the stars above us.</p>
<p>Star Birds is scheduled to launch on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/www.star-birds.com/steam">Steam</a> in 2025.</p>

			<p>South of Midnight, Compulsion Games' <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming deep south folktale</a>, has received a gameplay reveal trailer during today's Xbox showcase.</p>
<p>Last year we received a reveal trailer for the upcoming action-adventure, and today Compulsion Games and Microsoft released the game's first gameplay trailer. The footage is taken from around a third of the way through the story and features the main protagonist Hazel alongside her companion Catfish. You can check out the gameplay reveal trailer for the game below.</p>
<p><iframe title="South of Midnight - Gameplay Reveal - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4UHyaaWXuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the new trailer, the game's<i>&nbsp;</i>Creative Director David Sears, Art Director Whitney Clayton, and Game Director Jasmin Roy also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/south-of-midnight-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided some additional details</a> about this interesting new upcoming title on the official Xbox Wire. “[Players] are really in control of traversing there,” Jasmin Roy explained about the game's "wide-linear" environments. “So the way we built the environment is because we want players to follow the narrative, but have more to sink their teeth into – you can sometimes see some more open, hub-like sections.”</p>
<p>Art Director Clayton added, "‘The world Hazel comes from is inspired by the contemporary Deep South, but as you dive deeper into the world, things become more mystical and surreal. We wanted the feeling that you’re being pulled into a folktale, rather than, say, crossing a barrier like in Alice in Wonderland.”</p>
<p>The trio also talked about Hazel's weaving powers, which will serve different purposes throughout the game. “We don’t want to reveal everything in this particular gameplay trailer just yet,” said Roy, “[but] the spells are going to be used for traversal, problem-solving, <em>and</em>&nbsp;combat. This is how Hazel expresses the use of her power, through the different gameplay elements.”</p>
<p>Clayton continued, "“We needed to find something that connected to [the lore] and also have this Southern Gothic influence – this idea of taking back feminine crafts, and making them powerful, because we knew we wanted a female protagonist. That concept inspired this idea of a sort of living lace.”</p>
<p>South of Midnight is slated for a release on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025 - and <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-may-be-targeting-a-2024-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not the possible 2024 release that a LinkedIn resume appeared to hint at</a>.</p>

			<p>Following today’s big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Microsoft and Activision fully pulled the wraps back on what’s sure to be the biggest game of the year with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Direct. After a couple shaky years for the CoD franchise, this looks like the game fans have been waiting for, with an ambitious campaign, major updates to core gameplay, the return of round-based Zombies, and more. You can check out the full Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct below, provided you have around 25 minutes to spare, or you can scroll on down for our recap of the important points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qtI25vEDx38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Campaign</strong></h2>
<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct provided an in-depth look at the game’s campaign, which is being headed up by Raven Software alongside Treyarch. This looks like one of the more interesting CoD campaigns in some time, bringing to life an early 90s setting, which brings back a wheelchair-bound Frank Woods who acts as a mentor of sorts for new Troy Marshall and a new team. Oh, and yes, Russell Adler is back too.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, Raven is promising more open-ended missions, with different ways to achieve your objectives, some of which don’t involve combat. Yes, you’ll actually be able to talk your way through some scenarios. There will also be a new Safe House campaign hub around which you’ll return to between missions. Here’s a bit more detail about the campaign’s story.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops64.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“Black Ops 6 blends the rich and gritty history of previous Black Ops titles with both returning and bold new characters – and veteran Frank Woods acts as the through-line in our story. Across the Campaign, we see a different side of Woods following his traumatic injury at the hands of Raul Menendez. He’s been pulled from the field, and you’ll interact with him as he adjusts to a new role within the CIA.</em></p>
<p><em>His protege is Troy Marshall, who has been making a name for himself in the field. Marshall is a methodical leader, driven by a strong moral compass. They soon realize they must trust each other to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and this must be done without any of their usual resources. They must build their own team of rogue agents, recruiting two intriguing new characters in Felix Neumann, a technical genius, and Sevati Dumas, a mysterious assassin.</em></p>
<p><em>With a mixture of new and familiar faces, a legendary wildcard also returns to the fight – the infamous Russell Adler is back! While his allegiances and motivations remain unclear, this former ally may have become a new and daunting enemy.”</em></p>
<p>And here’s some detail on campaign variety and the more open-ended approach to objectives…</p>
<p><em>“Mission variety is a key component in the twisted, covert world of Black Ops 6. Raven Software has created individual missions from the ground up, with each one also offering diverse methods in the way you approach and execute them.</em></p>
<p><em>For example, one mission involves you infiltrating an old sewer system underneath an opulent casino in southern Europe, and these catacombs are one of many locations that are more ideal for stealth, where only the muffled yells or crumpled falls of the enemy can be heard, before you tactically reposition topside to pull off an audacious heist in the casino itself. Other areas are more appropriate for large-scale battles, such as an assault on a palace in the Iraqi desert.”</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops65.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Omnimovement and Gameplay Updates</strong></h2>
<p>Treyarch is also significantly overhauling core Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 gameplay, with the new Omnimovement system. This allows players to do new, more realistic moves, like slide, dive and shoot, sprint in any direction, shoot, roll, and maneuver while prone, and more. “Intelligent Movement” means this can all be done with fewer button presses, too.</p>
<p><em>“For the first time ever, players can sprint, slide, and dive in any direction (forward, sidestepping, and backpedaling) and move like a true Black Ops action hero. This innovation immediately allows the player to move like never before and seamlessly chain combat maneuvers together, like sliding, diving and a newly enhanced supine prone, all with a full 360 degrees range of motion.</em></p>
<p><em>If you can sprint in any direction, then it logically follows that you can slide and dive in any direction, too. This opened a world of new movement options. With a simple – and extremely engaging – prototype up and running, the team instantly knew this was much more than a modest improvement to the way you maneuver your Operator in combat.”</em></p>
<p>Other significant improvements to gameplay include the ability to fully customize your HUD, and enemies that have more advanced AI and more hit regions, that will result in more realistic death animations. Interestingly, the game will also be boosting its visuals using cloud-based texture streaming, which means, yes, you'll need to have an online connection even when playing single-player.</p>
<h2><strong>Multiplayer</strong></h2>
<p>Activision is holding back on traditional Mutliplayer info until a later reveal, but they’re promising 16 all-new maps at launch (no remasters), most of which will be classic-style three-lane affairs. Theater mode will also be returning to capture your best moments. More info on multiplayer is coming August 28.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops66.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>BioWare has revealed its plans for a ‘Summer Reveal’ for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>



<p>The following ‘Summer Reveal’ consists of:</p>



<ul>
<li>June 9 – Reveal Trailer</li>



<li>June 11 – 15+ Minutes of Gameplay</li>



<li>June 11 – Summer Game Fest First Impressions</li>



<li>June 14 – Discord Developer Q&amp;A</li>



<li>June 18 – Game Informer Cover Story</li>
</ul>



<p>Today marked the first of the Summer Reveal, which was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-unveils-dragon-age-the-veilguard-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new reveal trailer</a> during the Xbox Games Showcase. </p>



<p>At first glance, the reception seemed to be fairly mixed on the reveal. But we’ll see where BioWare lands at the end of its Summer Reveal event.</p>



<p>“Rally a team of seven companions, each with rich lives and deep backstories. These are characters to befriend, and even fall in love with. Among them, an assassin, a necromancer, and a detective will each bring their own expertise and unique abilities to the fight. You are never alone; decide who to take into battle and together face down demons, dragons and even ancient gods”, the official game description reads. </p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is said to be released later in 2024, but a more precise release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>When do you think the next Dragon Age game will be revealed? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
