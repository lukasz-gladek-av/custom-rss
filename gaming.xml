<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>says that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/sonic-rumble/" id="111686">Sonic Rumble</a> underperformed and that, overall, the value of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/angry-birds/" id="614">Angry Birds</a> developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rovio-entertainment/" id="2585">Rovio </a>was written down, resulting in an impairment loss of over $200 million.</p>



<p>Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., Sega’s parent company, recently <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported its Q3 earnings</a> for fiscal year 2026. Noted in the earnings that, as it pertained to Rovio’s business, there was a recognized impairment loss of approximately 31.3 billion yen. As of this writing, that amounts to about $205 million.</p>



<p>Sega completed<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/angry-birds-acquisition/" id="6935"> its acquisition of Rovio</a> in August 2023.</p>







<h2 id="h-factors-surrounding-rovio-s-underperforming-quarter">Factors Surrounding Rovio’s Underperforming Quarter</h2>



<p>In the Q3 presentation, Sega attributes Rovio’s performance falling short of initial expectations to “rapid changes in the market environment and other factors.” One of those factors was the collaborative mobile title Sonic Rumble, which struggled to meet key performance indicators.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Sega plans to reverse this momentum by focusing specifically on Angry Birds and Sega IPs, including Sonic, for future games. They also see the release of the third Angry Birds movie, set for December, as another factor driving hopeful increased traction for the brand.</p>







<h2>The Future of Sonic</h2>



<p>Sonic Rumble, which is also available for free on Steam, may have underperformed, but the blue blur always bounces back. It’s Sonic’s 35th anniversary this year. So far, no official game releases have been scheduled in celebration, but the Sonic team has put out a new audio drama in the Sonic universe. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-unveils-noir-sonic-audio-drama-the-chaotix-casefiles/" id="171225">here</a>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the filings, Sega announced plans to make mainstay IPs a focus not just in mobile releases but also in traditional console releases. Read more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-plans-four-major-mainstay-ip-releases-in-next-fiscal-year/" id="176620">here</a>.</p>

Buried beneath information about both MGS4 and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is a single line confirming the multiplayer offering will not return when the former finally sneaks onto more platforms this August.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/screenshot-2026-02-13-120832-1771012392399.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Screenshot from the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 website. Image captured by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This iteration of Metal Gear Online launched with MGS4 as a bundled-in multiplayer experience in June 2008. Featuring a variety of game modes that ranged from standard team deathmatch to a unique encounter that saw one player assume the role of Old Snake – the offshoot tied together elements from the fourth mainline Metal Gear Solid game for players to enjoy in an online setting. It received several post-launch expansions through the years before Konami <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/15/metal-gear-online-ending"><u>shut down the servers</u></a> in 2012.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing back MGS4 multiplayer for Master Collection Vol. 2 seems to be too tall an order for the publisher, but the second installment in its series of collections won’t be completely without an online component. Konami’s website also confirms that, unlike the first half of the bundle, its Peace Walker port will support online multiplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details on its returning Co-Ops mode promise classic team gameplay for the Big Boss era of the series, allowing two-to-four players to complete missions together. Versus Ops is for the more competitive-minded fans and features matches for up to six players. Local wireless play is also included, but only for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the lack of Metal Gear Online support for MGS4 may come as a sad surprise for fans of the original PlayStation 3 release, other tweaks coming to the base experience may pique their interest. As described in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-launches-aug-27-2026-on-ps5/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation.Blog</u></a> post, Konami said the new version of MGS4 will feature improved internal resolution, a maximum framerate increase, and customizable controls. It’s unclear if Peace Walker will also benefit from visual adjustments, but it will at least come with custom controls. Ghost Babel, a bonus Game Boy Color entry from 2000, will not see the return of its two-player Vs. Battle mode, but it will come with screen filters, pixel-perfect screen settings, a rewind function, and custom controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 has an August 27, 2026, release date for PC via Steam, Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. Those who pre-order their copy will gain access to the Cardboard Camouflage for MGS4 and the Love Box unfirom for Peace Walker. If you also happen to have save data from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Vol. 1</a>, you'll earn the Gold Camouflage and Gold uniform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read about what Konami is doing to make sure it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2"><u>doesn’t suffer the same launch problems</u></a> as Vol. 1.

<p>When Ubisoft announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was canceled</a>, it was also revealed that five other games were ending. Insider Gaming has learned the six games that have been cancelled at Ubisoft.</p>



<p>First reported on Insider Gaming Weekly, Insider Gaming understands that the following six games were canceled:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</strong> – Canceled after being first announced in 2020.</li>



<li><strong>Project Ether</strong> – In development since 2019, which was canceled, but has morphed, in a way, into a newer project. Believed to have been in development at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" id="168333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Project Pathfinder </strong>– Known previously as Project U</li>



<li><strong>Project Crest</strong> – A World War 2 extraction shooter</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</strong> – Stopping support</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Singularity </strong>– A new mobile Assassin’s Creed Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with the game cancellations that were previously announced—confirmed above—there was also a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed that had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly been shuttered</a>. That game, however, isn’t a part of this group. </p>



<p>One game that is still coming is the Assassin’s Creed: Blag Flag Remake. The latest rumors suggest that a reveal will take place in April after being delayed out of the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>If you want to go directly to the moment in the show below, it takes place <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rZcgQAfLRd4?si=k8dedz7N5aQ7E0D9&amp;t=3247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around the 54:07 mark</a>.</p>

            <guid>1435861</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Seven years ago, this would have been my weekly recommendation of what to play – after all, I did put over 1,000 hours into the original Overwatch – but if you told me coming into 2026 that I'd be back into it, I would have laughed at you. But here we are; Overwatch's recent complete overhaul, which saw the game stripped of the "2" in its title, made me curious enough to jump back in. As a regular player from 2016 to 2019, Overwatch sits near the top of my personal favorite games of all time, but following the announcement of Overwatch 2 back in 2019, the title fell off hard. Content slowed to a drip as the team focused on Overwatch 2's story content, most of which never saw the light of day. Then, when Overwatch 2 arrived, I still enjoyed it (I <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/overwatch-2/a-heroic-return">gave it an 9 out of 10</a>, after all), but it was a far cry from the novelty and excitement surrounding the original game during those first several years.</p><p>This reworking of the entire game is so much more than just a simple title rebrand; in addition to a more prominent story, complete with Blizzard's famously great cinematics, it's also refocusing on what players love. A permanent 6v6 mode is there for those who favor the original Overwatch team compositions. A ton of new heroes are joining the roster this year (including five heroes just this week), completely flipping any existing Meta on its head. And speaking of Meta, the new Conquest Meta Event has you pick a faction and fight for it over the course of a five-week event, earning rewards every step of the way. As someone who hasn't played the game for several years now, I'm struggling to not only rewire my rusty muscle memory, but also relearn my favorite heroes, as many of them have received reworks in my absence. It's a little overwhelming, and many of my old strategies now fail, but I'm having a blast dipping my toe back in. And when I am able to go on a run as one of my old favorites, I'm reminded precisely why I fell in love with this game in the first place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/13/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-13]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-devs-know-safeguard-has-problems-and-are-looking-into-it-2000668703</link>
            <guid>1435834</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over a decade ago, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em> introduced a new multiplayer game mode to the franchise: <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Safeguard_(game_mode)">Safeguard</a>. This team-based mode had players pushing and defending a walking robot from another team tasked with stopping it. It was very good. But the mode’s last appearance in a main game was in 2018. So I was over the moon to see the mode return as part of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s second season. And while I have some issues with it, Safeguard is still a lot of fun in 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Booting up Safeguard in the new season of <em>COD: BLOPS7</em></a> was like returning to an old friend’s house after years away to hang out. Something I’ve always appreciated about the mode was how it gave the defense a way to fight back that wasn’t just “Kill the other team.” You can instead focus your damage on the robot, and if you do enough, it will stop moving and have to reboot. This gives less skilled players a way to help without having to hunt down highly skilled <em>COD</em> pros each match. It also leads to an interesting dynamic where a defending team can over-focus on taking out the bot and let the attackers flank them and wipe them out. But focus too much on the attackers, and the bot will walk its way into the checkpoint, and you’ll lose before you realize it.</p>

  <p>This time around, the robot you are defending is a four-legged Boston Dynamics-like mechanical dog. The bots were previously bipedal humanoids, which was fine, but I’m far more into guarding a robo dog than a random mechanical man. But it felt to me as if this robot dog might be moving faster than the past bots had in Safeguard. So I talked to the devs behind the mode, and they confirmed that, no, the bot is moving at a “pace consistent with previous” versions of Safeguard.</p> <p>However, “<em>BO7</em>’s tighter map layouts, updated pathing, and the new animation set can make its movement feel faster, even though the underlying speed hasn’t changed much,” said a Treyarch spokesperson. They also confirmed they are looking at data to decide if the bot should move a bit slower.</p>

 <p>Another issue with the current version of Safeguard in <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that you can sometimes win, but still lose. Basically, the game mode is built around how fast you get the bot to the checkpoint. Each team gets a shot at pulling this off. If the first team does it in let’s say two minutes, then the other team goes, and if they get the bot there in two minutes and three seconds, <a href="https://youtu.be/LegP5qViODY">they’ll lose despite the bot making it to the checkpoint</a>. This feels bad, and Treyarch tells me they are looking into this.</p>

 <p>“We’re evaluating options to end the second round early in situations where the attacking team hasn’t pushed the Robot far enough in time,” Treyarch told <em>Kotaku</em>. “And we’re looking at this alongside the broader UI improvements already in progress. Our goal is to make the rules and win conditions as clear and intuitive as possible for all players.” The team is also open to bringing back overtime, which isn’t included in Safeguard right now.</p> <p>Besides those issues, and an odd bug that let people knock the bot out with a combat axe that has already been patched, I’ve really enjoyed playing Safeguard again. I think it’s a great example of how <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s gunplay can be incredibly successful in modes that aren’t simply about killing each other.</p>

 <p>I hope the mode sticks around past season two and, like Kill Confirmed and other fan favorites, return in future <em>Call of Duty</em> games. You don’t even have to have a robot for this mode to work. If the next <em>Call of Duty</em> isn’t set in the future but instead WW2 or something, fine, use a jeep. That would still let me enjoy this mode with my friends, even those who aren’t great at FPS games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Rovio's performance "fell significantly short of initial forecast"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a8a7a553b8c1b"><a title="Sonic Angry Birds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8a7a553b8c1b/sonic-angry-birds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA Sammy has published its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf">Q3 2025/26 financial report</a>, and it's a pretty mixed bag for the multimedia giant, with losses reported in multiple different areas.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest piece of news comes from Rovio's side of the business. Sega acquired the Angry Bird developer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/its-official-sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio">in 2023</a> Sega reports has fallen "significantly short of initial forecast due to rapid changes in the market environment and other factors".</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_forecast_e.pdf">reported an impairment loss</a> of ¥30.4 billion ($198.6 million), citing increased competition and the rapid deterioration of user bases. This meant that "Rovio found it difficult to advance its initially planned business development".</p>
<p>A number of titles haven't met Sega's own internal targets, with development delays and cancellations also a factor. <strong>Sonic Rumble</strong>, the mobile game which Rovio co-developed, also fell short of expectations, particularly around customer acquisition.</p>
<p>It's not just with Rovio, though — while net sales remain steady and are 4% up year-on-year, operating income and ordinary income are both down, 54.6% and 51.8% respectively. Entertainment Contents has also dropped 31%.</p>
<p>Sega only reports two full game releases for the third quarter: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on Switch 2, and <strong>Football Manager 26</strong>, the latter of which needed "a series of updates to address post-launch bugs, etc. and improved the gameplay environment". And in general, full game titles have reported "stagnant growth".</p>

<p>It's not all bad news, though: Sega is planning to release "four major new titles for mainstay IPs" next financial year, with a continued focus on expanding the trans-media business (movies, TV shows, merch, etc.). Daniel Svärd, once King's head of live game studios, will be appointed as Rovio's COO.</p>
<p>All in all, not a great showing for the company, and Sega has revised its net sales expectations to rise slightly — ¥490 billion / $3.2 billion, up from ¥475 billion / $3.1 billion — while operating income expectations have been lowered to ¥40 billion / $261.5 million, from ¥53 billion / $346.6 million.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> has <em>just</em> launched, and that will be included in the final report for the fiscal year ending March 2026. So that may help turn the tides a little. And 2026 marks the 35th anniversary for the Sonic series, so the future should be blue — in a good way.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-adds-ability-attack-pc-specs-steam-reviews/</link>
            <guid>1435807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that user-submitted <strong>Steam Reviews</strong> have often been <strong>quite controversial</strong>, especially during so-called "<strong>review bombings</strong>". In these instances, specific games have been targeted with a deluge of negative reviews, thus <strong>crashing the overall user review score</strong> on Valve's platform.</p>



<p>One of the earliest scenarios was the review bombing of <strong>Firewatch</strong>, <strong>Campo Santo</strong>'s acclaimed adventure game released in 2016. The following year, YouTuber <strong>PewDiePie</strong> <strong>racially insulted a player</strong> during a livestream in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (<strong>PUBG</strong>), and Campo Santo's founder <strong>Sean Vanaman</strong> asked YouTube to remove all of PewDiePie's videos from the platform. However, in retaliation, PewDiePie's legion of followers went en masse on Steam to <a href="https://wccftech.com/firewatch-negative-reviews-pewdiepie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leave negative reviews on Firewatch</a>.</p>



<p>Just a week after the controversy, Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-histograms-help-review-bombing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added histograms to user-submitted Steam Reviews</a> to help them make sense of these situations. However, review bombings continued:</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2018, SEGA's <strong>Total War: Rome II</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/tw-rome-ii-review-bombed-female-generals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got review bombed</a> <strong>due to the presence in the game of too many female generals</strong></li>



<li>In 2020, CAPCOM's <strong>Monster Hunter World</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-world-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-racist-joke-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a temporary blast of negative reviews</a> from Chinese players following what they perceived to be <strong>a racist joke in the Monster Hunter movie</strong></li>



<li>In 2023, Blizzard's <strong>Diablo IV</strong> was <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-is-already-being-review-bombed-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately review bombed when it launched on Steam</a>, with many user reviews blatantly criticizing the studio <strong>without even touching the game's actual content</strong></li>



<li>In 2024, Sony Santa Monica's <strong>God of War: Ragnarök</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was briefly the target of a review bombing</a> when Sony still required users to register for a PlayStation account to play single player games</li>
</ul>



<p>That said, in some instances, negative Steam reviews <strong>can be helpful to the developer if they point out actual problems with the game</strong>. One such scenario is whenever there are performance issues. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">With the latest Steam Client Beta</a>, Valve has introduced the "<strong>option to attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page</strong>", which could be really useful for developers as they diagnose performance problems mentioned in their game's Steam reviews. </p>



<p>The new Steam Client Beta also introduced another option: to send "<strong>anonymized frame rate data</strong>" to Valve. This data will be stored "without connection to your Steam account, but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on." Valve claims <strong>it will help them improve Steam and overall game compatibility</strong>, with a focus on devices running <strong>SteamOS</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Cool stuff is always coming out of the alternative controller community. From rhythm games where you wiggle around on </span><a href="https://scrape.nugget.fun/"><span>a real skateboard</span></a><span> to games where you smack </span><a href="https://www.dachu-interactive.com/how-to-pet-your-cat"><span>a giant stuffed animal cat butt</span></a><span>, the world of weird controllers is awesome and underrated. Luckily, a brand new type of alt control is getting some well-deserved love.</span></p> <p><span>Streamer Perri Karyal is </span><a href="https://youtu.be/rIbfNUA5pWk?si=ZHmAQQDUcdhWQfk2"><span>known</span></a><span> for making alt controls that allow her to play games using her brain—but what if it were the other way around? What if a game could control a player?</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, Karyal </span><a href="https://x.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?s=20"><span>posted</span></a><span> a video showing off exactly that. Using a process called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), which basically sends signals to the part of your ear canal that’s responsible for your sense of balance, Karyal was able to hook up her own body to a controller.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can control your balance</p> <p>I made a device that sends DC current through my head to stimulate my vestibular nerve (called galvanic vestibular stimulation or GVS) and, in doing so, can make me feel completely destabilised. By changing the direction of the current, it can make me… <a href="https://t.co/XNH0EtRow6">pic.twitter.com/XNH0EtRow6</a></p> <p>— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“By changing the direction of the current, it can make me fall in that direction,” she explains. The video shows Karyal running in a straight line — until a person shifts a joystick to the left, which causes her to veer to the left, too.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Karyal proceeded to use the tech to simulate G forces while playing Ubisoft’s 2020 racing game </span><i><span>Trackmania.</span></i><span> In the video, she sways from side to side in tandem with her digital car, to dizzying effect. She also reports seeing “flashing lights,” which doesn’t sound too good. The official </span><i><span>Trackmania</span></i><span> Esports account </span><a href="https://x.com/TMesports/status/2022169923741741070?s=20"><span>took notice</span></a><span> of Karyal’s experiment, calling it “awesome.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The technology that makes this possible is actually quite old. In an NBC article from 2005, journalist Yuri Kageyama </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna9816703"><span>tries out GVS</span></a><span>: “I found the experience unnerving and exhausting: I sought to step straight ahead but kept careening from side to side. Those alternating currents literally threw me off.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perri Karyal stresses not to replicate this experiment at home, as GVS isn’t very well-researched and can cause adverse effects. It’s very cool to watch someone else do it, though!</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meowth Will Gargle Your Pinballs For Just $7,000]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/stern-pinball-pokemon-table-price-7000-release-trailer-pikachu-meowth-2000668725</link>
            <guid>1435768</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After some teasing last week, Stern Pinball has officially unveiled its pricey <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-themed tables with a snazzy trailer. The question now is: Are you willing to pay $7,000 to fling steel balls at Meowth’s face?</p> <p>On February 13, Stern Pinball released a new trailer showing off its $7,000 <em>Pokémon</em> table, which features a large HD screen that plays clips from the anime series as well as a highly interactive playfield that includes a moving Pikachu and a Meowth balloon. Here’s the video:</p>  <p>Stern says players will be able to capture Pokémon while playing this pinball machine. And if you have a Stern account and log in via the app while playing, you’ll be able to collect Pokémon and check them out later on the app. As you’d expect from a modern pinball machine, the playfield is jam-packed with spinners, ramps, and targets to hit, all of which will cause Pikachu to react to how you’re playing.</p>

 <p>“Today we’re proud to finally deliver the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball machine,” <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">said Stern Pinball president</a> and CEO Seth Davis in a press release. “This game is a true celebration of nostalgia, craftsmanship, and the enduring adventure of Pokémon – brought to life in a whole new way through immersive pinball gameplay, thrilling battles, and the timeless excitement of catching <em>Pokémon</em>.”</p> <p>This all sounds cool, and if you find one at your local arcade or bar, it will likely be a lot of fun. However, if you want to buy one of these machines to stick in your basement or gaming room, you’ll need to drop at least $7,000 on the base model. There’s also a premium model that features different artwork, enhanced audio and visuals, and a fancier backglass, among other bonuses. Those don’t come cheap. This upgraded version will cost $9,700. Meanwhile, a limited-edition version of the table will set you back $13,000!</p>

 <p>If you can afford to grab this <em>Pokémon</em> table, first off, congrats on doing well in life. <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">And also, Stern is taking orders for its newly revealed <em>Pokémon</em> pinball machine right now on its website.</a></p>
