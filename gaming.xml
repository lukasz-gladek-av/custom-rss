<p>Mouse in the house</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Annapurna Interactive has today announced that Furcula's weird roguelike-meets-creature collector <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> will be landing on Switch on <strong>18th November</strong>.</p>
<p>This one briefly popped up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-august-2024-every-announcement-and-game-reveal-from-the-indie-world-and-partner-showcases">August 2024 Indie World</a> showcase, where it was accompanied by a 'February 2025' release date. That wasn't meant to be (obviously), but it's nice to hear that it's still coming our way.</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of Morsels before, this is a strange, top-down roguelite where you play as a mouse who is transformed into a Morsel — a weird little creature that possesses wicked combat powers — and sets out into the upper world to take down the oppressive forces of... street cats? Hey, we said it was weird.</p>
<p>In your trips up top, you'll be collecting other Morsels, which can be swapped out as you play to tackle feline foes with different abilities. They're weird-looking fellas, but the retro aesthetic gives a cute sheen to the whole thing.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the Morsels <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fight enemies using your rotating roster of captured Morsels, switching between them at any time<br>
- Each Morsel has its own abilities and strengths, and can become afflicted with ailments or boosted with power-ups and quirks<br>
- Multiple hidden bonus levels with unique art styles and surprising gameplay twists<br>
- Charming and addictive gameplay, with endless replayability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have enough roguelikes on Switch to last us a lifetime, but we'd be lying if we said that the weirdness of this one didn't leave us a little intrigued. Hey, in a few months, we can see it for ourselves.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Will you be checking it out on Switch later this year? Dive into the comments and let us know.</em></p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/shenmue-3-enhanced-playstation-xbox-series-nintendo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-3-enhanced-is-coming-to-playstation-xbox-series-pc-and-for-the-first-time-in-the-series-history-nintendo.1272891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Shenmue 3 Enhanced is a new "<em>upgraded</em>" version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-steam-launch-now-officially-scheduled-for-november-19th/">2019 entry</a> to the series from developer Ys Net that'll arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and for the first time in the series history, Shenmue is coming to a Nintendo platform, but there's no specification if it'll arrive on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, or both.</p>



<p>Unlike the original release published by Deep Silver, this new version of the game will be published by ININ Games, which acquired the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games/">publishing rights to Shenmue 3 last November</a>. Also, if you already own Shenmue 3 on PlayStation 4 or PC, you'll be able to upgrade to this new version, though the details regarding whether it's a paid update or a free one are still to come.</p>



<p>According to a press release, this new version of the game will feature "<em>overhauled visuals, performance boosts, and quality-of-life updates</em>." A few of those upgrades include new 4K textures, support for DLSS and FSR, and faster load times. </p>



<p>There are also a few gameplay-specific improvements, like increased NPC density in Niaowu, a classic camera mode for those who want to play Shenmue 3 as if it was made immediately after the original two titles. Adjustments to Ryo's stamina, health restoration between fights, and a reduction of money barriers have also been added, alongside the ability to skip NPC conversations and cutscenes if you want to get back to the action as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>And, for those who perhaps want the visual improvements but don't want any of the gameplay adjustments, all of these additions are optional, and can be toggled from the menu if you'd rather play without them.</p>



<p>No specific release date has been announced for Shenmue 3 Enhanced Edition, though with Gamescom 2025 set to kick off hours away from the time of this writing, it could be the case that we don't have to wait too long before hearing more about this new enhanced edition. We'll see what the week holds.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bigger-maps-found-in-battlefield-6-by-dataminers.1272882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A group of dataminers has reportedly shared visual evidence of some very large maps that will be available in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> at launch or shortly after the online shooter’s October release on PC and console.</p> <p>Over the last two weekends, <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta</a> was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">big hit with players</a>. The upcoming military sim’s ground combat, explosive destruction, and <em>Battlefield 3</em>-like vibes were well received online. I had a blast putting over 15 hours into the beta by myself and with friends. But it wasn’t a perfect beta, of course, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">EA having to tweak Rush shortly after adding it</a>, and some players complaining that the maps in the beta were too small. Well, good news for those people: We have our first reported look at some of the bigger maps that will likely be available in <em>BF6</em> later this year.</p> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-large-scale-map-images-leak-comparisons-alleviate-beta-concerns">As reported by <em>MP1st</em> on August 17</a>, a group of <em>Battlefield</em> dataminers known as 1BF was recently able to extract files from <em>Battlefield Lab</em>s. This is a version of <em>BF6</em> that EA uses for testing out new features, early gameplay ideas, maps, and modes. The group claims to have datamined two maps from <em>BF Labs</em>: Mirak Valley, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/features/maps">which was already confirmed by EA to be in the full game</a>, and another, known as Eastwood, that is rumored to be <em>BF6</em>‘s first post-launch map. And both of these maps are much bigger than the compact, urban warfare maps featured in the beta.&nbsp; According to the dataminers, Mirak Valley will be the largest map available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> at launch.</p> <h2>Leaked images of two big <em>Battlefield 6</em> maps</h2> <p>In renders leaked online via Imgur, which are included below, you can see various shots of Mirak Valley. Keep in mind the map won’t look like this in-game, but it does show us what looks to be a very big and open map, something <em>Battlefield</em> vets will appreciate.</p>

     <p>Meanwhile, the other large map, known as Eastwood, is reportedly set in California and will feature a golf course, fancy houses, and a new vehicle: a golf cart. <a href="https://youtu.be/X96xvDjEaVw">When EA teased a battle royale-like mode last month</a> coming to <em>BF6</em> in the future, it showed what looked like a mansion’s pool and people driving a golf cart. Perhaps Eastwood, which is likely the map’s codename and not its final title, will be the setting for this teased mode. You can see renders of Eastwood below:</p>   <p>A size comparison of Mirak Valley and Eastwood to the <em>BF6</em> beta map Siege of Cairo has also been doing the rounds based on the datamined renders, and it does show that, yes, there are seemingly much bigger maps in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. This shouldn’t be too surprising to learn, though, because <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-dev-says-the-betas-small-maps-are-to-make-sure-we-hit-the-full-octane-version-of-battlefield-on-the-head-and-dont-worry-large-maps-exist-too/"><em>Battlefield</em> lead producer David Sirland</a> said that bigger maps would be included in the full game last week.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Datamine of previously (mostly) unseen maps from the beta files</p> <p>Mirak Valley, based on the official description, will be the largest map on release</p> <p>source: Happysufigeee <a href="https://t.co/Hrr3YDyOTX">pic.twitter.com/Hrr3YDyOTX</a></p> <p>— 1BF | Battlefield 6 (@onebattlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/onebattlefield/status/1956751064587239657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It should be noted that datamined content isn’t guaranteed to be included in the full game. Development is messy, plans shift, and things get delayed or canned all the time. That said, these maps look very far along, and at least one of them is listed as a launch map in <em>BF6</em>. So while there might be some changes made between the datamined renders and the final maps in the shipped game, I’m expecting both of these maps to be included at some point in<em> Battlefield 6.</em></p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Peak’s popularity continues to rise with almost two million sales last week during a sale on Steam, according to new data.</p>



<p>The title received a significant update recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-adds-cannibalism-in-its-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding cannibalism</a> to the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside a new biome</a>, complete with new items and mysteries to solve.</p>



<p>A 38% discount on Steam then went live on August 11, which is still running, propelling Peak to staggering numbers with almost two million sales in the week alone, putting the game on the cusp of 10 million sales overall.</p>



<h2 id="h-peak-approaches-10-million-sales-mark">Peak Approaches 10 Million Sales Mark</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Huge boost. Image via Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure>



<p>New data published by <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/peak-sold-18-million-copies-last" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> revealed the impressive numbers, with 1.8 million sales last week, pushing the title to 9.7 million copies sold overall. With the sale price still available, the 10 million mark should be surpassed this week.</p>



<p>Sales have pushed revenue to over $55 million, it’s added, and should Peak pass the 10 million sales mark, it will become the second budget indie title to hit the milestone in 2025, following on from R.E.P.O (16.8 million sales). Last week, revenues are reported to have been $6.9 million.</p>



<p>Those numbers gave Peak the accolade of being the highest-selling title on Steam last week (August 11 to 17), with charts showing the huge rebound in sales numbers for the title, which had seen week-by-week sales steadily decrease since release.</p>



<p>Impressively, Peak sold over 550,000 copies on the weekend alone, while the launch of the Mesa Update on August 11 also brought legacy players back to the game, resulting in a boost to concurrent players.</p>



<p>Is Peak one of the best games to release in 2025? Should it be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3332/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

They also expressed disappointment at a perceived lack of food and transportation support and inadequate resting areas for exhibitors that were allegedly told to spend at least 12 hours per day at their booth or risk incurring a penalty.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The letter suggested those issues and more meant Gamescom Latam had positioned itself "antagonistically towards developers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This harms precisely those who most need the support, such as the exhibitors in the Panorama Brasil section. This situation becomes even more pronounced when compared to the treatment given to some of the international guests, whose travel and accommodation are often covered, along with other incentives," it added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-corp-responds-to-louisiana-lawsuit-that-claims-it-built-the-perfect-place-for-pedophiles-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox Corp responds to Louisiana lawsuit that claims it built 'the perfect place for pedophiles'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom Latam organizers quickly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://latam.gamescom.global/en/answer-to-the-devs-open-letter/">pushed back against those allegations</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (even describing some as "factually inaccurate).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, during a recent chat with Game Developer, Falk explained he was taken aback after reading about the controversy and claimed the team in Sao Paulo performed admirably when attempting to support developers in the region.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I was surprised when I read about the criticism, because—for example, just remembering one fact—if you're a part of the festival and you can [attend] Gamescom with no money, you have to make sure you as a developer are representing your game to the people," said Falk.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's something we do here at Gamescom in Cologne, as well. [...] We have a big discount for indies so it's cheaper for them, but we request them to be there [at their booth] because that's the beauty of it. So that wasn't anything new. I think it was some kind of miscommunication because I think the team over in Sao Paulo did really well in giving them the opportunity to be part of [the event] without paying."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To avoid similar situations in the future as the Gamescom team attempts to expand both Gamescom Latam in Brazil and Gamescom Asia in Bangkok, Falk said it's important they work with partners who have already established strong events in those territories.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-not-our-aim-to-grow-grow-grow-gamescom-2025-touts-record-exhibitors-but-organizers-says-quality-is-better-than-quantity" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It is not our aim to grow, grow, grow:' Gamescom touts record exhibitors but organizers says quality is better than quantity</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's why, for instance, he said Gamescom Asia is moving to Bangkok in 2025 after merging with Thailand Game Show. Even though the B2B portion of the event was strong when it was previously hosted in Singapore, he explained the B2C segment was growing more slowly than hoped.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we talk about Gamescom [in Cologne], we have hundreds of thousands of people [attending]. I think in Gamescom Asia we had like 30,000 or 40,000—but it was also tough because Gamescom Asia in Singapore started right into COVID. The first edition was really tough for the team," he explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Singapore was also great for business, so we were able to attract many business people and provide a great B2B experience. But for consumers, Singapore is quite expensive and it's hard to get there. You have to fly in. The [cost] of flying into an event is of course much higher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hope, then, is that merging with Thailand Game Show and tapping into their experience of hosting a consumer-focused show will help Gamescom Asia strengthen its offering. It will be interesting to see whether developers in Thailand feel the merger has been successful once Gamescom Asia has concluded in October.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-18-arkane-union-brands-microsoft-an-accomplice-to-genocide-krafton-hits-back-at-unknown-worlds-founders-and-is-collective-action-the-answer-to-miscrediting-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #18: Arkane union brands Microsoft an 'accomplice' to genocide, Krafton hits back at Unknown Worlds founders, and is collective action the answer to miscrediting?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer is attending Gamescom 2025 via the Gamescom Media Ambassador Program, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

      <article data-ads="true" data-article-type="news" data-article-group="news" data-paywalled="false" data-premium="false" data-sponsored="false" data-type="article">


<header data-component="article-header">
  

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Well, I say that, they've actually addressed "certain irregularities"</p>

    </div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>South Korean publishers Nexon are investigating a recent bit of TikTok marketing for their free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>, after players spotted some ads that feature AI-generated 'human' streamers bigging up the game. Well, we at least have to assume it's following that, as Nexon's statement omits mentioning AI in favour of the wonderfully nebulous phrase "certain irregularities".</p>
<p>If you've not seen one of these ads that look to have been posted by The First Descendant's official account, allow me to show you, because you'll see right quick why folks have been asking questions. <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1956400478855573771">Boom</a>. There are further booms compiled into one Reddit post by user iHardlyTriHard down below.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can see, them be some weird renderings of streamy blokes, especially the one who says <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>: Automata in a fashion that'd be hilarious if this wasn't terrible AI sloppage. Seriously, he pronounces it NEER (pause for ten seconds) audomada. He also gets points for doubling up on his use of free-to-play in his attempt to get you hyped about an F2P update to the F2P looter shooter, which has launched F2Ply.</p>
<p>Anyway, in addition to the more obviously not-streamers, it appears the first one in the compilation below may be based on the likeness of streamer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DanieltheDemon/videos">DanieltheDemon</a>. He's since taken to the comments section of a TikTok about the clips to make clear he didn't agree to any of this. "I have no affiliation nor contract with The First Descendant," the streamer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@game.central/video/7539498130065214742">wrote</a>. "They stole my face/reactions from my most viral video and used AI to change what my mouth says and a voice that isn't mine. I did not consent for my likeness to be used..."</p> 
<p>While you can't find these full ads if you go to The First Descendant's official TikTok account, you can see some of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@firstdescendantofficial/video/7525009515557932296?lang=en">gameplay</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@firstdescendantofficial/video/7525333042924211463?lang=en">clips</a> the AI streamers have been paired with to deliver their samey sales pitches.</p>
<p>What do Nexon have to say about this? The <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1957361838964006977">following</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We would like to inform you of certain irregularities identified in the operation of our TikTok Creative Challenge for creators. As a part of our marketing campaign for Season 3: Breakthrough, we recently ran a Creative Challenge program for TikTok creators, which allows creators to voluntarily submit their content to be used as advertising materials. All submitted videos are verified through TikTok’s system to check copyright violations before they are approved as advertising content.</p>
<p>However, we have become aware of cases where the circumstances surrounding the production of certain submitted videos appear inappropriate. Thus, we are conducting a thorough joint investigation with TikTok to determine the facts. We sincerely apologize for the delay in providing this notice as the review is taking longer than expected. Once the verification is complete, we will promptly share an update through an official notice.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the company ran <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/tiktok-creative-challenge-introduction/pc/en">a competition of sorts</a> that let anyone create ads for the game, which is a strange example of outsourcing at the very least, then seemingly left final approval for publication to TikTok's copyright checker, which merrily waved this dodgy stuff through. Either that or Nexon potentially gave it all the green light themselves. Either way, oof.</p><p>We'll have to see what the company say once that investigation's concluded, but here's hoping the next statement's a bit more like the easier-to-parse response offered when Nexon were accused of taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendant-has-decided-to-make-adjustments-to-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons">a bit too much inspiration</a> from some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> icons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>There’s a new reason to revisit <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, <em>Euro Truck Simulator</em> 2 gets ported after 13 years, and I don’t need another <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617"><em>Balatro</em>-like in my life,</a> but I might make an exception for fellow dopamine drip machine <em>Raccoin</em>. Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s round-up of gaming news and cultural discourse. Also, ongoing updates on the fate of D.C.’s most infamous sandwich slinger. A 20-person goon squad was sent to his home last Friday <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-goons-sent-swat-team-to-bust-the-dc-hoagie-hurler/">to re-arrest the guy</a>, but murals memorializing the moment <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ianlivingston.bsky.social/post/3lwmpmzwl322h">will be harder to detain</a>.</p> <h2><em>Raccoin</em> is a coin pusher for roguelike deckbuilder freaks</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="RACCOIN: Coin Pusher Roguelike | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy1FcT6sfIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Playstack’s next game is about watching coins fall off a ramp as you use special items and tricks to generate giant, super-satisfying combos. It’s certainly being presented as <em>Balatro</em> for coin-pushers, complete with a nice, quirky arcade cabinet art style. You select different characters with unique advantages and unlock special coins you can deploy to rack up bonuses. There’s a physics simulation element and lots of jingling.</p> <p>The developer is Doraccoon, and this appears to be their first game. If you’ve ever wandered by someone hunched over a coin pusher in the wild with a zombie look in their eyes and shook your head in dismay, well, hey, that could be you when<em> Raccoin</em> launches. There’s no release date yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/">a free playtest on Steam is live starting August 18</a>.</p>

 <h2>Keeping <em>Anthem</em> online forever might have made it a worse game</h2> <p>Ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah recently mused about<em> Anthem</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136">servers shutting down next year</a> in light of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-killing-games-break-switch-2-cart-size-ign-layoffs-pilotwings-music-2000614692">Stop Killing Games movement</a>. Had it been designed to stay online forever, “it would have been an uglier game, probably would have had more latency issues,” he recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>. “It would have been a worse experience second-to-second in order to get something that basically wouldn’t need to ever be sunset.”</p> <p>But he also added that those tradeoffs might be worth it in the long run. “I think maybe it is that we want to be in a world where we’re willing to sacrifice some fidelity, sacrifice some things in order to get it so that games don’t just vanish one day.”</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 2042</em> gets a big surprise update called “<em>Road to&nbsp;<span>Battlefield</span> 6</em>“</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Road to Battlefield 6: Iwo Jima" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Xq0BbFJ0DU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>EA’s last beleaguered multiplayer shooter is being repurposed into a bridge to the future. A new update that goes live today adds a new free pass full of unlockable nods to the franchise’s past as well as new rewards for <em>Battlefield 6</em>. A version of the Iwo Jima map is also returning, alongside other new content. Fans are grudgingly on board. “<span dir="auto" role="text">Okay <em>2042</em>, ill bite one last time,” wrote one YouTube commenter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em> is coming to console</h2> <p>A PlayStation store listing for the hit highway-and-chill series <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroTruck2/comments/1mthopc/ets2_is_coming_to_ps5/">leaked over the weekend</a>. The PS5 version is arriving <a href="https://truck-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2_Version_history">over a decade</a> after the game came out, though regular updates have continued adding new vehicles and fleshing out the sprawling continental road map.</p> <h2>There’s an enhanced version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/shenmue-3-the-kotaku-review-1840175041"><em>Shenmue III</em></a> on the way</h2> <p><em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em> will have more NPCs in the streets, better graphics, menu and gameplay fixes, and a new camera mode inspired by the original two games. It also brings the game to Xbox and Switch 2, with an upgrade path for those who already own it on PC and PS4.</p>

 <h2><em>The Last Of Us</em> <em>Online</em> game director teases new multiplayer project</h2> <p>Vinit Agarwal left Naughty Dog <a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-last-us-online-vinit-agarwal-1851785806">earlier this year</a> to set up a new game studio in Japan. He recently shed more light on what fans can expect from the studio’s new project, whose team also includes fellow <em>Last of Us Online</em> lead Joe Pettinati. “A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer,” he <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">told GameSpark</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/"><em>VGC</em></a>).

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression-on-xbox-playstation-pc-cross-platform-status-explained.1272846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hell may not have frozen over, but the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S is rapidly approaching and shows that nothing can be ruled out. If you want to know whether the release on the platform includes cross-progression, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>Due to be released on Xbox on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-helldivers-2-release-on-xbox-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, though there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-have-no-plans-of-putting-it-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no plans to bring the title to the Game Pass service</a>, Arrowhead Games’ title is one of the biggest releases of the summer for the platform and shows a major shift in approach from Sony, which published the title.</p>



<p>If you’ve already played Helldivers 2 on PC or PlayStation and want to know whether you can transfer your progress and any unlocked content to a different platform, like Xbox, we’ve got a full explanation on the feature.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression">Does Helldivers 2 Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Helldivers 2 does not support cross-progression between platforms, and any unlocked content is only available on the existing version.</strong></p>



<p>An<a href="https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12517679456156-Does-Helldivers-2-have-cross-progression-Can-I-transfer-my-stuff-to-another-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> FAQ published by Arrowhead</a> in July, it was confirmed that any progression, including limited-time content, cannot be transferred between accounts. It was also confirmed that accounts cannot be merged.</p>



<p>This means, for example, that Xbox players will not be able to show off any content from earlier seasons in Helldivers 2, with any unlocks before the Xbox release being unavailable on the platform. However, you also can’t share your account between PlayStation and PC either.</p>



<p>Although cross-progression is unavailable, crossplay support is offered between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, so you can play with friends regardless of their platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-cross-progression-be-added-to-helldivers-2">Will Cross-Progression be Added to Helldivers 2?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that cross-progression will be added to Helldivers 2, as Arrowhead stated there are “no plans to implement cross-progression at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>While you can never say never, it’s clear that cross-progression is not a priority for the development team, and if the stance were to change, it would likely take a lengthy amount of time for the feature to be implemented.</p>



<p>There could be additional demand for cross-progression following the launch of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S, particularly as many players may have opted to purchase the game on PS5 or PC due to the previous unavailability on Xbox. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 community is now without BF6 content again. Two weekends of betas have seen you all rack up millions of eliminations, building destructions, and more. So let’s see if EA and Battlefield Studios are planning another Battlefield 6 beta before the game’s release window.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> was a limited testing phase for BF6. Early indicators were good, but all this did was make the BF community feverish to try it out for itself. The first chance arrived with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-early-access-to-the-battlefield-6-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access Open Beta</a>. Another couple of days passed, and it was time for worldwide destruction. </p>



<p>This couldn’t have been more fitting as the BF6 beta destroyed all expectations, the game blew up, and Battlefield 6 destroyed CoD with over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> in the betas. With the Weekend 2 beta now finished, we need to see if you get one more chance to play before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-going-to-be-more-battlefield-6-betas">Is There Going to be More Battlefield 6 Betas?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It was a good run. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Comms page suggests that there will be no more Battlefield betas, and the next time you get to play BF6 is when the game comes out.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been playing the BF6 beta at any point, chances are you’ve been keeping up with the Battlefield Comms X page. This has been a constant source of information since day one. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA updates</a> to general bulletins on matchmaking, it has provided up-to-date details.</p>



<p>On August 18, it posted what appeared to be a farewell message on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> for BF6 beta testing:</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing throughout these Open Beta weekends. You made this truly special for us as you captured flags, controlled sectors, blew holes in buildings, charged into combat, nailed vehicles with RPGs, dove into fire to resurrect a teammate, sniped from different angles, pushed the line forward in tanks, and circled the battlefield in aerial combat. You truly showcased the huge variety of action-packed gameplay that is coming in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-come-out">When Does Battlefield 6 Come Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 is due for release on October 10, and this is likely the next time you get to play BF6.</strong></p>



<p>Unless something catastrophic happens between now and October 10, I think it’s a case of waiting a while until the full launch, as there won’t be any more betas. Battlefield Labs testing lasted many weeks. Thousands of hours were accrued during the Open Betas, too. I would hazard a guess that Battlefield Studios has accumulated all the data and feedback it needs.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Servers Closing Down Soon

The playlist options and game servers for Open Beta Weekend 2 will begin closing down in 1 hour at 12:00 UTC. Once the shut down starts, you’ll be able to continue to play until your match ends.

Thank you all for playing throughout these Open Beta</span></p></article></div>

<p>Did you get a chance to play any of the Battlefield 6 betas? What are your thoughts about the game ahead of its full-scale launch in October? I can’t wait, as we need a CoD alternative. Let me know what you think through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

      </div>
<p>Shenmue 3 Enhanced features overhauled visuals, performance boosts, and quality-of-life updates, although no new gameplay content has been confirmed. The original release did however have three pieces of DLC, including an additional story quest.</p><p>The enhancements confirmed for the new release include:</p><ul><li>Enhanced graphics and performance: sharpter textures, richer details, faster load times, and smoother gameplay.</li><li>4K texture uplift including for environments and characters.</li><li>DLSS/FSR support for supported platforms to enable upscaled graphics while maintaing smooth performance.</li><li>Increased NPC density. In particular, the city village of Niaowu will feature more characters populating the streets.</li><li>The option to play with a classic camera mode, based on the system in Shenmue 1 and 2. In the original games, you moved Ryo with the d-pad, while the left stick was for moving the camera from behind him, while holding the right trigger allows you to look freely in first-person.</li><li>Gameplay tweaks, including optional stamina system adjustments, health restoration before fights, and reduced money barriers to reduce the grind for progressing the story.</li><li>Option for skipping cutscenes and dialogue, while expanding the QTE timing window.</li><li>Menus will include helpful purchases alerted while navigation is also being streamlined.</li></ul><p>While the above quality-of-life improvements address some criticisms of the game, it will also be possible to toggle these changes so that the original experience of Shenmue 3 is preserved.</p><p>Shenmue 3 Enhanced marks a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-chapter-for-shenmue-3-has-been-teased/1100-6527913/" data-ref-id="1100-6527913">"new chapter"</a> for the game teased by Inin Games and Ys Net after they announced that they received the publishing rights for Shenmue 3 from previous publisher Deep Silver last year.</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shenmue-3-review-from-a-forgotten-time/1900-6417374/" data-ref-id="1900-6417374">Shenmue 3 review</a>, we said, "Shenmue 3 is certainly an interesting game thrown out of time, but that doesn't mean that it's always enjoyable to play."</p>

                <p>The Pokemon Company is making some big changes when it comes to the video game series' world championships. Over the weekend, the latest Worlds tournament took place in California, and as is usual for the event a number of announcements were made. The biggest one for the Pokemon Video Game Championships is that the upcoming pseudo-spin-off game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-champions/">Pokemon Champions</a> will be the main game at next year's Pokemon World Championships. On top of that, the game was also finally confirmed to be releasing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">A trailer announcing this news also revealed that Mega Evolution will feature in the "first set of regulations for Ranked Battles in Pokemon Champions." There was also a teaser for a new in-game device called the Omni Ring, which you can check out on Pokemon Champions' <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-gb/" rel="nofollow ">official website</a>. This will seemingly let you rotate between Mega Evolution and other similar abilities in the series like Z-Moves and Dynamaxing.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDOstmYXLVs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rDOstmYXLVs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-announced-for-switch-and-mobile/1100-6529752/">back in February</a>, details on Pokemon Champions are still pretty light overall.

It showed a bit about how you can recruit Pokemon, how you can change their stats, and the kinds of battles that will be available. You'll also be able to connect the game to Pokemon Home, and there's cross-platform support between the original Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2, and mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">A release date hasn't been set in stone just yet, but it is planned for release sometime in 2026 on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 iOS, and Android.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Direct presentation for tomorrow, Tuesday, August 19, 2025, that's 45-minutes long, featuring legendary game director and designer Masahiro Sakurai, that's all about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>The news first broke on the Nintendo Today app, before being published to social media, as we've seen Nintendo do several times now regarding major news and updates for its products. It'll kick off at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST, and you'll be able to watch it live on YouTube. </p>



<p>"<em>Join us on Aug 19 at 6am PT for a Kirby Air Riders Direct with director Mr. Sakurai</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders/status/1957432749125779831">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Kirby Air Riders account reads. "<em>The livestreamed presentation will last roughly 45 minutes and provide an in-depth look at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct 8.19.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtkHiB7WKf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It'll be the first we've seen of the first non-Smash Bros. game from Sakurai in years, and the first Switch 2 game directed by Sakurai. The game is also currently set to release sometime later this year, so it's likely that tomorrow's presentation will also include an official release date announcement, along with a bevy of information and gameplay footage of what to expect from the follow-up to the 2003 GameCube title, Kirby Air Ride.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-verdun-isonzo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gallipoli-is-isonzo-and-verdun-dev-blackmills-next-wwi-era-shooter.1272795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Verdun&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Isonzo&nbsp;</em>developer BlackMill Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli</em>, the next game in its series of World War I-set shooters, and it's promising "the most authentic WWI FPS battles yet".</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will shift the focus from the traditional European battlefields featured in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tannenberg-holding-historical-wolf-truce-event" rel="nofollow">previous games</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/verdun-christmas-truce-dlc-supports-charity" rel="nofollow">franchise</a> to those of the Middle Eastern front. That means you can expect a healthy dose of desert warfare alongside the usual "beach landings, historical classes, and realistic weaponry".</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3065940/view/834973992999715448" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, BlackMill says&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will come complete with its very own "signature game mode", and while the studio doesn't want to give too much away about that mode right now, it'll all revolve around momentum.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-explosive.jpg?itok=KaAK5DS9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-explosive.jpg?itok=owOReAWI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will continue its predecessors' focus on WWI-era realism.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will support 50 players and will split them into two teams. If you're on the attacking team, you'll need to try and complete your objectives as fast as you can, but the defending side will be trying to scupper you as you do so.</p>

<p>It sounds as though momentum will be incorporated as a gameplay mechanic rather than just a vague sense of initiative; BlackMill is promising opportunities to regain lost momentum other than completing objectives.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to improved gameplay and visuals in&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>compared to previous installments; the studio says it's "gone to great lengths to faithfully recreate" Middle Eastern front weaponry, which it says was "usually quite obsolete, weird, or both".</p>

<p>BlackMill is also promising "major improvements to progression, loadouts, cosmetics, and the health system", but you'll have to wait for future updates in order to learn specifics about how all of those things are being improved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-crouching.jpg?itok=QHbOtTL- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-crouching.jpg?itok=LD4xPdxg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can expect plenty of improvements in&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it lands, you can expect to play it on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starrupture-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starrupture-early-access-release-date-revealed-for-january.1272792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Creepy Jar has announced the Early Access release date for its open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, and it's set to launch on PC early next year.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1631270/view/597409112655921163" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>,&nbsp;<em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>will be coming to Steam Early Access on January 6th. Creepy Jar says it knows "you will need to wait a little bit longer than you originally anticipated" for the game's launch, but that the delay will mean "more polish [and] more improvements".</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafter game with base-building elements that was first revealed as part of the PC Gaming Show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/green-hell-dev-starrupture" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2023</a>. The name is a reference to the star at the heart of the game's solar system, which creates "extreme living conditions" for those residing on the planet nearby.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starrupture-early-access-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=Aaxun9oo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starrupture-early-access-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=h8uBugG8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Early Access next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Creepy Jar describes its game as a "first-person open world base-building game with advanced combat and tons of exploration" in which you can either play on your own or as part of a group.</p>

<p>You'll explore an "ever-changing open world" in which you'll have to construct a "complex industrial system" in order to "extract resources, produce goods and expand your base", in a similar fashion to titles like&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>Once the base is built, you'll also have to make sure you're defending it from the "hordes of alien monsters" that will lay siege to it, as well as the constantly-changing conditions of the planet on which you find yourself.</p>

<p>You can check out the Early Access release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, which also gives a pretty good sense of what you can expect from Creepy Jar's game, right here.</p>




<p><em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>is set to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 6th. You can read our very own Ashley's preview of the spacefaring base-builder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/starrupture-preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I was ready to skip MicroProse's just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deck-and-conn">Deck &amp; Conn</a>, on the grounds of it being far too early in the week for games that consist entirely of dials and rangefinders, but then a scrambled communique from Sin Vega alerted me to the fact that it's the work of Elissa Black, one of the peeps behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/objects-in-space">Objects In Space</a>, which I think is one of my top five <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space games</a>. So here we are. </p>
<p>At a glance, Deck &amp; Conn is Objects In Space, but turn-based and minus Objects In Space's slightly distracting 3D background elements. That's to say, it's a testing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategickal</a> simulation that seats you in front of a terrifying retro pixel display, and expects you to trace distress calls, manage your fretful crew, spin up torpedoes and so forth, all without bursting your puny monkey brain. </p><!--more-->
<p>It takes inspiration from older MicroProse games - the ones made by the MicroProse of the 1990s, before they got repeatedly bought and skinned and eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroProse#Brand_revival_(2018%E2%80%93present)">wrapped around the bones of a different company</a> - and the 1971 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> mainframe game, which is from before my time, though I think I've played one of its descendants in Thomas Spreen's Rescue!.</p>
<p>Being turn-based, Deck &amp; Conn should be a mite less stressful and exhilarating than Objects In Space, but I'm already having kittens over the sensor management tab in the screenshots. Remember: just because there's a dot on your radar doesn't mean that's where the ship you're fighting actually is. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The noble vessel you command in Deck &amp; Conn is "a Cold War-style nuclear corvette", which sounds about as safe as a bed of rusty nails. I'm guessing that it will not have enough reactor power for all the individual things you need it to do, prior to upgrades at least. Please brace to be impacted by these bullet points, direct from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3828500/Deck__Conn/">the Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Command a nuclear-powered space corvette in a Cold War-inspired sci-fi universe</li>
<li>Turn-based tactical combat with limited resources and system management</li>
<li>Dynamic campaign with war patrols, ship upgrades, and crew promotions</li>
<li>Individual combat scenarios to hone your tactical skills</li>
<li>Capture or destroy enemy ships to gain rewards and shape your legacy</li>
<li>Pixel art visuals inspired by early '90s MicroProse classics</li>
<li>Respond to HQ orders and make tough choices in the forever-war</li>
<li>Inspired by the 1971 Super Star Trek mainframe game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Black's other previous games include <a href="https://expectproblems.itch.io/swords-of-freeport">Swords Of Freeport</a>, "a text-mode social RPG heavily inspired by the style of Bulletin Board System door games from back in the '90s", which "is part MUD and part BBS Game - but without the need for a BBS. You can play it on your home machine alone, or play/install it on an internet-accessible machine where others can join you - anywhere they have terminal access."</p><p>That sounds like catnip to a certain venerable species of internet wayfarer. I think I prefer the space submarines personally. If you are similarly fond of astral tugboats with copious blind sides, you might enjoy playing or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-space-strategy-sim-nebulous-channels-eight-years-in-the-us-navy">reading about Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>.</p>
<p><em>Small disclosure: Sin Vega is an online acquaintance of Elissa Black from back in the day.</em></p>

<p>The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 leak has revealed that 16 6v6 maps will be available at launch. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 leaks have been surfacing in large numbers recently, with several new details emerging over the past couple of days. We recently learned that the upcoming title will feature some remastered maps and also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-leaks-remastered-maps-a-return-of-specialist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of specialist abilities</a>. Now, we know how many 6v6 maps will be available at launch. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-will-feature-13-original-6v6-maps">Black Ops 7 Will Feature 13 Original 6v6 Maps</h2>



<p>The details about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 6v6 maps come from a reliable COD leaker/insider, TheGhostOfHope. According to their recent post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957173644649488771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), 16 6v6 maps will be available at launch. Out of these, there are 13 original maps and three remastered ones from Black Ops 2. </p>



<p>Moreover, two maps will be available at launch for large-scale Skirmish, which features the leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-accidentally-reveals-20v20-wingsuit-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wingsuit mode</a>. Lastly, players can expect “plentiful” post-launch content. For comparison, Black Ops 6 had 12 6v6 maps at launch and 4 for Gunfight. </p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-characters-leaked">Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign Characters Leaked </h2>



<p>Hope also provided players with a Black Ops 7 campaign <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957124861173678175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> yesterday, which revealed which characters will be available for 4-person co-op. These include David “Section” Mason, Mike Harper, Eric Samuels, and Chloe “Karma” Lynch. However, as the information about the Black Ops 7 campaign characters and the launch maps doesn’t come from an official source, readers should treat it with caution. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta may be over, but there’s still work to be done to prepare for the release, with a fresh slew of exclusive rewards available to earn through the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 10</a>, Battlefield 6 is one of the most anticipated games of the year, which was proven by it taking just a few hours for over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million concurrent players</a> to assemble on Steam. </p>



<p>While it’s too late to earn the exclusive Battlefield 6 Open Beta rewards that were available, there’s now more loot to secure to bolster your locker before the game releases. Here are all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-rewards-amp-how-to-get-them">All Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Rewards &amp; How to Get Them</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Loot to earn. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Six exclusive cosmetic bundles are available in the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 pass, which will be immediately unlocked in Battlefield 6 on release.</strong></p>



<p>The rewards are cosmetic items, so won’t provide any boost to you in gameplay, but are a decent way of showing your support to the Battlefield franchise and you can flex on other players in the lobby with items they won’t be able to get their hands on.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass is available now and expires on October 7, just a few days before the release of Battlefield 6. In total, 30 exclusive rewards are available, as <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1957412193198100646]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on X</a> (formerly Twitter).</p>



<p>Check out all the exclusive rewards available in the pass in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Tier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Western Front Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Muller Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aurora Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Vehicle Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Blackburn Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Vehicle Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Commander Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Operator Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">49</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sovereign Soldier Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Operator Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">60</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-other-rewards-are-available">What Other Rewards Are Available?</h2>



<p><strong>While the highlight of the pass is undoubtedly the exclusive rewards available to secure for Battlefield 6, there’s plenty more up for grabs with 60 free tiers and over 50 new rewards.</strong></p>



<p>This includes a journey back in time through the Battlefield franchise, with rewards inspired by Battlefield 1, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, and Battlefield 4.</p>



<p>There are still a few months to go until Battlefield 6 releases, so working through the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass is a good way to kill time while you wait.</p>



<p>Are you planning on diving into Battlefield 2042 to unlock these exclusive Battlefield 6 rewards? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Production on the game began in earnest back in 2023, following the end of Sakurai's time overseeing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's lengthy schedule of downloadable content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no suggestion tomorrow's show will include any other Switch 2 games beyond Kirby Air Riders (sorry, Metroid fans).

Players can pick up the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle, and for aerial warfare, the A10 Warthog and SU-25TM Frogfoot are being pulled out of the vault so that they can be put back into service.</p>
