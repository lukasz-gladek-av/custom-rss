            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has some of the best character customization in Game Freak‚Äôs monster-taming series. Lumiose City‚Äôs wide array of fashion choices are a welcome change after </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>locked everyone into school uniforms, but the best addition is that none of these clothing items are gender-locked. So whether it‚Äôs skirts or long hair, whatever you see on the rack is yours to buy and wear as you please. The game is pretty fluid in how it lets players present themselves in the world, but even so, it‚Äôs got some gendered stuff in its story that some players aren‚Äôt thrilled about. However, the fashion freedom is helping people get around some of those limitations.</span></p>

 <p><span>When you pick your character‚Äôs initial appearance, you‚Äôre also picking whether the game will recognize them as male or female, regardless of what you‚Äôre wearing. However, you‚Äôre also picking who your rival is going to be. If you play as a male character, you‚Äôll be greeted by a young girl named Taunie when you arrive in Lumiose City. Conversely, a female trainer will meet Urbain, a boy who has a similar role and aesthetic, but is otherwise a different person. At first, I kinda figured this split would be in service of some shoehorned, heterosexual romantic subplot, but thankfully it never came to that. I rolled credits last night and I‚Äôm still not a hundred percent sure what the point of having these two characters is, beyond giving the main cast an even gender divide. Maybe I‚Äôll find out more as I make my way through the post-game. That said, some fans want to play as a girl and have Taunie on their team, or want to be a boy and hang out with Urbain. So while it‚Äôs not a perfect solution, some players are taking up crossdressing to present as one gender and still get their preferred rival.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Made The Xbox Ally X $1000, Not Microsoft]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asus-made-xbox-ally-price-not-microsoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-made-the-xbox-ally-x-1000-not-microsoft.1329781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (and Ally) have just been released, and they‚Äôre turning heads on account of a) their processing power and capabilities, and b) their eye-watering price tags. The Xbox Ally X will break the bank at $1,000, which is a huge hurdle for adoption. In a recent interview, Xbox‚Äôs president revealed that Microsoft didn‚Äôt have any guidance when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>It was stated that the Xbox Ally X at $1,000 and the Xbox Ally at $599 came straight from the head honchos and market analysts at ASUS, and neither Xbox nor Microsoft had a say in the price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-is-why-the-xbox-ally-x-is-so-expensive">This is Why The Xbox Ally X is So Expensive</h2>



<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment, offering cutting-edge handheld capabilities on a device that‚Äôs comfort redefined. It has a great battery life, neat cooling solutions, room for expansion, and a splash of RGB, all packaged alongside tactile buttons, a high-quality and durable screen, and punchy speakers.</p>



<p>That was all summed up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, anyway.</p>



<p>What the Xbox Ally X also has is a $1,000 price tag, which is enough to put off first-time buyers. In a recent interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Variety</a>, Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox, confirmed that Microsoft had no input whne it came to pricing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware. That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the staggering price point, Bond revealed that the Xbox Store sold out ‚Äòreally quickly‚Äô and suggested that the value that‚Äôs being given to gamers for the price is more than worthwhile.</p>



<p>But she has to say that, right?</p>



<p>Bond used the current line of Xbox marketing spiel to further promote the Xbox Ally X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It should be something you can have with you anywhere. You should be able to play any game you want with anyone you want on any device.</p>



<p>We want to make sure that people have a choice.</p>



<p>We want to make sure there‚Äôs an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what‚Äôs possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they‚Äôre a casual gamer, they‚Äôre a gaming enthusiast, then there‚Äôs Xbox Allys for them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think the pricing point for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is fair, or are you waiting for a price cut before you make that investment? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-nemesis-eris-icarus-moros-romance</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-will-romance-every-character-in-hades-2-but-under-duress.1329775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My relationship with <em>Hades 2</em> is very much a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJb4tWfpcOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuck you and I‚Äôll see you tomorrow</a>‚Äù situation. Do I endlessly complain about minor things that I don‚Äôt like about it, in its mechanics and its <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story</a>? Yes. Am I going to play another half dozen hours of it tonight? Also yes. As I continue to go deeper and deeper, as compelled as I am by essentially just getting more of <em>Hades</em>, it strikes me that so many of the returning features are basically the same, but just a little worse. Case in point: the romances.</p><p>I am a known dating game lover, and I found the romance options in the first <em>Hades</em> to be delightful, especially because of how unexpected they were. It‚Äôs already a narrative-heavy roguelike, stuffed to the brim with characters‚Äîbeing able to have a deeper connection to two of my favorites, Thanatos and Megaera, was a delight. <em>And</em> you could complete both of these romance arcs at the same time, and neither character would get mad at Zagreus!</p><p>In <em>Hades 2</em> you get double the romances, which I should love. The issue is that all these characters feel extremely similar to each other.</p><p>If you‚Äôre romancing women, you have the options of Nemesis and Eris. While they‚Äôre quite different from each other in terms of the way they talk and interact with the world, when it comes to player character Melinoe, the relationship is defined by high-key just hating her. Nemesis thinks that <em>she</em> should be the one to take down Chronos, who has taken over the underworld, and Eris is literally the goddess of strife and discord. So that‚Äôs my options for gay romance: two women who hate me.</p><p>The men aren‚Äôt much better. While I like both Moros and Icarus, they suffer from their personalities being too similar. Yes, they have different backstories and their stories with Melinoe play out differently, but they‚Äôre also both these sensitive, wilting men who leave me longing for a contrasting character. Like the women romances, their relationships with Melinoe are just too similar for me to have much of a motivation to seek them out. Like much of <em>Hades 2</em>, there‚Äôs more options, but it‚Äôs difference without distinction.</p><p>What‚Äôs so annoying is that there are other new characters who I would love to romance but pointedly cannot. Heracles and Odysseus are both probably too old for Melinoe, but they‚Äôre very different from each other, and from the existing romance options. Heracles, as you might imagine, is muscled and gruff, and while he also doesn‚Äôt like Melinoe on first blush, he respects her once he sees her in action. Odysseus is positioned as an older brother or uncle type, but he also spends the entire game calling Melinoe ‚Äúgoddess‚Äù in a way that makes me, the player, quite flustered‚Äîboth in myth and in this game, Odysseus has rizz. Most importantly, they are just different types of guys. They are different from each other, and from the existing romances.&nbsp;</p><p>I‚Äôve also wanted to romance Artemis since the first <em>Hades</em>, where her Olympian siblings teased her for having a crush on Zagreus. In <em>Hades 2</em> Artemis is once again a close friend who aids you in your struggle, and she‚Äôs also still gentle and sweet. I would love to have a chance to romance a female character who actually likes talking to me and being around me.</p><p>Mostly I feel like I‚Äôve lost out on characterization for Melinoe because all these romances are so similar. With both Nemesis and Eris, the main conflict in the romantic subplot is that they don‚Äôt like Melinoe, and they have to learn to get along. With Moros and Icarus, both these characters kind of already have a crush on Melinoe and have to learn to get over their shyness. With Zagreus, the romances expanded his character and allowed you to see him from different sides. With Melinoe, I feel like I‚Äôm just seeing the same aspects of her character explored over and over‚Äîthe way she clashes with women, and the way that she doesn‚Äôt see how reverent men are of her power.</p><p>Oh well. I guess I just have to play this game for another hundred hours.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6‚Äôs Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope"><h3>I Will Go Down Swinging Against Windows 11</h3></a><p>The end of support for Windows 10 is a mess</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-nemesis-eris-icarus-moros-romance]]></content:encoded>

<p>This year has been an incredible year for gaming. From highly anticipated sequels like Hades 2 and Hollow Knight: Silksong to surprising hits like Blue Prince and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, 2025 proved to be one of the better years for games at every level in recent memory. But if 2025 was great, a quick look at upcoming games suggests that next year might be even better. These are the most anticipated games for 2026.</p>



<p>With this list, only games that are first release and available on multiple platforms are eligible. That means games currently in early access, but planned to launch in 2026, don‚Äôt count. Also, if you‚Äôre looking for the most anticipated exclusives for consoles like the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and Nintendo Switch 2, those will be posted separately. </p>



<p>As of now, all of these games below are currently scheduled for a release next year. </p>

<figure data-uuid="1a93377be213f"><a title="Persona 3 Reload Opening Yukari" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a93377be213f/persona-3-reload-opening-yukari.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure><p>I‚Äôve been dreaming of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> port for Nintendo‚Äôs hybrid hardware long before the Switch 2 was even revealed. Having played through its lengthy campaign on my Xbox over the span of a month, I wished I was able to play more of this untethered from my couch. That clearly didn‚Äôt stop me from giving it all the time I had, and that desire to dive back in on flights and long <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/passenger-princess">Passenger Prince(ess)</a> drives has only gotten stronger since the announcement of a Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>While the best versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">5</a> have been playable on Switch for a few years, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_3_portable">Persona 3 Portable</a> ‚Äî which arrived the same time as 4 ‚Äî wasn‚Äôt always easy to recommend as it sacrifices some incredible animated cutscenes andthe 3D overworld is more like a 2D point-and-click. While you won‚Äôt find the option for a female playable protag in any version other than P3P, Reload is now regarded the essential way to experience the Dark Hour in the modern age. And later this week, it's available on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The original <strong>Persona 3</strong> and its revised <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/persona_3_fes">FES</a>. release have long been regarded as cult classics: Anyone who played the PS2 or PSP editions will likely have gone into Persona 3 Reload with a lot of nervous excitement. The game tackles a lot of heavy topics that a remake could have trouble reworking faithfully - hell, this is a game where chosen high schoolers fight demons at night by summoning more demons into the world by firing pistol-like 'Evokers' at their heads. Death is present in every part of Persona 3, but I think it‚Äôs handled eloquently.</p>
<p>With a remake, if you don‚Äôt have the right team behind a project to show it the unique kind of love it needs, you run the risk of losing the plot along the way. Thankfully, Persona 3 Reload was handled exceptionally from the leaders of the Persona series, P-Studio.</p>
<p>So, ahead of the remake's release on Switch 2, I was fortunate enough to chat with Kazuhisa Wada, P-Studio director and General Producer; Yoshihiro Komori, director of the Switch port; and Azusa Shimada, character artist on 3 Reload. I asked them about the performance of this Switch 2 edition, the difficulty of updating the S.E.E.S. uniform and their feelings on excluding the female protagonist from Reload.</p>
<p>You and I both have been waiting for this~</p>
<figure data-uuid="cb29fa36dfa47"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb29fa36dfa47/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): Atlus has grown the Persona series into quite a behemoth in recent years, so what led the team to choose Persona 3 Reload as their first game to release on this new platform over a spruced up version of Persona 5 or even the new spin-off, The Phantom X?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> The primary reason is that we wanted to release Persona 3 Reload on Nintendo hardware as early as possible, and the development and release for the Switch 2 proved to be the most suitable option. As a result, Persona 3 Reload became the first title for this platform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our primary focus was on optimizing the graphics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Persona 5 Royal has already been released for the Nintendo Switch, and is playable on the Switch 2. Considering that Phantom X is positioned as a live-service title, we believe Persona 3 Reload offers the most value as the first title for the platform.</p>
<p><strong>How do you even begin the process of re-developing a game that‚Äôs this long for another console, like Switch 2? What sort of things needed to be adjusted with this project and where does most of the time go when developing for a new console like this? We can only imagine how long it takes to playtest a project like this!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> The process of porting to the Switch 2 is broadly divided into two main tasks: 'porting the engine' and 'adjusting the game components.' Although this was the Persona Team‚Äôs first time developing for the Switch 2, the use of Unreal Engine made the engine porting process smooth overall.</p>
<p>By being able to create a build that would run on the Switch 2 relatively early in development, we were able to focus our efforts on adjusting the game's components.</p>
<p>Regarding the game itself, no new content was added. Instead, our primary focus was on optimizing the graphics. Given that the Switch 2 has differing hardware performance between TV mode and handheld mode, adjustments were required to ensure optimal visual quality for each mode.</p>
<p>We meticulously fine-tuned the graphics for specific scenes, such as the various floors of Tartarus and event sequences. Additionally, because this title features a very long gameplay duration, a significant amount of time was devoted to QA (quality assurance).</p>
<figure data-uuid="01dba5a28ceb0"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01dba5a28ceb0/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the Switch 2 version will release Episode Aigis simultaneously, we needed to conduct checks for this content in parallel, further extending the QA period.</p>
<p>Alongside the graphical optimizations, the QA team was tasked with carefully checking the processing load for each scene. This aspect added substantial effort to the development process.</p>
<p><strong>While playing on a home console or a PC often offers better visuals and performance, playing Persona games on the go on a handheld device is the way many of us here at Nintendo Life prefer to play! Grinding out a few floors of Tartarus feels perfectly suited for a long train ride or a long flight.</strong> <strong>Have you ever been able to pull any data to see what percentage of Persona users (hehe) prefer to play these games on a handheld device?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> This is truly a game experience that you can enjoy for an extended period of time, we understand players will appreciate having ways to play in the style of their choice. We are genuinely delighted that the game can now be played on a portable device as well.</p>
<p>We hope you take the opportunity to enjoy Persona 3 Reload to the fullest, even while on the go!</p>
<p><strong>The demo that was recently released on the Switch 2 eShop shows the game running at 30FPS, but with some frame rate hiccups. Is the team hoping to have those problems worked out for the final release of the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> We are currently taking steps to improve this. Since careful QA is required, it was difficult to address this in time for the main game‚Äôs release but will be in future patches.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c897dcafbaf35"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c897dcafbaf35/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are you considering offering any graphical options to players to let them choose if they‚Äôd prefer better performance or better visuals? Choosing between 30fps and 60fps would be really nice to see! Persona 3 Reload looks great in still images on Switch 2, but we think some players would also take smoother performance over visual quality if they could choose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> Thank you for your interest in our work and for giving us your request. We have also been positively considering increasing the frame rate; however, for this release, we prioritized delivering the Switch 2 version to everyone as quickly as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We aimed to create changes that would give players the impression of 'powered up and back better than ever!'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, we regret to inform you that there are currently no plans to implement this kind of requested feature at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Implementing new designs into a well loved, pre-existing world like Persona 3 can be a tricky thing to get right. So we were so surprised to see how sharp and slick the new S.E.E.S. uniforms that are introduced in Reload! Do you remember at what point in development it was decided to change up their uniforms and do you have any original concept sketches you could share?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Azusa Shimada (Character Designer):</strong> The concept for the new S.E.E.S. uniforms was gradually developed starting in the early stages of development. Initially, the idea stemmed from the need for unique visuals that would be distinctive to this iteration of the game from a promotional perspective. This prompted discussions with Soejima-san (Shigenori Soejima, the original character designer) about what aspects could be refined.</p>
<p>We aimed to create changes that would give players the impression of 'powered up and back better than ever!' as a defining symbol of this evolution, leading to the adoption of the new combat gear design.</p>
<p>Around the same time, concept for the new mechanic, 'Theurgy,' was also being developed, and it turned out that the two elements worked well thematically. This fortunate alignment allowed everything to come together into its current form.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d06812386e53a"><a title="Persona 3 Reload Concept Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d06812386e53a/persona-3-reload-concept-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Concept art of the new S.E.E.S. uniforms ‚Äî <em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Persona 3 Reload offers multiple romance paths, but since you need multiple playthroughs of the game to see them all, we're curious if there was a common choice amongst the development team for who to choose first? If we can only choose one, who would you say we choose?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> That‚Äôs such a very difficult question to answer‚Ä¶ For me personally, from all the Persona 3 related stories, my favorite was Fuuka. However, from Persona 3 Reload, I feel Yukari has become so much cuter. I might have to pick her.</p>
<p>Lotus Juice, who does the rap vocals for the soundtrack, was a Fuuka fan like myself, but last I heard, he‚Äôs switched over to Mitsuru.</p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> If I were to choose one person to romance, I would choose Aigis. The questions she asks‚ÄîWhat is life? What is love? What is the relationship between the heart and the body?‚Äîare all deeply fascinating.</p>
<p>Recently, I‚Äôve been engaging in dialogues about these topics at Philosophy Caf√©s (casual gatherings for philosophical dialogues). Exploring these questions with a partner‚Äînot just as abstract philosophical inquiries, but as real, tangible decisions on how I relate to someone important‚Äîwould be a truly romantic and intimate experience.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1e29d91822b8b"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e29d91822b8b/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How big is the development team that‚Äôs working on this Switch 2 edition and how has it felt being able to bring this beloved game to such a wide platform like Nintendo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> The porting process to the Switch 2 turned out to be unexpectedly smooth, allowing us to develop the project at a relatively compact scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The questions she asks‚ÄîWhat is life? What is love? What is the relationship between the heart and the body?‚Äîare all deeply fascinating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our hope, given that the Nintendo platform has such a broad user base, is for many players‚Äîparticularly younger audiences who have not yet experienced Persona‚Äîto try the series for the first time. Since Persona hasn‚Äôt had many new releases on Nintendo hardware yet, we believe there are still a lot of potential players who haven‚Äôt had the chance to play it.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that this opportunity will help more people fall in love with 'Persona' and immerse themselves in the series!</p>
<p><strong>We‚Äôve read in other interviews that the thought of adding the female protagonist into Persona 3 Reload would just be too costly of a task, but can you share any more insight into what those internal discussions were like and if you ever had any thoughts to pay homage to her in other ways within the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> When it comes to whether we are able to represent her in this game, though it saddens me to have to say this, the answer for Persona 3 Reload would be 'no.'</p>
<p>As developers, we have absolutely no intention of neglecting her, but this heartbreaking decision was made after much deliberation. We have a mission to continue working on various new games as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Soejima-san] truly is a man with a heart of gold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If asked what we feel remains unfinished in the context of Persona 3, this would undoubtedly be one of those things. However, we are working together as a team to develop various initiatives for future endeavors, and we hope you will look forward to what lies ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p><strong>This last one isn't really a question, I just want to pass along my sincere thanks for bringing this game for Switch 2. Persona 3 is my personal favorite in the series, and I'm so excited for Nintendo fans to be able to experience the full package like this, with all of the new bells and whistles that Reload brings! It's such a delightful heart felt game, and it ranks amongst my favorite games of all time. I also had the chance to meet Soejima-san at Summer Game Fest in 2023 while demoing Metaphor, and it really is a memory I'll cherish forever. He was so kind, so please send my thanks!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> I will make sure to convey this to Soejima-san. He truly is a man with a heart of gold.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for praising Persona 3 Reload. It means a lot to us! It is voices like yours that inspire us to dedicate our lives to game development and keep us going. Your support motivates us to deliver even more remarkable gaming experiences that meet your expectations.</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued support and encouragement!</p>

<p><em>Persona 3 Reload goes all out Nintendo Switch 2 on Thursday, October 23rd; a demo is already available on the eShop that lets you carry over all of your save data into the full release!</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks to Sega, Atlus and the team for helping coordinate this interview for us.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-embark-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon%E2%80%99s-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-%E2%80%9Cthey-were-a-great-a-b-test-%E2%80%9D-says-embark-studios.1329739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in April, ARC Raiders and Marathon both hosted playtests that coincidentally overlapped with each other, and according to Embark Studios' technical director, while that was entirely a coincidence, it proved beneficial for ARC Raiders and for Embark Studios.</p>



<p>Embark Studios just got done hosting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">'Server Slam Test' this past weekend</a>, where the game was available for free on all platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S) for players to hop into from October 17-19. As far as we know, it went well, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2427520/charts/">game's Steam concurrent players peaking at 189,668</a>, and it'll be interesting to see what Embark Studios takes from this playtest to implement in the final game.</p>



<p>Some learnings however didn't come from feedback on ARC Raiders at all. When speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">PC Gamer</a>, technical director on ARC Raiders, Virgil Watkins, admitted that Marathon overlapping playtest worked as a good compare and contrast for what Embark Studios was doing with ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>"<em>It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen</em>," said Watkins. "<em>It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours</em>."</p>



<p>Watkins doesn't identify any concrete examples, or claim that he and the rest of Embark Studios have been watching over Marathon like hawks, but it makes perfect sense that both teams would be eying each other, if only because they're both making extraction shooters.</p>



<p>While this past weekend's server slam test was undoubtedly popular, it'll be interesting to see how ARC Raiders does when it's on shelves. Unlike Embark Studios other major title, The Finals, it is not a free-to-play experience, so it doesn't have that same appeal of players being able to just give the game a try to see how they like it.</p>



<p>And with regards to Marathon, we know that Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">is hosting a closed test later this month</a> that is invite-only and under an NDA, though the future for that game is far more uncertain than the future for ARC Raiders.</p>

            <p>
There should have been two major extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> launching in the last quarter of this year. One of them is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, which is in fact coming out later this month. The other is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, which, well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">you know</a>. Interestingly, though, with both games hosting tests earlier in the year, there was an opportunity for Arc Raiders' developers to learn something from Marathon.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">PC Gamer</a>, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said how it was "very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen. It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."
</p>
<p>
In particular, Watkins notes how the Arc Raiders team was able to gauge how people responded to the pair of extraction shooters' differing takes on the genre. "[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours," he explained.
</p>
<p>
It is worth pointing out that Watkins said he hasn't been deeply inspecting the game or anything, only a select few have been able to play Marathon. Bungie's shooter is obviously in troubled waters currently, but Watkins is curious to see what becomes of it, saying he "[found] the art style very evocative ‚Ä¶ I'm personally curious to see how that ends up. I hope to see more of that in the future."
</p><p>
Arc Raiders held its final playtest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-final-free-arc-raiders-open-playtest-is-rolling-out-now-showing-off-quests-progression-and-crafting">over the weekend</a> and it seems to have gone quite well, so I myself am curious to see whether the full release will be the one to bring extraction shooters out of its deep niche well. Marathon is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-shows-signs-of-life-with-a-closed-network-test-scheduled-for-later-this-month">set to hold another test this week</a>, but this one is under NDA, so don't necessarily expect to hear anything about it (even if you can probably bet on someone breaking said NDA for Reddit karma or whatever the kids are into these days).

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield Is Going Through An Identity Crisis</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At the beginning of the year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/">wouldn't rule out Starfield coming to PS5</a>. Then, in March, the Bethesda Creation Kit website even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-still-not-confirmed-but-new-evidence-emerges/1100-6530141/">featured a PS5 logo for a Starfield mod</a> at one point.</p><p dir="ltr">Starfield might come to more than just PS5, too, as NateTheHate2 previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-leaker-claims/1100-6534121/">the RPG is set to release on Switch 2 in 2026</a>. Xbox is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-order-of-giants-looks-like-the-best-of-the-great-circle-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-too/1100-6534094/">bringing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to Switch 2</a> next year, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-big-xbox-published-games-are-getting-ps5-exclusive-physical-editions/1100-6532423/">PS5 has seen plenty of big Xbox-published games</a>. As such, there is clearly precedent for Xbox to support these systems with its titles.</p><p>Originally launching in 2023, Starfield is only available for PC and Xbox Series X|S currently.

                <p>Absolum launched earlier this month to strong reviews from players and critics alike, thanks to its compelling blend of traditional beat-'em-up action with the replayability and unpredictability of roguelikes and its striking dark fantasy graphic novel art style. While it originally launched as a digital-only title on PCs and consoles, it's now getting a physical release on PS5 and Switch. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCYQ1SWW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> version is already available, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCYRW2LN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a> version releases on October 24. Both are available for $40 at Amazon, which appears to be one of the few retailers to still have the Absolum physical edition in stock--so grab this one while you can.</p><div title="6535558 - Absolum Physical Edition" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4742" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535558 - Absolum Physical Edition" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCYRW2LN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FCYRW2LN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCYRW2LN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Absolum</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCYRW2LN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FCYRW2LN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCYRW2LN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$40</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The physical version of Absolum includes the base game plus a digital soundtrack by composer Gareth Coker.</p><p><span>As mentioned above, the physical edition has sold out at most retailers, including </span><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Popular+Indie+Rogulite+Absolum+Is+Getting+A+Physical+Release+On+PS5+And+Switch&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-10-20+07%3A34%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-20+10%3A56%3A19&amp;fnarticle_id=6535558&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fabsolum%2F20023132.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fabsolum-physical-edition-preorder-guide%2F1100-6535558%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a><span> and </span><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Popular+Indie+Rogulite+Absolum+Is+Getting+A+Physical+Release+On+PS5+And+Switch&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-10-20+07%3A34%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-20+10%3A56%3A19&amp;fnarticle_id=6535558&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dabsolum%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fabsolum-physical-edition-preorder-guide%2F1100-6535558%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a><span>.

Fanatical is also running its Scream Sale right now, so you'll also get a free game for spending over $15.</span></p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Absolum, the game mixes side-scrolling beat-'em-up gameplay with action RPG elements and a rouglite structure, and presents it all in a flashy graphic novel art style. The closest comparison is Vanillaware's Dragon's Crown, or the roguelike mode in Streets of Rage 4--which makes sense, considering Absolum was made by Guard Crush Games, which worked on Streets of Rage 4 alongside Lizard Cube.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/absolum-review-a-sleeper-hit/1900-6418419/" data-ref-id="1900-6418419">Absolum review</a> awarded the game an impressive 9/10, noting its fantastic fluid combat, compelling gameplay loop, and eye-catching visuals. "By tapping into a primordial part of gaming history, Absolum has created something that feels revelatory," wrote critic Steve Watts. "The beat-'em-up genre feels changed, now, and I don't know if there's any going back."</p><p>If you're looking to add more modern beat-'em-ups and side-scrolling action games to your collection, you can also grab Guard Crush Games' previous work with the physical edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Streets-Rage-4-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B088B42K9S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Streets of Rage 4</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%98s-map-will-reportedly-turn-into-springfield-from-the-simpsons-next-month.1329691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rumors have swirled for weeks now that the next <em>Fortnite</em> season would be a mini-season themed around Fox‚Äôs long-running animated series <em>The Simpsons.</em> Now we have new info from reliable leakers that claims the popular battle royale‚Äôs next big update will replace the game‚Äôs map with a virtual Springfield from the show.</p> <p>In September, reliable <em>Fortnite</em> insiders like HypeX and Shiina began reporting that the next season of<em> Fortnite</em> would be a <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season. Then, earlier this month, dataminers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706">discovered Kang and Kodos inside <em>Fortnite‚Äôs</em> files</a>. Descriptions of the two characters mention them not being included in the battle pass, seemingly confirming that the rumors of a <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season, complete with a battle pass, were true. Now those same insiders are reporting that the mini-season will replace <em>Fortnite</em>‚Äòs current battle royale map with a Springfield-inspired battlefield.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">SIMPSONS x FORTNITE MAP IS FULLY SPRINGFIELD</p> <p>Also a Nuclear Plant POI ‚Äî VIA <a href="https://twitter.com/NotPaloleaks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NotPaloleaks</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpushFNBR</a> <a href="https://t.co/s6H40GbEyK">pic.twitter.com/s6H40GbEyK</a></p> <p>‚Äî HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1979986181413622240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On October 19, multiple <em>Fortnite</em> leakers, including Hypex, <span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks">NotPaloleaks</a>, and </span><span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR">SpushFNBR,</a> began reporting that the mini-season‚Äôs map would arrive in November and will be ‚Äúfully Springfield.‚Äù Previously, some had theorized that part of Springfield would be added to the current battle royale map, but it sounds like that‚Äôs not the case. Instead, it‚Äôs claimed that the entire <em>Fortnite</em> map will be replaced with Springfield for the reportedly month-long event. <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Battle">That‚Äôs similar to how past mini-seasons have worked</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks/status/1980303035936165911">Paloleaks further reported that the map will be cel-shaded</a>, matching the look of the animated series. It‚Äôs also claimed that the new <em>Simpsons</em> season will include mash-up skins, likely mixing and matching <em>Simpsons</em> characters with <em>Fortnite</em> characters. I can‚Äôt wait to see what Epic does with Peely. Perhaps a Moleman x Peely skin that will make everyone question their sanity?&nbsp;</span></p> <p>As a giant <em>Simpsons</em> fan, I‚Äôm both excited about this <em>Fortnite</em> news and scared that I‚Äôm going to end up spending far too much money on a bunch of silly digital skins. <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">Yes, I know, I‚Äôm part of the problem and I‚Äôm sorry</a>. Epic hasn‚Äôt confirmed the new <em>Simpsons</em> season yet, and likely won‚Äôt until we get closer to November. Until then, I‚Äôll just rewatch Treehouse of Horror episodes and mourn the loss of <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Simpsons Tapped Out,</em> the last new <em>Simpsons</em> game released in over a decade</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>When The Outer Worlds launched back in 2019, it features humorous but often sharp writing highlighting the pitfalls of capitalistic ideals and the way markets interact with leaders in power. The Outer Worlds 2 promises even more of that, with a new governing trio fighting for control of the colony of Arcadia, and your Earth Directorate hero somehow in the center of it all.&nbsp;</p><p>With The Outer Worlds 2 launching on October 29 (or as early as Thursday if you buy the more expensive Premium Edition), we spoke to developer Obsidian Entertainment to learn more about how the team tackled its second bout with space-faring capitalism and whether or not real life plays a role in how it crafts its messages.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Unfortunately, those things haven't fixed [themselves]. I'm shocked," creative director Leonard Boyarsky sarcastically tells <em>Game Informer </em>when asked about capitalism's role in The Outer Worlds 2. "These are kind of unfortunately timeless themes that we have to deal with, and we kind of always deal with it in our games. We've always been involved in themes of power and balance, and it has to do with people having power and what they're going to do with that power, and it's generally not good for the people who don't have power, whether it's the Protectorate, who is full authoritarian and makes no bones about being a complete dictatorship [or] it's Auntie's Choice, which is trying to find this better way of spinning things so you feel like you're working for yourself [...] but you're still basically just helping them out."</p><p>When asked whether The Outer Worlds 2 reflects changes in capitalistic thought in the six years since the launch of the first game, Boyarsky says Obsidian doesn't try to be that timely. "These are universal themes, and if we time it too close to something going on in the world at a specific time, it gets very dated quickly," he adds. "And again, unfortunately, the bigger themes don't seem to change all that much from recorded history to now. People who have power tend to abuse the people who don't."&nbsp;</p><p>Though Obsidian says the real-world acquisition it went through ‚Äì joining Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios ‚Äì had no effect on the messaging within The Outer Worlds 2, curiously, Moon Man-fronted Spacer's Choice and Auntie Cleo's have merged in this sequel to create Auntie's Choice. This new organization represents the merchants of the game's trio of power, which consists of the aforementioned Auntie's Choice, the monarchy (Protectorate), and the church (Order of the Ascendant).&nbsp;</p><p>Boyarsky says the idea of this merger actually happened relatively early in the sequel's development. Two narrative designers who worked on the first game &nbsp;‚Äì Boyarsky notes they aren't "at the company anymore unfortunately" ‚Äì came up with the idea of merging Spacer's Choice and Auntie Cleo's.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was the natural way to go," he says. "To put them together, it made the most sense. They were the ones out of everybody in all of the corporations in the colony; they were the ones who seemed to have the most presence. Putting them together was a no-brainer."&nbsp;</p><p>He and game director Brandon Adler tease that players will have to see how Auntie's Choice handles its role in this trio of power in The Outer Worlds 2 when it launches this month.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/09/30/the-outer-worlds-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story for The Outer Worlds 2</a> is available to read right now if you're a subscriber (and this issue is shipping to mailboxes as we speak).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the launch of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally handhelds, not to mention the rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft's own handheld projects are dead in the water</a>, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Variety</a> that the company is absolutely still looking at making new hardware in the future: </p>



<p><em>We are 100% looking at making things in the future. We have our next-gen hardware in development. We‚Äôve been looking at prototyping, designing. We have a partnership we‚Äôve announced with AMD around it, so that is coming. What we saw here was an opportunity to innovate in a new way and to bring gamers another choice, in addition to our next-gen hardware. We are always listening to what players and creators want. When there is demand for innovation, we‚Äôre going to build it.</em></p>



<p>Specifically with regards to the Xbox/Windows handheld experience, Bond said Microsoft is already looking at many software improvements:</p>



<p><em>There‚Äôs a ton more innovation to come, including things like further optimizing the experience here, scaling out the handheld compatibility program, offering more benefits and improvements to the experience and other features and adds that we‚Äôre going to give to people and more choices and more games.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the ROG Xbox Ally X got a 7.5 out of 10 score. Reviewer David Carcasole pointed the high price and lack of support for actual Xbox games as negatives:</p>



<p><em>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful, capable, and comfortable PC handheld device, with a smooth user experience thanks to the new Xbox UI. It's really like taking your computer on the go, with all of your PC games in your hands. For its mix of improved hardware, user experience, and battery efficiency, it's arguably the best PC handheld device to buy on the market. It's not an entirely smooth experience though, with plenty of PC gaming hiccups interrupting the 'console-like' experience the device is supposed to provide, the fact that it actually doesn't let you play all your Xbox games, and what I still believe to be an exorbitant price tag, when cheaper devices can provide comparable experiences.</em></p>

            <p>
Though I deeply wish for it to not be the case, unfortunately the reality you and I find ourselves in is one where AI is being forced into every single crevice the worst corporations you know can fit it in to. It hasn't completely dominated any of the arts just yet, but its usage is becoming more and more common. If you're one such developer considering doing so, voluntarily, I would normally offer you some potentially unkind words, but instead I'll point you towards the one and only Nobuo Uematsu, whose stance on AI is one I'm quite fond of.
</p>
<p>
The iconic Final Fantasy composer recently spoke to <a href="https://www.jasrac.or.jp/magazine/interview/25/251010.html">JARSAC Magazine</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-says-hes-never-used-generative-ai-and-never-will-hardship-is-what-makes-the-creative-process-rewarding/">Automaton</a>), talking about his time in the games industry, and notably how he feels about AI. "I‚Äôve never used AI and probably never will," Uematsu explained. "I think it still feels more rewarding to go through the hardships of creating something myself. When you listen to music, the fun is also in discovering the background of the person who created it, right? AI does not have that kind of background though. 
</p>
<p>
"Even when it comes to live performances, music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections."
</p>
<p>
This, my friends, is the only reasonable response to AI. There really is an inherent value in the process of making something, it lets you discover something unexpected in the thing you're making that putting in a short prompt could never let you experience. Have a bad time making things once in a while! This is Uematsu we're talking about here, he knows a thing or two about this art thing.
</p><p>
It's also worth noting that the composer announced last year that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasys-legendary-composer-nobuo-uematsu-doesnt-have-the-strength-to-score-a-full-video-game-again">likely won't be producing a full video game score again</a>, even if he does plan to keep making music in general (including writing the Final Fantasy games' main themes). I bring this up as he specifically mentioned not having the physical or mental strength to do so anymore. Accessibility is often touted as a reason why AI is good, but even here Uematsu shows that it's still possible to make things even when there are limitations to what and how much you can produce.

              <p>A demo for a free <a href="https://kotaku.com/impressive-simpsons-hit-run-remake-was-made-by-one-f-1847530115"><em>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</em></a> mod that turns the beloved game into a <em>Futurama</em> adventure is finally here, around four years after the project was first revealed.</p> <p><em>Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em> is a still-in-development total conversion mod of 2003‚Äôs <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run">Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a>,</em> a fan-favorite semi-open-world game based on the long-running animated TV show and featuring most of the original voice cast and writers. <em>Hit &amp; Run</em> is one of those PS2-era games that has a large fanbase of older fans who desperately want a sequel. But what‚Äôs even better than a sequel? A whole new game based on a different animated comedy created by Matt Groening.</p>  <p>On October 19, Slurm Team (a collection of fan modders and devs) released the <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48">first playable demo for<em> Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em></a><em>.</em> The free demo features the mod‚Äôs first level and is a small slice of the planned full project, <a href="https://youtu.be/5vhFwQmTD5c">which was first announced back in 2021</a>. Still, what is here is impressive and could easily be mistaken for a game that was released back on the PS2 in the early 00s. It should be noted that the devs behind the mod confirm that the demo contains AI-generated voices, but those will be replaced with real voice actor performances in the full release.&nbsp; Honestly, calling this a mod doesn‚Äôt feel accurate, as <em>Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em> is more like a new game built using the engine and tech of the OG <em>Simpsons</em> version. Here‚Äôs some gameplay of the demo:</p>

  <p>Considering how few <em>Futurama</em> games we got back in the day, and how we‚Äôre currently in the middle of a <em>Simpsons</em> video game drought (with <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Tapped Ou</em>t being shut down</a> in 2024), projects like this are the closest things fans of either animated show can hope for in 2025. Well, besides <em>Fortnite</em> skins and events, like a rumored <em>Simpsons</em> event coming to Epic‚Äôs battle royale juggernaut later this year. That might be fun, but I‚Äôll still be over here longing for a new<em> Hit &amp; Run</em> starring Homer and the family. <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-hit-and-run-2-sequel-remake-remaster-planes-1851038958">There were plans to make a sequel back in the day, but it never happened.</a></p> <p>Until then, I can play this new&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Futurama</i>&nbsp;mod using&nbsp;<a href="https://donutteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://donutteam.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Donut Team‚Äôs fan-developed modern PC port of Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a><i data-stringify-type="italic">,</i>&nbsp;available here.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-that-happened-in-the-outer-worlds-so-you-know-it-all-before-playing-the-outer-worlds-2.1329643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>This article contains spoilers for 2019's The Outer Worlds.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With The Outer Worlds 2 imminently about to drop, we think it's a good time to brush up on the fundamentals of Obsidian's high-concept sci-ifi universe and recount the events of the first game. The next 2,000 words or so will work nicely as a refresher for people who finished The Outer Worlds ages ago, and also as a primer for those of you diving into the sequel without any prior knowledge. It goes without saying, then, that what follows contains <strong>spoilers </strong>for The Outer Worlds 1. If you don't want anything spoiled... well, the long and short of it is that unregulated capitalism is bad. That's enough to get you going with The Outer Worlds 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you didn't come here for tl;dr. You clicked on an article to read it, so here's everything that happened in The Outer Worlds. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-parvati-1760711875065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Divergence</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds' story arguably starts in 1901 with a non-event. That is, President William McKinley not getting assassinated by an anarchist for failing to regulate the corporations, and subsequently, uh, leaving the corporations unregulated for the rest of his term and apparently for the rest of time, putting humanity on course to colonise the stars, but as an entrenched, hyper-capitalist society in which workers rights are not remotely a concept. So this is like a nightmare version of Star Trek where everything sucks unless you‚Äôre absurdly rich. Thank god this is just fiction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward a few hundred years, and The Earth Directorate, a one-world government established after a devastating war, is granting licenses to various conglomerates to go off and colonise distant planets, the titular Outer Worlds. We don‚Äôt know exactly how many galaxies have been colonised, but multiple systems are mentioned through the course of the game, including Septerra, Tyrannus, Draconis, and from the upcoming Outer Worlds 2, Arcadia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 isn't a direct sequel to its predecessor, so that's <em>technically </em>everything you need to know. But there's every chance that some<em>one</em> or some<em>thing</em> from the original game will make an appearance, be that as a side character, easter egg, or even an important event in the story. So read on to brush up on everything that happens prior to your adventure in game two. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lost Hope</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Our story occurs in the troubled system of Halcyon, and that trouble starts before the colonisation effort even reaches the system. Of the two vast colony ships sent there, only one arrives on time - The Groundbreaker. After seeding all the inhabitable planets with colonists, it becomes an independent freeport space station and floating strip mall, an essential hub for trade at the intersection between small time private enterprise and the rest of the corporation-controlled system. The second ship, the Hope, carrying tens of thousands of scientists and thinkers in suspended animation, has a skip drive malfunction enroute from Earth and ends up limping to Halcyon at sublight speeds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presumed lost, it is then discovered by The Board, Halcyon‚Äôs corporate overlords, and instead of being allowed to complete its journey, it is tethered to a remote ice moon and hidden from view. The Board don‚Äôt have the tech or the will to revive the Hope colonists, and they don‚Äôt want to have to deal with a public outcry about it, either. And so they are content to let it remain frozen and forgotten in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, however, irks one of their scientists, one Phineas Welles, who is so incensed by The Board‚Äôs inaction that he takes matters into his own hands and starts experimenting, in secret, on the Hope‚Äôs colonists in order to find a viable method of resurrecting them after all this time. He succeeds, but not before becoming a disgraced outlaw and the most wanted man in the entire system.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-phinneas-welles-1760711674865.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the resurrection process requires lots of rare material that‚Äôs difficult to gather when you‚Äôre on the run, and so Phineas decides to use his one and only test batch of revival serum on a single Hope colonist. In a last-ditch raid on the abandoned starship, he selects someone to revive at random in the hopes that they will become a loyal ally and help him finish his grand scheme: to revive every Hope colonist, seed the Halcyon system with smart people who aren‚Äôt idiots, and free the colonies from corporate control. He successfully does so, but not without his own ship sustaining significant damage, grounding it permanently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who he revives depends on <em>you</em>, the player, and their skills and character traits depend on your choices in both the character creator and the game‚Äôs narrative. And so begins a grand choice and consequence story in which the optimum outcomes are locked behind gates of competency ‚Äì that is, if this heroic Stranger wants to achieve the most free and least bloody outcome for the people of Halcyon, they‚Äôre gonna need to pass some lofty speech checks. And we‚Äôre assuming that‚Äôs what they did, because covering every possible permutation of The Outer Worlds' story would take far more time than any of us reasonably has.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Unplanned Variable</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the player character arrives ‚Äì almost forty years late ‚Äì to the Halcyon system, The Board is content to preside over a system of shocking inequality, maintaining control through stifling bureaucracy and manufactured scarcity. But not every worker is a mindless drone, as we find out in Emerald Vale: the first major test of The Stranger‚Äôs resourcefulness, charisma, and political savvy - an opening chapter that sets the blueprint for all the conflicts to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, The Stranger needs a ride, and a guide. Welles arranges with a known privateer and general Han Solo archetype, Captain Hawthorn, to meet The Stranger on the planet Terra 2. Unfortunately what Hawthorn actually meets is the Stranger's drop pod, violently, with the top of his head. This leads The Stranger to commandeer Hawthorn's now captainless ship, The Unreliable - a sort of chubby Millennium Falcon with a feisty onboard computer - and take off on a grand interplanetary adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uh, except, not yet: it turns out that The Unreliable needs a replacement power regulator before it can go, which is annoying, but the pursuit of a new one does give The Stranger an opportunity to recruit two immensely useful companions: engineer Parvati and philosophical space-priest Vicar Max, both of whom provide boosts to The Stranger‚Äôs crucial Persuade and Intimidate skills, vital for the wheeling and dealing that lies ahead.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-emerald-vale-1760711576596.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After checking in with the boss of Emerald Vale‚Äôs biggest corporate town and Spacer‚Äôs Choice Saltuna cannery, Reed Tobson, it turns out that there are two power regulators in the area: one in his factory, which he is understandably reluctant to give up, and one at an abandoned Botanical Lab, now home to a set of deserters who, disillusioned with the systemic mistreatment they experienced as lifelong, sometimes multi-generational indentured employees of Spacer‚Äôs Choice, have decided to found a new cooperative society free from company oversight. Unfortunately, this means that the Saltuna Cannery is chronically understaffed, and so Reed asks you to cut off their power at the local plant in order to force his workers back into the fold, which will make it safe for you to nab their power regulator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a solid plan, but it does come with the downside of propping up an odious bootlicking toad like Reed at the expense of people whose only crime is wanting to be free of a system that is hostile to them. The obvious alternative is to screw him over and divert power to the Botanical Lab, but effectively killing the town of Edgewater at the same time ‚Äì not only is Edgewater a safe walled city where people live, it is also the home of companion Parvati, so destroying it comes with a significant personal cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, however, an optimal solution: The Stranger decides to shut down the Botanical Labs and take its power regulator, initially making an enemy of the deserter leader Adelaide, but convinces Reed Tobson to step down as leader of Edgewater, cleverly using his own company loyalty against him by pointing out that he‚Äôs remarkably crap at his job, and that the best outcome for Spacer‚Äôs Choice is for him to just disappear. Morbid, sure, but they could have just shot him, so this really is the best outcome for all concerned. The Deserters return to the town, Adelaide takes over as administrator from Reed, and sets about making the colony more sustainable by growing food in soil enriched by, uh, corpses. Which is fine. Look, however you slice it, life is cheap here. There is, as it turns out, no perfect solution to any of Halcyon‚Äôs problems ‚Äì but this way, the people of Edgewater get a little more health and happiness without having to give up the corporate infrastructure they so rely on.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Groundbreaker</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With a freshly installed power regulator and an eager new crew, The Stranger sets off to Groundbreaker Station, Halcyon‚Äôs premiere shopping destination and hive of scum and villainy. Most of it of the white collar variety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There, they recruit two more companions: Felix, a canny dockworker with a high Persuade boost, and Ellie, a roving sawbones loyal only to her next pay packet who comes complete with a boost to the party‚Äôs lying skills.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-ellie-1760711774908.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stranger‚Äôs next task involves visiting the moon of Monarch, but this is tricky because the planet has been deemed off-limits by The Board as it is subject to an entrenched civil war and a communications blackout. Having been cut off from board oversight, it‚Äôs generally assumed that the place is bad news. Bad News, however, is The Stranger‚Äôs middle name. Or names. It‚Äôs not really. But look, nothing will deter The Stranger from going there, not even a corporate embargo or risk of certain death. They demonstrate this determination by doing a bunch of busywork in another semi-abandoned corporate settlement just to get enough bits to buy an illicit black market navkey to the town of Stellar Bay in the Cascadia region of Monarch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Clearing the Air</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Phineas needs to procure a rare substance called Dimethyl Sulfoxide in large quantities to revive all the colonists still frozen on The Hope. To track some down, he‚Äôs made a deal with an information broker on Monarch with the help of Nyoka, The Unreliable‚Äôs final recruitable companion, but has yet to receive the intel for reasons unknown. So he sends The Stranger there in his stead to find and retrieve this vital piece of the puzzle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon arriving on Monarch, The Stranger makes contact with Nyoka and sets off to Devil‚Äôs Peak, the ominous horned mountain that hosts a large communications station where the Information Broker is currently holed up, and learns (after doing lots of murder, like, loads and loads of it) that the reason Phineas hasn‚Äôt received the intel is that the region‚Äôs communications are being drowned out by pervasive broadcasts by Monarch Stellar Industries, the corporate remnant still holding onto power on Monarch, and The Iconoclasts, a group of anarchists determined to free the colony of Board control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is like the Edgewater vs Deserters situation on steroids, and confirms what Phineas has told you about Halcyon: the system is falling apart, and The Board are content to let it, rather than relinquish its stranglehold on the workers. But The Stranger is remarkably good at brokering impossible deals ‚Äì getting people from opposing factions to see reason, and work together toward a common goal. They work this magic on Monarch, first to end the broadcasts and free up the comms tower to send Phineas his intel, and then ‚Äì just as an encore, you understand ‚Äì put an end to the conflict entirely with a little deposing here, a bit of finessing there. Turns out diplomacy's a piece of piss.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-rizzos-1760712004193.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Byzantium</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sorting out the mess on Monarch provided a strong foundation for the health of the Halcyon system going forward, but there still remained the issue of The Board and their sheer indifference to the horrific conditions that people are having to live with outside of their glittering capital city of Byzantium ‚Äì which is exactly where the intel sends The Stranger in order to retrieve those vital chemicals, which are being used by The Board to run experiments on human test subjects in suspended animation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that The Board‚Äôs answer to the Halcyon system‚Äôs collapsing economy and total lack of food security is the Lifetime Employment Program ‚Äì a scheme where all of Halcyon‚Äôs workers will be placed in indefinite suspended animation, revived only when needed, in order to reserve the colony‚Äôs dwindling food supplies for the societal elite in Byzantium. And, y‚Äôknow, their scientists will totally get onto fixing the whole food shortage thing in the meantime. Definitely. Yep. Oh, and this involves killing everyone left on board The Hope to make space in the fridge for this planned batch of worker popsicles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This being unconscionable, The Stranger shuts down the board‚Äôs research and retrieves the Dimethyl Sulfoxide, the second to last piece of the puzzle needed to revive the Hope colonists. The final piece being the ship itself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Endgame</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Phineas sends The Stranger back to where it all started, the Hope, with a plan to restart its skip drive and bring it to Terra 2, so the work of reviving its colonists ‚Äì said to be Halcyon‚Äôs best and brightest ‚Äì can get underway. It is Phineas‚Äôs belief that they will be able to solve the colony‚Äôs food shortages and systemic conflicts with science, technology, and pragmatism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the ship is retrieved, though, it is discovered that Phineas‚Äôs secret lab has been ransacked, and he himself imprisoned on Tartarus, Halcyon‚Äôs infamous penal colony. The fight that ensues involves almost everyone The Stranger helped out on their travels up to that point ‚Äì with both the MSI and the Iconoclasts showing up as allies to assist in this cosmic prison break, along with the crew of The Groundbreaker itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite a certain acceptable level of bloodshed being inevitable, The Stranger‚Äôs progressive reputation, history of even-handed pragmatism, and relative lack of a murderous streak puts them in a position to negotiate peacefully for Phineas‚Äôs release, locking in his vision for reviving the Hope colonists, and setting its brilliant thinkers on the path to fixing the colonies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halcyon system was not saved by violent action, but by negotiation, compromise, and calculated political manoeuvring. And also a bit of violence. A smidge. A necessary pinch of shooting and battering. Also petty theft and the odd swindle. But mostly the whole diplomacy thing. And via these actions, a ragtag group of colonists from all walks of life managed to deliver true, lasting systemic change to Halcyon before going their separate ways and their ship, The Unreliable, falling into legend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also at some point they lost contact with Earth and nobody knows what happened to it. I guess we‚Äôll find out in The Outer Worlds 2 ‚Äì a game on which, as far as we know, almost none of this has any bearing whatsoever. Still, saves you having to play it again, right?</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-story-recap]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Five Nights at Freddy's series started as a humble point-and-click survival horror game and has expanded into a multimedia franchise with surprisingly dense lore that spans dozens of video games, books, graphic novels, and movies. If you're looking to get up to speed on the Five Nights at Freddy's universe, the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nights-Freddys-Ultimate-Guide-Version/dp/1546169296?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Five Nights at Freddy's Ultimate Guide Version 2.0</a> can do just that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Friends, you might not know it by scrolling through my author page here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, but there were a few years where I was really disillusioned with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-games-best-worst-part-scarlet-violet-red-blue-1850084491"><i><span>Pok√©mon</span></i></a><span>. For a few generations, I played the games, but I wasn‚Äôt living and breathing Game Freak‚Äôs monster-catching RPGs like I am now and did as a kid. This wasn‚Äôt because the games weren‚Äôt resonating with me, but because I‚Äôd been kind of annoyed by the types of competitive-focused fans I suddenly found myself surrounded by in my high school years. All these years later, </span><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has you encountering a group of similarly snobby, pretentious, gatekeeping </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pok√©mon</span></i></a> <span>battlers, and putting the smack down on them was one of the most karmically satisfying moments in the game for me.</span></p> <p><span>As the kids around me grew up in my small Georgia hometown, it seemed like their relationship to </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>changed. They stopped caring about who their favorite little guys were and started crunching numbers and making spreadsheets, suddenly becoming very concerned about the competitive viability of these monsters above all else. I tell a guy Beautifly is one of my favorite Pok√©mon and he starts preaching to me about how she‚Äôs a weak point in my team because she‚Äôs a frail bug. Bro, I don‚Äôt give a fuck, look how pretty she is. Eventually, the constant competitive-focused conversational detours those people insisted upon became so obnoxious, they pushed me out of the space. </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>was always a social outlet for me, so to feel like I couldn‚Äôt really connect with other people through our mutual love of the world and its mysterious creatures soured me on it almost entirely.</span></p>

 <p><span>Eventually, I found my way back. The </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>game was the first step back in the door, as its mystery adventure mechanics and hopeful view of the </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>universe struck a chord with me in 2018. Then the movie came out, the </span><i><span>Let‚Äôs Go </span></i><span>games and </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span> had me tethered to my Switch, and I could not have been more back. I watch competitive play at arm‚Äôs length, but I‚Äôm still hankering to go to the World Championships some day. By and large, though, I play these games for the worldbuilding, the story, and to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>hang out with Raichu</span></a><span>. Don‚Äôt tell me how to make my Pok√©mon better for a hypothetical tournament I‚Äôll never compete in. I do not wish to know.</span></p>

  <p><span>I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way, either, as evidenced by a group of kids in </span><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> who call in Lumiose City‚Äôs mob equivalent to, with your help, get some competitive snobs to leave them alone. Lumiose City has a group called the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, which is led by the fairy-type trainer Jacinthe, a rich socialite who has a large amount of influence in the Paris-inspired metropolis. She is also, as you will come to find out, someone who insists upon herself, shows up uninvited, and puts literal barriers up to trap people into doing what she wants, and she seems to be involved in some kind of odd, fetishistic relationship in which she makes Lebanne dress up as a maid as some kind of humiliation ritual. That insistence seems to trickle down to the rest of the SBC members, as our first encounter with them is during a quest in which the player is running errands for the Rust Syndicate. A pair of these elites has started hounding a group of children, probably aged between five and eight, about how to make their Pok√©mon the Very Best Like No One Ever Was. Are you feeding your Pok√©mon the right supplements to ensure they‚Äôre competitively viable? If not, the SBC will come find you and pester you in broad daylight.</span></p>

The kids run up to me with distressed looks on their faces, and say they were just having battles on their own before the two people dressed way too well to be hanging out on a battle court started ‚Äúlecturing‚Äù them about the importance of competitive viability. ‚ÄúI bet they‚Äôre just trying to show off to us because nobody their own age will put up with them,‚Äù one says. And despite all their insistence upon their own competitive superiority, my team wipes them out, and they go running off to their homebase with their Slowpoke tails between their legs. It was cathartic.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>is such an expansive franchise that it can mean different things to different people. Some fans only engage with the games, others with the anime or card game, and some may just like having plushes on their desk. A series this big and broad is never just one thing to everybody, and trying to insist that it should be is the kind of toxicity that pushes people out. There will always be bad apples in the community that want everyone to conform to their vision of things, but at least I got to send my own personal </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>snobs packing.</span></p>

<figure data-uuid="b51b6ca716c9a"><a title="3DS Virtual Console" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b51b6ca716c9a/3ds-virtual-console.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's time to talk trademarks again, as Nintendo of America has had a new filing for 'Virtual Console' bumped up to the pending phase. But let's be clear right from the jump, it <em>probably</em> doesn't mean what you're thinking.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT" tabindex="-1">@MikeOdysseyYT</a> on X, the <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=79425775&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">trademark</a> was initially submitted on 21st April 2025, and got boosted up to the pending phase last week on 17th October. The application pertains to two different goods and services classes: IC 009 for "Recorded electronic game programs; downloadable electronic game programs; recorded video game programs" and the like, and IC 041 for "Providing non-downloadable online electronic publications, namely online journals and interactive online blogs featuring user generated or specified content in the field of video games and online publications in the nature of e-books in the field of video games" amongst other things.</p>
<p>NOA currently has two other trademarks for Virtual Console (one renewed in <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77975875&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">2018</a> and one in <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77014121&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">2020</a>), each of which is only linked to one of the two 'Goods and Services' classes outlined above.</p>

<p>But does this mean that Virtual Console will be making a comeback? Probably not, honestly. Trademarking is a long-running game of protection, and Nintendo is <em>always</em> on top of it. The company issues renewals all the time, ensuring that its wording, names and IP all remain under the same legal umbrella ‚Äî some of them turn into something, but most of them are just to keep everything on lock.</p>
<p>That said, this <em>isn't</em> a renewal. The application in question is for a new trademark, with the two pre-existing Virtual Console ones staying where they are. The fact that the newbie compiles the Goods and Services classes of the two others makes us think that this is just a pre-emptive way to move everything into one neat TM, but excited speculation is bound to lean in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Even putting the typical behaviour of trademarks to one side, we can't imagine that Nintendo would be considering bringing back the Virtual Console program while it continues to put Nintendo Switch Online front and centre. Sure, it would be lovely to get the chance to buy some of these classics on modern hardware, but why risk NSO subs in the process?</p>
<p>So yes, there may soon be a new trademark in town, but let's not get those hopes up, eh?</p>
