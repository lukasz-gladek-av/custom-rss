            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The rivalry between Samsung and Apple extends far beyond smartphones, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the premium… earbuds market. Apple just launched the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, despite being a few months older, pack even more powerful (AI) features under the hood.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">has slashed these pro-level earbuds from $249 down to $189, an all-time low that makes Apple’s pricing look almost unreasonable</a>. If you’ve been tired of dealing with mediocre sound quality on crowded commutes or struggling to hear your calls clearly in noisy environments, these earbuds solve those exact frustrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Samsung has redone the fit and comfort formula with the Buds 3 Pro, and abandoned that classic in-ear rubber tip form that lots of us find uncomfortable after a long period of wear. Instead, it uses a <strong>new ergonomic form that holds pressure more evenly across your ear</strong> so you’re able to wear these for extended periods of time on long flights, work marathons or at the gym without that pesky pain that causes you to reach for relief.</p>
<h2>Why They Beat Other Earbuds</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro’s<strong> active noise cancellation works on a different plane than budget models and actually holds its own with Apple’s</strong>. Samsung uses adaptive ANC tech that’s always scanning your world and tweaking cancellation power in real time. What this means in practical terms is that the earbuds automatically understand that you transitioned from a quiet office to a noisy street and turn up the cancellation. It’s a profound difference: plane engine hum vanishes, subway roaring dissipates, and that noisy coworker’s keyboard typing is barely a nuisance.</p>



<p>The sound-optimizing feature uses AI to analyze what you’re listening to and shifts equalizer settings automatically&nbsp;: If you switch from a podcast to a bass-heavy hip-hop beat, your earbuds sense this move and shift audio profile dynamically. This happens transparently in the background so you get studio-quality sound on every kind of content without having to manually shift settings via an app.</p>
<p>Call quality has been wireless earbuds’ Achilles’ heel, but the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro remediate this with a <strong>high-end three-microphone system on each bud</strong>. They work in conjunction with <strong>AI-driven voice processing</strong> to separate your voice from ambient noises. On video or phone calls, others at the receiving end will hear you distinctly even if you’re strolling on a windy street or at a coffee shop. The wind cancelling algorithm identifies that pesky whooshing sound that always compromises outside calls, making these buds truly useful for individuals who work from home or receive calls on foot.</p>



<p>Battery life comes in at approximately <strong>six hours with ANC active, with a further 24 hours of juice contained in a charged case</strong>. There’s a rapid charge facility that delivers an hour of listening time from a mere five minutes in the case, which comes in useful on hurried mornings which you had planned to charge overnight. Support for wireless charging allows you to plonk the case on any Qi-enabled pad which adds a convenient touch to your day.</p>
<p>This special Amazon exclusive release comes with a <strong>two-year extended warranty</strong> instead of a typical warranty of one year. With a price tag of just $189, which is below that of most mid-range pairs that cannot compete with such powerful noise cancellation, sound, or intelligent features, it really is almost ridiculous that they undercut AirPods Pro 3 by such an amount.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-has-laid-off-19-employees-at-red-storm-entertainment/1100-6533043/" data-ref-id="1100-6533043">laid off devs at Red Storm Entertainment</a> amid a larger restructuring of the company, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">spin-off subsidy with Tencent</a> that will focus on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. Now, Ubisoft is looking to shed even more developers, and it's been called out online by fans and industry figures for the way it characterized layoffs as a "voluntary career transition."</p><p>The affected studio is Massive Entertainment, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.  The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-brand-trouble-for-disappointing-outlaws-sales/1100-6533297/" data-ref-id="1100-6533297">failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations</a>, but Ubisoft did not say if that's why staff are being let go. In the message shared below, Ubisoft states that it has "introduced a voluntary career transition program giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance."</p><p>Some observers have called that "corporate speak," but it's also reminiscent of Newspeak from 1984. Either way, the responses have been swift.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/SolomonGloom/status/1981103204310941805" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">That's a pretty fancy way of saying you're doing layoffs.</p>  — Solomon Gloom (@SolomonGloom) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonGloom/status/1981103204310941805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/AntoineCheriet/status/1981036397910724902" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This is, without question, one of the most poorly written layoff press release I’ve ever read in my life.</p>  — Antoine Cheriet (@AntoineCheriet) <a href="https://twitter.com/AntoineCheriet/status/1981036397910724902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MiguelRaimundo_/status/1981028618449916008" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">"Hello Ai: Write a statement where we announce that we are laying off a bunch of people without saying we are laying off a bunch of people, thanks."</p>  — Miguel Raimundo (@MiguelRaimundo_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MiguelRaimundo_/status/1981028618449916008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bugasm16/status/1981042903540781076" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">dang. i didnt know division 2: survivors was reffering to the staff.</p>  — Bugasm (@bugasm16) <a href="https://twitter.com/bugasm16/status/1981042903540781076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The account for DayZ Badlands even trolled Ubisoft with an announcement of its own.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DayZ/status/1981047838457921920" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Official non AI Statement:<br>We are massively committed to driving a massive wave of transformation that aligns with our massive vision for the future of entertainment.

                <p dir="ltr">2025 has been a tumultuous year for the Xbox brand, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/">massive layoffs</a>, multiple price hikes for both its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">console portfolio</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/">Game Pass subscriptions</a>, and continued controversy over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-devs-call-for-microsoft-to-stop-working-with-israel/1100-6533901/">Microsoft's work with Israel</a> casting a shadow over the company's gaming wing.

The report says that the new target was set by Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, whose team has "taken a larger role in the gaming business in recent years."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589647"></a><figcaption>Perfect Dark, which was cancelled in July 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For context, as Schreier reports, estimates from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence mark the average profit margin for the entire video game industry at between 17 percent to 22 percent since 2018, with Xbox specifically coming in between 10 and 20 percent.</p><p dir="ltr">Bloomberg's report also indicates that the requirement for Xbox first-party games to be available on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service has hurt software sales overall. However, Xbox has employed a "member-weighted value" credit system which, as the report states, "is calculated based on several factors, such as the number of hours that Game Pass players collectively spend on a particular title."</p><p dir="ltr">Part of Xbox's new strategy has been releasing first-party games on competing consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5 have all launched on PlayStation 5 in recent months, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">notable success</a> according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-games-are-doing-super-well-on-playstation-store-publisher-tops-preorder-charts/1100-6531273/" data-ref-id="1100-6531273">sales figures</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Those familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that "moving forward, games that are either cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls may take priority over riskier bets." Xbox has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#11">cancelled multiple projects</a> recently in pursuit of this 30 percent goal, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rares-canceled-xbox-title-everwild-finally-seen-in-leaked-screenshots/1100-6535397/">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">The Initiative's Perfect Dark</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/">Zenimax's Project Blackbird</a>--all of which were in development for nearly a decade--among the biggest cancellations.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft's next earnings report is currently scheduled for October 29.

<p>"We could only go so far with the current licenses"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> dev Poncle continues to drop hints about the upcoming ver. 1.14 update — planned for release at some point next week — and the latest reveal is a fresh batch of content for the sublime <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors_ode_to_castlevania">Ode to Castlevania</a> DLC.</p>
<p>As seen in the above trailer, the 'vania DLC will soon be treated to a huge batch of fresh content, including 16 new characters, three new weapons and evolutions, 13 new weapon unions, another chapter in the 'Ode to Catlevania Adventure', and 12 new music tracks.</p>
<p>"In terms of characters, we've actually tried to go for some even deeper cuts," Poncle noted in a new post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/498334899948748889?l=english">Steam</a>, "but we could only go so far with the current licenses". The dev continued, "In other words, if popular/obvious/interesting characters are missing, it's only because of the complexity of getting the new licenses we needed for them was prohibiting for both us and our collaborators at Konami".</p>
<p>That's not to say that the upcoming additions aren't interesting, mind you. If you don't want the incoming newbies spoiled, then look away now, but Poncle has shared that the update will add the following 16 familiar faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugh Baldwin</li>
<li>Morris Baldwin</li>
<li>Annette</li>
<li>Tera</li>
<li>Atlantis Shrine Wizard</li>
<li>Drolta Zuentes</li>
<li>Astarte</li>
<li>Actrise</li>
<li>Zephyr</li>
<li>Jiangshi</li>
<li>Persephone</li>
<li>Slogra &amp; Gaibon</li>
<li>Genya Arikado</li>
<li>Fake Trio</li>
<li>Ruler Sword</li>
<li>Stone Skull</li>
</ul>
<p>Gosh, talk about some deep cuts, eh? "When we said 'Everyone is here' we meant EVERYONE!", the dev clarified. Hey, it's not wrong.</p>
<p>Poncle has been sharing info about the update's fresh features over the course of the last few weeks. Aside from the Ode to Castlevania expansion, ver. 1.14 will also pack in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/vampire-survivors-to-bring-more-chaos-with-online-co-op">online co-op</a> functionality and a gambling 'Westwoods' mode, and there's <em>still</em> more to be revealed.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for when all of this arrives on Switch next week.</p>

            <p>Two Ubisoft studios have announced plans to cut back staff, though one of them is trying to encourage people to lay themselves off in the form of "a voluntary career transition program". The studios in question are Ubisoft Massive - creators of Tom Clancy's The Division, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - and Ubisoft Redlynx, creators of the multiplayer gadabout Trials biking games.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Yesterday, a Massive representative posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386779718370422784/">LinkedIn</a> that "[as] part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games.
</p>
<p>"To support this transition responsibly," the post goes on, "we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance."
</p>
<p>It's good that people are getting some apparently decent severance in return for realigning themselves into the rubbish bin, but that may not be much consolation for developers weighing the odds of future, involuntary layoffs on less favourable terms. Massive haven't specified how many roles they hope to cut, and at what point they will deem themselves to have been sufficiently "realigned". Quit now for a juicier leaving package, or stick around because you enjoy your job and thereby, increase the odds of being sacked down the road? 
</p><p>Massive haven't had a brilliant couple of years. Last year's Star Wars: Outlaws was much-hyped, as you might expect given that it's an open world game bearing the stamp of Lucas, but it proved to be merely a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">"perfectly OK bit of Star War"</a> and had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">a "softer than expected" launch</a>. Its commercial struggles were a big factor in Ubisoft's decision to delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until they could be sure of doing the right numbers. Massive's current projects include Tom Clancy's The Division 3, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced in 2023</a>. We've heard little about it since. The Division 2 was said to be performing <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-to-restructure-as-creative-houses-as-q1-25-26-financials-come-in-lower-than-expected">"strongly"</a> in the company's most recent earnings report, but that's following Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">closure</a> of one of the game's support studios in January.
</p>
<p>All the above doom-mongering notwithstanding, the Massive people potentially affected are definitely in a happier situation than their colleagues at RedLynx. Ubisoft have <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">just announced</a> a "restructuring proposal" for the studio, to be thrashed out in collective negotiations with staff. Said negotiations primarily "concern the production and administration teams", and are all in the name of transforming Redlynx "from a multiplatform setup to a studio specialized in small screens". 
</p>
<p>The post adds that Redlynx have "two unannounced mobile projects" in the offing, in addition to a technology team who work on Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine. The proposal aims to trim the books by a maximum of 60 members of staff, and the negotiations are scheduled to run from October 30th till end of November.
</p>
<p>While the chief worry here is how many people will lose their livelihoods, I'm also saddened to hear that Ubisoft want Redlynx to shift away from PC and console, inasmuch as it means RPS will have less opportunity to write about Trials, a wonderfully daft party game.</p><p>It's of course noteworthy that neither Redlynx nor Massive appear to be part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft's new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a>, now called Vantage Studios, which is dedicated to Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six - regarded by Tencent as the juiciest parts of the Ubisoft pineapple. Anything that falls outside that core money-spinning operation appears to be more in danger of "realignment". In July, Ubisoft announced that they would reorganise the rest of their operation into "creative houses", with a view to being more "agile" and "focussed". Best of luck to all the rank-and-file devs mixed up in all this.</p>

            <p>Big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch alert. Seriously, it's massive. Dubbed the Unjust: 4.1.0 update, this behemoth boasts of having attempted to murder more than 200 bugs, alongside delivering some performance optimisation and gun balancing tweaks.</p>
<p>A healthy suite of changes indeed, and one that looks worth the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-need-just-a-smidge-more-time-for-that-next-helldivers-2-patch-promises-a-healthy-suite-of-optimisations">bit of extra wait</a>, assuming it does what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Arrowhead design director Niklas Malmborg and gameplay designer Lennart Holmgren dissect the Unjust: 4.1.0 update over the course of about a half hour in the video above, but we'll delve into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/538868565209514366?l=english">full notes</a>.</p>
<p>"This update focuses on what matters most right now: making Helldivers 2 feel better to play," they read. "We’ve overhauled how we approach patching to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us. That means more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most. Over 200 bugs have been fixed, along with key balance updates and quality-of-life improvements. While new features are coming, this patch marks a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it. More refinements are already underway."</p><p>Outside of the fixes, it's worth reading through the mountain of gun balancing adjustments. Primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems should generally feel more effective, while SMGs and pistols have been specifically targeted with changes aimed at making them great in close-quarters fights, but less viable at long range.</p>
<p>How weapons with differing rates of penetration perform has also been looked into, with light penetration guns having been tweaked to "generally deal a higher percentage of their total damage against durable enemies" in an effort to set them apart from their medium penetration brethren. A bunch of enemies have undergone tweaks aiming to ensure you can effectively splatter them with both those levels of penetration. As part of that, the fearsome Terminid dragon roach has had its spawn rate decreased and can now be taken out by solely targeting its wings, which have been made more vulnerable to explosions and given their own health pool.</p>
<p>That's a quick rundown, but as I say, it's worth reading through the full thing if you're planning on dropping in soon. Here's hoping this effort Arrowhead are now putting into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">stabilising everything before ploughing ahead with more additions</a> pays dividends.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-ditches-galaxy-z-flip7-on-amazon-now-going-for-pennies-on-the-dollar.1332511/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one smartphone that fashion lovers and trendsetters have been obsessing over, it’s the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7</strong>. This premium flip phone isn’t just a tech gadget, it’s a statement piece that solves the eternal struggle of wanting a full-sized smartphone that actually fits in your pocket.</p>
<p>Here’s the good news: Samsung seems to be quietly moving stock through Amazon rather than their official site, and right now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/"> you can snag this 256GB beauty for $849 instead of the usual $1,099</a>. That’s a $250 discount on a phone that rarely sees price cuts this aggressive, and honestly, we’re kind of obsessed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip7 addresses something we’ve all felt: that moment when you’re trying to stuff your phone into a clutch, a tight jeans pocket or a small bag and it just won’t cooperate. This <strong>phone literally folds in half and gives you all the screen real estate you need when it’s open</strong> (perfect for scrolling, watching videos, or texting), then collapsing into a compact square that slips anywhere. It’s the best of both worlds without compromise.</p>
<h2>Why This Flip Phone Upends It All</h2>
<p>Samsung has genuinely improved the <em>FlexWindow</em> on the Z Flip7, that outside screen you get when you close the phone. This no longer just shows notifications: With this new <em>MultiStar</em> integration, you get to personalize this external cover screen with your favorite apps, your widgets and shortcuts. This revamped edge-to-edge display gets everything more in reach, gets rid of that awkward moment of reaching for your phone for just about anything.</p>



<p><em>Now Bar</em> feature warrants a special mention as it actually simplifies your life. This smart strip on your cover screen gives you contextual information during your day. Watching a sports game? You get live scores. In the middle of a workout? You get your progress. Waiting for a delivery? You get your tracking information there. All this comes without opening your phone, which translates to staying informed but not getting bogged down in that endless scroll pit.</p>



<p>Google Gemini integration with FlexWindow raises the bar for convenience: You’re able to <strong>carry on complete conversations with Gemini’s AI assistant</strong> directly from the cover screen, asking questions, making reminders, or getting directions without taking your hands off the wheel. Galaxy AI-driven Now Brief identifies your patterns and automatically brings to your attention personalized information, such as your day’s calendar summary in the morning, bad-weather alerts, or traffic for your commute.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexCam</em> feature is where this phone comes into its own for content creators, as well as for selfie takers: Since the phone is able to support itself at different angles at a partially unfolded state, you’re provided with a <strong>built-in tripod for hand’s free photos as well as videos</strong>. Auto Zoom ensures that you’re always perfectly framed, whether you’re alone or with a crowd, automatically zooming in to get everyone in shot. No more struggling to hold your phone at arms length or asking strangers for a photo.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the Z Flip7 won’t compromise on performance for its slender body. Multitasking with its powerful processor, from playing games to video editing, will come easy, as will not having to constantly search for power outlets with its all-day battery. With storage of 256GB, you get ample storage for your photos, apps, and videos with no worries about running out of storage space. This matters as you’ll be taking lots of <strong>high-quality shots with a 50MP main camera</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an <strong>unlocked phone with a full one-year factory warranty</strong> from Samsung, which means you’re free to use it with any wireless carrier and won’t worry about quality. This phone at a price of just $849 offers an <strong>all-time lowest price</strong> for a phone that was originally launched at a price of $1,099 a few months ago.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-wants-xbox-to-hit-a-30-profit-margin-well-above-industry-standard.1332508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report has outlined that Microsoft wants Xbox to hit higher profit margins, with the goal for the gaming division to hit a profit margin of 30%, a number which is well above the industry standard. The target has resulted in Xbox canceling several different projects, raising both its console and subscription service prices, and cutting thousands of jobs over the last 24 months.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>‘s Jason Schreier and Dina Bass, Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood, has reportedly set a target to achieve 30% “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox.</p>



<p>As revealed in the report, the target of 30% is significantly higher than the industry standard for the video game industry, with past averages ranging between 17-22%, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>



<p>In 2023, Microsoft reported a mere 12% profit margin for its gaming division, with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence estimates revealing that the industry, on average, has not gone past 22% for at least since 2018.</p>



<p>In July 2025, this new target by Microsoft saw the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-was-perfect-dark-canceled-xbox-game-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark by The Initiative canceled</a> – a project that was reportedly in development for around seven years. Its cancellation saw the shutdown of The Initiative studio. Rare’s Everwild, another project that was in development for around seven years, was also canceled around the same time.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-was-everwild-canceled-xbox-game-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal memo obtained by Insider Gaming</a> from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, the cancellations were due to the “focus on strategic growth areas.”</p>



<p>In the last two years, Microsoft has seen several high-figure layoffs, with Xbox also being impacted.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox’s new internal target of 30% profit margins? Do you think it can be achieved, or will we continue to see Xbox canceling projects, raising prices, and laying off its employees?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-broadcast-bethesda-reveals-what-it-has-planned-for-the-show">Fallout Day upon us</a> and rumors swirling around remakes, remasters, and even new games in the famous post-apocalyptic role-playing series, one Hollywood star has made his thoughts crystal clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That star is Danny Trejo, whose appearances in the likes of From Dusk till Dawn, Con Air, and Spy Kids made him a cult figure. But he’s intimately familiar with Fallout, too, having played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-new-vegas/Raul_Tejada">Raul Alfonso Tejada</a>, a Ghoul companion, in the much-loved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it stands to reason that Trejo would, like so many fans, love to see Fallout: New Vegas return in some fashion. Responding to Bethesda’s official Instagram post on what to expect from Fallout Day, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallout/p/DQHdlH_jQeS/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trejo said</a>: “Remaster New Vegas boss!” alongside a fire emoji. Trejo has 3.1 million followers on Instagram, so his comment will be heard loud across the social network.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, a Fallout: New Vegas remaster was not on Bethesda’s official list of games set to appear during its Fallout Day broadcast, which is set for 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UK today, October 23. Specifically on Fallout 76, Bethesda will show more of the Burning Springs update. This big expansion, due out in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline"><u>sees Walton Goggins reprise his fan-favorite role as The Ghoul from the Fallout TV show</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Shelter is also mentioned, as is Fallout 4 and Creations, which suggests the decade old role-playing game will get some new content soon. Creations are community created mods released officially for Bethesda’s video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are new merch drops, community in-person events, and a post-show celebrating the community. There is no specific mention of the Fallout TV show, either. with Season 2 due out in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gettyimages-2230689584-1761216214306.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Danny Trejo wants Bethesda to remaster Fallout: New Vegas. Photo by Alberto Rodriguez/Variety via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Danny Trejo should have a word?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>New action games, in the style of Devil May Cry and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, need to offer more than just great graphics. That's what Hideki Kamiya thinks, and he should know - he's behind some of the genre's very best, including Bayonetta and Devil May Cry.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55371">Famitsu</a> alongside Morbid Metal creator Felix Schade (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-says-pretty-graphics-alone-dont-do-much-for-him-a-good-action-game-needs-mechanics-no-other-game-has/">Automaton</a>), Kamiya has expressed his desire to create new mechanics in his games and not just focus on making them look more visually impressive - a part of the conversation that came about after explaining how the door loading screens in the original Resident Evil were added to stop players staring at a black screen for six seconds.</p>
<p>"When I make a new game, I try to come up with a unique gameplay mechanic that can only be experienced in that game," he said. "For example, in Bayonetta it was the Witch Time system where dodging an enemy attack slows down time, and in Okami, it was the Celestial Brush, which lets you directly affect the game world by drawing."</p>
<p>Kamiya added that he's not really drawn to a game that is only offering pretty graphics - he's looking for more: "As a player, I want to get excited by the unique experiences which only that one game can offer."</p><p>The genre as a whole, though, Kamiya reckons is in a good spot: "Until not too long ago, there weren't many 3D action games around, but recently there have been a lot of stylish, combo-based action titles. I think that's a result of growing demand, and as someone who also wants to make that kind of action game one day, it makes me happy to see."</p>
<p>Fans of Hideki Kamiya's work were thrilled at December 2024's announcement he was working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">sequel to Okami</a> at his Clovers studio, in collaboration with Capcom.</p>

						<h5>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </h5><p><span>October 16, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>In recent years, the trend for core Pokémon RPGs has been to push for ever-larger sandboxes, with the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> offering a full-on Breath-of-the-Wild-style open world. The newly-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> bucks that particular trend, instead restricting the critter catching to a single relatively compact city map, while introducing a number of other tweaks to the Pokémon blueprint.</p>



<p>Will Pokémon Legends: Z-A transform fans into enthusiastic city slickers? Or will you be left yearning for a return to nature? Here are the ABCs of Z-A...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A casts players as a tourist visitor to Lumiose City, the Paris-inspired metropolis last seen in 2013's Pokémon X and Y. Lumiose is in the midst of an ambitious redevelopment plan, which aims to create a city where Pokémon and humans can live side-by-side in an urban environment. As you might expect, this isn't going entirely smoothly, with some residents concerned about the growing percentage of the city being transformed into "wild zone" Pokémon habitats and rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon causing havoc.</p>



<p>You’re quickly drawn into the intrigue of Lumiose City when you’re recruited by the eager Taunie/Urbain (their gender depends on the gender of your main character) to join their band of Pokemon-training friends, Team MZ. Before long, you’re set up in a room at the quaint Hotel Z and fully immersed in the Z-A Royale, a competition held by the Quasartico Corporation to determine the best trainers in Lumiose, with ranks going from, you guessed it, Z to A. It's up to you to earn your way to the top while figuring out the mystery of the rogue Mega Evolutions and what's going on in the mysteriously shuttered Prism Tower at the heart of Lumiose City.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While you shouldn’t come into Pokémon Legends: Z-A expecting Tolstoy, the story here is better than a good percentage of previous Pokémon RPGs. You also get an unusually strong cast of characters for a Pokémon game, with most of the members of your Team MZ squad, from the ever-earnest Taunie, to the spunky wannabe dancer Lida, to the fanboy fashion designer Naveen, being likable, or at least memorable.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rest of the town is populated with an array of other unique personalities, with some even being recognizable for those who played Pokémon X and Y (Professor Mable has come a long way from her role as a minor villain in X/Y). Even the game's sidequests are fairly interesting, with your typical "fetch this item or Pokémon" quests being mixed with more original stuff, like a Pokémon scavenger hunt in Lumiose City’s surprisingly-expansive Pokémon museum. This is one of the first Pokémon games in a while where I wasn't just interested in the landscape and the Pokémon I can find there, but also the game's characters and the society they inhabit. This really is one of the richest-feeling Pokémon worlds to date.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the case despite the fact that the game’s map is, undeniably, quite small. You could probably run from one side to the other in a couple of minutes, but Game Freak does a lot with their limited real estate. The map is somewhat maze-like, which makes it feel bigger than it is, and the city's rooftops and even parts of its sewer system are fully explorable. There are also plenty of Lumiose City tourist traps to distract you along the way, like the aforementioned museum and scads of clothes shops and cafes. Did I miss the greater sense of geographic variety and scale we got in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet? I did at times, but not as often or as badly as I was expecting.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This bustling little world looks quite nice as well. While some folks looking to drum up negative engagement had a field day trashing Z-A before its release, the reality is, this is far and away the best-looking Pokémon game to date when playing on Nintendo Switch 2. Obviously, if you're expecting this game to measure up to mega-budgeted PS5 RPGs, you're going to be disappointed, and the game's buildings do look rather flat and blocky. That said, the things people actually care about, the Pokémon and their human trainers, look super sharp (the designs for human characters are particularly good this time around). On Switch 2, everything ran at a consistent 60fps without much in the way of visual glitches. The visual difference between Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Scarlet/Violet is night and day.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, a well-designed world doesn’t mean all that much without solid core gameplay to match, and thankfully, Pokémon Legends: Z-A delivers on that front too. The game opts for a new action/menu-based hybrid system, in which battles take place in real time with trainers fully immersed in the action, but attacks are still selected manually. The system is very approachable, with a simple lock-on function and attacks being mapped to the four face buttons. Eventually, the concept of Mega-Evolved Pokémon is added to the mix, with players being able to temporarily power up some members of their party, but this doesn't complicate matters too much. This system feels like a “best of both worlds” scenario -- the rock-paper-scissors depth of the turn-based Pokémon RPGs hasn't gone anywhere, but battles now play out much quicker and with more of a sense of danger as trainers can get smoked if they don’t stay out of the fray.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This new battle system's greater immediacy also creates increased challenge and tension. This is particularly true of the battles against rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon, which take the form of full-on action-packed boss battles with sometimes complex attack patterns you have to keep aware of. These battles were some of the most satisfying challenges I've ever encountered in a core Pokémon game.</p>



<p>Once you get through the game’s early tutorials, Pokémon Legends: Z-A settles into a fairly well-defined gameplay loop. The game rolls out a steady stream of rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon to tackle and at any time you can engage in some sidequests or catch yourself some critters in the city’s wild zones. Catching Pokémon borrows from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-arceus-another-time-and-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, with players able to sneak up on creatures and catch them by simply throwing a Poké Ball at them. Of course, you can also battle wild Pokémon to weaken them first, and, in fact, in a change this series has needed for decades, you can now catch Pokémon for a brief window after they've "fainted." No more being punished for landing a super-effective move!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At night, randomly selected battle zones pop up. Here, you'll take on a succession of other trainers, racking up points to earn a Challenger's Ticket, which, in turn, lets you take on a promotion battle (essentially this game's version of a Gym Leader battle). Here too, players can gain the advantage by sneaking up on opponents, and picking up bonus cards will grant you extra points if you complete specific tasks (knock out an opponent from behind, hit a specific number of water/fire/ground-based attacks, etc.)</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This gameplay loop works quite well, and while it could have become repetitive, Z-A largely avoids that. The game lets you skip a large number of ranks at one point (you don't have to rank up 26 times, don't worry) and Game Freak makes an effort to mix up the game's main story missions. Yes, you're still always earning a Challenger’s Ticket to enter a promotion match, but tracking down your opponent and getting them to face you usually isn’t a simple task. You'll find yourself doing things like engaging in a competition with other mega fans of an influencer-trainer in order to win the right to face them, and doing some detective work and delving into the dungeon-like sewers beneath Lumiose to find a missing person before another trainer will face you. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels closer to the rhythms of the various Pokémon anime than most of its predecessors.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Pokémon Legends: Z-A campaign is a bit lighter than some other entries in the series, as you'll be able to complete the story in around 20 hours if you're really galloping toward the finish line. Of course, you could easily spend two to three times that (or more) if you really want to <em>Catch 'em All</em> and tie up everything the game has to offer. As is usually the case with this franchise, you get out of this Poké Ball what you put into it.</p>

					<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </h2>

						<section>
				<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next. </p>

            <p>There appear to be a number of issues plaguing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> launch, including bugs, crashes, and performance issues. Publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/">Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have listed</a> the highest priority of these, assured players they're being addressed, and suggested workarounds to use in the meantime.</p>
<p>Some workarounds are fairly crude, though. There are people who've found the Lasombra and Toreador clans - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sucks-youll-have-to-pay-for-two-clans-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">once destined to be paid DLC additions</a> - are still locked when they play. The workaround? Update and reinstall the game. And there's nothing yet to solve crashes on PS5 in particular. All that's said is, "We are also working on some platform-specific performance issues, such as crashes on PS5."</p>

<p>The other problems and workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>There's no way to turn off motion-blur.<strong> Workaround: </strong>Try turning post-processing to low</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>The game doesn't launch or gets stuck on the starting screen. <strong>Workaround: </strong>Try running the game and launcher as an admin</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>Seattle is not populating correctly (in the game!) with NPCS during quests. <strong>Workaround:</strong> Reload from the last save (an inconvenience considering you can't manually save)</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>The AZERTY keyboard does not work, or keybinding does not work. <strong>Workaround: </strong>Enable the QWERTY layout in Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Other issues mentioned include the lack of a field of vision slider, the ability to disable elements of the HUD, and "facial hair in character customisation" - which I presume means people want more than stubble as an option in the character customiser. But no workarounds or promises are listed alongside these. I assume they're there to say "we've heard you and are working on this".</p>
<p>Otherwise, Paradox, The Chinese Room, and Vampire: The Masquerade IP holder White Wolf thanked players for the support and encouraged them to keep sending in feedback via the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/bloodlines-faq#game-issues">bug report form</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">I reviewed Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 for Eurogamer</a> and sadly I didn't think it was up to much. Every area of the game felt thin and lifeless to me, pardon the pun, though I didn't have an entirely horrible time with it. Some characters were great, some of the action sequences were engaging, particularly later on, and occasionally the fantasy of being a very powerful elder vampire shone through.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is full of content, with Lumiose City packed full of shops to spend your hard-earned cash, and the Stone Emporium is one of the most important locations in the game.</p>



<p>Although not available instantly, the Stone Emporium is a go-to location to purchase items for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-trading-stone-special-evolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special evolutions</a>, as well as fossils to revive in the Pokémon Research Lab.</p>



<p>For all the details on where to find the Stone Emporium and the stock available to purchase, our guide has you covered.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Shopping spree. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Stone Emporium in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A is located on Vernal Avenue, near Wild Zone 1 and to the east of Wild Zone 12</strong>, <strong>but only unlocks once you complete Main Mission 10.</strong></p>



<p>The nearest fast travel point is the Pokémon Center on Vernal Avenue, though you can also use the fast travel points at the Pokémon Research Lab, Cafe Woof, and Cafe Classe.</p>



<p>Available stock increases throughout your playthrough, so make sure to revisit the store regularly to stock up on Mega Stones and Evolution Stones.</p>







<p><strong>The Stone Emporium is the best place in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to get your hands on Evolution Stones, along with being the only place you can purchase particular Mega Stones.</strong></p>



<p>Stock levels increase throughout the game, with some items only becoming available to purchase later on in the main story progression, and remember, you can only purchase each Mega Stone once. However, unlike previous games, you can purchase as many fossils as you want to revive at the Pokémon Research Lab.</p>



<p>The table below shows the full breakdown of the stock available at the Stone Emporium and prices.</p>

Arrowhead said that while new features are coming, this patch marks “a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it.” More refinements are already underway, the studio continued.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of balance, the overall effectiveness of primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems is increased. SMGs and pistols, for example, have been adjusted to emphasize their role as close-quarters weapons, with increased close-range damage and increased damage falloff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting changes are made to enemies across the board. The Dragon Roach, for example, has seen its spawn rate decreased, and destruction of the wings now results in instant death. Each wing has a health pool, and the Dragon Roach should be more susceptible to explosions because even if you hit the body you now also hit the wings and do more damage. Overall, there should be fewer Dragon Roaches and they should be easier to take down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the patch notes, courtesy of the Helldivers 2 Discord, below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Balancing</strong></h2><h2 data-cy="title2">General changes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Primaries, Sidearms, Throwables, and Stratagems</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improvements have been made to increase the overall effectiveness of primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Light vs. Medium Penetration Weapons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Light and medium penetration weapons now offer more distinct advantages.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Light penetration weapons generally deal a higher percentage of their total damage against durable enemies, differentiating them more clearly from medium penetration options</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SMGs and Pistols</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>SMGs and pistols have been adjusted to emphasize their role as close-quarters weapons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Yes, even Limit Break.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-best-sellers"><u>Magic The Gathering’s Final Fantasy set</u></a> in June <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day"><u>set new records for the franchise</u></a>, and given the popularity of Commander, we’d imagine <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers"><u>plenty of the four decks included in the set</u></a> were shifted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trouble is, there’s always been a discrepancy in price, with the Final Fantasy 6 deck ‘Revival Trance’ going for much less, Final Fantasy 7’s ‘Limit Break’ going for much more, and the other two falling somewhere in between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Buy’s answer? Discounting them all to the same price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Buy Has Every Final Fantasy Magic Deck Under MSRP</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the positive side, this means you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqRRg3?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Limit Break</u></a>, a deck that regularly sells for much more than its MSRP, for $48.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a very fun deck that’s themed around equipment and dealing combat damage, and will no doubt be an easy pickup for anyone who waited for a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the downside, <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PP6v?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>that means Revival Trance is also $48.99</u></a>. It’s under MSRP, sure, but this deck’s messy game plan and lack of big reprints mean you can snap it up for around $35 elsewhere if you keep an eye out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the quartet, I’ve been having more fun with Scions and Spellcraft recently, the Final Fantasy 14 deck helmed by Y’Shtola. It’s all about pinging opponents around the table for damage, which isn’t something you often get in a blue/white/black deck. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJJdX?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $48.99 now</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, arguably the best deck from the set, Counter Blitz is helmed by Final Fantasy X’s Tidus and Yuna, and lets you manipulate counters to deal big damage or keep Summons around longer. And, guess what? <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMMj4?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $48.99 now, too</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each deck also comes with a ‘Collector Booster Sample Pack’ which includes two cards in foil or borderless treatment, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Publisher No More Robots has announced two new games during an eighth anniversary showcase, with these games being pretty different to each other. The first is Cruise Control, a game about managing a cruise fleet, while the second game is about job applications and the job market. That game is called Thank You For Your Application, a phrase surely burnt into the mind of anyone who has applied for jobs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cruise Control -- Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nshhSnPTpSA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Cruise Control, your role is to build up a cruise ship, expanding its offerings, and keeping cruise enthusiasts happy. You will need to fill the ship with amenities like restaurants and gyms, plus entertainment rooms such as bingo halls, dance halls, arcades, spas, gaming halls, and cinemas. The more popular your cruise gets, the more people that will want to set sail with you so you will need to keep expanding and refreshing those offerings. A ship needs a crew though, so you will need to hire maintenance staff to keep the ship going smoothly and keeping it tidy. Cruise Control will also feature an Elite Cruises mode where you will compete with other players to climb the leaderboard. A beta test will be taking place soon, and to join you have to go the official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fx82V8Tn7eM">Cruise Control Discord</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thank You For Your Application - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6zbCEwIakw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thank You For Your Application looks like a game that fans of Papers, Please will be interested in. You play as a junior interviewer for Aeropolis, the biggest company in the world. Your role is to interview candidates and send thank you letters, but there is a secret to uncover too. There will be lots of interviews to do, and robots are also eligible to take jobs from humans. You will earn money but will need to be on top of things like rent, so you do not become an illegal resident. Thank You For Your Application has a branching narrative which is affected by the choices you make, and you can try out a demo for the game now by going to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881370/Thank_You_For_Your_Application/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <p>Paradox have outlined some workarounds for a number of "high priority" issues which have been draining folks' ability to get sucked into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> now the gates to Seattle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-cannot-possibly-be-on-sale-now">are open</a>. Proper fixes for these and other known issues are also in the works, as is planning for post-release additions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/bloodlines-2-thank-you-and-upcoming-plans">blog post</a> which kicks off with a nice thank you, the studio quickly got down to brass tacks. "From your comments, we also know there are some players who are facing issues," they wrote. "While we continue working on the post-release plans for Bloodlines 2, we’d like to address some of those immediately and provide possible workarounds so that as many of you as possible can return to enjoying the game. As part of this process, we want to thank everybody who’s taken the time to fill out the bug report form. It helps us immensely to get an overview of what issues people are facing!"</p>
<p>They proceeded to outline some of the workarounds they've devised for "high priority" issues. Folks who're struggling to get the Bloodlines 2 to launch or are getting stuck on its starting screen are advised to try running it as an admin. Those unable to use their AZERTY keyboard or bind keys as they should might find "adding the QWERTY keyboard layout in Windows" to be a solution. Finally, if your version of Seattle isn't "populating correctly with NPCs" during certain quests, reloading your last save from the main menu's worth a shot.</p>
<p>"We are also working on some platform-specific performance issues, such as crashes on PS5," Paradox added. Regarding known bugs like the Lasombra and Toreador being locked at the clan selection screen on some platforms, we recommend updating and reinstalling the game."</p><p>Finally, they're aware players have indicated they're not happy with things like the the lack of an FOV slider, not being able to turn off bits of the HUD, and underwhelming beard/moustache options. Rounding out that list of gripes is not being able to turn off motion blur, with the studio recommending you "try turning post-processing to low" in that case.</p>
<p>"Your passion, feedback, and patience mean the world to us, and we’re committed to continuing to improve Bloodlines 2," the post concluded. "The story of Seattle’s Kindred is only just beginning."</p>
<p>While the work they're putting in might not revamp things to the extent it's worth substantially re-evaluating whether Bloodlines 2 lives up to its moniker as a sequel to a beloved classic, here's hoping it can poke things from the merely ok territory Dominic Tarason spoke of in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a> towards the unquestionably good realm. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">Mods</a> will also likely help achieve that goal.</p>

            <p>The George Foreman grill, sorry… PlayStation 3, has now been outsold by the PS5 in the US. Sony's newest machine has achieved this feat in a fraction under five years on sale (PS5 launched 12th November 2020).</p>
<p>Respected <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella shared the piece of trivia on Bluesky</a>, noting that the sales-overtake had happened during September's sales period.</p>
<p>"September 2025 US video game data fun fact - The PlayStation 5 has now surpassed the PlayStation 3 in lifetime installed base," Piscatella wrote. "So that's cool."</p>
<p>He didn't share numbers - Circana charges for that sort of thing - but did mention in replies that PS5 sales are also ahead of PS4 on "a time-aligned basis" in the US, and have been for "a very long time". "PS5 is ahead of PS4 by 4.6 percent," he wrote.</p><p>As a reference point, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/">Sony's business website lists global lifetime PS4 sales</a> at more than 113.5m (as of September 2020), lifetime PS3 sales at more than 87.4m (as of March 2017), and lifetime PS2 sales - the company's best-selling machine - at more than 160m (as of March 2012). Given the dates attached to those counts, those figures have likely since changed.</p>
<p>Sony announced in its last financial report in August that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-5-has-sold-803-million-units-as-it-closes-on-in-on-fifth-anniversary">PlayStation 5 had sold 80.3m units</a> in total - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-lifetime-sales-on-par-with-ps4-but-sony-relying-on-third-party-game-success">a pace which has roughly been the same as PS4's</a>, on a like-for-like basis, for a while. The next batch of financial results is due 11th November.</p>
<p>However, Sony is expecting sales of PS5 to slow, both because it believes the console has passed its sales peak and, I expect, because of the challenging economic conditions and tariffs the market is facing. Console prices for this generation have never been higher.</p>
<p>It's a strange footing to be on when thinking about planning the next generation of consoles. But as I found out recently, perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">the role of the console is about to change</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's no doubt that Starfield, Bethesda Game Studios's first new intellectual property in over twenty-five years, did not ignite as much passion in the studio's fans as its other franchises, Elder Scrolls and Fallout, have done before. Even Bruce Nesmith, who worked on Starfield as well as more successful releases like Fallout 3 and 4 and Elder Scrolls Oblivion and Skyrim over the course of his 17-year-long career at Bethesda, admitted that while a good game, the latest release of the studio isn't in the same caliber as the other two series they're known for.</p>



<p><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/starfield-designer-says-sci-fi-rpg-still-a-great-game-but-procedural-generation-stopped-fallout-elder-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to FRVR</a>, Nesmith, who left Bethesda in late 2021 and is now a full-time science fiction author, said that the problem was not space, which is kinda boring by default. The issue was rather with how the game failed to populate the planets with engaging enemies and things to do.</p>



<p><em>I’m an enormous space fan, I’m an amateur astronomer, I’m up on all that stuff, a lot of the work I did on Starfield was on the astronomical data, but space is inherently boring. It’s literally described as nothingness. So moving throughout that isn’t where the excitement is, in my opinion. But when the planets start to feel very samey and you don’t start to feel the excitement on the planets, that’s to me where it falls apart. I was also disappointed when, pretty much, the only serious enemy you fought were people… there’s lots of cool alien creatures, but they’re like the wolves in Skyrim. They’re just there, they don’t contribute, you don’t have the variety of serious opponents that are story generators.</em></p>



<p>Personally, I think Nesmith nailed the explanation. I also felt that the exploration loop that Bethesda fans love in Elder Scrolls and Fallout was missing for some reason. In those games, often the best experience comes simply by exploring the map without even caring about the story missions, but that's because they are littered with interesting discoveries, dungeons, and encounters. </p>



<p>Starfield really lacked in that. Whether it was due to the procedural generation system (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-have-benefited-from-daggerfall-like-proc-gen-for-dungeons-instead-of-reusing-premade-ones-says-oncelost-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was criticized by fellow developers from OnceLost Games</a>) or the fact that they felt like the space planets had to be emptier due to the lore, I cannot say. </p>



<p>Still, Bethesda hasn't stopped working on the game. They recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a new story DLC, new gameplay systems, and some space changes. According to the latest rumors, all this new content should launch alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-announcement-is-rumored-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PlayStation 5 version</a> sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox president Sarah Bond was recently featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy video interview with Mashable</a> as part of the press tour for the launch of the ROG Xbox Ally X (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we reviewed here</a>). We already covered her comment <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the next-generation console being 'very premium and very high-end'</a>, but there's also another interesting tidbit in that interview: Bond's statement about game exclusives, which she labeled as antiquated.  </p>



<p><em>We're really seeing people evolve way past that. Like the biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox. That's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. They have experiences. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people. You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience because it just opens up another way for you to play. As does cloud, as does PC, as does the consoles that we all own and have in our living room.</em></p>



<p>Bond's statement comes as no surprise given Microsoft's u-turn on exclusives. Xbox did attempt to pursue exclusives for its Xbox consoles for around fifteen years or so, even going as far as making pricey deals with Japanese developers for games like Ninja Gaiden, Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, and Ace Combat 6 to name a few.</p>



<p>However, that effort eventually dwindled down alongside the Xbox One's weak exclusives output. In 2016, Microsoft started bringing all its exclusive games to Windows PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-pushed-quantum-break-pc-delay-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginning with Remedy's Quantum Break</a>. That was the first extension of what an Xbox was. Much more recent is their choice to port first-party games to rival consoles like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch. This major strategy shift took place in February 2024, when following a series of rumors Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Obsidian's Grounded and Pentiment, Rare's Sea of Thieves, and Tango's Hi-Fi Rush would be released on the PS4/5 and/or Switch.</p>



<p>Many more games have since followed, including Gears of War: Reloaded, Forza Horizon 5, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and DOOM: The Dark Ages. This month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and The Outer Worlds 2 will launch day and date on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Microsoft is really now looking to bring its games to as many devices as possible, but that's because, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-has-lost-the-console-wars-next-gen-consoles-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">candidly admitted in 2023</a>, they have lost the console wars. Sarah Bond also mentioned live service games, which certainly benefit from being available on the widest possible amount of platforms, but Sony and Nintendo, especially the latter, still put a lot of importance in non-live service games which can definitely boost hardware sales when exclusive to their console.</p>



<p>On one hand, I do wish all games were released across all platforms immediately. It would certainly be a big win for all gamers. On the other, I understand Sony and Nintendo's current stance, even though the former is already slowly moving toward multiplatform releases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Players Are Arguing About Unrealistic Skins Again]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-are-arguing-about-unrealistic-skins-again.1332415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s first season approaches, and in the run-up to the inevitable drop, fans have started discussing the content coming in the impending update. One of the key points of contention involves a new <strong>blue </strong>skin, dubbed ‘Wicked Grin’. It’s one of the least unrealistic skins showcased so far for Battlefield 6, and some fans feel it’s the beginning of the end.</p>



<p>It has gotten to the point of a fierce debate on social platforms, with some diehard fans berating Electronic Arts and all associated studios for ‘already tainting’ Battlefield 6 with bizarre skins.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s that bad?</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-wicked-grin-skin-is-causing-fights">Battlefield 6’s Wicked Grin Skin is Causing Fights</h2>



<p>On social media, users shared images of the blue Wicked Grin skin, coming to Battlefield 6 with the season one update and assumedly being part of some Halloween-themed campaign.</p>



<p>It’s the most divisive skin yet, even more so than the skin that boasted some <strong>bright green elements </strong>that split the community down the middle a couple of weeks ago.</p>



<p>EA DICE announced that Battlefield 6 would be much more grounded ahead of release, and some have condemned the studio for already breaking that promise, less than two weeks after the launch of the game. Battlefield 6 has proven to be a marvel so far, with the community loving almost everything on offer, but these potentially destructive skins are not going down well with fans.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/grounded_skins_for_a_while_18_days_exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Reddit</a>, one user wrote, ‘Man, that looks f***ing dumb,’ while another asked, ‘Why is it so much to ask for just regular military uniforms? Nobody is using this s***.’</p>



<p>Others defended the skin: ‘This is cherry-picked from a large selection of mostly regular military outfits. This sub is a cesspool, so I expect no different, but this is laughably misrepresented.’</p>



<p>Some have argued that it’s ‘far more grounded’ than some of the most inane Call of Duty skins, such as the Beavis and Butthead and Nicki Minaj crossovers that brought <strong>the strangest outfits </strong>to the Activision-backed shooter.</p>



<p>Do you think the Wicked Grin skin is so awful that you won’t want to see anyone wearing it in Battlefield 6? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-day-2025-what-to-expect/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-fallout-day-2025%E2%80%94here%E2%80%99s-what-to-expect.1332406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every year on October 23, the Fallout community comes together to celebrate Fallout Day, an official tribute to the franchise that recognizes the date in the game’s universe on which <strong>the bombs fell</strong>. It was the spark that ignited The Great War, bringing about the end of the world and the start of the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>This year, the rumors have been circulating like wildfire, with many believing that Bethesda Game Studios is about to reveal a remaster of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas. We know a few things that are happening this Fallout Day, but what’s set to unravel as the day goes on?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-3-remastered-being-revealed-today">Is Fallout 3 Remastered Being Revealed Today?</h2>



<p>It’s Fallout Day, and that means a few things.</p>



<p>First, it means that Fallout fans worldwide are diving into their favorite post-apocalyptic games, soaking up the irradiated action that has evolved over the last quarter of a century. Second, it means that special streams, offers, and reveals are set to drop.</p>



<p>Later today, Bethesda Game Studios will host a special Fallout Day broadcast, and the consensus is that a new game, such as Fallout 3 Remastered or New Vegas Remastered, will be unveiled.</p>



<p>Some have even theorized that a Fallout Shelter 2 will shadowdrop.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Fallout team revealed a glimpse of what’s coming this Fallout Day:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Fallout Day is almost here! Tomorrow at 1 PM ET, join us for a special broadcast packed with:</p><p>✅ Fallout 76: Burning Springs Updates<br>✅ Fallout Shelter<br>✅ Fallout 4 and Creations<br>✅ New Merch Drops<br>✅ Community In-Person Events<br>✅ And a post-show celebrating the community! <a href="https://t.co/kcNTLrSf8E">pic.twitter.com/kcNTLrSf8E</a></p></div>— Fallout (@Fallout) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1981020245226594611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Let’s break down that list.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout 76: Burning Springs </strong>is likely a more in-depth look at the upcoming expansion, which brings Walton Goggins’ character ‘The Ghoul’ from the television show to the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout Shelter </strong>is seen by many as the sudden unveiling of a new release to expand the best-selling mobile-first game, but it’s more likely a new update of sorts or a limited-time event.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout 4 and Creations </strong>is the outlier in the list, as nobody is sure of what that means. It could be more officially-backed mods finding their way into the Creations platform on Fallout 4, or it could be something else entirely. Last year, Fallout 4 received a current-gen upgrade, and nothing has really changed since then. In just a couple of weeks, Fallout 4 will hit its <strong>tenth anniversary</strong>.</p>



<p>Maybe we’ll see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-this-november/">Fallout 4: 10th Anniversary Edition</a>… Who knows?</p>



<p>New merchandise is available for fans to purchase, and a limited-time 40% discount is available in the Bethesda Gear Store. Also, a special post-show has been announced, set up to celebrate <strong>the community</strong> behind Fallout. This will be backed by the Fallout for Hope charity initiative and will last at least three hours.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-fallout-day-2025-stream">Where to Watch Fallout Day 2025 Stream</h2>



<p>The easiest way to watch Fallout Day 2025 is via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bethesda Game Studios’ Twitch channel</a>. This is where the official stream will run, and if you miss it, you can check out the VOD to catch up on what was announced.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s when to watch Fallout Day 2025:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>1 PM ET</li>



<li>6 PM BST</li>



<li>10 AM PT</li>



<li>7 PM CEST</li>

<p>Two new unlisted Switch 2 lifestyle commercials for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> have been spotted on Nintendo's official YouTube page. They're titled "Power Up Your Holidays", so we'll seemingly be seeing them in the lead up to the Christmas season.</p>
<p>Although these new trailers are only around 16 seconds each and spend a lot of that time focused on the player, they apparently include some <strong>spoilers</strong> about Samus' new adventure – so we would advise you navigate away from this page right now if you don't want to ruin any surprises for yourself.</p>
<p>Right, with this warning out of the way, you can see two bosses. One is called Xelios (a new "spherical" boss) and the other is known as Carvex (a "plant" boss which you might have already seen). We've taken screen captures, just in case Nintendo's trailers end up disappearing. You can see them at the bottom of these videos:</p>



<p>Nintendo has also ramped up its coverage of all-things Metroid this week with a bunch of <em>other</em> Metroid-related announcements. This includes the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II</a> soundtrack on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a>, and also some promotion of the upcoming Metroid Prime 1-3 art book. Nintendo has added a new Metroid reward to the My Nintendo Store, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I received a Woojer Strap 4 alongside the Woojer Vest 4, and I was eager to see how the two devices stacked up against one another. While the Woojer Vest 4 is reserved more for immersive VR experiences, the Strap 4 is a more compact, simpler device that offers a scaled-down feedback experience.</p>



<p>What I found was that the Woojer Strap 4 shouldn’t be discredited just because it’s a smaller thing. This haptic feedback device offers a punchy solution for <strong>feeling audio</strong>, and whether you use it for games or music, you’ll be impressed with what it can do.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Woojer Strap 4 review.</p>



<h2 id="h-woojer-strap-4-is-energy-in-a-compact-package">Woojer Strap 4 is Energy in a Compact Package</h2>



<p>While the Woojer Vest 4 (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-vest-4-review-new-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I also reviewed</a>) is a full upper body solution, the Woojer Strap 4 is a single, simple, and discrete device that offers immense versatility. It’s designed to be used however you want, and with that in mind, it can be worn in several ways. Whether you want a low-cost immersion element for VR or something to enhance your enjoyment of music, this is it.</p>



<p>The Strap 4 is less than half the price of the full Woojer Vest 4, so it’s a no-brainer if you want an introduction to the haptic world without breaking the bank. You’ll be paying around $125 for the strap, which comes in a range of colorways and themes, and there are even some special edition straps featuring branding from top games like Black Ops 7 and Fortnite.</p>



<p>Once you’ve unboxed your Woojer Strap 4, you’ll find that the setup process is so swift and simple, and the Woojer app allows full customization of the device where sound profiles, inputs and outputs, and RGB layouts are concerned.</p>



<p>Putting on the Strap 4 takes seconds, and it’s designed to fit all body types. Even my larger frame was perfectly comfortable enveloped by the Strap 4. Once on, you’ll start blasting sound through the Strap 4, noticing how the punchy transducer translates all inputted sound into powerful, vibration-based haptic feedback.</p>



<p>It’s weird at first, but stick with it.</p>



<p>On a single charge, the Woojer Strap 4 can last around ten hours, which is about the same amount of time as you’d get with the Vest 4, only the Strap 4 takes less time to recharge. It’s a diverse thing that can be connected wirelessly via Bluetooth or wired with a range of inputs that accommodate almost every kind of device you might want to use.</p>



<p>At just 240 g, you’ll hardly notice the Woojer Strap 4, but you’ll feel those audio cues without a doubt. At the highest sensitivity, the Strap 4 will hit like a 12-gauge alongside certain sound profiles. I used the Strap 4 with a variety of games, but like the Vest 4, it felt the best for me with an explosive first-person shooter like Battlefield 6 or Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>You really do feel every shot, explosion, and punch.</p>



<p>It might seem like a bit of a gimmick, but if you want the most immersive gaming solutions possible, something like the Woojer Strap 4 should be right up your street.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if the Woojer Strap 4 sounds like your kind of technology.</p>
