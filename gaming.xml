			<p>The latest free update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is available for players to dive into, and the update comes to <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-hands-on-preview/">the game</a> one day early. It was officially released yesterday by Fatshark, with the Unlocked and Loaded update, including a mass overhaul to itemization, the Rolling Steel operation, and the Party Finder feature. This update is available to those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a> and Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide  - Unlocked &amp; Loaded | Narrative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGPVTYzBGBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While this update is predominantly focused on overhauling some of the features in the game to make it a smoother experience for the players, it also adds a new mission for players to complete, as well as the new social features and balance changes.</p>
<p>The Itemization Overhaul in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide 'reinvents' weapon progression by giving players the ability to experiment and progress with their weapons rather than being locked into just one. In this update, two new systems have been added: Mastery and Power. The mastery system allows players to gain experience just from using a weapon in missions, where players will unlock three different types of rewards. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blessing Points: This allows layers to unlock tiers of Blessings.</li>
<li>Weapon Marks: Players will be able to unlock various weapon marks that are attached to the Mastery track of the weapon's family.</li>
<li>Perks: Perks unlock automatically as players advance in a chosen mastery track.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Power system allows players to improve their weapon's stats by spending their resources at the Shrine of the Omnissiah. This will enable players to increase the base stats of any weapon they use.</p>
<p>The new update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide also adds a new mission type called Operations. Operations are typically a shorter experience, but they add a more cinematic experience. The first Operation to be added to the game is called Rolling Steel, and players will have to stop a moving train that has been hijacked by cultists.</p>
<p>The Party Finder is a brand-new feature that has been added in this free update, allowing players to team up with other players. They can filter the party finder by Game Mode, Difficulty, Language and assorted Tags to be able to discern whether the group is right for them. As this feature is tested out, it will continue to evolve and improve once community feedback is received.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a time-limited special event players will be able to dive into called Unrelenting Hordes. From September 26 to October 10, players will have to work to retrieve Grimoires and Scriptures from the Infected Moebian 21st successfully. In doing so, this will give players in-game currencies such as Docket, Plasteel and Diamantine.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/synduality-echo-of-ada-release-date-revealed-for-january.993228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/synduality-echo-of-ada-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced the&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>release date, and the anime-inflected extraction shooter is launching early next year.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/synduality/status/1839304227350294646" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Synduality&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account,&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and current-gen consoles (although that doesn't count the Switch) on January 23rd.</p>
<p>As is often the case with Japanese games' release dates, however, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1245480/view/4656249009457970268" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> points to January 24th as the release date. The discrepancy is likely down to time zones, so make sure to check which date the game is releasing in where you are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bandai-namco-synduality-echo-of-ada-release-date-mech.jpg?itok=ybSuknot 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bandai-namco-synduality-echo-of-ada-release-date-mech.jpg?itok=orJWM95q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>will arrive early next year on PC and current-gen consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada</em>, it's a mecha extraction shooter developed by the rather generically-named Game Studio Inc, whose name you may know from games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-strash-dragon-quest-adventure-of-dai-release-announced"><em>Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai</em></a>, which it co-developed alongside Square Enix.</p>
<p>You play as a Drifter, a mech pilot whose role is to collect a rare resource strewn across a post-apocalyptic landscape that's also inhabited by vicious monsters known as Enders.</p>
<p>As you do so, you'll also have to contend with other players, who are going to be looking to collect the same resources you are. If you've played games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/escape-from-tarkov"><em>Escape from Tarkov</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Gray Zone Warfare</em>, or other extraction shooters, you'll know the drill here.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada</em>, which also gives a sense of the game's art style and gameplay feel, right here.</p>

<p>Three editions of the game will be available at launch; the base game, the Deluxe Edition, and the Ultimate Edition. Each one grants different bonuses, and you can see what those bonuses are <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/synduality/synduality#shop-now" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the official website</a>.</p>
<p><em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245480/SYNDUALITY_Echo_of_Ada/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/synduality/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on January 23rd (or January 24th, depending on your region).

<p>An investor in Ubisoft is claiming it has the support of 10% of shareholders looking to make major changes at the top of the organization, including a sale.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ubisoft-activist-investor-says-it-has-support-10-shareholders-management-tussle-2024-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, AJ Investments says that it is building support for a sale of the company and potentially a change of leadership.</p>



<p>“We call on the management of Ubisoft to allow the sale of the company to third parties or private equity firms at a fair price,” the firm, which owns less than 1% of the company, said in a letter shared with Reuters.</p>



<p>The firm didn’t name the other investors it claimed to have the support of. They also declined to provide that information to Reuters when asked.</p>



<p>AJ Investments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first made calls for a sale</a> and change of executive leadership in early September. At the time, they said they believe the company is “mismanaged” while Ubisoft shareholders were “hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them.”</p>



<p>“Management is focused on pleasing investors with beating quarterly results and not focusing on long-term strategy to provide exceptional experience for the gamers,”  they said in their first letter. “Our company has extensive knowledge about the gaming industry and we were longterm shareholder in Activision Blizzard and we started our Ubisoft position couple weeks ago and still adding to it.”</p>



<p>The latest letter has yet to be publicly posted.</p>



<p>Over the last few weeks, Ubisoft’s shares have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fallen to 11-year lows</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigations have been started</a>. On top of that, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed</a> to February 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of the latest push by investors for Ubisoft to make changes to leadership or even force a sale? Join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official community forums.</a></p>

How fast you move determines how fast time moves," the description reads. "You can use the Cyberpunk engine tweaks to bind the controls to toggle this mode on and off."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Longtime fans looking for a new way to play Cyberpunk 2077 — on the one year anniversary of its one and only expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a> launching — could perhaps find some entertainment here. Toggling in and out of the mode for certain battles seems like it would add some new intensity to the game and allow players to perform some particularly dramatic takedowns.</p><p>In fact, the gameplay change somewhat recreates a piece of cyberware available to players in Cyberpunk 2077: the Sandevistan. Though this does exist in the game, it's not available in quite the same flashy way it was shown off in anime <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-review">Cyberpunk Edgerunners</a>, where protagonist David Martinez would manipulate time to dodge through bullets and take down baddies.</p><p>This mod is based on Superhot, a puzzle game which debuted the mechanic of time stopping if the player stops. "Every level in Superhot is an exciting, self-contained, time-bending puzzle that turns typical fast-paced first-person shooter mechanics on their head," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/25/superhot-review">IGN said in our review</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p dir="ltr">Focus Entertainment has announced a new patch is now available for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, bringing ultrawide support for PC and private lobbies for PvE in Operation mode for the game. The update also adds a new special sparring stage to screw around with buddies.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/90-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-26-09-24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Space Marine 2 community page</a>, it's noted this new stage is called the Hub Sparring Arena. Players can find it in the Battle Barge for Operations and Eternal War modes, and it's a way to fight against friends before another mission. Meanwhile, the private lobbies let you team up with bots or another person instead of working with randoms. Other tweaks with the patch include an "option to reset custom color presets" and Veteran difficulty adjustments. Your health has decreased a tad, but so has enemy aggressiveness for this setting during campaign missions.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1544741603" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>In the time since PlayStation announced it would be releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">remastered PS5 and PC version of Guerrilla's Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, it has also quietly bumped up the price of the original PS4 game.</p>
<p>Price history data on the game, as shared on site's such as <a href="http://psprices.com/">PSPrices.com</a>, shows the PS4 version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition was selling for £15.99 - and had been for some time - until it got a sudden, sharp, price increase yesterday (25th September).</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is now retailing for £34.99 on the official <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA10213_00-HRZCE00000000000">UK PlayStation Store</a>, more than double what it was a couple of days ago. On the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA10237_00-HRZCE00000000000">US store</a>, meanwhile, it is currently retailing at $39.99.</p>

<p>The timing of this increase is no coincidence. During <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-sonys-playstation-state-of-play">this week's State of Play broadcast</a>, PlayStation announced Horizon Zero Dawn was getting its long-rumoured PS5 and PC remaster.</p>
<p>Set to arrive this October, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered promises a range of enhancements on the now seven-year-old original, including "more than 10 hours" of re-recorded conversation motion capture, as well as "countless" graphical improvements.</p>

<p>On its release, this remastered version will retail at $49.99 in the US (I am looking for the UK equivalent), but those who already own Horizon Zero Dawn or Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition will be able to upgrade to the new PS5 or PC version for $9.99.</p>
<p>So, in short, if you had purchased Horizon Zero Dawn a few days ago, it would have been cheaper overall to follow that $10 upgrade path. But, if you purchase the PS4 version now, you will end up paying the same amount as the remastered version's full price if you choose to upgrade.</p>
<p>We see you Sony.</p>

<p>In addition to Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, Aloy is also getting a bricky makeover thanks to the series' collaboration with Lego.</p>

			<p>Having been delayed to early 2025, Assassin's Creed Shadows is now in direct competition with Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei, but this won't be a problem for the new entry in the long-running open-world series, according to Ubisoft's CEO.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented on the two games launching in the same year, saying that there's a lot of space for very high-quality games and that the two games can both sell well. Assassin's Creed Shadows, in particular, will set itself apart from the competing game with its dual protagonists and the two different complementary gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot further commented on Assassin's Creed Shadows and its recent delay in a new internal memo sent to staff before today's earnings call, as reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/">Insider Gaming.</a> The memo highlighted how the game's delay to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">February 14th, 2025</a>, was motivated by the need to release ultra-polished games on day one, something that did not happen with the recent Star Wars Outlaws, whose initial sales were lower than expected.</p>
<p>While not mentioning Assassin's Creed Shadows outright, Yves Guillemot also commented upon the company's creative choices, which are not dictated by any specific agenda. As an entertainment company, Guillemot continued, Ubisoft's mission has always been to <em>"entertain players and enrich their lives with original and memorable experiences, that resonate with a global audience."</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches, as mentioned above, on February 14th, 2025.

So while it might look retro, it gets you normal features like adaptive triggers, rumble support, a built-in microphone, and wireless connectivity.</p>                      </div><p>As mentioned above, this is wildly popular--so if you want it in your collection, you’ll need to move fast and check back frequently for restocks.</p><p>Remember, this isn’t the pro-style DualSense Edge Anniversary Edition, so it’s not equipped with back buttons and it doesn’t come with a carrying case. But if you want something relatively affordable that looks incredibly stylish, it’s hard to go wrong with the DualSense 30th Anniversary Edition.</p><p>Like all DualSense controllers, this one works with PS5, PC, and mobile.

                <p>Earlier this week during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a>, the company announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-a-ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-announced-at-state-of-play/1100-6526653/" data-ref-id="1100-6526653">Ghost of Yotei</a>, the first sequel to the acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review-you-khan-do-it/1900-6417501/" data-ref-id="1900-6417501">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. But instead of continuing the story of Jin Sakai, Ghost of Yotei jumps ahead a few centuries and introduces a new female ronin named Atsu, who has adopted Jin's Ghost persona as her own. Somewhat predictably, Atsu's very existence has already sparked a backlash from gamers who don't want to play as a heroine. That led to a direct response from ex-Sony executive Shawn Layden.</p><p>Layden, who was the former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, reacted to a post on X that complained about Atsu. Layden's reply was simple: "It's a game. If you don't like it, don't buy it."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">1 It's a game. An entertainment. A story a team of creators believes in. They want to make this.<br>2 it's a game. If you don't like it, don't buy it. In fact, why not make the game you want yourself?</p>  — shawn layden 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🇺🇸🇯🇵 (@ShawnLayden) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It does seem odd and regressive that simply placing Atsu in the leading role is seen by a few players as some sort of affront to their idea of what gaming should be. There have been plenty of heroines in the history of Japan-centric video games, including the similarly themed Tenchu: Fatal Shadows and Red Ninja: End of Honor. And just because Atsu is the Ghost in this game doesn't mean that another character can't assume the role in any potential sequel that emerges.</p><p>Sony and developer Sucker Punch Productions haven't released any gameplay trailers for Ghost of Yotei yet, but the game is expected to hit PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Dragon Ball</em> game, <em>Sparking Zero</em>, is just around the corner, and with its immense <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/the-ultimate-surprise-the-final-reveal-of-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-full-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly-200-character roster</a> comes the reemergence of a question as old as time: How many Gokus are in this one?</p><p>Before I delve into the nitty gritty, I must give credit where credit’s due: Aftermath’s own Chris Person first asked this question of <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> <a href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1002659819768238082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in 2018</a>, and he and our esteemed former colleagues Harper Jay (now at Double Fine) and Eric Van Allen (<a href="https://x.com/seamoosi/status/1838575296422805724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hire him!</a>) proceeded to argue it out at <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-many-gokus-are-in-dragon-ball-fighterz-exactly-1827369805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Old Website</a>. I am merely carrying forward the torch they lit, and I will do my best to honor the shared Goku-counting rubric they created by cherry picking the parts of it I like and leaving out the parts I don’t. With that said, let’s begin:</p><ul><li><span>Android 13 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 16 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 17 (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 17 (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 18 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 19 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Anilaza - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Babidi - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Baby Vegeta (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bardock - Looks exactly like Goku, but is actually Goku’s dad. Therefore, not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Beerus - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bergamo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bojack - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan Full Power (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly (<em>Z</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Legendary Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Burter - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba, Super Saiyan 2 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Caulifla - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Caulifla, Super Saiyan 2 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, 1st Form - And now we reach our first rough patch. Cell looks nothing like Goku, but he is technically composed of some of Goku’s cells, along with those of the other Z fighters. How many? We don’t know. But he is technically some tiny percentage of a Goku, as are all of his other forms. So let’s go to the source for this one: While the original manga implies that Cell is the sum of microscopic matter from a number of powerful lifeforms, it only mentions Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Freeza, and Freeza's father by name. Thus, for our purposes here today, Cell counts as one-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, 2nd Form - One-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, Perfect Form - One-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Perfect Cell - One fifth of a Goku. (Also, a note: I’m not sure why they’re differentiating “Cell, Perfect Form” and “Perfect Cell,” but every version of this list I’ve seen published contains both. Maybe it’s a reference to the form Cell achieves after he blows himself up in an attempt to kill Gohan? I guess we’ll see.)</span></li><li><span>Cell Jr. - I’m tempted to say that Cells Jr – short, stout Cells that split off from the main body – would count as a smaller subdivision of a Goku, but they’re a byproduct of asexual reproduction, which tends to result in an identical organism to the original. So: one-fifth of a Goku.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Chiaotzu - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cooler - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cooler, Final Form - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cui - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dabura - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dodoria - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dr. Gero - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dr. Wheelo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dyspo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 1st Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 2nd Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 3rd Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 4th Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, Full Power (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza Force Soldier - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frost - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bojack, Full Power - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Fused Zamasu - Fused Zamasu is – deep breath – a fusion of Zamasu, a mortal-hating god, and Goku Black, a time-traveling version of Zamasu who stole Goku’s body in an alternate timeline. If you gave Goku Black a DNA test, it’d say he’s Goku. As a result, he counts as one full Goku. Therefore, Fused Zamasu is one half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Fused Zamasu, Half-Corrupted - Half corrupted, but still the same guy. Thus: one half of a Goku.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Fusion Android 13 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Future Trunks - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Future Trunks, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Ginyu - He did once possess Goku’s body, but this is Ginyu in his own body. Therefore, not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta (<em>DB Super</em>) - Gogeta is a fusion of Goku and Vegeta. As a result, he’s one half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta, Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - One half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - One half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta, Super Saiyan 4 (<em>GT</em>) - One half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan (Adult) - Goku’s son, but not a Goku himself.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan (Adult) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan 2 (Adult) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan (Future) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan (Future) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan (Kid) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan (Teen) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan (Teen) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gohan, Super Saiyan 2 (Teen) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>GT</em>) - This is Goku! In the purest sense, Goku counts as one Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan (<em>GT</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan 3 (<em>GT</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan 4 (<em>GT</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>DB Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan (D<em>B Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan God (<em>DB Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Ultra Instinct (<em>DB Super</em>) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (Teen) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>DBZ</em>-Early) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>DBZ</em>-End) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>-End) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan 2 (<em>DBZ</em>-End) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan 3 (<em>DBZ</em>-End) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku (<em>DBZ</em>-Mid) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>-Mid) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku Black - We already went over Goku Black’s whole thing earlier in this list, but again, despite the fact that Goku Black’s mind is not Goku’s, his body is. Therefore: One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku Black, Super Saiyan Rose - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goku, Mini (Pre-order bonus) - One Goku.</span></li><li><span>Golden Frieza - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goten - Goku’s other son, who – like Goku’s father – looks exactly like him, but not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Goten, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gotenks - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gotenks, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gotenks, Super Saiyan 3 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Great Ape, Baby (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Great Ape,Vegeta - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Great Saiyaman - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Guldo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Hirudegarn - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Hit - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Janemba - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Jeice - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Jiren - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Jiren, Full Power - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kakunsa - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kale - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kale, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kale, Super Saiyan (Berserker) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kefla - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kefla, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kefla, Super Saiyan 2 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>King Cold - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Krillin - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Lord Slug - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Lord Slug, Giant Form - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Kid Buu - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Majin Buu - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Majin Buu, Evil - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Majin Vegeta - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Majuub (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Master Roshi - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Master Roshi, Max Power - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Mecha Frieza - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Metal Cooler - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Mr. Satan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Nail - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Nappa - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Omega Shenron (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Pan (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Piccolo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Piccolo, Fused With Kami - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Raditz - Goku’s brother, who looks nothing like Goku.

He also later goes on to absorb Vegito and, therefore, Goku. But at this point, he hasn’t done it yet. Therefore, not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Buu (Gotenks Absorbed) - Still not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Garlic Jr. - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Gogeta (<em>Z</em>) - One half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Janemba - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Trunks - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Vegeta - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Super Vegito - Vegito is another fusion of Goku and Vegeta, this time using the Potara earrings instead of the fusion dance.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/blizzard-reveals-overwatch-2-x-my-hero-academia-collab-starcraft-heading-to-pc-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-reveals-overwatch-2-x-my-hero-academia-collab-starcraft-heading-to-pc-game-pass.993120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-reveals-overwatch-2-x-my-hero-academia-collab-starcraft-heading-to-pc-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2024, Blizzard revealed some of its upcoming plans. These included a collaboration for Overwatch 2 with the hit anime My Hero Academia, as well as StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft II, both heading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service/">PC Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The Overwatch 2 collaboration will begin on October 17 and through October 30, where players will get the opportunity to obtain skins of characters such as Deku, Uravity, All Might, Kiriko, and Tomura Shigaraki. Of course, these skins are premium, so players will have to fork over some money to get the skin they choose. The skins are typically $19 each, with the bundles typically being about $67. The paid skins have been a point of controversy since Overwatch 2 was released. While the loot boxes were predatory to a degree, they at least gave the option for people to try and earn the legendary skins for free via loot boxes rather than forcing them to pay for it or hope they scrounge up enough currency from purchasing the Battle Passes. It's unlikely Blizzard will ever go back on this decision.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The second main announcement that came from Blizzard during the Tokyo Game Show was regarding StarCraft. As of November 5, StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft II: Campaign Collection will be available to those who have a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. This franchise is incredibly popular and is one of the most iconic games in the franchise. For the most part, StarCraft: Remastered was well revered in the community and felt like a faithful remaster of the game, as the campaign and gameplay elements were unchanged. For the most part, StarCraft: Remastered was the perfect game for professional players, as it's an 'almost perfect' remaster of the original. However, for the ordinary player, it fell a bit short.</p>
<p>With the game being added to Game Pass, it means players will be able to test out the game without having to fork out more money on the Battle.net client to be able to play StarCraft. The original StarCraft is still available on Battle.net for free, but you'll have to <a href="https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/starcraft-remastered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay $15.99</a> if you want to play the remastered version.</p>
<p>While it may seem on Battle.net that you can play StarCraft II for free, you will have to pay to be able to play the campaign if you want to dive into the expansive story. With the games being added to Game Pass, it's significantly cheaper to play them via Game Pass than purchased on Battle.net.</p>
<p>By being on Game Pass, players will be able to experience the game that helped continue to influence the RTS genre, with players able to interact with three different factions throughout both games.</p>

The $699.99 console is about to be available to preorder in the US at <strong>10AM ET / 7AM PT</strong> through Sony’s <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>, so if you want to secure one ASAP, you’ll want to jump in line at Sony’s site (be sure to have your PlayStation Network login info handy).</p><div><p>Also going up for preorder at the same time are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249013/sony-playstation-ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-retro">Sony’s retro-styled 30th Anniversary</a> PS5 Pro bundle (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$999.99</a>), PS5 Digital Edition slim (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle-model-group-slim?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$499.99</a>), PlayStation Portal (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$219.99</a>), DualSense (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$79.99</a>), and DualSense Edge (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$219.99</a>).</p></div><p>However, if you don’t have much luck in the queue, preorders for the standard PS5 Pro at retailers like <a href="https://howl.me/cm93fQtADXd">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE%2F11839818124">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-pro-console%2F-%2FA-93620188">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> are set to open on October 10th.</p><p>The main prospect of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">PS5 Pro</a> is improved graphics and performance. The new console may <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">lack a disc drive</a> (you can get one for an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5HJNLM?tag=theverge02-20">additional $80</a>), but its new GPU, AI upscaling, and better ray tracing promise a new level of fidelity for this console generation — with the ability to maintain 4K resolution at 60fps across select titles. It may not be the most logical upgrade over a regular PS5 for everyone, but if you’re hungry for the best performance on exclusives like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248448/the-ps5-pro-makes-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-look-so-much-better"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, it may be the only way to achieve it (at least until <em>Rebirth</em> and other exclusives find their way to PC).</p><p><h3>How to preorder the standard PlayStation 5 Pro</h3></p><p>As mentioned above, Sony is opening up preorders for its $699.99 console first through <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console">PlayStation Direct</a>, which requires a PlayStation Network account. The site adds you to an online queue that refreshes automatically. If you’re one of the lucky ones to get through the queue without a hitch, you’ll be given a timed window to preorder the console and any accessories you might want. The PS5 Pro is set to land on November 7th, so preorders are expected to arrive then.</p><p>The <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console">official PlayStation storefront</a> may get first dibs on preorders, but retailers will have their opportunity to shut up and take your money on October 10th. That includes big ones like <a href="https://howl.me/cm93fQtADXd">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE%2F11839818124">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-pro-console%2F-%2FA-93620188">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. If the nightmarish PS5 restocks we witnessed in the early days of the pandemic were any indication, some retailers will have an organized queue in place while others (cough, cough... Amazon) may feel a bit like a bot-infested wild west. Here’s our go-to advice when the time comes:</p><div><ul><li>Create / log in to your account with the retailer ahead of time.</li><li>Have your billing / shipping info saved to make checkout as quick as possible.</li><li>If possible, try accessing the retail site using both your computer and the accompanying mobile app for your phone or tablet.</li></ul></div><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="BT5qcu" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console">PlayStation 5 Pro</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->700</span></p><p>The “pro” version of Sony’s PlayStation 5 has a bigger GPU, new PSSR AI-based upscaling, advanced ray tracing, and 2TB SSD (with expandable storage). The new features allow for better graphics at higher frame rates, allowing for the blending of “fidelity” and “performance” modes in some games.</p></div><p><h3>How to preorder the 30th anniversary PS5 Pro (Update: sold out)</h3></p><p>Launching two weeks after the PS5 Pro is Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249013/sony-playstation-ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-retro">special 30th anniversary collection</a>, a capsule of limited edition hardware honoring the arrival of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20995937/playstation-25th-anniversary-original-ps2-ps3-ps4-vita-photos-sony">original PlayStation</a> console 30 years ago. As a whole, the collection offers fans their pick of the following retro-styled editions: an extra-special PS5 Pro bundle, a Digital Edition PS5 slim, a PlayStation Portal, a DualSense Wireless Controller, and a DualSense Edge controller — all of which are available for preorder via the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle?emcid=ot-ps-456950">PlayStation Direct storefront</a> and launch on November 21st (aww thanks for the birthday gift, Sony).</p><p>The 30th anniversary PS5 Pro bundle is the ultra-exclusive one, as Sony is only making 12,300 individually numbered sets, and the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$999.99 bundle</a> includes a PS5 Pro console, two controllers (one of which is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>), and extra accessories / collectibles. If the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7362193/playstation-4-20th-anniversary-photos">last anniversary PlayStation console</a> is any indication, preorders are likely to sell out incredibly fast.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="SM2ls9" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle?emcid=ot-ps-456950">PlayStation 5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition BundIe</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><p>A limited edition bundle containing a PS5 Pro and accessories, all of which are clad in classic PlayStation styling.

Aside from the coloring of the console and controller, as well as the included cover plate for a disc drive, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">the same PS5 slim</a> that’s been with us for nearly a year now.</p><p><h3>How to preorder the 30th anniversary PlayStation Portal</h3></p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a> remains a quirky little peripheral, as the 8-inch handheld has one sole purpose: to stream games off your PS5 via Remote Play, complete with full DualSense integration and features. The Portal looks almost odd to my eyes in Sony’s retro aesthetic, but if you were already planning to pick up Sony’s latest mobile experiment and want a little nostalgic flare, you can currently get in line preorder the LE edition from the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">PlayStation Direct storefront</a> for $219.99 ahead of its November 21st release date.</p><p><h3>How to preorder the 30th anniversary DualSense controller</h3></p><p>Sony’s DualSense Wireless Controller is the cheapest way to dip your toe into the nostalgic waters of the 30th anniversary collection. The limited edition DualSense and DualSense Edge gamepads offer the same features as the standard models, only with multi-tone gray paint jobs and colorful PlayStation logo / button shapes. The <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">DualSense</a> and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">DualSense Edge</a> are available to preorder via <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us">PlayStation Direct</a> for $79.99 and $219.99, respectively, and are set to arrive on November 21st. <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-30th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition%2F12284220058">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cnaSW9Rybtv">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHLH13R5?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> also have listings for preorders of the 30th Anniversary DualSense.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><em><strong>Update September 26th, 10:53AM ET:</strong> Article has been updated with links to other retailers for the 30th Anniversary DualSense controller and to reflect that the 30th anniversary PS5 Pro bundle is sold out.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You might remember Kara Stone as the developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ritual-of-the-moon">Ritual Of The Moon</a>, a game about a banished witch that is played in bursts of five minutes a day, over the course of a lunar cycle. Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ritual-of-the-moon-diary-day-one">an article series to it back in 2019</a>, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/known-mysteries">Known Mysteries</a> is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.</p><!--more-->

<p>Stone's solar server project is broadly an exploration of the artistic possibilities of reliance on locally-generated renewable power. Known Mysteries itself is a sorrowful climate change fable in which a woman from a small Canadian town reckons with the dastardly doings of the neighbourhood oil-tech corporation. I'm not captivated by the premise and confessional tone, if I'm honest, but I love the corroded, iridescent visuals, and I'm very interested in how Stone (who serves as writer, designer, artist and programmer) has tailored Known Mysteries towards the server's capacities.</p>
<p>"The game is designed to be low-carbon," she observes in a press release. "It has highly compressed images and video that utilizes found footage, a low frame rate, and is divided into three distinct streamable chapters."</p>
<p>I wrote about Stone's solar server for <a href="https://www.techradar.com/features/the-quest-for-the-solar-powered-gaming-console">Techradar</a> in 2022, back when I plied the ever-ravenous waves of freelance. We talked a little at the time about how embracing the practicalities of locally generated solar power - for example, variable yields based on the time of day or weather, and difficulty scaling up with demand - might push back against always-on recreational culture.</p>
<p>"The idea is that things don't have to run 100% of the time, especially access to a game - it's really not crucial for anyone's life," Stone told me back then, scandalously. "So even if the server was down every night in my timezone - which it shouldn't be - I think that's fine." The emphasis on not having constant access to the game naturally makes me think of Ritual Of The Moon's daily rhythms and minimised playtime. (The server is hooked up to a car battery, so it can store a bit of power for overnight operation.)</p>
<p>Stone aside, Known Mysteries is the work of another programmer <a href="https://www.ckerich.com/">Chris Kerich</a> and voice actor <a href="https://partygirlrising.bandcamp.com/music">PARTYGIRL</a>, with music from <a href="https://amateurpainter.bandcamp.com/">Amateur Painter</a>. Stone has yet to announce any other games for the solar server. I'm intrigued to see whether the distribution platform might give rise to a range of bespoke "solar" genres, perhaps comparable to the disarming alt-history fusions of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ufo-50-review">UFO 50</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-after-remaster-announcement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you plan on picking up a copy of Horizon Zero Dawn in preparation for the launch of the remaster, get ready to pay a higher price. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was announced during PlayStation State of Play. The game, set to release for PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC, brings updates to visuals and performance.</p>



<p>For those that currently own the original Horizon Zero Dawn on PS4, the upgrade will cost you just $9.99/£9.99. But if you expected to get a copy of the game from the PlayStation Store now before upgrading, you will to be paying more than you would have just days ago.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://x.com/GamePittReviews/status/1839018836357476399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamePittReviews</a> and verified by Insider Gaming, Sony has quietly raised the price of Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition on the PlayStation Store. For the better part of the last six years, the game had been $19.99/£15.99 on the PlayStation Store. However, as of September 25, the <a href="https://psprices.com/region-us/game/1838981/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">price has jumped up</a> to $39.99/£34.99 on the store, doubling its cost.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the price increase, that would put the cost of getting Remaster version of the game at $49.99/£45.99 instead of $29.99/£25.99 if you were to buy new from the PlayStation Store. The price increase seems to just be at the PlayStation Store as you can still get the physical version of the game from stores like <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/products/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition---playstation-4/160630.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=feeds&amp;utm_campaign=%24PLA_%24LowCP_Catalog_Preowned%20Software&amp;utm_id=20619203887&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjNS3BhChARIsAOxBM6rYn4yKUzyFSjDuyhE-BygALM2pYImwcqFDCkVmqpX_Ey5lRR_DEf0aAuRVEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameStop</a> for $19.99 as of writing. You can also find it on the second-hand market even cheaper if it’s something you want to look for.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to PlayStation for comment on the price increase.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced a series of changes and quality-of-life improvements to both Xbox's UI and the Xbox app on mobile devices and PC. The update includes the ability to pre-load games and game updates on Xbox consoles via the mobile app, although Microsoft hasn't yet announced a specific date when this feature will go live.</p><p>One feature has already gone live, however: Game Bar Compact Mode. Optimized for smaller screens, Game Bar Compact Modes allows users to more easily navigate the Xbox app on mobile or handheld Windows devices. It can also be used to rapidly exit a game that's currently running.</p><p>"With Compact Mode enabled, access to widgets and navigation is simplified to ensure you can get to the content you want as easily as possible on smaller screens," explained <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent Xbox blog post</a> announcing the contents of the September update. "Compact Mode is also optimized to navigate with a controller, and you can quickly switch between widgets with left and right bumpers."</p><p>On the "coming soon" list is another feature for PC users, which will allow them to more easily peruse and install DLC and other game add-ons.</p><p>"Now you can view and install all add-ons related to the game that you are installing, regardless of when you acquired them or if they were part of the same bundle," Microsoft's blog post says of the upcoming feature. "This helps you see all content related to the game you are installing at a glance, instead of having to navigate the app to see and install the different add-ons or content tied to the game you want to play."</p><p>Xbox's mobile app is also getting a facelift via an update that will allow users to manage their Game Pass subscription right from the app. In the past, Microsoft oddly separated Xbox Game Pass content into its own app rather than within the Xbox mobile app.</p><p>According to Microsoft, players can expect the mobile app's update to begin rolling out this week--but only for Xbox beta members. Microsoft also announced that, due to the changes, new downloads of the Xbox Game Pass app will no longer be supported as of November, suggesting non-beta members may gain access to the new and improved app around the same time.</p><p>"Starting this week, we’re streamlining the mobile app experience by moving features from the separate Xbox Game Pass app into the Xbox app," the blog post explains. "These updates will be available for Xbox beta members on mobile and will be coming to everyone soon. As part of these changes, we will no longer support new downloads of the Xbox Game Pass app, starting in November. Key features--like the ability to explore Game Pass and manage your membership--will now be found in one place with the Xbox app on mobile."</p><p>The new app will also allow users to browse the entire Game Pass catalogue, and Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to claim their perks through the app and even livestream "select games" via Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS or Android devices.</p><p>September's update has a treat for console users, too: the ability to pre-download games and game updates so they're ready to go as soon as a game launches or an update goes live. Like the PC app's new Game Bar Compact Mode, this new feature is already live on Xbox consoles, and can be accessed by selecting "My Games &amp; Apps," then "Manage," then "Updates," which will take players to a page displaying all currently available pre-downloads.</p><p>"This [pre-download] feature is supported by some of your favorite games now, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cassette-beasts/">Cassette Beasts</a>--and expect many more titles to support it soon," the blog post reads.</p><p>But Xbox's September update has one final treat for console users: notifications that are genuinely useful.</p><p>"With the new update, when a game on your wish list is released, enters the Game Pass library, or becomes available as part of a Free Play Day promotion, you will now receive console notifications."</p><p>For users who--for whatever reason--don't wish to be alerted to a chance to play wishlisted games for free, these notifications can be toggled off in the console's user settings menu.</p><p>For more information on Xbox's September update, check out <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox blog</a>, which also includes a page dedicated to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">details regarding the new Game Bar Compact Mode</a>.</p>

        <p>French union calls employees to walk out for three days.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
French staff at Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft have been urged to strike for three days next month, after being told they should return to the office three days a week.
</p>
<p>
The call to walk out, first reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-workers-urged-to-strike-in-october-over-return-to-office">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, comes a week after Ubisoft announced that all of its 19,000 employees worldwide would be required to work from the office three days out of every five - albeit with some flexibility for certain individuals, and without a firm start date for the change.
</p>
<p>
Members of the French video game workers union STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo) have now <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/">called</a> on Ubisoft staff to strike on 15th to 17th October.
</p>
<p>
The move back to the office three days a week is one "without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives," the STJV said.
</p>
<p>
"After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions," it continued.
</p>
<p>
"Our employer knows this perfectly well. The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues' jobs, the disorganisation of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how many Ubisoft staff will walk out next month, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/700-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-france-over-failed-salary-negotiations">more than 700 employees took part in a day of strike action organised by the STJV back in February</a> this year, after annual salary negotiations collapsed. 
</p>
<p>
The call to strike lands further pressure on Ubisoft after a bruising 24 hours. Yesterday, the embattled publisher admitted <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> had underperformed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows would be delayed</a>, and it would now be carrying out a comprehensive review of projects as a result.
