            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/terrible-influence-satirical-board-game-about-global-entertainment-debuts-at-pax<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The entertainment brand WatchMojo is stepping into the world of tabletop gaming at this year's PAX Unplugged. Their debut title, <em>Terrible Influence</em>, is described as a satirical board game with comedian Mark Cope as its lead designer.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, the first public demo for <em>Terrible Influence</em> will be made available at PAX Unplugged 2024 in the Forever Stoked booth at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The convention begins Friday, December 6 and ends Sunday, December 8.</p>

The goal is to draw in an audience of passionate (and possibly deranged) fans and accrue as much wealth as possible, triggering juicy scandals along the way. You'll need that money and influence to avoid the consequences of Leaked DMs, Internet Trolls, and various Cancel cards. After all, if you're famous and rich enough consequences just go away.</p>

<p>The different online superstars in <em>Terrible Influence</em> include a funny podcaster, a vlogger with actual talent, a marketing-savvy reality TV show star, and many others. Players can gain valuable skill cards like Good Looking or Great Personality, and can role-play lucrative scenarios like sponsor ads or acceptance speeches to earn more money.</p>

To become President, naturally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The game is a comedic and frankly cynical journey through our modern society, where players try to earn as much money and fame as possible in order to win the game and become President” said Mark Cope, Creator and Lead designer of Terrible Influence. “The real humor comes from the wild bonuses and absurd scandals throughout the game, and if I’m honest, those are pulled more from real life than satire.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cope has over 15 years of film and TV experience, including the stop-motion series <em>The Most Popular Girls in School</em> and <em>Dr. Havoc's Diary</em>. Cope has also helped create shows and branded campaigns for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Harry Potter</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mattel-committing-to-board-game-accessibility-going-forward" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mattel</a>, and TruTV.</p>

<p><em>Terrible Influence</em> will launch on Kickstarter in 2025.</p>

It’s easy to recommend it to anyone willing to shed a tear. Though the game seems to function primarily as an allegory for pollution and protecting the planet, it can also hit particularly hard for those of us who have lost pets, as it deals with love, loss, grief, and rebirth in ways that are certain to cut you deeply if you let it. But it’s not just there to drain you. Rather, it serves as a meaningful reminder of the love and memories our companions leave behind. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196086,195301" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As such, the game’s trophy and achievement list even asks you to complete multiple tasks related to soothing and caring for Neva, your titular wolf-like companion, throughout the game’s brief runtime.

<p>Rainbow Six Siege’s Y9S4 update drops <strong>today</strong>, with Ubisoft taking the game offline for up to 60 minutes to apply the super-sized patch. It ushers in Operation Collision Point, which brings a new Operator to the game, as well as a slew of new features, tweaks, and balances.</p>



<p>It’s the last major update of the year for Rainbow Six Siege – check out the Y9S4 patch notes below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-does-operation-collision-point-release">When Does Operation Collision Point Release?</h2>



<p>Operation Collision Point is released today, December 3 on all platforms. It’s a free-to-consume update that brings countless new features and changes to the game, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blackbeard, a new Attacker</li>



<li>Player Protection updates</li>



<li>Ballistic Shield balances</li>



<li>Console to PC crossplay 1.0</li>



<li>Matchmaking improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a serious update that has players excited. This is typical of Ubisoft, though. Every so often, the team releases a major update into the Rainbow Six Siege ecosystem that alters the playing field – it’s why Siege has stayed on top for almost a decade.</p>



<h3 id="h-y9s4-patch-size">Y9S4 Patch Size</h3>



<p>Here are the download sizes for the Operation Collision Point update:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ubisoft Connect: 73.99 GB</li>



<li>Steam: 14.8 GB</li>



<li>Xbox One: 34.4 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series X: 40.7 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 4: 39.90 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 5: 36.74 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>It was noted that the download sizes are larger than usual because the team has completed a texture reforge.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/6MQfBtcDbLYv6CbQxZg3pF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Y9S4 patch</a> is huge both in size and in what it offers. From an Operator price decrease to new seasonal skins, and hundreds of bug fixes to the introduction of the Siege Cup ecosystem, players are being spoilt rotten by Ubisoft this month.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nes-tetris-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-new-tetris-the-grand-master-game-announced.1050615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetris-nintendo-switch-online-the-grand-master<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced another new NES addition to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and you're bound to get along with this one if you like classic old-school puzzle games.</p>

<p>None other than the NES version of legendary block-arranging puzzler&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>is heading to Switch Online next week; it'll be added to the service's lineup on December 12th, and you'll be able to play it as long as you have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this isn't the first version of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>to land on Switch Online. The iconic Game Boy version has been available on the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">since 2023</a>, and if you count&nbsp;<em>Panel de Pon&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>game (since it was localized as&nbsp;<em>Tetris Attack&nbsp;</em>in 1996), then that's been on Switch Online <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-getting-new-snes-and-nes-games" rel="nofollow">since 2020</a>.</p>

Screenshot courtesy of YouTube channel World of Longplays and Spikestuff.</figcaption></figure><p>This is Nintendo's version of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>as opposed to the short-lived Atari version released earlier in 1989; that version was pulled from sale pretty quickly after its release, and you won't even find it on the recent&nbsp;<em>Tetris Forever&nbsp;</em>collection.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to get to enjoy another version of this classic puzzler on Switch Online, even if <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">many</a> do seem to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_how_nintendo_killed_the_best_version_of_tetris" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">regard</a> the Atari version as technically superior.</p>

<p>That's not all that's happening in the world of&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, either. Earlier today, developer Arika announced a new installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master&nbsp;</em>series, and it's scheduled for release next year.</p>

<p>The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master 4: Absolute Eye&nbsp;</em>will land on PC via Steam "by the end of March 2025", according to Arika. There's no word yet on whether it's getting a console release, but it will be an "offline game", Arika says.</p>

<p><em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>lands on Nintendo Switch Online on December 12th.&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master 4: Absolute Eye&nbsp;</em>is set to come to Steam next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311887/intel-battlemage-b580-b570-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel’s next — and possibly last — desktop graphics cards will begin arriving in just 10 days. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24309086/intel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">Right on cue</a>, the company has announced the budget $249 Arc B580 and $219 Arc B570, shipping December 13th and January 16th, respectively, as the “best-in-class performance per dollar” options in the GPU market.</p><p>They’re based on the same Xe2 “Battlemage” GPU architecture you’ll find in Intel’s Lunar Lake laptop chips but with more than double the graphics cores, up to 12GB of dedicated video memory, and up to 190W of power compared to their limited laptop forms — enough power to see the B580 slightly beat Nvidia’s $299 RTX 4060 and AMD’s $269 RX 7600, according to Intel’s benchmarks, but sometimes still trading blows.</p><p>For example, Intel claims the B580 runs 10 percent faster on average than the RTX 4060 in a wide array of games at 1440p and ultra settings, assuming you pair both with Intel’s pricey Core i9-14900K CPU. There, Intel says that combo can break a 60fps average in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, <em>Returnal, </em>and <em>The Witcher 3</em> where the 4060 can’t. </p><p>And yet the Nvidia card is still ahead in <em>Starfield, Gears 5</em>, and a pair of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games (as well as <em>Counter-Strike 2, DOTA 2, </em>and<em> League of Legends</em>, though all cards have plenty of frames there<em>)</em> despite widespread reviewer consensus in 2023 that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23777753/nvidia-rtx-4060-review-roundup">Nvidia’s RTX 4060 was underpowered and hamstrung</a>. Intel’s <em>really</em> relying on price to sell this one. </p><p>Compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23382391/intel-arc-a750-a770-gpu-graphics-card-review-test-benchmarks-price">Intel’s previous-gen A750</a>, which originally retailed for $289 but can now be found for $180, the new card runs 24 percent faster on average, according to Intel — but it may again depend on the game. In that test, Intel ran many games with its XeSS AI upscaling turned on, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> barely ran faster on the new GPU.</p><p>Intel suggests that you can truly see the B580’s clear advantages in situations where its competitors are memory-constrained, as the B580 has 12GB of video memory to the 4060’s 8GB. One example: in <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, the Nvidia card apparently beats the Intel one 86fps to 77fps, but Intel wins 64fps to 57fps when you turn on ray tracing. </p><p>Intel didn’t offer individual comparisons to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">AMD RX 7600</a> or any comparisons whatsoever against the new Arc B570.  </p><p>Intel will sell its own Arc B580 Limited Edition card with two fans, a single 8-pin power connector, and “whisper quiet” performance; Acer, ASRock, Gunnir, Sparkle, Maxsun, and Onix will sell versions as well.</p><p>It’s refreshing to see video cards come in at lower price points with more memory and memory bandwidth than the competition, but the GPU market has a tendency to self-correct pricing quickly, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301811/nvidia-just-made-nearly-20-billion-in-pure-profit-in-a-single-quarter">Nvidia has profits to spare</a>. It’d be nice if the gap were bigger, or to see what Intel could do with more cores. While the company says its newer Xe2 cores offer 70 percent better performance <em>per core</em> than last gen, the B580 doesn’t get a 70 percent performance uplift because it includes fewer cores.</p><p>I wouldn’t bet on such a future card coming out, though, because Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu">recently suggested</a> the company’s discrete graphics card were on the chopping block — shortly before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310983/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retired">he got chopped from Intel himself</a>.</p><p>Intel’s also announcing some very welcome upgrades to its XeSS technology today, a resolution and frame rate enhancing competitor to Nvidia DLSS and AMD FSR. The new XeSS 2 now offers frame generation (which substantially increases frame rates by imagining new frames between existing ones) and a Xe Low Latency mode that, Intel claims, can completely eliminate the penalty of using that frame generation technique. </p><p>For best results, Low Latency needs to be integrated into games to sync with their game engines correctly, but Intel will offer a driver-based version you can toggle on and off, too. </p><p>Intel says XeSS 2 is coming to <em>F1 24, Marvel Rivals, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Killing Floor 3, Citadels, Dying Light 2, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, Ascendant</em>, and <em>RoboCop: Rogue City.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> series will live on, but Elden Ring 2? That's slightly more in doubt. So says Hidetaka Miyazaki, the original Elden Lord, in a new interview about From Software's current projects, which apparently span a variety of genres.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The interview in question is a roundtable chat from this month's PS Awards, as passed on by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1644616.html">Game Watch</a>. It's also in Japanese. Not being much of a Japanese reader, I'm wary of quoting from it directly, but Miyazaki does say that right now, Elden Ring 2 is not in development, though From naturally has plans for Elden Ring in general. Miyazaki has previously suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-is-the-limit-for-from-software-project-scale-says-miyazaki-multiple-smaller-games-may-be-the-next-stage">From Software's future game projects might be smaller in terms of development resources than Elden Ring</a>, commenting in the wake of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC that he'd have serious "concerns" about going bigger.
</p>
<p>
Chalk the hesitancy about Elden Ring 2 up as a minor tactical victory for everybody's favourite high school club, the Elden Ring Isn't That Amazing Brigade, current president: me. I have wittered on here before about my apathy for From's first "proper" open world game, so I won't bend your ear about the superiority of branching world design again. But I will say that I'd much rather play, for example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/souls-devs-fromsoftware-also-want-bloodborne-on-pc-even-if-the-games-own-director-cant-admit-it">a Bloodborne PC port</a> or a sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro</a>, From's magnificently mouldy reprise of Tenchu.
</p>
<p>
In the interview above, Miyazaki also says that From Software have a variety of projects on the go, spanning a range of genres - this in response to a question about whether their next game will be science-fiction or fantasy. Miyazaki himself appears to be game director for at least one of these projects.</p><p>This isn't exactly mind-blowing news - From Software have been working on parallel projects that straddle the realms of fantasy and SF for years. But I'm happy to think aloud about what kind of fiction the next From Software project might inhabit, assuming it isn't a sequel.
</p>
<p>
In particular, I was talking to Brendy the other day about the possibility of a From Software Soulslike that isn't broadly the tale of an outcast chosen one overthrowing a corrupted divine ruler. While the details vary, that particular thematic arc is arguably the heart of every Souls game. Given the extent to which the politics and metaphysics of From's worlds inform the detail of character progression and combat, I'm not sure it's even possible to make a Soulslike that isn't about a cosmic cycle of usurpation. I guess the obvious source of inspiration would be the Armored Core series, which tell a different kind of story. Then again, I've never found Armored Core plots very exciting.
</p>
<p>
I might end up writing a fusty longread on the subject. As and when I ever get to interview Miyazaki, I'll ask him about it too. Although in the shorter term, I would probably ask him whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-is-in-talks-to-buy-dark-souls-and-elden-ring-parent-company-kadokawa">Sony are really going to buy From Software's parent company Kadokawa</a>, and if so, how that might impact his job.

            <p>We don't know yet if the AI revolution of our reality will go full Skynet or simply end with the robots unceremoniously dumping us like a sad Joaquin Phoenix. But at least video games can help us speculate. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heart-of-the-machine">Heart Of The Machine</a> is a cyberpunk 4X strategy game that will let players choose how a newly awakened AI sentience might behave once set loose upon a big future city. Developers Arcen Games call it a "turn-based sci-fi 4X RPG", which is a lot of genres fighting for supremacy in one small phrase. It was announced last year, but today it gets a release date and an updated demo. </p>

<p>It's due out January 31st, say the devs, and will be an early access release. The game takes place in a grim future civilisation where "despite its technological advances and dreams of a bright future, centuries of rot have taken hold". Sounds familiar. From the video, it does look very 4X-ish, with a lot of detailed menus and building sidebars. The city will feature "genetics labs, factories, nuclear silos, military complexes, and much more", we're told. You can build robot manufacturing plants to make android fighters, and tap into the city's electricity grid to power your processor-heavy scheming. Although it all depends what sort of AI big boss you want to be, say the creators.</p>
<p>"Raise an army of robots to rule by force, become a benevolent machine overlord, or explore a constellation of alternative paths as you strive to find your place amidst a crumbling society in desperate need of saving (from itself)."</p>
<p>To that end, it looks like there'll be some classic moralistic decision-making. One prompt in the above trailer shows a robot meeting a bunch of slum cats. You get the choice to befriend the cats (correct choice) or liquidate them for "samples" (evil, bad, unforgivable choice - do not pick, do not harm the cats, I am warning you). There will also be different factions who can serve as allies or rivals, like the "corrupt corporate executives that run the city" who you might tap for cash or vow to destroy. </p><p>There are military options to achieve your goals too, including "a varied array of combat androids for when things get violent". You can catch a quick glimpse of the phrase "slurry spiders" in the trailer, for example (as someone who grew up near a farm with a slurry pit, this is a truly terrifying concept). But there'll also be more hacky and manipulative ways to go about getting what you want, say the devs. </p>
<p>But why am I even repeating all this stuff? You can just go play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001070/Heart_of_the_Machine/">the demo on Steam</a> if you're interested. It has been playable since an earlier Steam Next Fest. But it's now been updated to include a rewritten prologue, rejigged combat, and some new quests and events, including one in which you can "adopt a pet". Please do not liquidate it for samples.</p>
<p>Also, don't confuse this game with the other robo-led urban sprawler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/build-a-blissful-art-deco-sci-fi-city-as-an-ai-mayor-in-technotopia-out-this-october">Technotopia</a>, a city-building card game in which you also play as the AI "mayor" of a big art deco futuropolis. They are different robots. Please don't upset the machines.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-spotify-wrapped-2024-coming-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Spotify Wrapped is one of the most exciting times of the year for the 250 million subscribers to the music streaming service. It doesn’t matter if you use it to play background noises while gaming or if you rely on it solely on your commute, <strong>everyone </strong>waits all year round for Spotify Wrapped to drop.</p>



<p>With that being said, Spotify has kept a tight wrapper around this year’s release, refusing to give anything away on social media. When is Spotify Wrapped 2024 coming out, and where can you find it when it does?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-is-spotify-wrapped-2024">Where is Spotify Wrapped 2024?</h2>



<p>Spotify Wrapped first surfaced in 2016 as the platform’s attempt to sum up everyone’s listening habits for the past 12 months. It has evolved with time and has become much more granular, and it’s now a staple in the calendar of every subscriber worldwide.</p>



<p>With Spotify Wrapped, you’re given unique insights into the music that defined your year. You’ll be offered an audio-visual trip down memory lane <strong>and </strong>a playlist tailored exclusively to you.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but when is Spotify Wrapped 2024 coming out?</p>



<p>Spotify Wrapped has always dropped around the first week of December, so we can expect it to arrive in the coming days (at the time of publishing). Here’s a brief history:</p>



<ul>
<li>2023: November 29</li>



<li>2022: November 30</li>



<li>2021: December 1</li>



<li>2020: December 2</li>



<li>2019: December 5</li>



<li>2018: December 6</li>



<li>2017: December 6</li>
</ul>



<p>Potentially, we’re looking at a release date of December 4 for Spotify Wrapped 2024.</p>



<p>To find it, you’ll just need to log into the Spotify app on a mobile or desktop device and you’ll be presented with a pop-up alerting you that your Spotify Wrapped 2024 breakdown is ready. Then, you’ll have a 2024 lookback playlist contained in your ‘Made For You’ section on the app.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to unlocking your end-of-year report from Spotify? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re expecting in your Spotify Wrapped.</p>

Miyazaki previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-there-is-interest-dev-says/1100-6524511/" data-ref-id="1100-6524511">people have expressed interest in making an Elden Ring movie</a>, but no such project has been officially announced.</p><p>Miyazaki also confirmed that From Software has multiple games currently in the works; he's working on some directly, while others are being managed by different developers at the studio.</p><p>Elden Ring, which was released in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-passes-25-million-players-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree-expansion-launch/1100-6524201/" data-ref-id="1100-6524201">reached 25 million players in June</a>, and that was before Shadow of the Erdtree's release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-a-life-2-0-in-stalker-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When STALKER 2 was released on November 20, one thing that was missing was the ‘A-Life 2.0’ that was promised to make The Zone a living, breathing world. It was said that A-Life 2.0 would serve as a solid evolution of the A-Life mechanics featured in the earlier STALKER games, giving players a sense of being present in a world populated by intelligent AI characters.</p>



<p>That’s not there in STALKER 2, and recently, GSC removed a reference to A-Life 2.0 from the game’s listing on Steam. However, GSC’s CEO has sat down with IGN to explain what happened to A-Life 2.0 and why it’s not in STALKER 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-did-a-life-2-0-go">Where Did A-Life 2.0 Go?</h2>



<p>In an interview with IGN, Ievgen Grygorovych, the CEO of GSC Game World, explained what happened to A-Life 2.0. It was penned as being one of the most advanced features in STALKER 2, allowing players to witness events unfolding independently of their input, with NPCs almost living their own lives irrespective of what the player was doing.</p>



<p>Grygorovych said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This system to work properly requires a much larger area for spawn NPCs, and it requires much more memory resources. We were fighting with optimization. To optimize, you have a lot of things that need your resources, and you try to cut things from different directions to properly optimize the game well.</p>



<p>But to make it work we had to optimize some things, and they make A-Life work in many situations not as it should. Also, we created some bugs not long ago before release with NPCs spawning in the air and dropping back to the bottom. They should actually spawn in the terrain. Why it happened, I don’t know! And also we had some bugs with AI behavior.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He explained that the team is working very hard to stabilise A-Life 2.0 and deliver what was promised, but it’s ‘very broken and not working’. In another statement, GSC’s creative director, Maria Grygorovych, threw the blame at the company’s marketing team, stressing it was <strong>them </strong>who removed the reference to A-Life 2.0 on Steam without permission.</p>



<p>She brought receipts, though. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview with IGN</a>, she showed screenshots of a conversation between her and the ‘marketing person’ who removed the details on Steam. However, the team <strong>won’t </strong>put the reference back until they’ve fixed A-Life 2.0.</p>



<p>That’s what happened – but it’s now up to GSC to patch up A-Life 2.0 and turn it into something that resembles what was promised.</p>

It’s proof, she says, that she’s telling me the truth about Stalker 2’s A-Life 2.0 system. The message is about why mention of A-Life 2.0 was pulled from Stalker 2’s Steam page and replaced with a generic description about the way AI works in the game. It turns out that Maria found out the description had changed when she saw players complaining about it on Reddit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stalker 2 launched late last month to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-launches-big-on-steam-as-dev-promises-fixes-for-rough-edges">a positive reception on Steam</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-with-many-more-playing-on-xbox-game-pass">one million sales</a>. It’s a success for the Ukrainian studio, a miracle, really, considering the harrowing circumstances that followed Russian’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. Stalker 2 suffers from well-documented bugs; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2s-first-big-patch-has-dropped-and-it-makes-over-650-fixes">GSC knows this and is working as hard as it can to fix them</a>. But it’s A-Life 2.0 — or its apparent absence — that has gained the most attention from fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A-Life was a key feature of the first Stalker game that governed AI behavior across the game world. At a high level, it is a system for simulating life in the Zone that works its magic seemingly independently of the player’s actions or whereabouts. It helps to create convincing AI and the emergent gameplay Stalker is famous for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC had said A-Life 2.0 would make the Zone feel alive as never before, that it would fuel emergent gameplay on a scale previously thought impossible. Indeed for some fans, A-Life 2.0 was Stalker 2’s biggest selling point. Unfortunately, now Stalker 2 is out in the wild, A-Life 2.0 hasn’t quite lived up to that billing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, it feels as if A-Life 2.0 isn’t even in the game. Players have found little evidence to suggest anything approaching a life simulation is in operation at any scale, with NPCs and enemies spawning around the player and sometimes in obvious ways. This, players have said, lends Stalker 2 a more scripted feel than its predecessor, with emergent gameplay sorely lacking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what happened? GSC CEO Ievgen Grygorovych and creative director Maria Grygorovych offer an explanation during our interview, which takes place at BAFTA in Piccadilly, London following a screening of <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a>. The 90-minute documentary, which includes interviews with GSC’s Ukrainian staff as they contend with the invasion, reveals the remarkable circumstances surrounding the extremely difficult development of Stalker 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s with this in mind that Ievgen and Maria explain what went wrong with A-Life 2.0, revealing for the first time how the studio's battle to optimize the performance of Stalker 2 in the months before release caused the feature to break down. A-Life 2.0 is in Stalker 2, the pair insist, it’s just bugged. Massively bugged.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/03/20241202-202049-1733223547947.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ievgen and Maria Grygorovych, far right, discuss the making of Stalker 2 at BAFTA 195 Piccadilly. Photo by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ievgen offers a technical explanation of what happened. In short, optimization issues ahead of launch forced GSC to shrink the area around the player in which A-Life 2.0 works. It is supposed to extend much farther in virtual distance terms than it currently does, but to get Stalker 2 into a decent place performance wise across PC and Xbox Series X and S, the developers had to reduce this distance. Then came the bugs on top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This system to work properly requires a much larger area for spawn NPCs, and it requires much more memory resources," Ievgen says in English, which isn't his first language. "We were fighting with optimization. To optimize, you have a lot of things that need your resources, and you try to cut things from different directions to properly optimize the game well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But to make it work we had to optimize some things, and they make A-Life work in many situations not as it should. Also, we created some bugs not long ago before release with NPCs spawning in the air and dropping back to the bottom. They should actually spawn in the terrain. Why it happened, I don’t know! And also we had some bugs with AI behavior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, all these things connected make it look like it's very broken and not working. But we are now continuing working on the optimization part to bring more resources for the A-Life system, to increase the range where A-Life is actually visualized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are NPCs outside of the range of the player and they are in offline mode. And when the player reaches some distance, they are going to online mode and they pop back up. The distance is dictated by our optimization range, where we stream the real world and not real world with all the collisions. It was tough work, and because of these optimization problems and bugs, it's become broken.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, so now we know what went wrong with A-Life 2.0. The question is, can GSC fix it? Or, can it get A-Life 2.0 into a place where it realizes the developer’s ambition and makes good on that initial promise? Absolutely, Ievgen and Maria insist. In fact that’s exactly what the developer is working on now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For now we committed to players to make it work and it can be done from directions both optimizing, giving more resources to A-Life, fixing bugs, making it work properly, and then putting more efforts to make it more advanced,” Ievgen says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this brings us nicely back to A-Life 2.0’s mysterious disappearance from Stalker 2’s Steam page upon the game’s release. Its original description, which mentioned A-Life 2.0 by name alongside promises about how game-changing it would be, was removed and replaced by another description that fails to mention A-Life 2.0 at all. "Advanced artificial intelligence systems that will keep engaged even the most hard-boiled players,” it now reads. That’s not particularly exciting to fans, who are at best worried about the future of A-Life 2.0, at worst accusing GSC of misleading them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>He did that without any discussion or permission. He didn’t ask, ‘Do we have some bugs with A-Life or something?’ Because we had.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Maria tells me someone on GSC’s marketing team took it upon themselves to change the A-Life 2.0 description to make it easier to understand. The thinking, apparently, was that Stalker newcomers wouldn't have a clue what A-Life meant and might dismiss it. But this marketing person didn’t run the change by Maria first before pushing it live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He told me there will be a lot of new players who don’t know what A-Life is,” Maria says. “They need to understand what we’re talking about in this description. So I will try to change it to a more understandable form. He did that without any discussion or permission. He didn’t ask, ‘Do we have some bugs with A-Life or something?’ Because we had. We knew that. It’s a really huge and difficult system. But, when he did that before release, it was a surprise for me, because I noticed it because of Reddit. We did the Steam page in 2021. So for me, I was shocked, honestly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maria admits her explanation of events might sound unconvincing or suspicious, and suggests I probably don’t believe a word she’s saying. “People think it looks like it’s connected to us releasing the game with broken A-Life,” she says. “But it’s not. Even now, I’m talking about it to you, and you’re thinking, 'Hmm, yeah, yeah, it was some guy in the marketing team.' I understand it sounds suspicious!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So she pulls out her phone and scrolls for a bit before showing me a screenshot of the inter-company message proving she was telling the truth about this marketing person changing the Steam page without her knowledge. I tell her I believed her anyway, but she insists on showing me her phone screen and yep, it’s there, in black and white.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, will GSC put that A-Life 2.0 description back on Stalker 2’s Steam page? Not until the feature itself is fixed, Maria insists. But there’s no timeframe for that, and it’s hard to push for one given half the development team is still working in Ukraine and faces week-long power cuts that blanket the country in darkness and cut off internet access.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have a relationship with our players and players wanted to see something," Maria says. "We have to do it for them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you survive in the Zone, we've got a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Stalker 2 Tips and Tricks</a>, plus a guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_to_Do_First_in_Stalker_2">Things to Do First in Stalker 2</a> to help you through the early game, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_Stalker_2_Doesn%27t_Tell_You">Things Stalker 2 Doesn't Tell You</a> - everything we wish we knew before we started playing.

<p>He added FromSoftware is working on multiple projects, though did not specify if some form of Elden Ring game is one of them.</p>

<p>The company's future is uncertain too, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">reports Sony is looking to acquire FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> raked in over $200m during its first month of launch, according to recent estimates by <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">AppMagic</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-skyrockets-to-200m-in-first-month/">PocketGamer</a>, the mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly £164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>The report added Pokémon TCG Pocket's average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p>

<p>The game saw a boost on 22nd November, when it recorded $8.4m thanks to the start of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak event. A comparatively reserved $2.7m was spent in the game on its first day, 30th October, which remains its lowest level of player spending as its success has soared.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket reached its highest weekly earnings on its third week post launch, with $51.1m. This declined by three percent the following week, to $49.7m.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived at the end of October, and within its first four days reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">earned $12.1m</a>. That number of course soon swelled even more, and Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a> in its first three weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-2-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring developer FromSoftware is currently not considering creating a sequel for their highly successful game, but this doesn't mean that the series won't be expanded in the future for certain.</p>
<p>During today's PlayStation Partner Awards, Japanese publication <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1644616.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameWatch</a> talked with FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki about what's next for the development studio after the release of the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. At the moment, the studio is not considering the development of a second entry in the series, but this doesn't mean that a sequel will never be made. For the time being, FromSoftware is working on multiple projects covering different genres, some of them under the direction of Miyazaki-san himself, which will show some different sides of the Japanese development studio.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's latest release is the aforementioned Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, which launched earlier this year on PC and consoles. The expansion is every bit as good as the base game, featuring the same mechanics and open-world setting that made The Lands Between so memorable, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/vulture-aid-perk-zombies-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has reignited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-zombies-split-screen-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> as the mode returned back to its round-based roots. The undead mode has been all about giving the community what they want, a classic Zombies experience, with all the Perks and features fans know and love.</p>



<p>Speaking of Perks, you’ll find a familiar bunch in both Terminus and Liberty Falls, from Juggernog, Speedcola and Quick Revive to Deadshot Daiquiri, Stamina-Up and PHD Flopper.  With the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts map</a>, the devs have decided to reintroduce a Perk from Black Ops 2 called Vulture Aid.</p>



<p>For those who aren’t familiar with the Perk, here’s what Vulturue Aid is in Black Ops 6 Zombies and how it works.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-what-is-vulture-aid-in-bo6-zombies">What is Vulture Aid in BO6 Zombies?</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-where-is-vulture-aid-perk-in-black-ops-6-zombies">Where is Vulture Aid Perk in Black Ops 6 Zombies?</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vulture-aid-in-bo6-zombies">What is Vulture Aid in BO6 Zombies?</h2>



<p>Vulture Aid is a <strong>Zombies Perk that players can purchase in the Black Ops 6 Citadelle des Morts map</strong>, which arrives December 5, 2024, as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-release-date-new-guns-codmas-event-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Reloaded update</a>. </p>



<p>The Vulture Aid Perk was first introduced in Black Ops 2’s Buried map and hasn’t been seen since. It returns in Black Ops 6, and it will likely feature the same coffin-style red and white Perk machine design.</p>

<h2 id="h-vulture-aid-perk-effects">Vulture Aid Perk effects</h2>



<ul>
<li>See Perks, wall weapons, the Pack-a-Punch machine, and the Mystery Box through walls when close-by (they will also have a brighter glow for better visability).</li>



<li>Zombies also occasionally drop ammo or points on death</li>



<li>Some Zombies will release a green cloud upon death that players can walk into to mask themselves from Zombies and be ignored.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are the effects of Vulture Aid in Black Ops 2. There’s no telling whether the Perk will have the same effects in Black Ops 6 until mwe get hands on, but it will likely be very similar.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-vulture-aid-perk-in-black-ops-6-zombies">Where is Vulture Aid Perk in Black Ops 6 Zombies?</h2>



<p>Venture Aid is on the Citadelle des Morts map in Black Ops 6 Zombies. We don’t yet know exactly where the Perk Machine will be, but it has been confirmed for the new map.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> has begun testing Reward Road, a new in-game scheme to provide additional bonuses when players spend real-world money on virtual items.
</p>
<p>
The reward program is live now to some players in Australia and New Zealand while developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> gathers feedback. So far, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h54bog">reddit</a> report that the scheme offers 30 Points for this month's £5 "Eggs-pedition" event ticket. The top reward from the scheme requires 3000 Points, suggesting this will be unlocked when players spend an eye-popping £500.
</p>
<p>
So what are these rewards? Well, for 50 Points (so not quite enough from spending a fiver) you'll get one Premium Battle Pass. That's not terrible, but it's not great either.
</p>
<p>
Hit 750 Points and you'll also have claimed a couple of Incubators, plus a Lucky Egg, a Star Piece, a couple of incense and some stickers. This is all stuff that you could get in-game relatively easily (by winning a Showcase, for example) or purchase in a box with PokéCoins for a lot less than it would cost to hit the 750 Points mark with real-world money.
</p><p>
Reward Road only awards points when you spend cash - not PokéCoins which can be earned for free in-game, and also not if you buy tickets to real-world events like in-person Go Fests, presumably because Niantic uses its own web platform for those. Oh, and your points reset each month, so the race will always be on to spend more every 30 days.
</p>
<p>By the time you've hit 3000 Points, you'll have unlocked around 15 Battle Passes and 16 Incubators, as well as a smattering of other rewards. This might cost you around a tenner normally if buying in an in-game bundle. But is it worth spending more to hit £500? Nowhere close.</p>
<p>
It's hard to see anyone but Pokémon Go's true whales deliberately spending more money per month to unlock these rewards. But perhaps they are the target market here. It'll be interesting to see whether Reward Road is tweaked further and makes it out of testing to a wider release.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-dual-destiny-hemisphere-seasonal-spawns-end-date-9404">Pokémon Go's new Dual Destiny season</a> kicks off today with an event that introduces Sinistea, the teacup Pokémon. Cheers!

			<p>With The Witcher 4, developer CD Projekt Red may fix the known stuttering issues that plague Unreal Engine 5 games by changing how things are done in the engine, but not all improvements may be implemented in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> replied to a fan asking if CDPR will fix the aforementioned Unreal Engine 5 stuttering issues in The Witcher 4, delving deeper into a topic that was briefly touched upon a few months back. The tech experts highlighted how the developer has made it known they are well aware of them in a presentation held earlier this year during Unreal Fest Prague conducted by Jarosław Rudzki titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaCf2Qmvy18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Small Open Doors Can Lead to Better CPU Utilization and Bigger Games.</a> The presentation was centered on the Polish studio's findings from their own games and in Unreal Engine 5 regarding how frame times get worse by moving around in a game, and the bigger the world, and the more actors get involved in the game's world, the worse frame times get. As such, it is suggested that things must be done differently in Unreal Engine 5 than ever before to reduce the well-known frame time issues seen so far, such as changing how streaming is handled and more. Judging from this presentation, it is very likely that CDPR will do things differently in The Witcher 4 to address these issues and deliver a smooth open-world experience.</p>
<p>CDPR solving the Unreal Engine 5 stuttering issues for The Witcher 4, however, doesn't mean that all games powered by the engine will instantly benefit from the improvements made by the Polish Studio. Some of them, for example, could be game-specific, while others may take some time to get implemented in the engine itself, despite the partnership between CDPR and Epic. For example, there's a well-known issue with software Lumen in games like Fortnite that prevents it from being enabled in AMD APUs, such as those powering handheld systems like the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally, that has yet to be officially fixed. So, there's a very good chance it will still be mostly up to the developers to address these issues that are affecting the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5-powered games.</p>

<p>Some time since its initial reveal, The Witcher 4 has finally entered <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/">full production</a>. A release window has yet to be confirmed, but hopefully, it won't take long to learn more about the first entry in the series that will not feature Geralt of Rivia as the main character.</p>
