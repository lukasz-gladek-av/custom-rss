            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord’s adding a new commerce feature that will let users buy digital items for games they might not even play. Starting with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113437/marvel-rivals-trailer-netease-pc-mcu-disney">Marvel Rivals,</a></em> users will be able to search, buy, wishlist, and gift cosmetics without ever leaving the platform.</p><p>It works like this. Starting today, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will have a new store page accessible directly within the game’s official Discord server. There you can browse and buy offerings without launching the game client. Users can also create wishlists for specific items that will appear in their profile, where friends can also view and buy them. Discord cofounder and chief technology officer Stan Vishnevskiy tells <em>The Verge</em> that it’s the wishlist and gifting aspect of the new store that offers the most opportunity to both the platform and game developers.</p><p>“On any single day, 20 percent of purchases are gifts,” he said, talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981434/discords-in-app-shop-is-now-available-to-everyone">Discord’s current shop</a> that sells cosmetics to zhuzh up user profiles. “And on holidays, it can spike to way over 30 percent.” With these new store features, the team saw an opportunity to let users extend that generosity beyond Discord-specific borders. Discord also has the opportunity to take a cut of the purchases but did not disclose the specifics of how that revenue will be split. Vishnevskiy said that the goal is to provide incremental revenue and value to developers. “We’re not ultimately just taking a cut for something,” he said.</p><p>That value comes in making the purchasing experience simple and seamless while adding the potential for new player acquisition. Vishnevskiy said that buying items for yourself within <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is fairly straightforward, but it can be tedious trying to buy for someone else and impossible, outside of gift cards, if you don’t already play the game. “We all have friends that play games that we don’t play, and they love things that we don’t always love,” Vishnevskiy said. “This gives an opportunity for a game developer to reach the friends of people that could now potentially be customers.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>A mockup of what the </em>Marvel Rivals <em>store will look like in Discord.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Discord</cite></span></p></section><p>The shop is available in US currency and only on the desktop app, but Vishnevskiy said that bringing the offering to consoles and mobile is “top of mind” for the team. As for why the feature started with <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, Vishnevskiy says it was a natural fit. “They have the largest gaming server on Discord, with over 4 million people that they constantly run events with and make reasons [for players] to show up.”</p><p>But while <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is the only game that has this feature right now, it won’t only be the big AAA games and publishers able to take advantage of this program. Vishnevskiy spoke about Discord’s introduction of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/758146/discord-now-lets-developers-add-chat-and-social-features-right-into-their-games">social SDK earlier this year</a>, which lets developers of all sizes integrate chat and other social features into their games. He said Discord’s in-game shop plan will follow the same route. “We’re starting with more AAA games, but our intent is to make sure this is available long term beyond them,” Vishnevskiy said.</p><p>In the current media landscape, media and gaming platforms are experimenting with ways <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794923/meta-facebook-tiktok-reels-friend-bubble">to keep people engaged</a> for longer to monopolize and thereby <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/711304/instagram-enshitification">monetize their attention to varying degrees of success and</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791595/instagram-uploading-features-content">user irritation</a>. According to Vishnevskiy, this new feature isn’t designed to keep people on the Discord wheel, but something he says will enhance the already meaningful experiences players have on the platform. “Telling people, ‘Hey, your friend loves this game and they love this character, and if it’s their birthday, they would appreciate this.’ It’s something uniquely Discord can do,” he said.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/835385/discord-shop-marvel-rivals-gifting-wishlist]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1370215</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>December is here and both Black Friday and Cyber Monday are in the rearview mirror. If you missed your shot at purchasing some holiday gifts during the biggest sales event of the year, you’re not out of luck just yet. Some deals are still active and attractive for late shoppers like us. One such deal is on the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the true wireless Bluetooth earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Normally priced at $250, these earbuds are currently available for just $140—a whole $110 in savings, thanks to a 44% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultimate Comfort and Fit</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are designed to be the most comfortable in-ear headphones the brand has created yet, ideal for all-day wear. Each pair comes with a sleek charging case, a USB-C charging cable, and three sets of ear tips in various sizes to ensure the best possible fit. This thoughtful design ensures the earbuds stay in place, delivering crisp, clear sound every time you use them. Whether you’re running errands, working out, or just relaxing, these earbuds should stay securely in your ears.</p>
<h2>Advanced Noise Cancellation and Custom Sound</h2>
<p>With ANC support the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 3 can automatically adjust the level of noise cancellation based on your environment. You can enjoy your music, podcasts, or audiobooks without being disturbed by the surrounding noise like the noisy chatter of a crowded office or the loud hum of an airplane engine.</p>
<p>Sound quality is exceptional, with the dual amplifier and enhanced two-way speaker working in harmony. The adaptive equalizer customizes the audio to your unique ear shape, delivering a personalized sound experience. If you decide to connect them to your TV, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro offer an immersive 360-degree sound experience, providing a surround sound effect without the need for bulky speakers or expensive equipment.</p>
<p>With convenient touch controls, you can easily pause your music, skip tracks, answer calls, and more—all without needing to take your phone out of your pocket.</p>



<h2>Real-Time Translation with Galaxy AI</h2>
<p>One of the more unique new features of these earbuds this specific integration&nbsp; it has with Galaxy AI. The Galaxy Buds Pro 3 allow you to have real-time, face-to-face conversations in multiple languages—no translation app required. It’s a sci-fi wonder straight out of The <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. </em>When someone says “Hola” to you, the earbuds instantly translate it to “Hello” in your ear. This makes communicating while traveling a breeze. It does require being paired with a Samsung device to function. Sorry iPhone users.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro come in two stylish color choices: silver and white. Both have come down in price for Cyber Week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">They’re usually selling on Amazon for $250, but the 44% discount brings the price tag to just $150 for a limited time. You end up saving yourself $110.</a></p>

The Metal Gear series is part of videogame history, spanning pixel art to cinematic presentation, and so each title requires a different approach to expressing and remaking it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We won’t apply the methodology used to make the recent MGS Delta to all other games in the series — rather we intend to find the best approach for each specific game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamura also touched on the amount of time it took for the team at Konami to be in a position to remake Metal Gear Solid 3. “Most of the original staff members had left and the team had been reorganized, however we gathered people together and finally arrived at the point where we could make MGS Delta. As a team, we are confident that we achieved a level of quality that not only preserves the appeal of the original but also that modern players could enjoy. We are currently working out concrete plans for what we are going to do next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, when asked about the possibility of a Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots remake, Okamura remained cautious, saying: “the hardware back then required very specific designs to get the most out of the 3D technology that was available at the time, so MGS4 ended up with some pretty unique code. It seems like it would be quite a challenge to bring that into the present day.” </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Kojima Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the moment, 2008’s Metal Gear Solid 4, which ties up all the loose ends in Solid Snake’s story, is only playable on PlayStation 3.

The way the internet works is being reshaped, too, with the idea of fair use of content for the training of AI models at loggerheads with copyright protection. This has resulted in ongoing lawsuits. Disney and Universal, for example, have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/gettyimages-2237848702-1764673388048.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dan Houser believes AI will eventually eat itself.

His new novel, A Better Paradise, is a story that revolves around AI, and so it stands to reason that he would be asked about the tech in a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/d4RTTcvFxJU?si=3rw5DLWLXvhGrG7D" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virgin Radio UK</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Houser is sceptical about the future of AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity or whatever it is, using AI, are not the most humane or creative people,” he said. “So they're sort of saying we're better at being human than you are. And it’s obviously not true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is one of the other things we're trying to capture, that humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people who maybe aren't fully rounded humans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “I think that AI is going to eventually eat itself. As far as I understand it, which is really superficial understanding, the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models. So it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't see how the information is going to get better. They’re already running out of data. It will do some tasks brilliantly but it's not going to do every task brilliantly. It’s going to become this sort of mirror of itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm slightly obsessed by the fact that when you search for the same thing again, it doesn't give you the same answers. And it's wrong a lot of the time, but it says it so confidently.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Houser is talking here about what happens when AI models start training on their own output, which experts say puts them at risk of collapsing. The Large Language Models, or LLMs, that power the likes of ChatGPT are said to be cannibalizing themselves via Garbage In/Garbage Out (GIGO). Or, as Houser puts it, “it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of AI in entertainment is one of the hottest topics across video games, movies, and television. Last month, the CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-ascension"><u>Silent Hill Ascension</u></a> — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-z-loves-ai-slop-former-square-enix-exec-claims-a-lot-of-ai-sentiment-is-driven-by-emotion-rather-than-logic">claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI in games, stating: "Gen Z loves AI slop."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is some pushback. This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-artist-responds-as-fans-claim-game-now-includes-examples-of-blatant-ai-artwork-including-a-nine-toed-character-in-a-hammock">Epic Games came under fire for what fans believe to be AI generated art in Fortnite</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Chelsea Guglielmino/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

For that reason, there may be cases where, even if it appears to one player as if contact was made, from the other player’s perspective no contact occurred. In order to limit unpleasant experiences in situations like these as much as possible, in basketball games this may be determined as no contact.</li><li>On the other hand, in Survival Tag, the question of contact is the whole crux of the game and is particularly important to game progression.

However, unintended behavior occurred, such as players accelerating beyond top speed when landing after rotating, or not decelerating while in midair even if they had exceeded top speed.

            <p>The original Sonic the Hedgehog game was "terribly controversial" at Sega, according to PlayStation's Mark Cerny, who's detailed more on its development in a new interview.</p>
<p>Cerny was lead system architect for Sony's PS4 and PS5 consoles, but began his career at Atari before moving to Sega and founding its Sega Technical Institute in America. It's this team that developed the sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, after the original game was made in Japan.</p>
<p>The first time he saw Sonic the Hedgehog, it was "obvious that game was going to do great," Cerny told journalist Simon Parkin on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/mark-cerny-lead-system-architect-playstation-4-5">My Perfect Console podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Was there pressure to find a mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario? "The pressure was to make a game that could sell a million copies," Cerny replied, before describing the game as "terribly controversial" due to the increase in resources focused on the game, which ultimately led to Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka's departure from Sega.</p><p>"Part of the idea there was…Let's put much more resource on this project than we usually do," said Cerny. "As I said, what's usual? Three people, three months. So they were going to do, if I remember properly, three people, ten months. But they ended up needing four and a half people for 14 months. I'm a little hazy on the numbers these days. And though it was a success, they blew their budget so badly by putting in a couple of engineers on this that Yuji Naka was just getting yelled at and quit the company."</p>
<p>Cerny admitted "it pays off fantastically well for Sega" due to the success of the game. "But Yuji Naka was pretty tired of the situation by that point." Cerny described Naka as a "top level creator making $60,000 [after a bonus] in their best year and getting yelled at a lot. And he'd had it."</p>
<p>Famously, development on the Sonic series after the success of the first game was split. Development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 moved to the Sega Technical Institute in America founded by Cerny and included original developers Naka and designer Hirokazu Yasuhara. Meanwhile in Japan, another Sonic game was developed by original co-creator Naoto Ohshima intended to be a sequel, but ultimately became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-cd">Sonic CD</a>.</p>
<p>Cerny noted "nobody realised how big Sonic was going to be" in either Sega Japan or America. "Sonic ships and almost immediately I've got the team ready to work on a sequel and do you want a sequel? And I've got Sega of America saying no, it's much too soon. Do a different game first," he said.</p>
<p>That soon changed following sales of Sonic the Hedgehog over its first Christmas period, quickly leading to the sequel's development by STI.</p>
<p>Cerny described his time at Sega overall as "brutal". "Atari was great, Sega was difficult," he said. "It was a difficult environment with a hard-driving president who was going to force us to success. That isn't to say that there wasn't an incredible amount of cameraderie with the people that I worked with but it was just brutal. Nakayama [president of Sega Japan] would come in and he would just give it to us if he didn't see happening what he wanted to see."</p>
<p>"Getting out of Sega was a very healthy thing," he said, before adding "Nakayama is amazing. He understood games like nobody's business...It's just that working for Nakayama - that was difficult and seven years of that was enough."</p>
<p>Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka has since had something of a fall from grace. After eventually leaving Sega in 2006, he later developed Balan Wonderworld with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> which was considered a critical and commercial flop on its release in 2021. He soon left the company and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-was-removed-as-director-of-balan-wonderworld-before-disastrous-launch">accused Square Enix of removing him as director six months before its launch</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2022, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-reportedly-arrested-for-insider-trading">arrested for insider trading at Square Enix</a>, which led to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-receives-suspended-prison-sentence-for-insider-trading">suspended prison sentence</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-developer-boasts-98-percent-cheat-free-matches-launch-week/</link>
            <guid>1370182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The development team behind Battlefield 6, collectively known as Battlefield Studios (DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a detailed update</a> on how their kernel-level Javelin anti-cheat system has been performing in combating cheats in the popular first-person military shooter game.</p>



<p>According to data gathered by the developers, Javelin ensured that roughly 98% of online Battlefield 6 matches in the game's launch week were effectively cheat-free. This means there was only a 2% 'Match Infection Rate', an admittedly nebulous data point that the developers describe as the chance that players would encounter a cheater in their matches. </p>



<p>The 98% rate was attributed mainly to the improvements made during the Open Beta weekend. At first, 'only' 93.1% of the matches were cheat-free, but that figure was raised to almost 98% by the final day after blocking over 1.2 million cheat attempts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing tens of thousands of cheaters</a>. Secure Boot adoption had increased from 62.5% to 92.5%, as well.</p>



<p>During the launch weekend of Battlefield 6, Javelin prevented over 367K cheating attempts. That's fewer than during comparable Open Beta weekends, but it's consistent with the current number of cheating developers the developers had tracking. To date, this figure has grown to 2.39 million blocked cheat attempts. Battlefield Studios is currently aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, resellers, and their associated communities. Since launch, 183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely.</p>



<p>That doesn't mean the fight against Battlefield 6 cheats is over. Beyond the requirement of Secure Boot, developers are exploring additional features already available at the operating system level, such as HVCI (Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity) and VBS (Virtualization-Based Security). Furthermore, they will continue to work with console partners to ban cheating hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as the Cronus Zen</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 just ended <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its free multiplayer trial event</a>. The game is about to receive its Winter Offensive update in a week. Winter Offensive will add a new map, mode and weapon; players will roam the streets of Brooklyn with below freezing temperatures, forced to seek Heat Zones to prevent health drain in the limited-time Ice Lock event, battle other teams in the limited-time Ice Lock Gauntlet variant, and unlock the new Ice Climbing Melee Axe.</p>

            <p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a>'s latest celebrity elusive target mission is all about Eminem. The rapper has Agent 47 take down his blonde alter-ego Slim Shady, it's all very meta and a tad less appealing to me than the cameos previously made by the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitmans-latest-free-elusive-target-mission-makes-you-bruce-lees-bodyguard-and-is-out-now">Bruce Lee</a> and Mads Mikkelsen as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">Bond villain Le Chiffre</a>.</p>
<p>That said, a new interview some IO Interactive folks have given to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>, in which boss Hakan Abrak makes clear there will be a new Hitman coming once the studio have gotten some stuff off their plate, has caught my attention by contrasting Mr Nem with murderbald handler Diana.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, let's get the next Hitman stuff out of the way. "So of course there will be more Hitman," Abrak said when asked if there'll be more hitmen now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>'s morphed in catch-all basket World of Assassination. "But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman — because, of course, there’s going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>IO, of course, also have Bond game 007 First Light to put out soon, with a new fantasy game unimaginatively codenamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-fantasy">Project Fantasy</a> also mentioned here as being in the wings. As for what this next Hitman might look like, lead level designer Jacob Mikkelsen simply said he doesn't regret any of the paths the series has gone down to this point, citing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> as the most out-there entry, but still as a game that taught the studio valuable lessons.</p><p>Speaking of valuable lessons, here's the bit in the interview which makes me regret not having immediately been down to give Agent 47's Eminem mission a go the moment I saw it was a thing. The rapper acts as a handler helping guide barcode man to Shady, and I'd not thought about how that'd allow the devs to play him off of the most Eminem-coded character in Hitman canon. "There’s some interchanges between Eminem and [usual 47 bossperson] Diana [Burnwood] that are really fun," according to writer Jen Simpkins. "Because, as you know, Diana is a very different character to Eminem. And it’s a very surreal level where there’s a lot of reality blending and mixing into one."</p>
<p>Personally, I can see the pair really getting along. Diana seems like she'd appreciate the sort of dedication and practice which goes into nailing that one really fast verse in Rap God, while Eminem seems like the kind of guy to understand the sort of care and adroitness it takes to navigate shadowy multinational murder conspiracies while you've got a very narrow margin for error. After all, he is master of all that's shady and slim.</p>
<p>Those two should helm Hitman 4 if 47 opts to hang up his piano wire in the interim. The Eminem mission is available in World of Assassination until December 31st, so if you fancy trying it, you've got plenty of time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-oled-with-joy-con-falls-to-a-clearance-level-low-as-amazon-has-only-limited-grade-a-renewed-units-left-2000649255</link>
            <guid>1370173</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo recently launched the much-anticipated successor to its highly successful Nintendo Switch console earlier this summer. For those looking to upgrade, the new Nintendo Switch 2 is available this holiday season for $450. However, if you missed out on the original Switch, or if you’re not in a rush to adopt the latest version, picking up a previous model could be a smart choice. Currently, Amazon is offering a refurbished model of the Nintendo Switch OLED at a massive discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">Going refurbished over new, normally will save you about $40 ($360 versus $400). However, right now for Cyber Week, the price has come down to just $310</a>. You end up saving $75 wen compared to buying the Switch OLED new, and you can join the Nintendo ecosystem for $171 less than you’d pay buying a brand new Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch debuted way back in 2017, Nintendo did release updated hardware between then and now with the Nintendo Switch OLED arriving in 2021. This mid-generation upgrade brought substantial improvements over the original version. The most notable change is the 7-inch OLED screen, which delivers brighter, more vivid visuals, especially noticeable in games with prevalent deep blacks like <em>Metroid Dread</em>—a title that launched alongside the OLED model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED vs. Switch 2</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the new Switch 2 doesn’t feature an OLED display. Instead, it uses an LCD screen with HDR, which represents an improvement over the standard LCD technology on the launch model Switch but still can’t match the color richness and depth of OLED. This decision seems to be a cost-saving measure by Nintendo, and they likely aim to release a Switch 2 with an OLED screen in the future. As it stands now, certain games actually look better on the OLED model compared to the Switch 2 due to the superior display.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the Nintendo Switch OLED still holds an advantage. The Switch 2 offers between 2 to 6.5 hours of battery life depending on the intensity of the games you play. In contrast, the Switch OLED lasts anywhere between 4.5 to 9 hours, providing a more reliable portable gaming experience. Though the Switch 2 comes with a larger 5220mAh battery (compared to the Switch OLED’s 4310mAh), the bigger screen and higher resolution (1080p handheld) cause the Switch 2 to drain its battery more quickly than the OLED model.</p>



<h2>Game Library</h2>
<p>If you’re drawn to the new Nintendo Switch 2 because of its shiny new titles like <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you’re in for some fun, but beyond those there’s a just a couple new releases that dropped in time for the holiday. All and all, the first-year lineup of games is still somewhat limited. You might find that there’s no immediate need to jump to the newest generation just yet, especially with the vast selection of games already available on the original Switch.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch has a well-established library, with fan-favorites like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> still being some of the best titles in gaming. Furthermore, the original Switch is packed with incredible indie games, such as <em>Celeste</em>, <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and<em> Hades</em>, which can each on their own keep your attention for hundreds of hours.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether the Switch OLED or the Switch 2 is the right choice for you depends on your priorities. If you’re looking for an excellent value and don’t mind going with a model that’s a couple of years old, the Nintendo Switch OLED offers great performance, stunning handheld visuals, and longer battery life. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">You can grab one now for just $310</a>. Then maybe we just hold out for Nintendo to eventually release a Nintendo Switch 2 OLED in a few years.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Survive Wave Z monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Scrap and much more.</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the classic multiplayer Call Of Duty game mode Zombies? If so, Survive Wave Z is going to be right up your alley, and you need to check out this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-ants-empire-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> wave defence experience immediately. As the name of the game suggests, players are tasked with defending and surviving against endless waves of enemies, with the end goal being to survive Wave Z, which is considered the last one. There is a wide variety of weapons and other items that the players can use in their mission to survive, but not all of them will be available for use at the start of the game.</p>







<p>As is the case with most games of this genre, unlocking powerful weapons required a massive amount of grinding, and for players who are new to the game, acquiring some of these can seem like a pipe dream. That’s where these codes can come to the players’ aid. They provide free rewards to the players, including key resources like Scrap, making it a key part of the game. Redeeming these codes will help players get ahead of the competition and progress through the levels faster than they otherwise would be able to.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-survive-wave-z-codes">Expired Survive Wave Z Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Survive Wave Z, as the game only came out quite recently. The one active code given above is the only one that has been released by the developers so far. However, with the game’s increasing popularity, new codes are likely on the horizon. As soon as any of the active codes expire, they will be moved to this section of the page.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Survive Wave Z is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. There are no prerequisite steps, making it a very beginner-friendly process. For players who are new to the Roblox, however, here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Survive Wave Z.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button at the top of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the codes text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on the Submit button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

<p>New Roblox game codes are often released by the developers through the game’s official Discord server, through the Roblox game page, or on their social media pages. However, tracking all of these regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this article can be a lifesaver. We update this page with new codes as soon as they drop, so we recommend that all players bookmark this page to not miss out on any free rewards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion has soared onto the scene, with the beat ’em up title boasting an impressive roster of characters, including several that are locked behind progression.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-a-cosmic-blast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review of Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, a ‘Great’ verdict of the game was issued, with the title attracting praise for providing chaotic gameplay in a good way, with a perfect balance of depth to keep players engaged, but not overwhelmed, in the vintage beat ’em up.</p>



<p>If you’re diving into Marvel Cosmic Invasion but want to know how to unlock a specific character, or are wondering who there is to choose from on the roster, this guide has all the crucial details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-marvel-cosmic-invasion-characters-amp-how-to-unlock">All Marvel Cosmic Invasion Characters &amp; How to Unlock</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Tribute Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 15 playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion, four of which are locked behind specific requirements in progression.</strong></p>



<p>The base roster in Marvel Cosmic Invasion is kind, with 11 characters unlocked by default, including fan-favorites like Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Rocket Raccoon.</p>



<p>However, Jean Grey/Phoenix, Venom, Phyla-Vell, and Silver Surfer must be unlocked by completing specified missions, which require exploring several areas of the game as split paths present themselves regularly. Due to this, you won’t be able to unlock all the characters immediately, and will have to backtrack at some points.</p>



<p>The challenge of unlocking the restricted characters is not difficult, however, as you only need to complete the specified levels, and don’t need to achieve any particular objectives, though this means potentially venturing out of your way to the four individual levels containing the locked characters.</p>



<p>The full list of playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion and how to unlock them is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>"Right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination," Abrak told the publication.</p>
<p>"But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman - because, of course, there's going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>And, thank goodness for that! It's always a hoot prowling around the many opulent settings Agent 47 gets sent off to, before (if you are anything like me) running away in a hail of bullets as any attempts at stealth get put back on the shelf.</p><p>As for that aforementioned co-op mode, this will feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode. On the co-op mode's eventual release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side</a>. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. </p>

<p>In addition to Hitman and 007 First Light, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">IO Interactive also has a multiplayer fantasy project in the works</a>, aptly codenamed Project Fantasy. This upcoming release, which hasn't officially been revealed yet, is "extremely ambitious and really cool and is something [other] than a gun in a suit", Abrak said. "So that's also good to have something new within the creative outlook here."</p>
<p>But, before that arrives, 007 First Light will be shooting onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and PC on 27th March next year. The studio has promised a deeper look at the gameplay we can all expect to see as part of a dedicated stream it is hosting tomorrow, 3rd December, at 4pm UK time.</p>

<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 won every award imaginable when it came out, as did The Witcher 3 years before it. It makes sense that CD Projekt Red wants to create the most successful sequel possible, and acquiring one of BG3’s senior devs is a good way to do this.</p>



<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher if you want <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-dev-doesnt-know-how-to-top-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> to have any hopes of living up to the reputation of the third game. Cyberpunk 2077 battled to become a huge success in the end, but it required a lot of hard work. The Witcher 4 will be equally as difficult, but it can get off to a better start than CP 2077. One way to do that is by bringing in a Larian Studios artist.</p>

<p>Felix Pedulla worked at Larian Studios for six years, starting as a cinematic artist before becoming a senior cinematic artist.</p>







<p>They helped Baldur’s Gate 3 to become one of the most celebrated and successful game releases of the last few years. That journey recently came to an end when Pedulla announced a new career move on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fedulla_newjob-careergrowth-gamingindustry-activity-7401304661347172352-uP_M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACUuJ-8BNA69V1_ApZijzm0QdBNPNFJlEnA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>“After an incredible and frankly wild six-year ride with the amazing team at Larian Studios, a new chapter begins. I’m so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared. We made some serious magic together, and I’ll forever cherish the lessons and memories. A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made.</p><p>As one adventure ends, another begins! I am absolutely thrilled to announce that I’m joining the legendary team at CD Projekt Red as a Senior Cinematic Designer! The opportunity to contribute to one of the most ambitious studios in the industry is a dream come true. Time to trade in my Baldur’s Gate dice for some Polish steel and get to work crafting some epic cutscenes.”</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>It was nice to see so many of the replies being Larian Studios devs, sad to see the artist go. Interestingly, this news comes only a handful of weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s lead gameplay designer</a> also joined CD Projekt Red. The team is obviously keen to recruit and house the best developers in the world to create one of the most anticipated RPGs of all time.</p>



<p>If you think The Witcher 4 will be an instant hit, there’s one place you can let everyone know: The free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <p>More people have downloaded mods for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> than Larian ever expected. "Way more than we ever expected," studio founder and Baldur's Gate 3 director <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1995565346892513574?s=20">Swen Vincke shared on X</a>. The total downloaded-mods number now stands at more than 350m, the studio revealed, and more than 10,000 mods have been uploaded for other people to play.</p>
<p>"This is insane," Vincke added in a video accompanying <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-36-a-very-moddy-christmas_146">a Baldur's Gate 3 community update</a>. From giant bunnies to giant... Not going to do that! It's absolutely amazing. So you should give yourselves a pat on the back, have a shot of whiskey, and have a party. Have a great holiday everybody."</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Larian shared some of its favourite Baldur's Gate 3 mods, including the mod Vincke stopped himself from mentioning in the video: Wither's big naturals. Yes, tits. Yes, an undead, mostly mummified character with big boobs, because why not?</p>

<p>The tongue-in-cheek mod recommendations do not stop there. Why not add a selection of inflatable pool floaties to your fantasy adventure, for instance? You could wear an inflatable duck on your head. For some reason. Why not also paint yourself in clown make-up? Few things are as likely to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.</p><p>You might also be interested in a car wildshape because perhaps you think yourself a Transformer. Would you like to make Astarian even more handsome? Would you like to redress Raphael? Lightsabers? A grenade launcher? Vintage firearms? Bald heads? It's all here, and there's a good chance you'll recognise the person in Larian's videos demonstrating them. Hello Aoife!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">Larian is currently hard at work on two new projects</a>, and both of them will be based on the studio's own original properties, or IP. We don't know what they are or whether they'll have anything to do with the studio's existing Divinity franchise, but we certainly can expect them to follow the role-playing tradition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> and Baldur's Gate 3, for that is Larian's thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-dd-owner-wizards-says-of-course-we-want-to-do-a-successor-to-baldurs-gate-3-we-wonder-who-will-make-it-and-what-kind-of-game-it-will-be">Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast seems keen on making a follow-up to Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which may or may not be called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, and is probably in development at Wizards' internal studio Invoke, which has already confirmed it is working on "a triple-A game set in the world's most iconic role-playing universe - Dungeons &amp; Dragons". I wonder if The Game Awards will provide a time and place for that reveal.</p>

            <p>Hey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s just gotten a patch with some noteworthy balancing tweaks and fixes ahead of its latest warbond - <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos</a> - dropping. In short, a fair few guns now do more damage, some enemies have been made a tad less potent, and the drawback which usually comes with attachinga magnifying scope to your favourite bug blaster has been scaled back.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the notes for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621274?l=english">Into the Unjust: 5.0.0 patch</a>, the studio have clearly spied that the weapon ergonomics penalty suffered if you equip a long-range sight to your gun was putting folks off from using such attachments. So, in order to make them "more a matter of preference", you'll now notice the muzzles of guns with tube red dot sights, combat scopes, and sniper scopes being a fair whack less lethargic in following where you point your crosshair. The sniper scope change also applies to the anti-materiel rifle.</p>
<p>Outside of that, Arrowhead have begun to implement some tweaks designed to make pistols more ideal at close range over long, while still effective enough to use. Moving to primary guns, the defender, reprimand, M7S SMG, variable, and M90A have all had their damage upped by three to 10 points, with a couple also getting durable damage boosts. The peacemaker, verdict, and M6C/SOCOM pistols have also undergone similar tweaks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, war strider and bile spewer enemies have been tweaked to stagger less when hit with explosions. The stalker, on the other hand, has had its tongue attack nerfed slightly so you won't stagger as much when slapped by the thing protruding from the bug's meaty maw. Finally, some new unbound keybind options have been added to make quick-swapping gear easier and playing in first-person should mesh better with your field-of-view settings.</p><p>There you go. I'm going to duck talking about the bug fixes to instead mention that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation in the works at Sony is now set to be directed by Justin Lin of Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift fame, per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. I mention this because it's got me wondering what the drifting equivalent of being sent flying by a rogue bug tongue is. I assume the answer's maybe catching a kerb, rolling, and landing with your passenger's mouth locked over your nose. That's never happened to me, I assure you.</p>
<p>Make sure you tell your family about this patch and the movie. They need to know Vin Diesel'll now have less scope trouble when he's inevitably confirmed to be playing <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1779875631334899883">General Brasch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Fortnite artist has hit back at suggestions that some art in Chapter 7 Season 1 is AI-generated, proving their work on a piece of artwork.</p>



<p>Fortnite kicked off Chapter 7 in style with the Zero Point live event, marking the end of the last Chapter, attracting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players</a>, but social media was soon awash with claims that AI created some artwork and assets used in Chapter 7 Season 1, despite a lack of proof.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-artist-proves-their-work-was-not-ai-generated">Fortnite Artist Proves Their Work Was Not AI-Generated</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Proof. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As posted by the likes of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995684089945620483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HypeX</a>, Fortnite artist Sean Dove revealed he was behind the Marty McFly Spray in the game that some have accused of being created by AI, showing his work on the image.</p>



<p>Dove explained the process of his work, particularly the background featuring clocks, where he “grabbed some clocks off image search, collaged them, and halftoned them.”</p>



<p>He admitted that “the numbers are bad” and that it was “entirely possible” he grabbed an AI clock when gathering images, but, nevertheless, the work was done by him.</p>



<p>Although this doesn’t quite end the AI debate surrounding Fortnite, as there are plenty of accusations revolving around other images found in the game, it does show evidence that one of the most prominent pieces of art, which is available as a Spray in the Battle Pass, is not AI-generated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Epic Games regarding the accusations of AI artwork being used in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 and is waiting for a response.</p>

                <p>Sony has unveiled a new limited-edition look for the DualSense controller, just in time for the launch of Genshin Impact Version Luna III. Dubbed the Genshin Impact Limited Edition, this controller is inspired by the game and its signature style, giving it a fantasy-themed makeover. Preorders begin December 11 at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET, and the controller is priced at $85.</p><p>This version of the DualSense controller combines an ethereal white, gold, and green palette with arcane glyphs found in Genshin Impact. You'll also find emblems of the Traveler Twins Aether and Lumine, as well as a nod to their companion guide, Paimon, with a cute graphic. Sony says that it collaborated closely with Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse to create the controller and celebrate the popular live-service game's fifth anniversary.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614873-genshin-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614873-genshin-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614873"></a><figcaption>Genshin Impact DualSense controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614873-genshin-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614874-genshin-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614875-genshin-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614876-genshin-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614877-genshin-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614874,1300-4614875,1300-4614876,1300-4614877" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4614874-genshin-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4614875-genshin-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4614876-genshin-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4614877-genshin-5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614874-genshin-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614875-genshin-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614876-genshin-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614877-genshin-5.jpg"></figure><p>The Luna III update for Genshin Impact goes live on December 3, and it introduces new characters, quests, and content to the game.

            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions has found its director.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin will be at the helm of the upcoming adaptation, which is based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' space-based shooter. After directing The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast &amp; Furious, Lin went on to also direct Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6 and F9: The Fast Saga.</p>

<p>Along with his directing duties, Lin will also produce the Helldivers film via his Perfect Storm Entertainment banner, along with Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan.</p>
<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter's sources, while Lin himself is not a gamer, he used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>
<p>"He aims to find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology," <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">the publication stated</a>. "There are plenty of details waiting to be drawn in, something that is compelling to the filmmaker."</p>
<p> Joining Lin is writer Gary Dauberman, who is known for penning horror movies It and Annabelle.</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p>An online co-op mod for very French and very puppety soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has been released in alpha form. As of writing, it'll let you take on boss battles with a friend and its creators are hoping to offer full multplayer playthroughs similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">seamless co-op mod</a> further down the line.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While the multiplayer mods of most FromSoft games are famously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">the work of modding savant Yui</a>, this Lies of P co-op add-on's been developed by a three person crew called Ember Wave. They've sunk "more than one year of reverse-engineering and systems development" into getting their project to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/liesofp/mods/368?tab=description">alpha release on Nexus Mods</a>, having shown off some progress via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbuROQ5LG5g">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EmberWaveTeam">Patreon</a> along the way.</p>
<p>As of right now, the mod'll let you jump into boss fights across the base game and DLC - including the likes of the Scrapped Watchman, Nameless Puppet, and Arlecchino the Blood Artist - with one other player. So, duos for the moment, but the modders do note in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/release-mod-144752076">fresh Patreon FAQ</a> that they'll consider upping that limit as they overcome more technical hurdles.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see each other's health bars, spectate your partner via a special death cam if you fall, and be revived if they activate a stargazer. "You can mess around after killing a boss," the modders say, "but crashes might happen."</p><p>As for their next steps towards releasing the full co-op mode that'll allow seamless end-to-end playthroughs, the Ember Wave add that they "still need to sync world events (doors, elevators, quests, etc.) and fix a specific issue related to entering the Hotel, which causes unexpected behavior". So, that's on their plate going forwards, alongside nixing any major issues with the alpha release.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the alpha a go, you'll need to be running Windows 10 or 11 and have a Steam copy of Lies of P running <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1627720/announcements/detail/502836597467646578">September's version 1.12.0.0 update</a>. <a href="https://www.radmin-vpn.com/">Radmin VPN</a> is also required to "simulate a LAN connection" in order to host co-op sessions. Finally, if you want to battle DLC bosses, both players will need to own the DLC in question.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if this co-op mod for the boss battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">former RPS reviews guru Ed Thorn</a> dubbed "the closest we'll get to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> on PC, probably" can hit the complex heights of Yui's masterpieces when it reaches its final form. Until then, the modders'll no doubt keep on pulling marionette strings to see what they can accomplish.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has promised players of World of Warcraft that player housing, which launches in a limited form today (tomorrow across Europe), is going to be expanded in every patch and in future expansions released for the online game.</p>
<p>"I will reassure you as much as possible that that is the case," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">World of Warcraft housing lead Jesse Kurlancheek told IGN</a>. "We have a short-term, medium-term, long-term list of features and content that we want to add. We talk about what are we doing in 12.0 and 12.1 and 12.2 and beyond pretty regularly [...] We're thinking about things as not just a single feature release, [but as ] a very long-running thing."</p>
<p>Senior UX designer Joanna Giannullis added: "I think we've already always started wanting to make sure that we were kind of in it for the long haul. This is a feature that we know is going to live in the game for some time to come, and we're going to be adding more to it with every, not just every patch, but in future expansions, and we want to keep growing it."</p>

<p>The full player-housing release happens alongside new expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft: Midnight, which launches 2nd March</a>, but people who've pre-ordered it can dabble in a slimmer version of housing starting today. Incidentally, if you're planning to try housing out, there's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244464">a Getting Started explainer on the WoW website</a> you might find handy.</p><p>Housing is arguably the largest systemic addition to World of Warcraft ever, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-in-the-making-world-of-warcrafts-player-housing-the-most-ambitious-expansion-feature-ever-says-blizzard">housing has been in development for several years</a>. It's a system that allows players to not only own and customise houses, but also to organise themselves into neighbourhoods - an aspect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has talked about before as being a kind of "sociological experiment"</a>.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember about housing's soft-launch today, according to Kurlancheek and Giannullis, is that it's a start. There are many more things to come to it, both in the weeks and months to come, leading up to Midnight's launch, and beyond.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features, the housing duo revealed, is co-ownership of a house - or the ability to temporarily give someone edit access to it. "Yeah, one [that] comes up a lot is, 'I'm not especially creative or I'm not great with a toolset - can my friend come over and sort of deck out my apartment or deck out my house?' Yeah, it's certainly on our radar," Kurlancheek said. This could even give rise to a whole cottage industry of players who specialise in this work.</p>

<blockquote><em>"The idea of us building together is super compelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>This co-operative building could be developed even further into communal building. "The idea of us building together is super compelling, I think," Kurlancheek added. "As soon as players can build something themselves, we want to build things together. And so, what that ends up being depends on what people are trying to do or what is interesting for them. If it is just us coming together in the town square and hanging up balloons or whatever, because we're having a birthday party, what does that look like? Versus we want to build a racetrack for our mounts around the outside of a town and what does that look like? Versus we want to do prop hunts and duelling things and all of these different potential pieces of stuff."</p>
<p>But though there are many ideas, both from inside Blizzard and from the community, there is "a fairly hard line" drawn regarding things that can potentially increase a character's power. "You should never feel that, 'I have to go engage in a housing loop because if I don't, I can't attune to a raid, or I won't have a three percent DPS boost or whatever,'" said Kurlancheek. "So that sort of practical stuff is really not on the table."</p><p>Reactions to player housing from the alpha already seem very favourable, although there is some concern about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">the new Hearthsteel currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a> to buy cosmetics related to it. This is the first real-money currency added to the game in 20 years, and while Blizzard assures us it'll only be used for housing specifically, and that the majority of house items you won't be able to buy that way, there's worry that these standards will gradually erode over time.</p>

<p>The strange statue referenced by Geoff Keighley ahead of The Game Awards 2025 has been the talk of the town, and God of War director Cory Balrog has given a big update on GOW’s status in relation to the statue.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans have been trying to uncover the identity of a mysterious Game Awards Statue</a>. On November 29, The Game Awards show host and creator Geoff Keighley posted on X saying: “regal.inspiring.thickness.” The message was accompanied by a statue, which was later revealed to be close to the venue.</p>







<p>God of War has been one of the biggest suggestions heading into the show, and Cory Balrog has responded.</p>

<p>Gaming content creator and streamer Luke Stephens had a surprise visitor pop up in their chat during a stream, none other than God of War director Cory Balrog.</p>







<p>Balrog has worked extensively on the GOW franchise since 2005 and worked their way up at Santa Monica Studio, becoming the main director for the 2018 reboot and Ragnarok. Stephens’ chat was talking about the Game Awards statue, and Balrog had a quick message to address one of the many suggested games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“no, it’s not gow.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So there you have it, if you see the statue appear during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> livestream, you might be disappointed to learn that it’s not God of War related.</p>

<p>It doesn’t mean the series will be absent altogether. The long-rumored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Metroidvania game</a> has been outed for a possible TGA 2025 appearance, and it would be fun to see.</p>



<p>No one seems to know, but what do you think the statue means for The Game Awards 2025? Any ideas which game it’s referring to or highlighting?
