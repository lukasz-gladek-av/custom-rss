		<p>Surprising literally nobody, Flight Simulator 2024 has been announced for PlayStation 5, the latest Xbox exclusive to breach the previous platform divide. The game will arrive on PS5 on 8th December 2025, while PSVR 2 support is also in development for a later date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5xeNotR5Hw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Flight Simulator 2024, launched for Xbox and PC at the end of last year, an overhauled successor to the 2020 Flight Simulator, building on the same rendering of the real world that you can fly around, but building in a career mode, more missions, from Search and Rescue to tourism, agricultural crop dusting, and plenty more.</p>
<p>It’s a great simulator, but I think I’m most intrigued to see how PSVR 2 support looks on console, as the game is pretty heavy to run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Housemarque and Sony have released a chunky five minutes of gameplay for the upcoming looper shooter roguelike Saros – the sequel to Returnal. The team have confirmed that Saros is coming to PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> on 20th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | September 24, 2025 [English]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QcEoGC51ZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This latest tale takes players to the planet Carcosa, with an ominous eclipse and the end of the world sending Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli) into a deadly time loop. He’s a Soltari Enforcer, looking for answers on a lost off-world colony which is repeatedly being destroyed by way and the death of the planet’s sun. He’s a bit chattier, it seems, as he has an AI companion, and hunt down Soltari datalog vaults to reveal more of the game’s story.</p>
<p>The gameplay structure will sound pretty familiar. It’s a roguelike third person shooter, very much in the vein of Returnal, with a permanent progression system wrapped around individual runs that reshape the world and give you new upgrade possibilities to find on the next attempt.</p>
<p>The action looks a bit faster than Returnal, though this may be my imagination, with more sprinting and dashing. Arjun comes with a Soltari Shield that can absorb and reflect projectives, using them to feel the Power Weapon, an Eclipse-driven weapon.</p>

<p>Second Chance is one of he permanent progression features, able to revive Arjun on his first death to immediately throw him back into the action of a particular run.</p>
<p>The video built up to the reveal of a big many-armed boss, with many more snippets of titanic gameplay to round things out.</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

			<p>Housemarque kicked off <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">today's State of Play presentation</a> with our first look at gameplay for Saros, showcasing some of the new gameplay mechanics that the studio is implementing to build off what it did with Returnal, and landed the new trailer by revealing that Saros is coming to PS5 on March 20, 2026.</p>



<p>It was a very action-packed trailer that showed Housemarque isn't trying to fix what wasn't broken with Returnal's gameplay, and is adding new features to turn up the danger by giving players a shield they can use to break up some of the onslaught of colored shots coming their way, and fire back with more power.</p>



<p>You'll also get one extra chance per run, letting you revive yourself at least once instead of reviving, which is something you unlock deep into the game, like it was in Returnal. The trailer didn't get too deep into the modifiers and upgrades you can unlock, though, so it could be that we'll have more than one extra chance in a run, depending on what you unlock.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>For our first look at gameplay we wanted to show real and unedited action gameplay from Saros, and then layer by layer detail some of the new elements we have added on top of Returnal’s award winning third-person action. Our goal with these new elements has been to add more depth to our gameplay by adding a wider variety of tools</em>," wrote Gregory Louden, creative director at Housemarque, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/saros-launches-march-20-on-ps5-first-look-at-gameplay-from-todays-state-of-play/">a PlayStation Blog post.</a> </p>



<p>"<em>Arjun’s Soltari advanced combat suit allows him to dash, melee, jump, and more. At the start of every run you will select your loadout from a mix of Soltari human weaponry and Carcosan alien weaponry. In this video, Arjun is using the Soltari Phosphorous Shotgun to defend himself and melt the hostile machines housed in the lost ancient city. As you can see from our extended gameplay, you can expect spectacular bullet patterns from enemies, and brutal weapons to use which fuel the sci-fi power fantasy.</em>"</p>



<p>Louden also briefly touched on the story in Saros and what Arjun is doing on the planet of Carcosa, though was careful not to reveal too much, of course. "<em>We also wanted to highlight how we are expanding our storytelling in Saros. Along with grounded voice-over, stunning cinematics, haunting audio logs, and conversations with our ensemble cast of NPCs, there are also Soltari Holograms detailing what happened on Carcosa as you explore. If you choose to collect them, they are vital to discover what happened on this hostile planet. There’s also more surreal and mysterious storytelling sequences, but we will share more with you about these moments ahead…</em>"</p>



<p>Saros will arrive on PS5 and PS5 Pro on March 20, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony opened its September State of Play with our first gameplay look at <em>Saros</em>, the next big PS5 game from <em>Returnal</em> makers Housemarque. It’s set to arrive on March 20, 2026 exclusively on PS5 and will be “enhanced” on PS5 Pro. Like <em>Returnal</em>, it’s a fast-paced third-person roguelike sci-fi shooter built around players dying over and over while getting stronger with permanent upgrades.</p> <p>Here’s the new <em>Saros</em> gameplay trailer that just premiered during State of Play. The upcoming sci-fi game stars Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj and looks just as wild and frenetic as <em>Returnal</em>.</p>  <p>And here’s the game’s official description:</p> <blockquote><p>Arjun Devraj, a Soltari enforcer, fights to survive on the lost colony of Carcosa under an ominous eclipse. Shape-shifting biomes and hostile ruins set the stage for a fast-paced, cinematic action experience where every encounter demands precision and adaptability. Combat unfolds as a fluid dance of dodges, shields, and parries, paired with a high-tech arsenal built of human and alien weaponry. Master enemy patterns, evolve your strategy, and face off against spectacular bosses that push every skill to the edge. Death is not the end, with permanent upgrades, evolving equipment, and the “Second Chance” system that allows you to always come back stronger.</p></blockquote> <p>PlayStation 5 owners have been wondering what 2026’s exclusive release calendar will look like, and with <em>Saros</em>, it looks like Sony is starting the year off strong with what appears to be another exciting and likely tough-as-nails third-person roguelike shooter from a team that has been consistently knocking it out of the park for three decades. Will <em>Saros</em> match the success of <em>Helldivers 2</em>, the sci-fi shooter that kicked of Sony’s 2024? Probably not, but either way, I’m excited to get my hands on <em>Saros</em> in March of next year.</p>

            <link>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/saros-launches-march-20-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/saros-launches-march-20-2026.1307601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a dream project, by a dream team. Please watch our gameplay first look below: </p><p>This gameplay is captured on PlayStation 5 at 60fps using Unreal Engine 5 and is still a work in progress, so expect tweaks, fixes, and upgrades when you’re playing <em>Saros</em> on PlayStation 5 or enhanced on your PlayStation 5 Pro in 2026. </p><p>For this extended gameplay reveal we wanted to establish the world and story and then focus purely on our deep 3rd person action, and how we take things to the next level with Saros. </p><p><strong>The Shape-Shifting Planet of Carcosa</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The events of <em>Saros</em> take place on Carcosa, a shape-shifting, hostile alien planet; one that changes on every death, and offers a wide variety of environments and enemies for you to encounter. In this gameplay first look, we see our protagonist Arjun Devraj (performed by Rahul Kohli) exploring the planet as a total eclipse nears. Along the way he finds Nitya Chandran (performed by Shunori Ramanthan), one of our ensemble cast, and a key character. The stunning environment Arjun explores is that of a lost ancient civilization fueled by the twisted enlightenment of the eclipse. This is just one of the biomes our amazing team on <em>Saros</em> are creating.</p><p><strong>How Our Action Gameplay Has Evolved</strong></p><p>For our first look at gameplay we wanted to show real and unedited <a title="Genres > Action [3,066 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a>play from <em>Saros</em>, and then layer by layer detail some of the new elements we have added on top of <em><a title="Games > Returnal [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a></em>‘s award winning third-person action. Our goal with these new elements has been to add more depth to our gameplay by adding a wider variety of tools.</p><p>Arjun’s Soltari advanced combat suit allows him to dash, melee, jump, and more. At the start of every run you will select your loadout from a mix of  Soltari human weaponry and Carcosan alien weaponry. In this video, Arjun is using the Soltari Phosphorous Shotgun to defend himself and melt the hostile machines housed in the lost ancient city. As you can see from our extended gameplay, you can expect spectacular bullet patterns from enemies, and brutal weapons to use which fuel the science-fiction power fantasy.</p><p><strong>Weaponry and Abilities</strong></p><p>Let’s talk about Arjun’s unique abilities. Firstly, we have the Soltari Shield, activated by holding R1. In <em>Saros</em>, you can run into the hostile projectiles, absorbing their energy to defend yourself. Once absorbed you can hit back hard with your Carcosan Power Weapon. This second unique ability allows you to charge up the weapon with energy harvested from hostile projectiles (by pulling the L2 adaptive trigger fully), then discharging this explosive energy at enemies with R2. </p><p>Power Weapons transform Arjun’s right arm into an eclipse-fuelled weapon, corrupting him in the process. This gives him an alternate, and customizable, way to deal devastating damage to hostiles. </p><p><strong>Storytelling in Carcosa</strong></p><p>We also wanted to highlight how we are expanding our storytelling in <em>Saros</em>. Along with grounded voice-over, stunning cinematics, haunting audio logs, and conversations with our ensemble cast of NPCs, there are also Soltari Holograms detailing what happened on Carcosa as you explore. If you choose to collect them, they are vital to discover what happened on this hostile planet. There’s also more surreal and mysterious storytelling sequences, but we will share more with you about these moments ahead…</p><p>The final element we highlight is the “Second Chance” ability. On death, Arjun has the ability – once discovered – to use eclipse corruption energy to rise back up on first death. This is one small part of the permanent-progression systems we have added in Saros, which will allow you to always come back stronger after each death. These systems include the ability to upgrade your Soltari advanced combat suit &amp; abilities if you choose to do so.</p><p>We are super proud of how <em>Saros</em> plays, and cannot wait for you all to experience it. <em>Saros</em> has been built by a dream team of collaborators; for this PS Blog post we wanted to shout out all of our superb <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,567 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Studio partners including <a title="Companies > XD [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/xd">XD</a>EV, Nixxes, PlayStation Studios Creative Arts teams and many more.</p><p>Nixxes are working closely with Housemarque’s creative, gameplay, art, and production leadership on key elements of the art and gameplay in Saros. They have been an amazing collaborator, and you can see their stunning work in this gameplay first look.</p><p>After our award-winning collaboration on <em>Returnal</em>, PlayStation Studios Creative Arts are also back working with the team at Housemarque. The sound and music you hear in this reveal is the result of this continued collaboration, and we are building something exceptional together.</p><p>Last but not least, the dark-electronic meets drone-metal score featured in this gameplay showcase (and in our earlier cinematic announcement), was composed by the fantastic and two-time Grammy Award-winning Sam Slater. His past work includes collaborations on the acclaimed Chernobyl and Joker, as well as being part of the team behind the score for the cult film, Mandy.</p><p>Expect a deep dive into our musical score and Sam’s process as we get closer to launch. We set out to create a bold and innovative score unique in any medium today.</p><p>In the future we’ll be sharing more about our mysterious, monstrous, and moving story including our plot, ensemble cast of NPCs, and the lost off-world colony on Carcosa you will experience.</p></div><p>Watch the first gameplay footage below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/saros-launches-march-20-2026]]></content:encoded>

The game launches for PS5 on December 8. Additionally, Microsoft announced that it's working on support for PlayStation VR 2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. </p><p>"To make this PlayStation experience truly shine, we embraced the immersive features offered by the DualSense wireless controller. Adaptive triggers respond to different speeds and surface types on the ground and provide sloped resistance in the air. Communications from air traffic control (ATC) play through the controller speaker, simulating the feel of a real cockpit. Gyro controls, lightbar support, and a customizable touchpad further enhance the immersion during flight," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xeNotR5Hw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S5xeNotR5Hw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is not the first Microsoft game on PlayStation, as some of the others include Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 5, Grounded, and Gears of War: Reloaded.</p><p>Microsoft is bringing its games to PlayStation platforms (and Nintendo systems in some cases) in part due to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">reported mandate at Microsoft to increase margins at all divisions, including Xbox.</a> There is said to be an internal plan within Microsoft called "Latitude" that is focused on formulating plans to bring more first-party Xbox games to rival systems.

Housemarque has provided a first look at Saros, it's next game and PS5 follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>.
</p>
<p>It's set for release on 20th March on PS5, and will be enhanced for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>While the initial reveal was purely cinematic, now we've got a look at the game's gameplay. Check it out for yourself in the trailer below.</p>

<p>At first glance, this is more of the same intense bullet hell action we know and love from Returnal, but there are some subtle tweaks too.</p>
<p>Creative director Gregory Louden introduced the video, stating the game will explore the emotional and haunting story of protagonist Arjun Devraj (Rahul Kohli) on a shapeshifting planet. Later he mentioned an ensemble of NPCs, suggesting this could be more story focused than Returnal was.</p><p>As for gameplay, Devraj wields a shield used to absorb projectiles and then hit back with a powerful weapon - almost like a delayed parry. Louden also hinted at the progression system with a permanent ability: Second Chance, which revives Devraj on death. The trailer ended with a wild-looking boss, of course.</p>
<p>Further details have been provided on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/saros-launches-march-20-on-ps5-first-look-at-gameplay-from-todays-state-of-play/">PlayStation Blog</a>. Saros takes place on the hostile alien planet of Carcosa, with the first biome shown being that of a lost civilisation. Devraj will begin each run by choosing a loadout, mixing Soltari human weaponry and Carcosan alien weaponry, plus he'll have access to a wide variety of tools.</p>
<p>
Saros was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">first announced earlier this year</a> at Sony's February State of Play and will be the first game from Housemarque as a first party studio, after being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">bought by Sony in 2021</a> after Returnal's release.
</p>
<p>Sony announced Saros will release on X 2026, exclusive on PS5. It's unknown if a PC release will follow, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-releases-on-pc-next-month">as with Returnal</a>.</p>
<p>Returnal has received plenty of praise from players, critics, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-wins-big-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">award-givers</a> alike, and is considered one of the key games to truly make use of the PS5 hardware. As such, expectations are high for Saros to follow suit.</p>

            <p>
I think my big problem with the proliferation of Soulslikes as a genre is twofold: one, that so many games get labelled as such despite not being such, and two, they're all much too similar. There might be mechanical differences, but there's no big thing that clearly sets them apart from what FromSoftware already does so well, not even an aesthetic overhaul. That's part of why I quite liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>, and why I'm curious if cautious about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a>.
</p>
<p>
RPS' own James got to go <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-a-first-person-soulslike-work-playing-napoleonic-parryfest-valor-mortis-suggests-oui">hands-on with the game not too long ago</a>, and despite only getting to try out a tutorial and the game's first boss, he did feel that it's a game potentially worth keeping an eye on, first-person combat and all. The only problem is, I'm not James! And neither are you, but I'm sure you, like me, would possibly like to give Valor Mortis a try to get your own verdict on what a first-person Soulslike is, well, like. This is where I come in again to tell you that you can do that, actually, because there's a <a href="https://valormortis.firstlook.gg/">playtest you can sign up to right now</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's not particularly clear if everyone that does sign up will get to try it, but it's worth a shot if you're even remotely interested. Apparently the playtest, which runs from October 6th to October 13th, will feature the game's first chapter. That includes a mini-boss and a proper boss, and a taste of the upgrade tree and level progression. In any case, as James also notes, the devs behind it also made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>, a quite good first-person action game or so I've been led to believe, so perhaps there's not much to worry about. 
</p>
<p>
Valor Mortis doesn't have an exact release just yet, but it is supposed to be releasing in 2026. Let's see if that comes to fruition in this delay ridden era we live in.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-blops7-skins-goofy-crossover-turned-down-deals-bf6-grounded-2000628200"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> is set to launch this November. And, surprisingly, a decade after the PS4 and Xbox One’s launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-price-release-date-switch-2-dev-kits-call-duty-2000617983"><em>BLOPS 7</em></a> is still arriving day one on the aging machines. According to the devs making the next entry in Activision’s blockbuster franchise, the old consoles don’t force them to hold anything back, and <em>Call of Duty </em>is still played by a “shocking” amount of people on those platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/treyarch-address-concerns-black-ops-7-was-held-back-by-last-gen-consoles-3256130/">In a new interview with <em>Dexerto</em></a>, Treyarch’s senior director of production Yale Miller and associate design director Lawrence Metten addressed fan concerns that developing<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;for the now 13-year-old PS4 and Xbox One was holding the game back and limiting what the studio could do on PC and current-gen hardware. According to them, that’s not the case at all.</p> <p>“The way we’ve talked about it always is, you should never be thinking about old-gen for the features that you’re designing,”&nbsp; Miller told the outlet.</p>

 <p>Instead, the team builds the game for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and then makes it work on the older machines. This sometimes leads to features not making it onto PS4 and Xbox One, a disappointing decision for last-gen players, but one that the studio is willing to make.</p>

 <p>“[Theater mode in <em>Black Ops 6</em> was] something that we knew we wanted to do,” said Metten. “We can’t support it on old-gen. That’s not a reason not to do the feature. We’re gonna bite the bullet and disable it on old-gen.”</p>

 <h2>Why <em>Call of Duty</em> is still launching on PS4 in 2025</h2> <p>As to why Activision is still developing <em>Call of Duty</em> games for the decade-old machines, the answer is obvious but still surprising: In 2025, there are still a lot of people playing these games on older consoles. Miller didn’t share specific numbers, but told <em>Dexerto</em> there is a “shocking number of people” playing new <em>Call of Duty</em> games on PS4 and Xbox One, and this apparently helps with matchmaking, giving them more players to work with.</p>

 <p>“It made sense for us to [bring<em> Black Ops 7</em> to last gen], and we could,” said Miler. “There are straight-up, like, graphical features and things that you just won’t see, but we feel like that doesn’t necessarily break the experience. And, obviously, there’s performance and other things that are not gonna be as good, but that’s it. It’s just players.”</p> <p>While that makes sense, I can’t help but feel like it might be time to move on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">especially as EA’s upcoming <em>Battlefield 6</em> is doing that and cutting PS4 and Xbox One loose</a>. However, while both are military shooters, they offer very different experiences and demand different things from the platforms they are available on.</p> <p>Still, if <em>CoD</em> is so scalable and flexible, I do wonder why the team isn’t, as far as we know, working on a Switch 2 port of <em>Black Ops 7.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-gamescom-digital-foundry-2000620055">Perhaps they also struggled to get dev kits</a> ahead of Nintendo’s console launch earlier this year? Or maybe somewhere deep inside the massive entity that is Activision-owned studios, someone is tinkering with <em>Black Ops 7</em> on Switch 2 right now. I wouldn’t bet on it, but maybe you like to gamble?</p>

                <p>Starbreeze has announced a new subscription program for Payday 2 DLC. The Payday 2: Subscription, as it's called, gives players access to dozens of DLC packs for a fee of $5/month or $20 for six months--the latter represents a savings of 33% compared to paying monthly. There is no annual subscription offering, however.</p><p>The subscription comes with access to more than 65 DLC packs for Payday 2, adding things like more heists, weapons, and cosmetics. Subscribing isn't taking over as the only way to get the DLC, however, as the game's DLC packs remain available to buy individually. </p><p>Starbreeze boss Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-launches-payday2-subscription-on-steam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the aim with the Payday 2 subscription is to "give players greater flexibility in how they experience the game." The subscription is only available on Steam.</p><p>Payday 2 originally launched in 2013. A sequel, Payday 3, came out in 2023 but was marred with significant server issues upon release. Reviews for the game also didn't come in too strong, and remain "Mixed" on Steam compared to "Very Positive" for Payday 2.</p><p>Payday 2 appears to be preferable to Payday 3 for fans, as the older title has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thousands more daily players </a>than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the newer one.</a></p>

              <p>Sony was probably saving this announcement for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch-2000628219">September State of Play</a> but it’s leaked ahead of time. According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/cette-pepite-fera-partie-des-jeux-du-mois-doctobre-2025-du-playstation-plus-essential-60568">Dealab’s billbil-kun</a>, October’s big PS Plus game is <em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p> <p>The survival horror GOTY contender came out two years ago next month and catapulted <em>Alan Wake</em> into the ever-expanding Remedyverse following the success of <em>Control</em> before it. The mind-warping metanarrative will be part of the Essentials tier, meaning everyone who has even the cheapest PS Plus subscription option will be able to download and play it as long as they stay paying members of the service.</p> <p><em>Alan Wake 2 </em>follows FBI agent Saga Anderson as she investigates a cult responsible for a string of murders in Bright Falls. Coming out 13 years after the original, the sequel takes place that long after the original, too, picking up where the prior game’s narrative threads left off and only getting way weirder from there. If you’re planning on giving <em>Alan Wake 2</em> a spin next month, you’ll definitely want to make sure you’ve completed the original game first.</p> <p>The first game is available to revisit via a remaster released a couple years back. The good news is it’s currently on sale <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01924_00-AWREMASTERED0001">for just $5</a> on PS5 and PS4, but you only have another day to claim it at that price. The sale ends after September 25.</p>
