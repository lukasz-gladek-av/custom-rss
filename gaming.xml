Its single dungeon, evil monsters, creepy town, and loot-filled catacombs forever changed the action RPG genre. Today, the OG <em>Diablo </em>might seem a bit small and simple compared to the wild open-world adventure we find in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">2023's <em>Diablo 4</em></a></span><em>. </em>But <em>Diablo’s </em>vibes are still unmatched by any of its sequels, and now you can experience the classic ARPG for free on your phone or PC browser. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/you-can-play-the-original-and-best-version-of-diablo-in-your-browser-again/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/you-can-play-the-original-and-best-version-of-diablo-in-your-browser-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new website has popped up</a></span> that lets you play the shareware version of the original <em>Diablo </em>in your browser. This new web-based port of the game was built using <em>Diablo’s </em>original source code, which was previously reconstructed by GalaXyHaXz and the Devilution team and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can be found on GitHub</a></span>. </p><p>Now, keep in mind that unless you own <em>Diablo </em>and upload the “DIABDAT.MPQ” file, you won’t have access to everything found in the retail release. Still, the shareware version of <em>Diablo</em> lets you play as a warrior who can’t talk to NPCs, but can kill demons and loot weapons in the dungeon under the church in Tristram. </p><p>In my testing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this browser-based port of <em>Diablo</em></a></span><em> </em>plays really well. I had no issues exploring the dark corridors and killing zombies and skeletons. Just toss your old <em>Diablo </em>save and DIABDAT.MPQ file onto a service like Google Drive or a USB stick and you can play Blizzard’s seminal ARPG anywhere with an internet connection. </p><p>In fact, you could be playing <em>Diablo </em>right now on the device you are currently using instead of working or reading the last sentence of this blog. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Stealth 700 sounds a little more rudimentary than that (though also much less finicky), but its specs are pretty robust with 60mm drivers that are 10mm larger than the last-gen model, simultaneous Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity for phone / Discord use, spatial audio, a noise-canceling microphone (that apparently uses “AI”), and a claimed 80 hours of battery life. </p><p>The dedicated PC model offers higher 24-bit / 96kHz audio and a 16-bit / 32kHz mic, as the current consoles are limited to 16-bit / 48kHz for audio and 16-bit / 16kHz for mics. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption><em>All three versions of the Stealth 700 Gen 3 will be available in black, with the Xbox variant also offered in cobalt and the PlayStation model offered in white.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Turtle Beach</cite></p></div></div><p>Another strange connectivity anomaly is that the Xbox version is cross-compatible with PlayStation / PC, but the PlayStation and PC models don’t work with Xbox (yet the PlayStation model works with PC, and the PC one works on PS5 / PS4). Microsoft and Sony’s proprietary licensing for their respective consoles likely plays a role in that bit of confusion — <em>fun</em>.</p><p>Nuanced compatibility restrictions aside, the new Stealth 700 sounds like a simple yet brute force method for a multiplatform gamer to use one headset across systems without constantly moving around a USB receiver or repairing Bluetooth. It’s definitely a little more flexible than the Astro A50 X’s demand that your headset be the central hub for all your systems, especially if your console and PC setups are in different rooms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s why I prepare so vigorously and why we only shoot finished screenplays. And <em>Supergirl</em>, which I’m not directing, is being handled the same way.

		<p>Square Enix have announced that Final Fantasy XVI will be coming to both Steam and the Epic Game Store on September 19th 2024. The whet your appetitive there is a free demo available right now on both stores, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi-demo-c289c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s the link for EGS,</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2738000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s the link for Steam. </a></p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XVI “DELIVERANCE” - PC Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2WT_0m0dsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As usual there are a couple of variations of the release.&nbsp; Final Fantasy XVI Standard Edition &nbsp;includes the base game, or the Complete Edition &nbsp;includes the exciting DLC chapters “Echoes of the Fallen” and “The Rising Tide” at a discounted price. You can also buy the DLC chapters individually or as part of the Final Fantasy XVI Expansion Pass, which includes both chapters. All of these will be available on launch day.</p>
<p>If you pre-oder the game on either Steam or the Epic Games Store will also receive the following in-game DLC items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brave Blade Weapon</li>
<li>Cait Sith Charm (Gil Boost Accessory)</li>
<li>“Sixteen Bells” Orchestrion Roll</li>
</ul>
<p>The game originally launched in June 2023 on PlayStation 5 and we gave it a whopping<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/21/final-fantasy-16-review/"> 9/10 in our review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>“If you’re a fan of strong narrative experiences, Final Fantasy lore, breath-taking graphics and a particularly sassy Moogle, and you don’t mind a sprinkling of The Witcher, The Handmaids Tale and the many accents of Old Blighty, then Final Fantasy XVI is the game for you,” said Nic. “Heck, it might just be the best Final Fantasy yet!”</p>

<p>If you need even more convincing you should get the game then let me remind you it won our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-playstation-game-ps5-psvr2/">PlayStation Game of the Year foe 2023</a>.</p>
<p>“Final Fantasy XVI is very different to its predecessors. First and foremost, it’s a lot more grown up, with the sex, swearing and everything else that its muse, Game of Thrones, offers. Then there’s the set-piece Eikonic battles, where players duke it out as the Summons the franchise is famed for. It looks and sounds utterly spectacular.”</p>
<p>“This game is a must-play for all action-RPG fans who want something a little more grown up. It shines for its lore and its lack of exposition for the sake of it, with reams of backstory hidden just a button-press away, offering a flow that feels more natural than any other Final Fantasy game to date. Its characters are fantastic, and as you grow to love them, their moments of sacrifice hit in a way unfelt since the likes of Final Fantasy X.”</p>

<p>Following the game’s most recent update, in which developer Starbreeze Studios released the Houston Breakout DLC, featuring a brand-new heist, tailor pack, and weapon pack, if you purchase the entire Chapter 3 bundle, some players cannot join a lobby. It’s becoming more widespread with each passing minute. Here are some potential fixes for the failed to fetch game config in Payday 3!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-potentially-fix-failed-to-fetch-game-config-in-payday-3">How to (Potentially) Fix Failed to Fetch Game Config in Payday 3</h2>



<p>If you’re among the many suffering from this bug that’s plagued the game since its launch, you’re not alone in dealing with it today. Countless players cannot get into a game because of the “game config” error in Payday 3. While not guaranteed, here are a few potential fixes for the problem:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create an entirely new Starbreeze account and link it to your game via Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation.</li>



<li>Verify the game files on Steam by right-clicking the game in your library, selecting Properties, then Installed Files, and then “verify integrity of game files.” It will need to check every file, so be patient!</li>



<li>If that doesn’t work, delete the contents of the % appdata%LocalPAYDAY3 folder and attempt to verify the game files once more.</li>



<li>Attempt to log in repeatedly until it connects.</li>
</ul>



<p>While certainly not ideal, some of these fixes may help you finally check out the new content in the Houston Breakout DLC!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-causes-the-game-config-error-in-payday-3">What Causes the Game Config Error in Payday 3?</h2>



<p>It’s unclear precisely what causes the failed to fetch game config error in Payday 3. Some users report it as a problem with their internet connection. More often than not, however, it’s on Starbreeze’s end. It’s not your fault.</p>



<p>Even worse, Starbreeze has not yet addressed the problem, as far as we’ve seen. Many experienced it on launch day, and here we are, nearly a year later, with the problem persisting for many players.</p>



<hr>



<p>Payday 3 is a bit of a mess, especially considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbreeze fired its CEO</a>, but we’re hopeful the team can turn things around and create a cooperative heist game for the ages!</p>

The moments in between, however, aren't quite as strong, sometimes devolving into aimless tedium. But its satisfying combat and unique variety of boss fights mostly manages to overcome these flaws."</p><h2>8BitDo Ultimate 2C vs. Ultimate Controller</h2><p>The Ultimate 2C is the budget version of 8BitDo's flagship Ultimate controller, which is our pick for the <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">best PC controller in 2024</a></strong>. The Ultimate supports three custom profiles and offers handy internal customization settings via 8BitDo's app, including macro support, full button mapping, adjustable trigger and rumble sensitivity, and analog stick stick deadzones. The Ultimate has a pair of remappable back buttons, whereas the Ultimate 2C's extra buttons are on top next to the triggers. In addition to the controller, you get a charging stand with a compartment to store the dongle.</p><p>You can get the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller for Switch, PC, and mobile for $48</a></strong> (was $60) at Amazon right now. The Bluetooth model also supports 2.4GHz wireless via a dongle. Three's also a <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CPY7H952?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2.4GHz wireless version</a></strong> without Bluetooth for PC and mobile for $45 (was $50). 8BitDo recently released the Ultimate "3-mode," which is a bit more confusing. It is technically an officially licensed Xbox controller, though it only works via a wired connection on Xbox. It does, however, support wireless on PC with the included 2.4GHz dongle and Android with Bluetooth. Prime members can get the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D1VHT3S6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 3-mode Xbox Controller for $55.29 (was $70)</a></strong>.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Live Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-anthology-preorders-quakecon-2024/1100-6525656/">Doom Anthology Preorders Are Live - Comes With 6 Games, Steelbook Case, And Replica BFG</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retrorealms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retro-game-preorder-guide/1100-6525752/">Halloween And Ash Vs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1825594654387294219?t=-rx6Q_9ptJcZJYDfNIcunA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateTheHate2 on X</a>, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be released on PC and Xbox as a timed exclusive in December 2024. The timed window is supposedly six months, and a planned release on PlayStation 5 is planned for the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming purchased MachineGames, the developer behind this Indiana Jones game after it acquired Bethesda in 2021 for $7.5 billion. Because of that, it seems highly likely that the game will be an Xbox exclusive, with the game being available on day one on Xbox Game Pass for both PC and Console.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't know how true this is, as it is purely speculation. We know that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is being showcased at Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will hopefully provide more information about the game and what to expect.</p>
<p>This upcoming action game is being developed by MachineGames, who also developed games such as the Wolfenstein franchise, some Quake games, and, most recently, the Indiana Jones game. Bethesda Softworks is publishing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a game between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this title is in a first-person perspective, with some third-person moments throughout the action, predominantly used for environmental exploration. The game also relies heavily on stealth, where players can control Indiana and use his whip as a weapon and a tool to solve puzzles that allow them to traverse difficult obstacles.</p>
<p>Bethesda and MachineGames announced in January 2021 that the game was officially being developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. Jerk Gustaffson, the Director, teamed up with Gordy Haab to contribute original music and reinterpretations of classic Indiana Jones themes heard throughout the movies.</p>
<p>At the moment, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn't have an official release date other than sometime in 2024. It's possible that, with the footage shown at Gamescom, they will announce a release date then. So far, the game is set to be one of the most highly anticipated Xbox exclusives.</p>
<p>With the speculation suggesting that the game will be coming to PlayStation 5 in the near future, it seems as though <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-reportedly-coming-to-ps5-as-microsoft-seemingly-prepares-to-go-third-party/">Microsoft has slowly started weighing up</a> the options of whether to bring the game to the PlayStation 5 or not. While <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/4-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-starfield-and-indiana-jones-arent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phil Spencer</a> spoke out at the Xbox Business Update, he suggested that four exclusives were being ported to other platforms but didn't mention which ones. This has given the audience plenty to speculate on, but we'll have to wait and see what the footage from Gamescom Opening Night Live brings us.</p>

Loot includes, but is not limited to, XP, materials, or drops (e.g. Exotic class items).”</p><p>While Bungie didn’t call out exotic class item farming specifically, that seems to be the most popular form of AFK macros lately, ever since players hit peak exhaustion with the gameplay loop required to attain them. Since exotic items spawn with random perks, it’s not just a matter of getting one but of getting the “right one” for the builds you’re running. And with  Overthrow activities in the Pale Heart not being generous enough and Dual Destiny being a lot of work to keep re-running, some <em>Destiny 2</em> diehards on PC started turning to running scripts in the background to farm for them, especially after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-exotic-class-overthrow-tier-4-chest-drop-rate-1851616742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-exotic-class-overthrow-tier-4-chest-drop-rate-1851616742">recent accidental nerfs</a></span> made the whole thing even worse. </p><p>The way it works, as you can see from dozens of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/1duhy7f/pale_heart_afk_chest_macro/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/1duhy7f/pale_heart_afk_chest_macro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit threads</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNZZBzG3dNM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNZZBzG3dNM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a></span>, is by loading players into the Overthrow the Landing patrol zone and looting the same old chest that has a roughly 2 percent chance to drop an exotic class item over and over again. Because the chest is close and always in the same place, it’s just a matter of rinsing and repeating. The script can loot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNNxdB0WqWM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNNxdB0WqWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about one chest a minute</a></span>, which would be mind numbing for a player to do but can make quick work of the farm if outsourced to a macro script that inputs all the commands for you while you’re busy complaining about <em>Destiny 2</em> on the subreddit.</p><p>“Is this allowed?” one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/my_friend_is_using_a_macro_to_farm_exotic_class/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/my_friend_is_using_a_macro_to_farm_exotic_class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a></span> in early July amid discussions of whether this was a bannable offense. “I mean, as long as he’s doing it solo and not hampering anyone else’s enjoyment of the game, I personally don’t see a problem with it,” another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/comment/lcajour/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/comment/lcajour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a></span>. “I don’t know why anyone would wanna spend hours actively running around a patrol space for a 1/64 chance to get something they are looking for for a build in the game.”</p><p>Bungie is now making it clear that that’s no longer the case. Most players seem to be okay with this change, and the studio specified that checkpoint macros, which are used to give teammates the same encounter save spot as the main person running the activity, won’t be regulated in the same way. But it still leaves the larger issue of why players were so turned off by the current grind that they started AFK farming to begin with. “Based,” wrote<em> Destiny 2 </em>YouTuber Stefan “Datto” Jonke. “But now it’s time to do something about why people opt for those paths in the first place.”</p><p>“That is indeed the goal,” Bungie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1825586394842149103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1825586394842149103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote back</a></span>. “We have some changes to XUR coming that we announced last week, and the team is continuing to look at opportunities for improvement.  Know it can be frustrating, but increased feedback/data to show the problem helps a lot, rather than resorting to Macros.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tactical-breach-wizards-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Games about high stakes, globetrotting military operations with the balance of global power at stake are a dime a dozen. But take their automatic weapons and tactical gear and replace them with flying brooms and pointy hats, and now we’re firmly in “things you don’t see everyday” territory. Tactical Breach Wizards’ imaginative setting pairs well with its snappy and witty script. The actual tactics in its main campaign didn’t challenge my brain as often as its jokes tickled my funny bone, but the small encounters kept a brisk and engaging pace that put hours of my time under a magical handkerchief and made it disappear in a blink of an eye.</p><p>Tactical Breach Wizards is a pretty literal name, all told. Your party, a rag tag group of magic using mercs from all walks of life, take their fight to the enemy one splintered door at a time. While this fits directly into the wheelhouse of Zan, a former black ops agent turned wizard of fortune, there’s no great explanation as to why his old friend Jen, a pretty mid private detective, takes to the explosive breaking and entering so well. But a few missions in, it didn’t seem out of place anymore. A lot of this world feels like pieces of real life and bits of witchy ideas kinda dropped together, with powerful spellcasters who have day jobs as traffic cops. But everything is treated so matter of factly that it all made sense eventually. Of course there’s a powerful mafia of druids featuring a guy who turns into a dog like Snoop in that one music video. Why wouldn’t there be?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tactical Breach Wizards Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The story is solid enough, following Zan and Jen as they chase a powerful and dangerous operative who can move faster than sound across the planet, but that tale isn’t all that enchanting in and of itself – especially in the back half where things escalate and get pretty convoluted. The dialogue is absolutely stellar throughout, though. It’s fun and plucky in a way that reminds me of TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly. Characters can be funny and vulnerable and sincere all in the same conversation without undermining any of it. There’s a lot of reading to do since there’s no voice acting, but the conversations are so energetic that it doesn’t feel like a drain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The dialogue is absolutely stellar throughout.</p></div><p>Most of the story happens in cutscenes that surround each mission. These turn-based skirmishes are more Chimera Squad than XCOM 2, with characters that have specific ability sets operating on more limited maps with lots of environmental factors to consider. Each encounter starts with the eponymous breach, where you deploy your units across one or many possible infiltration points and figure out your first moves. Having a really good first turn can set the pace for a good mission, but I rarely felt the opposite was true. I could almost always recover from a bad turn thanks to the ability to rewind any actions during it. You always know where your enemy is targeting, so you can always be reactive about mitigating their damage by any means necessary. That said, since you don’t always know where they are going to move the following turn, you still have to be more proactive to get good positioning on the map so that enemies have to react to you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As far as your squad of (eventually) five goes, it’s all hits, no misses when it comes to powerful abilities and the creative ways in which you can combo them with each other for big results. Most of your characters don’t fit neatly into well worn archetypes of the genre – there are no generic mages and fighters here – but their roles are distinct. Jen is a disrupter who can push several enemies around the level at once. Zan can put down overwhelming damage when mixing in a clone or overwatch-style abilities into his regular actions. Later, you get access to a tank who can switch places with anyone on the map, and can charge into people from long distances. Even through to the end of my 13 hour run, I was finding clever new ways to stunt on my foes.</p><p>Much of the action requires you to get your surroundings involved. Bouncing enemies off of walls and other objects is not just an enriching experience in its own right, but a sound and necessary tactic against well-armored baddies. This, as with the other two games in developer Tom Francis’ aptly named “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34631927-The-Defenestration-Trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Defenestration Trilogy</u></a>”, has a healthy(?) obsession with throwing people out of windows, to the point that one character can actually <em>make </em>windows to throw people out of if one isn’t readily available. Many objectives involve not only knocking out all bad guys, but also interacting with points on the map; interfacing with a laptop, locking down doors so reinforcements can’t come in, and turning off turrets are the bulk of the ask here. </p><p>Tactical Breach Wizards didn’t overwhelm me with these sub-goals, but it didn’t really wow me either. I spent most missions doing the same things in different configurations. There are tougher, optional goals that did test my skills when I chose to engage with them, like attempting to KO all the bad guys in one turn or using certain abilities in specific ways. Going back to complete these with stronger loadouts and characters is on my list of endgame stuff to do, but during my initial run though the story I didn’t stress much about them, and the game itself didn’t poke me too much about them either.</p><p>There are also some special challenges to vary things up that come in three forms: Anxiety Dreams, which are personal missions for each character, Dream Training, and Proving Grounds, which are unique maps with tests themed around specific mechanics or units. The latter two are where the real difficulty lies, tactically speaking, but unfortunately there are only a limited amount of them. Meanwhile the Anxiety Dream missions aren’t as tough, but they are creative, usually focusing around one character’s unique kit and lots of ways to use it. They pop up in the middle of the story and earn characters special upgrades for their abilities, but you can skip them without sacrificing the buff and comeback to it later. In fact, Tactical Breach Wizards lets you just skip every mission to progress the story if you so choose, and you can even choose to jump into any mission from the mission select screen regardless of if you’ve done it before or not. It’s a strange feature that I didn’t personally get any use out of, but it’s a bold statement to say “play this game at your own pace, literally whatever that pace may be.”</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Jarrett Green's Tactical Toolbox</h3><p>The definitive, completely correct list of the best turn-based tactics games you can play</p></div><p>Every mission grants you XP that become perk points you can spend to give character abilities a little extra zazz. Not all of these upgrades are made equal, and I’ve definitely made the most out of the perk point refunds in search of the right bonuses. Making Zan’s clone hologram, normally just used to draw enemy fire, a shooting platform in its own right is one of the several upgrades I trial and errored myself into that became significant game changers for me. It’s all pretty linear progression, though, and the only choices you have to make regarding customization are due to the scarcity of your perk points at any given moment. <s>You could pretty easily go back to old missions and grind XP to unlock everything. </s><em><strong>Editor's Note: </strong></em><em>It turns out replaying missions doesn't actually grant you additional XP, so you can't go back and grind out unlockables like this review originally stated. We apologize for the error.</em></p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Tactical Breach Wizards doesn’t demand knowledge from lost magical tomes to conquer its character-focused missions, each of which is filled with lots of doodads to fiddle with and not a lot of space to do it in. Being easy doesn’t mean it isn’t fun though – in fact, the very opposite is true here, thanks to the creative kits on every unit and how dynamic the combinations between them can be. Wrap that up in a vibrant and weird world with some truly incredible writing and it’s hard not to get entranced in its spell.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
