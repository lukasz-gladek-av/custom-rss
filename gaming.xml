            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Hollow Knight: Silksong’s huge launch in full swing, community debate about its qualities and flaws has gone back and forth, with some players insisting their criticisms about things like the game's difficulty are valid and shouldn’t be instantly dismissed as "hate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> launched over six years after it was announced amid huge excitement, and early indications are that it’s a critical and commercial success. At the time of this article’s publication, the Steam concurrent player count was over half a million, with English language user reviews sat on a ‘Very Positive’ rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as more players work their way through the game, some are expressing criticism across social media, subreddits, Discords, and Steam reviews. Most of this criticism revolves around Silksong’s difficulty scaling, which is causing players problems, and brutal runbacks. There’s even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/an-early-unassuming-miniboss-is-wrecking-hollow-knight-silksong-players">one very early miniboss causing a lot of players a whole heap of trouble, too</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it just me, or are some of the things that make Silksong ‘difficult’ just cruel?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n9o79b/is_it_just_me_or_are_some_of_the_things_that_make/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wondered redditor Machi-Ato</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game has artificially inflated difficulty and playtime due to overtuned numbers and menial tasks/runback,” reads a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159120097849349/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the reaction to these sorts of criticisms that has sparked a debate within the gaming community. Take that Steam post, for example. “Maybe you just got older and your skills have declined,” is the first response.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I love reading the negative reviews of Silksong because its just people complaining the game is too hard and doesn't baby them <a href="https://t.co/65Fv9lBtAx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/65Fv9lBtAx</a></p>— Johann (@LookAtMyMeat1) <a href="https://twitter.com/LookAtMyMeat1/status/1964418056329056751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s okay that Silksong is hard,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1na2etu/its_okay_that_silksong_is_hard/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared redditor jacked-deMamp in a thread upvoted 1,400 times</a>. “It’s already getting old seeing that every other post online about this game is someone complaining about the difficulty, especially when there are so many incredible things to talk about like the quest system and the new mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The amount of love Team Cherry put into this game is insane and you can feel it when you play, I wish people would get over the fact that it’s challenging because there’s nothing you can do about it other than get better. The game is finally out, and it’s hard - just like the original. I personally love that the mechanics are so different and require a lot of learning again, because after playing hundreds of hours of HK I didn’t want to just breeze through Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we just need to realize the game is the way it is and cherish these early days with a very special piece of art. It’s okay to get frustrated but don’t make those feelings overshadow how great of an experience this game is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sentiment has pushed the debate even further, with some players pushing back against the "git gud" and "skill issue" comments to insist it's perfectly fine to point out flaws in Silksong, however, beloved and important a release it may be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Criticism isn't hate,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1na13am/criticism_isnt_hate/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countered redditor bboy2812 in a thread upvoted 5,200 times</a>. “Most of the criticism I've seen on here and the Steam discussions is consistently dismissed as hate. Bad rosary economy, insane difficulty scaling, very few meaningful unlocks/upgrades, runbacks, locked into fighting bosses, contact damage stacking with normal hits, etc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The only ‘hate’ I've seen are from people who spam ‘git gud’ and ‘skill issue’ whenever they encounter valid complaints against their perfect little game that cannot possibly have anything wrong with it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds familiar, it’s perhaps because we’ve been through this sort of debate multiple times before with FromSoftware’s Souls games. The typical ‘Souls Cycle’ usually kicks off with adulation, followed by complaints the game is too hard, then more insight into why they’re too hard, then the ‘git gud’ accusations. Silksong, it seems, is following the same path.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the debate about Silksong’s difficulty shows no sign of slowing down, which you’d expect for a game so popular. Thankfully, IGN is here to help.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/quacks-board-game-review-bubbling-up-some-fun</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/quacks-board-game-review-bubbling-up-some-fun.1290963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So you want to brew potions? Sounds easy enough, right? WRONG! In <a href="https://www.cmyk.games/collections/games" rel="nofollow">CMYK</a>'s new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cmyk.games/collections/games/products/quacks" rel="nofollow"><em>Quacks</em></a>, a gorgeous re-vamp of the classic&nbsp;<em>Quacks of Quedlinburg</em>, it's a race against your opponents to bubble up the best concoctions in your cauldron before things get truly out of hand. Distributor Asmodee USA sent me a copy of the Premium Edition of the game to check out, so read on for my thoughts - and let's start brewing!</p>

<h2>How Do You Play Quacks?</h2>

<p><em>Quacks</em>&nbsp;is what is colloquially referred to as a "bag builder." In bag builders, much like with classic deck building games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dominion-review-game-that-launched-genre" rel="nofollow"><em>Dominion</em></a>, you're slowly perfecting and building up your resources over the course of the game. In deck builders, that means buying more cards that get folded into your deck. But in a bag builder, you'll earn money to buy tokens from a supply over the course of the game and slowly add those tokens into your bag. But what does that matter? And what is this bag anyway?</p>

<p>Great question! The core mechanic of the game involves drawing tokens (without looking!) from your bag and placing them on your cauldron board. As you wind around the board, you'll get more and more points and resources to spend on upgrading your bag further in future rounds. But beware! If you keep drawing, you'll be pushing your luck, as you can accidentally draw too many explosive berry tokens which causes your potion to explode for the round.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/colorful-quacks-board-game-1.jpeg?itok=iuCUOeKw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/colorful-quacks-board-game-1.jpeg?itok=BkXJuaIm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In&nbsp;<em>Quacks</em>, you'll pull tokens from your bag and place them in your cauldron until you call it for the turn or bust. Image: CMYK</figcaption></figure><p>One of the elements I really like about&nbsp;<em>Quacks</em>&nbsp;is that, unlike in many other push-your-luck games, the penalty for pushing your luck and failing (aka exploding) isn't&nbsp;<em>horrible</em>. Normally at the end of each of nine rounds, you gain dollars to spend on ingredients&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;victory points. If your potion explodes, you have to choose one or the other (pro-tip, ignore victory points early on, you'll need to build up your bag).</p>

<h2>Fast Play, Light Interaction</h2>

<p>Gameplay in <em>Quacks</em>&nbsp;feels lightning-fast, even though there are nine turns in the game. This is achieved by simultaneous action - meaning that each player "goes" at the same time. So each player will draw tokens from their bag at their own pace, deciding when to call it quits vs. continue pushing their luck.</p>

<p>This creates a fun (and not as chaotic as it sounds) experience that will have everyone focused on their boards until the end of turn, where points are tallied and bonuses are awarded. The downside here, of course, is that there's almost no player interaction. If you're looking for a game where you can truly mess with your opponents, <em>Quacks</em>&nbsp;(and most "builder" games, for that matter) isn't it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/quacks-board-game-nail-art.jpeg?itok=PJICnDUV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/quacks-board-game-nail-art.jpeg?itok=3F1Pib_l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In the premium edition of the game, cardboard tokens are replaced with these gorgeous acrylic pieces (nail art not included). Image: CMYK</figcaption></figure><h2>An Visual Upgrade (And Thankfully Nothing More)</h2>

<p>As you can see from the highly stylized images I'm using throughout this review (created by the CMYK team), there's a lot of glitz and gloss applied to&nbsp;<em>Quacks</em>. But other than new artwork - which swaps medieval-style imagery of the original for an almost "claymation"-like look - and a smart name shortening, there are no functional differences between&nbsp;<em>Quacks&nbsp;</em>and <i>Quacks of Quedlinburg</i>.</p>

<p>I say in the sub-header above that this is "thankfully" the only change made to the game - and that's because at its core <em>Quacks of Quedlinburg</em>&nbsp;was an incredible game that only suffered from a goofy name that confused people. I used to work in a board game shop, and I could see customers I <em>knew</em>&nbsp;would love this game not even give it a second glance. A game this good deserves to stand out and be as attention-grabby on the shelf as possible!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/quacks-board-game-handful.jpeg?itok=yzuixUZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/quacks-board-game-handful.jpeg?itok=ijFdDh8a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each colored token represents an ingredient you throw into your cauldron - too many cherry bombs and your cauldron will burst. Image: CMYK</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Quacks -</em>&nbsp;Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Quacks&nbsp;</em>is pure joy - it's energetic, fast-paced, and there's a lot of replayability in the form of different ingredients you can slot into the game. My game group loved getting right into the action, easily picking up on the base game and mastering more complex ingredients in our second playthrough. As I mentioned above, there's really not much player interaction - but we were all too busy worrying about our own cauldrons to care much about what our opponents were up to.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of "builder" games and never played&nbsp;<em>Quedlinburg</em>, you should absolutely check this out. I love the new art style, too, which feels fresh, modern, and unexpected. More games should stand behind a big, bold look like this!</p>

            <p>Bethesda has hidden a secret message in a social media post ostensibly marking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s second anniversary.</p>
<p>It's only 12 seconds long, and starts pretty much as you'd expect, but halfway through the <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522">video teaser</a>, the music and visuals are interrupted, the black/blue palette is replaced by yellow and brown, and we see snippets of black text and a secret message.</p>

<p>Thanks to some keen-eyed Starfield fans, somebody's already pieced together the clues and shared that message with us: "Terran Armada".</p>
<p>While we don't yet know what Terran Armada is, let alone when it'll release, fans are positing it's possibly the name of the next DLC or expansion, and are already sharing on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">Starfield subreddit</a> what's top of their wishlist.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">DLC2 is titled "Terran Armada".</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sklain/">u/Sklain</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/">Starfield</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"Yeah, this is interesting because 'Terran' when used in the correct context can only mean 'of Terra' or 'from earth'," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/comment/nckva3j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">suggested</a> one player. "Looks like our planet might be more than it seems in Starfeild. With the rumors of a Starborn DLC or update I wonder if a bunch of Starborn resettled the earth in secret or something?"</p>
<p>"I'm just happy to have something to speculate and theorize on again since that has been one of the most fun parts of gaming releases since [I] was a kid," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/comment/ncl7fiz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> someone else.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Bethesda won't leave us hanging for long and will confirm what's coming sooner rather than later – we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Last month, Bethesda teased an upcoming update for Starfield would improve space travel following a datamine that discovered hints of an overhauled "cruise mode". After a hasty patch removed hints of the cruise mode from the files, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-teases-starfield-space-travel-update-after-datamined-leak">Bethesda has since come forward with its hands up and admitted that yes, cruise mode is real</a> and is on the way somewhat soon.</p>

<p>"I'm seeing a lot of comments asking about Kingdom Hearts 4," Nomura said, as translated by <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884">Aitaikimochi</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-tetsuya-nomura-update/">TheGamer</a>). "We are making great strides and going according to schedule. So please wait for more information on that!"</p>
<p>Admittedly, that doesn't give us much to go on, but it should be a relief to fans to know everything is "going according to schedule". And as for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3?</p>
<p>"[Motomu] Toriyama supposedly said we will have news around the time of the second anniversary of FF7EC," he added. "We are making great progress on the game! And I can't say anything else. I'm not gonna be like, 'Well, actually…' If I did, people would be really surprised if it's during this FF7EC livestream.</p><p>"But we are indeed making a lot of progress with the game. We already have decided when we will make the announcement as well, and we will stick to that time schedule. So don't worry, but please wait for it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> finally released fresh screenshots of Kingdom Hearts 4 back in May, giving us our first look at the game in three years. Before then, the last time the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">shown was back in 2022 for the series' 20th anniversary</a>, in which we were treated to Sora's return and the expansive metropolis of Quadratum.</p>
<p>The day before those new screenshots, Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancelled mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</a>.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has sped up repercussions for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players who used V-Bucks and refunded them through an exploit on Xbox, essentially getting the in-game currency for free.</p>
<p>As we moved into the weekend, the studio <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1964118061763432684">said</a> it had now "fixed a delay" and would be claiming back any items that were bought through currency that had been refunded on Xbox or previously gifted from fraudulent accounts.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the system it uses to revoke items on Xbox between December 2024 and July 2025 "malfunctioned", the company <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1964011363363107319">warned</a> some players "may now see a message that their payment was reversed or refunded and see recent items have been removed, even from transactions from several months ago".</p>

<p>It comes after some Xbox players abused an exploit through which they could buy V-Bucks through Microsoft, apply them to their accounts, and then refund them.</p>
<p>After clarifying this "does not affect regular purchases on Xbox or any other platform that weren't refunded", the Fortnite Status X/Twitter account added:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update on Xbox refund issue:</p><p>Ordinarily, when a player receives a refund of a real-money Fortnite purchase, the purchased items are removed from their account.

</p></div>
<p>"Ordinarily, when a player receives a refund of a real-money Fortnite purchase, the purchased items are removed from their account," Epic explained. "When V-Bucks are purchased, spent, and refunded, causing the player’s V-Bucks balance to go negative, items most recently purchased and gifted with the refunded V-Bucks are removed from the player’s account and the gift recipient's account.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the system we built for this malfunctioned on Xbox between December 2024 and July 2025. During this time, players were receiving refunds, but the refunded V-Bucks and items purchased with refunded V-Bucks remained in the player’s account and gift recipient accounts."</p>
<p>While Epic accepts that over this period most players "continued using purchasing and refunding in good faith as usual", some "exploited the situation to make large numbers of purchases, often with many accounts. Some even set up shops to accept payments from players and gifted them items purchased with refunded V-Bucks".</p>
<p>It's taken so long to sort the issue, however, that when Epic began processing back-dated refund requests on Xbox on 4th September and confusing players, it's now "making a correction to distinguish between accounts that made ordinary refund requests, and accounts exploiting the refund system".</p>
<p>"We're restoring the items that were removed earlier this week for players who made less than 7 refunds since Dec 2024. It was our fault that we didn't update the V-Bucks balance in their account immediately as we should have. This will take a few days," Epic conceded.</p><p>"The removed items will stay removed for anyone who received 7 or more refunds, and for items received through gifting from players who made 7 or more refunds during this time. This is the ordinary approach to refunds from our terms of service, and these item purchases were taking advantage of an exploit with the V-Bucks refund system."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-return-to-ios-in-the-uk-uncertain-as-epic-accuses-uk-regulator-of-deprioritising-store-competition">Epic Games recently claimed the return of Fortnite to iOS in the UK is "uncertain"</a> as it's been unable to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS this year, "if ever", after the CMA – the UK's competition regulator –  has "deprioritised store competition entirely", following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">lengthy legal battle between Epic and Apple</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/06/concords-ps5-cancelled-shut-down-offline/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord%E2%80%99s-post-mortem-one-year-later.1290873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been one year since <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> pulled the plug on <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, a multiplayer shooter that was meant to lead the publisher’s vanguard of AAA live service titles. Instead, it became a grim harbinger, attracting so few players at launch that the game was brutally axed with all traces of its existence quickly removed – a cleanup operation that resulted in the shuttering of developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a> and the displacement of many talented workers.</p>
<p>The development budget of Concord has never been confirmed by Sony, with estimates of between 200 and 400 million dollars. Whatever the true figure was, the game’s commercial failure sent shockwaves through the PlayStation business, leading Sony to scrap multiple live service projects on top of the ones it had already cancelled. It’s reported that nearly every major first party studio had been working on a live service series that included flagpole franchises such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war">God of War</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Launch Trailer I PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQB_2FF2G1o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Still, when it was announced that Concord would go offline forever, just two weeks after launch, it came as a surprise to me. I thoroughly enjoyed my short time while reviewing it and was optimistic about the game’s future despite some evident shortcomings. When it comes to live service titles, most endure a somewhat rocky launch period as developers take on board feedback to make improvements while rolling out a roadmap of new content.</p>
<p>So, why did Concord fail so badly? And why was Sony particularly keen to wipe it from existence? There’s a combination of factors, really, starting with the game’s lack of distinction amidst an already saturated market of hero shooters. Overwatch 2 was still relatively popular, alongside Valorant and Apex Legends as well as new and upcoming games like Ubisoft’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>. The only thing that really set Concord apart was its focus on narrative, promising weekly cinematics that would add depth to the game’s cast of characters and the universe they existed in. It was an interesting concept but one that we never got to see play out.</p>


<p>Speaking of characters, the design of Concord’s playable heroes was a weak point that naysayers immediately latched onto. Considering the game was about a spacefaring team of misfits, akin to Guardians of the Galaxy, many of the designs were disappointingly drab and lacked imagination. Despite a handful of exceptions, many were bland human characters dressed in clumsy outfits. Some of Concord’s unlockable cosmetics promised more exotic hero designs though, again, we never got to see these in full effect.</p>
<p>Pricing was another issue for Sony. This is one area where Concord actually stood out, eschewing the popular free-to-play model that even Overwatch 2 had recently shifted to, in favour of a £34.99 price tag with the promise that all future content (including heroes, maps, and modes) would not be tied to microtransactions. As someone fed up with exploitative microtransactions in free-to-play games, this is something I personally welcomed, knowing that I could make a single upfront payment instead of being regularly stung with each new season or battle pass. Of course, many other gamers didn’t share this view, unwilling to part with £34.99 to see if they liked the game or not.</p>
<p>If Concord had launched a year of two earlier, it may have been an entirely different story. Or, at least, Sony may have given the game more of a chance before marching it off to the gallows. By the time Concord was revealed to the public, after many long months of teasing, there simply wasn’t an appetite for this kind of online shooter. With a development cycle of approximately eight years, Firewalk’s debut game was late to the party, launching at a time when live service fatigue was at an all-time high. The writing was on the wall when Concord’s reveal event failed to excite even the most ardent PlayStation fans, followed by a poor turnout during pre-launch playtests.</p>

<p>With so much time and money having already been poured into the game, Sony made the ill-fated decision to march on without delay. In the days leading up to its launch, there was a definite sense that Concord had been sent out to die with a minimal marketing presence and launch right in the middle of Gamescom. active players and copies sold were always going to be far lower than the publisher’s original forecast, but it felt like Concord would have a long tail and the chance of a comeback story. One that Sony could learn from to strengthen its remaining live service games in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Sadly, we’ll never get to see what Concord could have evolved into if Sony hadn’t been embarrassed into such a kneejerk reaction. Despite some unappealing qualities, the core gameplay was extremely fun and well-polished – Firewalk had actually nailed the part that matters most for an online shooter, but it sadly wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Although it held out far longer than Concord ever did, we saw a similar story with XDefiant, Ubisoft’s attempted “COD killer” that sewed together elements from a number of the publisher’s hit franchises. It ended up being another strong shooter that simply couldn’t attract enough players to keep the lights on. We also saw this happen with Splitgate… and Splitgate 2. In fact, the only recent success story in this genre has been Marvel Rivals which, despite being hugely derivative, has leveraged the still popular IP to draw in players.</p>
<p>Sony has paid the price for leaning so heavily on live service games as part of its current-gen strategy, which could be to blame for a smaller selection of first party hits compared to this point in the last generation. Now, all eyes turn towards its next big online title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, which has had problems of its own. There’s a growing fatigue surrounding the already niche extraction shooter, and despite Marathon’s slick reveal trailer and key art (some of which was plagiarised), the hype train has slowed to a crawl following initial playtests with Bungie now going back to the drawing board. Let’s hope the former Halo devs can right the ship instead of hammering another nail in PlayStation’s live service ambitions.</p>

<p>Last time, we checked out the original Harvest Moon for the SNES, and would you believe it, it was actually the more realistic European design that won the day with 46% of the vote. North America was the runner-up with 34%, while Japan only managed 20%.</p>
<p>This week, to celebrate the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken</a> on Nintendo Switch Online, we're going to look at... Forsaken! Madness. Yes, originally launched in 1998 from publisher Acclaim Entertainment, Forsake was relatively well-received for its first-person gameplay and was given the remaster treatment by Nightdive on other platforms back in 2018.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Forsaken didn't launch in Japan, so we're back to a two-way duel this week with North America going head-to-head with Europe. Let battle commence.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:187360 @ 1757291359 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Forsaken - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f44a44c3bc23/forsaken-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/240-forsaken-64/1821-harvest-moon13-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Acclaim Entertainment / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American version of Forsaken features model Donna DeCianni sporting a rather unsavoury 'Forsaken' tattoo on her left cheek, which is probably why she's shedding a tear, to be honest. The background looks a bit barren; almost like it's been ripped from the world of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, or something. It's a recognisable piece though, even if the game's logo isn't necessarily that impactful.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ce3d612ecb4c/harvest-moon-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/240-forsaken-641-harvest-moonils/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Acclaim Entertainment / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European version features a much cooler font for the game title itself, though it's fair to say that the overall composition is maybe a little barebones. You've got what looks like a bronze-coloured globe with the letter 'F' imprinted on the front, with flames rising from the bottom of the box to surround the game title.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-god-of-war-tv-show-reportedly-begins-filming-in-march-2026.1290855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The God of War TV show, which will air on Amazon Prime Video, could begin filming its debut season in March 2026, according to a rumor <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-god-of-war-series-set-to-begin-filming-in-march-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Nexus Point News</a>. The website's sources also allege that the show will be filmed in Vancouver, a renowned filming hub thanks to its significant cost savings due to the lower Canadian dollar and generous government tax credits. The Canadian city also boasts a highly skilled and experienced local crew, state-of-the-art facilities, and incredibly diverse scenery.</p>



<p>The God of War TV show was <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> on December 15, 2022, but had to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebooted</a> about a year ago after changing the showrunner and producers. Ronald D. Moore, known for Star Trek: Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, and For All Mankind, is the new showrunner, writer, and executive producer. There are other writers, though:</p>



<ul>
<li>Matthew Graham (Life on Mars, Ashes to Ashes, Electric Dreams, and Spanish Princess)</li>



<li>Stephanie Shannon (For All Mankind and Outlander)</li>



<li>Naren Shankar (The Expanse and For All Mankind)</li>



<li>Joe Menosky (Star Trek: Next Generation, Voyager, Discovery, The Orville, and For All Mankind)</li>



<li>Marc D. Bernardin (Castle Rock, Treadstone, Carnival Row, and Star Trek: Picard)</li>



<li>Tania Lotia (The Witcher and Carnival Row)</li>
</ul>



<p>If the beginning of filming is indeed this close, the main cast is probably already chosen, and an announcement may be made before the end of the year. Furthermore, fans can probably anticipate the series to air on Prime Video at some point in 2027.</p>



<p>Overall, Amazon is betting heavily on gaming IPs with Prime Video adaptations. Fallout's debut season registered incredible success and they're looking to repeat it with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming second season</a> and an already announced third season, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon: Yakuza</a> wasn't quite as acclaimed. There's a lot more on the way, though, including the Tomb Raider TV show adaptation, which we just learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature Sophia Turner (Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones) as Lara Croft</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect TV series</a> that will be produced by the same team behind Fallout, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfenstein TV show</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange adaptation</a> confirmed just two days ago, and the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000 cinematic universe featuring Henry Cavill</a> (although the status of this one is unclear). </p>

<p>"What fun memories do they bring back?"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft began its 30th anniversary celebrations for its famous video game mascot <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Rayman</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from the news he'll be returning at some point in the future (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-kicks-off-raymans-30th-anniversary-says-new-project-is-in-good-hands">with work on a new project now underway</a>), Ubisoft is planning to reflect on the character's career with behind-the-scenes information, anecdotes, developer interviews, concept art and "more".</p>
<p>To kick things off, it has shared some concept art for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/rayman_legends">Rayman Legends</a>, which released for the Wii U in 2013 and followed with a Definitive Edition release on the Switch in 2017.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Return to the Glade of Dreams with these beautiful official Rayman Legends concept artworks. What fun memories do they bring back?"</p>

<p>In some related news, the Ubisoft free-to-play multiplayer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/brawlhalla">Brawlhalla</a> this week launched a limited-time Rayman 30th anniversary celebration - adding a new look for Rayman, themed stages and more.

<p>Addressing crashes, save stability and much more</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_the_shire_a_the_lord_of_the_rings_game">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</a> admittedly didn't get off to the best start when it launched on the Switch in July. Fortunately, the team at Weta Workshop has been busy improving the overall experience since then.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the latest game update has now been rolled out across all platforms. Below are the official patch notes for the Switch version. It improves save file stability, lifts the volume in handheld mode, resolves stuttering and crashing problems, and more.</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch</h3>
<p><strong>Save files</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We've made some changes to improve saving stability, so that your save files are tucked away safe and sound."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spinach Seeds</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It seemed that the spinach seeds weren't too fond of being planted on Switch. We've coaxed them back, so they're ready to sprout when the time is right."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The volume in handheld mode has been gently lifted, making it easier to hear all sorts of things - babbling brooks and beyond."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stuttering and crashing</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hobbits became blocked from playing after the game began to stammer, then crashed like a cart with a broken wheel. Not the sort of thing we take lightly in Bywater."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have also been some fixes on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and along with this are some cross-console fixes, which address issues across all platforms.</p>
<h3><strong>Cross-console</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waking Up Under Your Home<br></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Hobbit home is all about comfort, and it's certainly not comforting finding yourself underneath those nicely tiled floors of yours. You can rest easy knowing you'll wake up safe and sound inside your home."<strong><br></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Controller Vibrations</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Controller vibrations have been softened across all consoles, much more suitable for a Hobbit's pace and no more fear of those teacups shaking off the table."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stuck Guests</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After enjoying a delicious meal together, some townsfolk found themselves trapped in unlocked areas of one's home. Keeping guests stuck in odd corners isn't what any well-mannered Hobbit would call good hosting."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mismatched Floors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For those who appreciate tidy lines, it's been a bother getting one's home to feel just right when the floor patterns face different directions in the halls between rooms."</p>
</blockquote>
