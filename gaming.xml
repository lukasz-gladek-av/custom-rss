		<p>The full game sequel to Astro’s Playroom, Astro Bot is coming out on 6th September 2024 for PS5, with a huge number of world to explore and nods to popular PlayStation games and franchises.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASTRO BOT - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHMNQzLG_Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>More than 50 worlds will feature in Astro Bot, and just as with Astro’s Playroom – the game bundled with every PS5 – there will be plenty of gameplay variety. We saw flying sequences, sponge abilities, space battles, punching and grappling and more, in addition to returning abilities from Playroom.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of new PlayStation game references, such as Journey, Parappa the Rapper, Kratos and others.</p>
<p>It looks like a lot of fun, and we can’t wait.</p>

<p>Astro’s Playroom was a simple bundle of joy for pretty much every PS5 owner. “Astro cements himself as the PlayStation 5’s mascot,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">I said in 2020</a>, “with a celebration of all things PlayStation that also showcases the full potential of the immersive new DualSense controller. Astro’s Playroom is the first thing you should play on PlayStation 5.”</p>

		<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion was&nbsp; announced for PSVR 2, Meta Quest 3 and Steam VR earlier this year and we now have the first gameplay reveal and a release window of holiday 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien Rogue Incursion - First Gameplay | PS VR 2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnzh9Ll4i7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Alien game project has been in development for the last two years at VR specialists Survios. The company burst on the scene with the dawn of VR with Raw Data in 2016, before bringing the rapid releases of Sprint Vector, Electonauts and Creed: Rise to Glory through 2018.</p>
<p>“As reverent fans of the franchise, we know that any Alien video game begins and ends with its deadly Xenomorphs, and those encountered within Alien: Rogue Incursion are definitely ferocious, unpredictable, and terrifying,” explains &nbsp;TQ Jefferson from Survios.</p>
<p>“Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn’t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it’ll bring some friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage. “</p>

<p>There’s a rich pedigree for Survios and VR, in other words, but really the main reason why people will be excited for Alien: Rogue Incursion is because of 2014 game Alien: Isolation. The celebrated horror game was once shown as being playable in VR prior to release, and fans have long wanted to see a VR version of the game released – hopes that will sadly never be realised at this point. Hopefully Rogue Incursion can be the VR horror surrogate that we need.</p>
<p>“Our team at Survios are huge fans of Alien and have been building Alien: Rogue Incursion for a long time, honing our ability to pair the most technically advanced, immersive, and engaging VR experiences with best-in-class franchises,” says TQ Jefferson, Chief Product Officer at Survios. “This fully original story embraces all our favorite elements from 45 years of Alien, from kinetic action and heart-pounding exploration to our terrifyingly resourceful Xenomorphs that will truly make your skin crawl. We can’t wait for fans to get their hands on it this holiday season.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-a-new-trailer-as-part-of-state-of-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-a-new-trailer-as-part-of-state-of-play.885771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-a-new-trailer-as-part-of-state-of-play/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s State of Play broadcast has previewed the heavily anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-2/">Silent Hill 2</a> remake. The new trailer shows more of the town of Silent Hill, more of the enemies and a smattering of combat, all of which looks rather like the recent Resident Evil remakes. Silent Hill 2 set to release on October 8th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sU3pyYi5hz0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Having received a letter from his deceased wife, James heads to where they shared so many memories, in the hope of seeing her one more time: Silent Hill. There, by the lake, he finds a woman eerily similar to her… “My name… is Maria,” the woman smiles. Her face, her voice… She’s just like her.”</em></p>
<p>In development by Bloober Team, Silent Hill 2 is a big step up for the studio, but one that absolutely makes sense. They’re best known for their work on psychological horror games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/15/layers-of-fear-review-2/">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/19/observer-system-redux-review-ps5-series-x/">Observer</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium</a>. That experience will be vital when updating a game made and designed for the limitations of the PlayStation 2 hardware in 2001.</p>
<p>In terms of the core gameplay, Silent Hill 2 will most noticeably be transformed by a shift away from fixed cameras and tank controls to over-the-shoulder and a more modern control scheme, similar to the treatment that Capcom gave to their Resident Evil remakes.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s also a massive leap forward graphically, with Bloober Team tapping into Unreal Engine 5 and all the cutting edge technology that this features like Lumen for realistic lighting effects and Nanite for exceptionally detailed 3D modelling and texturing.</p>
<p>It had been a while since Silent Hill 2 was first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/20/silent-hill-2-remake-is-using-unreal-engine-5-with-lumen-and-nanite-graphics/">announced back in 2022</a> – of course, it had been heavily rumoured for a good long time before then – but true to their word, it seems that development had been progressing smoothly in the time since then. Sadly there’s no sign of a release date just yet, but this latest look at the game will certainly have horror fans champing at the bit!</p>

		<p>Sony shared a first look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> remake coming to for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PC, confirming that the game is still set to release in late 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ownf9ZasITA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Until Dawn is getting the full remake treatment by Ballistic Moon, taking the PS3 cult classic horror game and completely remaking it in Unreal Engine 5, as opposed to the Decima engine of the original.</p>
<p>There will be some updates to both gameplay and narrative, most notably shifting to a third person camera, instead of fixed camera angles, and trying to be more nuanced and emotional with the story. Hopefully it’s still got some of the original’s schlocky teen horror vibes, and this trailer does seem to show it echoing many of the old locations and scenes.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2015, Until Dawn really put Supermassive Games on the map as a horror game developer, and saw them then delve deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of more and more narrative horror through The Dark Pictures Anthology series, The Quarry and more.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review/">original review of Until Dawn</a> in 2015, Jim said, “With its immersive world, branching narrative, and lifelike character work, Until Dawn will have players on the edge of their seats while pounding them with jump scares and a bone-chilling soundtrack. Having previously worked on ports and smaller titles for Sony, Supermassive Games have shown that they can play with the big boys and we can’t wait to see what they come up with next.”</p>

            <p>
Sony has announced a new Astro Bot game during tonight's PlayStation State of Play. It's simply called Astro Bot, is once again developed by Sony's Team Asobi, and launches for PlayStation 5 on 6th September.
</p>
<p>
A charming-enough-looking platformer, this is Astro's first starring role since 2020's PS5 launch title Astro's Playroom. 
</p>
<p>
In the past, Astro has been used as a showcase for Sony's hardware, with Playroom designed to show off the PS5 DualSense, just as 2018's Astro Bot Rescue Mission was built for PlayStation VR. 
</p>
<p>This time, Astro Bot looks a more typical platformer - with sections where Astro can power-up and grow in size... and also dress up as other PlayStation characters such as PaRappa the Rapper, and also... a PlayStation 5 console? And wield Kratos' hammer?! It's clear there's plenty of Sony loving going on here too.</p>
<p>Here's a first look:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><em>Note: This is a developing story. More info about Astro Bot will be added shortly. </em></p>
<p>Among the many quality PlayStation 5 exclusives, few are more underappreciated than <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/astros-playroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro’s Playroom</a>. Sure, it was just a relatively small-scale pack-in title, but Astro’s Playroom was a ton of fun and made better use of the Dualsense controller’s unique features than any game since. In the past week, rumors emerged that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal of a new Astro Bot title was imminent</a>, and it turns out the leakers were right on the money.</p>
<p>During today’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a> showcase, we got a first peek at the next entry in Sony’s series, simply titled Astro Bot. The game looks to be an extension of what was established with Astro’s Playroom, offering larger themed platforming worlds to explore. The trailer shows Astro getting around on a rocket-powered glider of sorts shaped like a Dualsense controller, tons of different environments, some massive bosses, and more wildness. In addition to that, we see plenty of PlayStation cameos and references, with a particular focus on old Japan Studio creations like PaRappa the Rapper (although Kratos and others get a nod too).</p>
<p>Best of all, we won't be waiting too long for Astro Bot, as Sony also revealed we’ll be able to get our hands on the game in September. Check out the first Astro Bot trailer for yourself, below.</p>

<p>Astro Bot jumps onto PS5 on Setpember 6. What do you think? Excited to go on another adventure with Sony’s little robot?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168014/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-gameplay-trailer-state-of-play<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Mi8etX">Capcom has circled back to reveal more about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the open-world entry in its beloved <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-guides">Monster Hunter</a> series, after having previously <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23992308/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-capcom">revealed the game at The Game Awards 2023</a>. At PlayStation State of Play on Thursday, a new gameplay trailer showed off way more of this massive upcoming title. There’s still no release date — besides just “2025” — but now we know a bit more about how the game looks.</p>
<p id="5J1LOI">The new gameplay trailer introduced what appears to be an ensemble cast of characters, trading quips amongst one another while riding a big boat that somehow is traveling over the sand dunes of a huge desert. A series of shots then depicts these characters exploring a diverse range of environments that are — you guessed it — full of monsters. The trailer then showed some classic-looking Monster Hunter battles, with over-the-shoulder shots of a character who has a vast array of weapons at their disposal.</p>
<p id="DdG4Nu">The Monster Hunter franchise, which celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024, is comprised of dozens of wildly successful games across every platform — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22356696/monster-hunter-world-board-game-preview-kickstarter-launch-date-price">even the tabletop</a>. The bestselling entry in the franchise, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/2018/1/25/16911176/monster-hunter-world-guide-walkthrough"><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> (2018)</a>, was a huge action-adventure game but didn’t actually feature an open-world — despite the “World” in its title. Its follow-up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-rise-guide/22348967/weapons-armor-wirebug-wyvern-riding-best-controller-beginners-tips-tricks"><em>Monster Hunter: Rise</em> (2021)</a>, followed the same formula. Since <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will have a fully open world, fans can expect more freewheeling exploration through much bigger maps and biomes.</p>
<p id="Ei8YhD">We still don’t know exactly when in 2025 we’ll be exploring the world of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, but we do know the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.</p>

  <p id="R0L9KE"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158274/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-date-sony">Sony’s latest State of Play livestream</a> was full of new game announcements and updates for all things PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR 2 — with a little bit of PlayStation content for PC as well. PlayStation fans got a look at a new game starring the lovable Astro Bot, a new Dynasty Warriors, a release date for the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, and confirmation of a few games making the jump from PC to PS5 (and vice versa).</p>
<p id="F9QQd4">If you couldn’t watch May’s big State of Play showcase live, here’s a recap of all the game announcements, release dates, trailers, and other highlights from Sony’s event.</p>
<h2 id="21zA7f"><strong>Concord gets first gameplay</strong></h2>

<p id="5NgGqk">When Sony <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736345/playstation-showcase-may-2023-new-games-trailers">showed off <em>Concord</em> at last year’s PlayStation Showcase</a>, we didn’t know what to expect from Firewalk Studios’ multiplayer PvP FPS. Now we do, as Sony and Firewalk showed off a cinematic trailer and in-engine gameplay from the colorful 5v5 competitive hero shooter starring a bunch of alien misfit adventurers. <em>Concord</em> is coming to PS5 and PC on Aug. 23.</p>

<p id="EAE9dg">Open-world dress-up adventure <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is coming to PS5 — with a beta test expected soon — letting players explore a bucolic fantasy world with their furry friend Momo. Think <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, but with really cute outfits.</p>

<p id="ymzTct">The developer behind <em>Pascal’s Wager</em> revealed its new game, <em>Ballad of Antara</em>, a very ambitious Soulslike action game coming to PS5 in 2025. According to the game’s official description, “A faraway land is on the verge of being lost to a conflict from eons ago, and the invasion that followed it. Embark on a perilous journey, seek towering divine creatures, to reclaim the twisted and lost fundamentals of the world.”</p>

<p id="HC4K5Q">Skydance’s <em>Behemoth</em> promises an adventure through strange, otherworldly environments and battles against towering monsters, with “weighty VR combat and life-like physics.” PSVR 2 owners will be able to test those claims for themselves when <em>Behemoth</em> arrives later this year. </p>

  <p id="YN6OT5">Marvel and NetEase Games’ superhero team-based PVP shooter <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24112564/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-trailer-release-date-netease"><em>Marvel Rivals</em> got announced</a> last March and is already in beta on PC. At the PlayStation State of Play livestream on Thursday, fans learned that the game will also be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, with a closed beta coming to the PlayStation platform soon.</p>
<p id="JtgeqQ"><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is a free-to-play game with a huge lineup of Marvel heroes and villains, with 18 characters confirmed thus far: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/26/16898048/marvel-black-panther-movie-comics-avengers-chadwick-boseman">Black Panther</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/27/13058882/doctor-strange-explained">Doctor Strange</a>, Groot, Hulk, Iron Man, Loki, Luna Snow, Magik, Magneto, Mantis, Namor, Peni Parker, Rocket Raccoon, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, Storm, Star-Lord, and The Punisher. The premise revolves around converging timelines and multiple Doctor Dooms, with proceedings overseen by Galactus’ daughter Galacta, but really the point of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is to see these popular and mega-powerful characters teaming up and using their diverse array of abilities in combat.</p>
<p id="SikeEP">In an earlier <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24112564/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-trailer-release-date-netease">interview with Polygon about <em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, game director Thaddeus Sasser — who has also worked on series like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Ghost Recon for two decades — emphasized that all of those different superpowers are definitely the fun part. “Having magical superpowers in a multiplayer game is something that hasn’t really been done to death,” he said. “It’s still kind of relatively fresh and new, and the way we’re doing it, and some of the tricks we’ve got up our sleeves should be pretty exciting for new players.”</p>

The weather appears to dramatically alter as well—at one point a thunderstorm is raging in the background of an epic encounter. Another great addition is a mountable companion that looks to be a game-changer. It appears to seamlessly weave in and out of combat, and at one point even picks up the player to save them from getting crushed by a monster’s follow-up attack.</p><p>Check out the latest trailer for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>below:<br></p><p><br><em>Monster Hunter: World </em>launched the long-running series into the mainstream back in 2018, when it became <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-monster-hunter-world-became-capcoms-greatest-succes-1834759462&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-monster-hunter-world-became-capcoms-greatest-succes-1834759462">Capcom’s best-selling game of all time</a></span>. <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>’s environments were lauded  for their density, as well as how monsters would interact with one another as part of the shared ecosystem.</p><p> <em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>first launched on the Switch back in 2021 before releasing onto other platforms alongside a hefty expansion back in 2023. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>looks to build upon the foundation of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>’s massive and layered biomes and pair it with <em>Rise</em>’s focus on streamlined and refined movement systems to make potentially a hell of a game.

Astro also flies around on a DualSense controller at one point, so I expect that will probably be steered through motion controls. Oh, there’s also a PlayStation 5 space ship. Wait, Kratos just gave Astro his axe? Oh, it looks like he’s teaming up with a bunch of different PlayStation characters. This shit rules. Game of the Year contender, you heard it here first. Unlike <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, it looks like <em>Astro Bot </em>will be a boxed video game you can find on store shelves on September 6.</p><p>Check out the trailer below:</p><p>Astro originates from <em>The Playroom</em>, which was another tech-demo-style experience on the PlayStation 4 that launched alongside the system in 2013. This was followed up with <em>Playroom VR</em>, which held the same purpose but for the PlayStation VR headset in 2016. The character finally got a self-titled game with the excellent <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission </em>in 2018, a PlayStation VR exclusive. <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>was the first full-fledged game starring Astro that didn’t require a peripheral, and it was a hit, so it’s good to see the little guy get a new game.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whenever I’ve had a long day, I always find comfort in an ARPG. My go-to right now is Diablo 4, but that’s primarily because I’m waiting for Path of Exile 2. Here is what we know about the Path of Exile 2 Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-date">What is the Path of Exile 2 Early Access Release Date?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, we don’t yet know the official release date for Path of Exile 2. We don’t even know precisely when the Early Access period begins, besides sometime later this year.</p>



<p>According to the PlayStation State of Play showcase, which revealed additional gameplay, including couch co-op in Path of Exile 2, we’ll get our hands on the ARPG before the year is out.</p>



<p>However, the exact date remains unknown to everyone outside of Grinding Gear Games!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-big-is-path-of-exile-2">How Big is Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>From leaks and reveals, Path of Exile 2 promises to be massive, especially compared to the first game. It was so big that, while initially planned as an expansion to the first title, GGG decided to make it a standalone sequel.</p>



<p>The second game features a total of six acts, 100 unique environments, over 600 monsters, and 100 bosses to fight across the massive campaign. All the while, you can play cooperatively with up to six players in total, and there are twelve classes, so no one must double up!</p>

<p>At the State of Play showcase, an all-new trailer was revealed for Path of Exile 2, announcing an early access window kicking off towards the end of 2024. It also uncovered several key elements of the upcoming title, including couch co-op gameplay mechanics and crossplay features.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-the-path">Take the Path</h2>



<p>Fans have been waiting for Path of Exile 2 for some time. Last year, Grinding Gear Games offered a sizeable update on the game as well as a fresh trailer that showcased the work done thus far. It’s a follow-on from 2013’s Path of Exile and it’ll feature an extensive, seven-act campaign that can be played solo or with a friend either online or in a couch co-op setting – which is rarely seen these days.</p>



<p>Here’s the newest trailer for Path of Exile 2:</p>

<p>Sony has officially unveiled the new Astro Bot game, coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 (PS5) on September 6.</p>



<p>A new Astro game had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-planning-new-astro-bot-game-for-2024-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long been rumored</a> for 2024. Just last week, reliable data miner billbil-kun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-astro-game-announcement-coming-in-next-two-weeks-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that an announcement</a> on the new game known as Astro Bot would be coming “within 15 days”.</p>



<p>“Gear up for a supersized space adventure with ASTRO BOT,” Sony says. “Charge into a brand-new, supersized adventure with ASTRO across more than 50 exciting and diverse worlds…”</p>



<p>The new game marks the third title in the franchise from PlayStation. The first, Astro Bot Rescue Mission, was released exclusively for PS VR in 2018 while Astro’s Playroom was released in 2020 and came pre-installed on all PlayStation 5 consoles. This new game isn’t a VR title like the original, instead another platformer like Astro’s Playroom.</p>



<p>In addition to the official announcement, a trailer was released for the game showcasing some gameplay and its location. The game will be exclusive to PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>In addition to the trailer, some new information was revealed about the game, including it’s environment.</p>



<p>“Dynamic, ever-changing environments,” Capcom said. “A story of monsters and humans in a world with two faces: one in which the lands are harsh and unforgiving, where monsters fight for scant resources—and another in which the lands are vibrant and brimming with life.</p>



<p>“You play as a professional monster hunter, protecting the balance of the ecosystem and hunting monsters. Use the resources you gain from hunts to craft ever more powerful weapons and armor in your quest to unravel the mysteries of the new lands.”</p>

<p>Where Minds Weet was revealed during the Opening Night Live ceremony at Gamescom 2022. Since then, things have been relatively quiet, with the developer – Everstone Studio – not passing up much in the way of information regarding the ‘supernatural swordfighting’ game. In the first trailer that showcased the project, we got an extended look at a game that seemed to replicate a few games in its makeup, namely Assassin’s Creed, Ghost of Tsushima, and Sekiro.</p>



<p>It was confirmed a while ago that Where Winds Meet would be released on PC – but thanks to a new trailer dropping at the PlayStation State of Play event, we know it’s also coming to consoles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-winds-meet-on-console">Winds Meet on Console</h2>



<p>In an all-new trailer for Where Winds Meet that was released today during the PlayStation State of Play showcase, we saw characters fighting acrobatically through trees while wielding weapons like umbrellas and swords. That’s all you need to know.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Where&nbsp;Winds&nbsp;Meet - Announce&nbsp;Trailer | PS5 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eqEGZ5AKUwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Where Winds Meet comes from Everstone Studio, a Chinese developer sitting under the NetEase banner. This is an untested studio, as Where Winds Meet is the team’s first game. On the company website, there’s a lot of information about what is assumed to be <strong>this game</strong>, but it’s in Chinese and translating the page doesn’t yield too much in the way of tangible results.</p>



<p>Regardless, the latest trailer is all we need to confirm the biggest piece of news regarding Where Winds Meet since 2022 – it’s coming to consoles.</p>

    <p><span>First glimpses of the story, characters, system, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,487 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released the first official trailer for <em><a title="Games > Monster Hunter Wilds [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></em>, which introduces the game’s untamed landscape teeming with new monsters, as well as first glimpses of the story, characters, system, and more. <span id="more-885943"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>In <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, players join the ranks of a special Research Commission team investigating the Forbidden Lands. Fully voiced for the first time in the <em><a title="Series > Monster Hunter [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> series, the hunter ventures into the unknown with their companions, including Guild-appointed handler Alma, their Palico partner, and a mysterious child. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> features multi-dimensional biomes that can transform in unexpected ways. The first locale to be unveiled is the Windward Plains, a vast region encompassing harsh deserts, twisted rock formations, and swaying grasslands abound with life.</p><p>These immersive ecosystems are populated with wildlife acclimated to their surroundings, including smaller monsters like Dalthydon, an herbivorous wyvern that migrates seasonally, and Ceratonoth, who rely on males to shield the herd from raging storms with well-developed dorsal horns that serve as lightning rods. Of course, large monsters also roam the Windward Plains, including Doshaguma. While massive and territorial, these fanged beasts are curiously sometimes sighted stalking the plains in aggressive packs. Meanwhile, the formidable amphibian Chatacabra uses its surroundings and adhesive saliva to become an even stronger adversary by armoring its body with natural materials like ore.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_885955"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>To help hunters meet the challenges that await in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the beloved gameplay of the series has evolved with an arsenal of new features. Players will experience a seamless flow from story sequences to gameplay without interruption. To traverse this world’s sprawling environments, the game introduces Seikrets, a new type of mount. These nimble creatures can guide their riders to destinations and allow hunters to perform <a title="Genres > Action [1,862 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s on the go, such as sharpening weapons, gathering materials, and wielding the slinger. Hunters can also swap to a secondary weapon with their Seikret, empowering hunting parties to adapt to the changing conditions out in the field without returning to base.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>All 14 of the series’ iconic weapon types return in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and have now evolved to include new actions. Additionally, the game introduces brand-new systems, such as Focus Mode, giving hunters more precise control over aiming, guarding, and attacking monsters’ weak points. The new Hook Slinger also offers hunters additional abilities, including contextual actions and the power to collect items from a distance – even when mounted atop their Seikret.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> players who link their <em><a title="Games > Monster Hunter: World [160 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a></em> save data can receive special bonus items. This includes the Felyne Leather Set (Palico Armor) and Felyne Acorn Spade (Palico Weapon) for linking <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> base game save data, and Felyne Duffel Set (Palico Armor) and Felyne Trekker Peckaxe (Palico Weapon) for linking save data from the title’s massive expansion <em>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</em>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,401 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,199 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

"This is actually a feature a lot of games just don't bother with anymore, but it's something that I really love personally."</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding Gear Games reworked Path of Exile 2's menu and inventory screens into full-screen versions better suited for playing on a big screen when playing solo, and players will be able to fully remap all of their skills to any of the game's 24 keybinds. Console players will also have easy access to learning more about the game's complex stats and mechanics, with a built-in help system that explains the game's various systems with the press of a button.</p><p dir="ltr">Path of Exile 2 will be free-to-play and is slated to receive a closed beta on PC and consoles later this year, with a planned early access launch before year's end. Grinding Gear Games is aiming for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-is-aiming-for-approachable-depth-over-complexity/1100-6517495/" data-ref-id="1100-6517495">Path of Exile 2 to be more approachable than the original Path of Exile</a>, which will feature a brand new six-act campaign, skill gem system, 12 character classes, and a new "dual specialise" feature for its infamous Passive Skill Tree. Meanwhile, Grinding Gear Games announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-replace-the-first-game-after-all/1100-6516398/" data-ref-id="1100-6516398">Path of Exile 2 won't replace the original game</a>, promising to offer new expansions in both games going forward.</p>

In a trailer that recreates several memorable scenes from the 2001 original, you can get your first glimpse at the game's performances, combat, and more. Oh, and it's been dated for October 8, most importantly of all.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU3pyYi5hz0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sU3pyYi5hz0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Silent Hill 2 remake is a PS5 console exclusive. It will tell the story of writer James Sunderland arriving in the titular town in search of his wife, whom he believed to be dead. The game uses a modernized gameplay style and perspective and will use 3D audio, haptic feedback, and the DualSense controller's adaptive triggers.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the original Silent Hill 2, developed internally at Konami, Bloober Team is responsible for the Silent Hill 2 remake. The studio is best known for its Layers of Fear games, as well as its supernatural horror adventure The Medium.</p><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill 2 lands on PS5 and PC on October 8, 2024.</p>

Unlike the last entry, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHMNQzLG_Jg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro's Playroom can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/astros-playroom/astros-playroom-review-a-welcome-celebration">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you've played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/URG75CDX_rg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/monster-hunter-wilds-revealed-at-the-game-awards">its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December</a>. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards.&nbsp;The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

The Chinese studio describes its project as “Groundbreaking Oriental Wuxia Open World” on its official website. Today’s trailer seems to bear that out, with a number of bombastic and over-the-top scenes featuring high-flying martial arts against the backdrop of rainswept forests, burning castles, and warriors wielding sword and spear.</p>

<p>Today’s video makes it clear that the game is in development for PlayStation 5, but no word yet on a release date.</p>

The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/baOokyTUX_k" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game showcases a variety of beautifully rendered locations, though we have little idea of the plot other than the trailer's synopsis:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>A faraway land is on the verge of being lost to a conflict from eons ago, and the invasion that followed it. Embark on a perilous journey, seek towering divine creatures, to reclaim the twisted and lost fundamentals of the world.</em></p>

<p>Regardless of what any of that really means, the action looks good enough to grab our attention. Why is the protagonist lugging this kid around? We’re curious to find out.</p>

<p>Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5 in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/05/30/playstation-reveals-first-look-at-concords-5v5-fps-gameplay-out-this<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/04/21/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-team-developing-aaa-multiplayer-game">which it acquired in 2023</a>, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its&nbsp;<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBnStS9d2xg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below</strong>:</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jqQJhjf_3o" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="224" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">PlayStation’s unofficial mascot, at least in my eyes, is back for his own big adventure. <em>Astro Bot </em>is a fully fledged new game starring the rambunctious little bot, and it arrives on PlayStation 5 on September 6, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">Previously starring in games like <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission </em>for Sony’s VR headset and in the fantastic launch title <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>for the PS5, <em>Astro Bot </em>gives Team Asobi’s little fella a game all his own. Granted, it looks like he’ll still be platforming around, meeting famous Sony characters, and utilizing PlayStation tech from throughout the console lineup’s history.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="ASTRO BOT - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHMNQzLG_Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">We can expect more than 50 worlds to explore, which is a substantial amount of <em>Astro Bot </em>to dig into. But if it remains as charming and fun as the previous games, this might be a big-hitter for Sony. At least in today’s trailer, shown off during the Sony State of Play, we can see plenty of fun levels and interesting gameplay moments, including flying a giant PlayStation 5 into space.</p>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">It will have to carry the weight either way, as today’s State of Play was a little short on other major Sony reveals. <em>Concord </em>feels like it’s already off to a rough start after its official unveiling, and other games felt like they only got small updates, with several major games like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>still aiming for 2025 rather than 2024.</p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="false">I believe in <em>Astro Bot</em>, though. He’s quickly become a favorite face of mine in the Sony roster, and this new entry looks delightful. If nothing else, I have a hopefully solid platformer to look forward to on September 6.</p>
