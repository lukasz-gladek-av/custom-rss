			<p>Even though <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/">we've known the release date</a> for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X since <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom last month</a>, pre-orders were not live, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">before last night, we were still in the dark on price</a>. Well, now we know the price with the base Xbox Ally model coming in at $599 USD and the more powerful Xbox Ally X model listed at a whopping $999 USD. But even with those eye-watering prices, the handhelds are selling out across the globe, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>"<em>The hype is real!</em>" Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1971477401944326215">boasted in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>ROG Xbox Ally X preorders are sold out on the Xbox Store worldwide. You can still grab yours at asus.com/store/ or find a local retailer on xbox.com.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, it should be pointed out that this is just the first batch of pre-orders selling out. We don't necessarily know how many units Microsoft made available, so this isn't exactly a sign that the handheld is due to sell millions of units or anything like that when it launches next month.</p>



<p>But it is at least a clear sign that the early-adopting enthusiasts who are getting these pre-orders are not swayed by its price in the least. What happens after those enthusiasts all have their own, and how sales of the handhelds look within a year, will be the more telling figure.</p>



<p>Though these handhelds are made by ASUS, it's worth noting that Xbox-branded hardware hasn't exactly been selling well. Xbox Series X/S consoles have <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">reportedly sold only a little over 30 million units</a> since its launch five years ago, and new reports seem to confirm that Costco, the third-largest retailer in the world, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/">has stopped selling the consoles in its US and UK locations</a>. Costco Canada seems to carry them still, but you have to wonder how much longer that will last. </p>

              <p>City apartments don’t offer a ton of living space. So if you find yourself in either a one bedroom or studio, you’re going to have to make some tough decisions surrounding how every square inch gets used. This is especially true when it comes to your desk setup. It may not be worth it for you to dedicate a tone of surface area to a huge PC tower. Go with a mini instead. T<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/">he Geekom Mini PC AX8 Max is currently on sale for 29% off. It’s normally priced at $749 but has come down to just $529.</a> That saves you a staggering $220.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AAA Gaming on a Mini PC</h2>
<p>This compact case measuring in at only 5.4 by 5.1 by 1.7 inches contains <strong>a full-on PC powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU and AMD Radeon 780M graphics card.</strong> As far as mobile integrated GPUs go, this one is pretty darn good. You might actually be able to play some of the more demanding games out there like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> so long as you keep it in minimum graphics settings. And then lots of smaller indie titles should play pretty smoothly. You can actually even connect the AX8 Max to an AMD discrete graphics card over one of the USB-C ports to improve your graphics further. The mini PC has also got a fair amount of memory with its <strong>32GB of RAM plus a full 1TB of storage</strong> on its PCle SSD.</p>
<p>Mini PCs are pretty perfect for your “everyday” computer tasks. By that I mean the day-to-day stuff like browsing the web, sending out emails, queuing up a YouTube video, or doing anything you need in Microsoft Office apps like PowerPoint, Excel, or Word.</p>



<p>With the two USB-C ports and the two HDMI ports, you can actually connect to up to four displays at once without the help of a dedicated docking station. Over USB-C, you can achieve an 8K resolution at 30Hz while the HDMI 2.0 ports can get you 4K resolution&nbsp; at 60Hz. And since the PC is so small, you can just mount the whole thing to the back of one of your monitors, taking up no surface area on your desk at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/">The Geekom AX8 Max can be set to three different modes, based on your needs in the moments</a>. First up is the default mode. Not much to say there. Next we have quiet mode which can reduce power consumption and noise. Great for some light office work or while studying and needing to focus. Then we have performance mode which is optimized for AAA gaming.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-ii-review-%E2%80%93-how-can-you-improve-on-perfection.1309830/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Man, I love Supergiant Games. I’m still of the opinion that they’re one of the best developers around, and every new game has been a delight ever since their debut with the amazing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/07/19/review-bastion/">Bastion</a>. Each new game has their style and sound all over it, but has offered an entirely new mechanical experience underneath. So I was a little nervous when they announced Hades 2, even though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">I gave the original a 10/10</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hades II – v1.0 Launch Trailer (Available Now!)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8lJRcUeEMs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I stand by my score for Hades, by the way. It’s basically perfect, and that’s a bit of a problem when trying to make a sequel – how can you improve upon perfection? Hades 2 adds in a lot of new mechanical features to the game, with resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths to take in your adventure, and a more mechanically involved combat system as well. It’s just layer upon layer of stuff to do, and it can almost feel a bit overwhelming.</p>


<p>The general premise is pretty simple though. You take control of Melinoe, a mighty warrior and witch, and the daughter of Hades. You’ve been raised by Hecate, and it turns out that, while Zagreus in the previous game did get to sort stuff out for himself and his family, the problems were not over. Not a huge shock if you’ve paid any attention to Greek mythology, to be fair. Chronos has decided to wage war on the Gods, and has recruited the Titans to do so. He’s set himself up in Hell, while the other Titans are besieging Mount Olympus. Both of these things are bad, so you need to sort it out.</p>


<p>As you would expect, Hades 2 still plays fantastically well, a refined action RPG roguelike, though Melinoe doesn’t feel <em>quite</em> as slick as Zagreus did, in my opinion. She has&nbsp;a wider array of weapons to choose from, and a lot more layers to what boons you choose from the Gods to get upgrades and so on. The build variety is fantastic, and unless you’re actively seeking it out, you’ll be unlikely to play the same build more than a couple of times.</p>
<p>It still looks and sounds fantastic too, which isn’t a shock. Darren Korb has penned the soundtrack one again, and he’s one of the best in the business. The design is also steeped in style. Each new boss and monster is fantastic to look upon, and the horrors at the top of Mount Olympus are truly something to behold. So, it looks amazing, sounds exceptional, and it plays great… so what’s my issue?</p>

<p>Hades was sort of revolutionary, as one of the first roguelikes to use the gameplay mechanics to tell a really heartfelt story. Hades 2 is just another game that follows that form, and I don’t feel it tells the story quite as well, nor that the story is as interesting. It loses a lot of the heartfelt nature of Zagreus’ journey through the first game, and it results in one that’s just a bit more generic. You’re still overcoming trauma, sure, but the stakes are bigger, and I think that obscures some of the core themes that I’d like to see the game focusing on.</p>
<p>I also just think the cast of characters isn’t as good as the first one. While Melinoe is a fantastic protagonist, the supports aren’t as good, and I don’t think the bosses are either. I miss Theseus and the Furies, and instead we get Eris and her machine gun, or Scylla and her band. I like them all well enough, but I don’t love them.</p>

<p>To be honest, that’s how I feel about Hades 2 as well. It’s more technically and mechanically ambitious, and I appreciate that added depth and variety, but I don’t think it’s necessarily better for it.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is an undoubtedly excellent game, but it can’t quite escape the shadow cast by the original – I just know I won’t be playing this one as much as the first. That’s okay, of course, but it has me once again looking forward to Supergiant’s next original game, not what they’re doing now.</p>

<p>Silver Lining Interactive has announced that a physical edition of its first-person survival horror sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bendy_and_the_dark_revival">Bendy and the Dark Revival</a>, releases today for Switch . Hooray! (And/or terrified gasps!)</p>
<p>The physical edition of Bendy and the Dark Revival is out <strong>today, and you can pick it up from</strong> <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/products/bendy-and-the-dark-revival-standard-edition-nintendo-switch?_pos=2&amp;_sid=8fc22cb6c&amp;_ss=r">Silver Lining Direct for £32.99</a> or whatever that equates to where you are.</p>
<p>This particular survival horror, which is currently sat on a very respectable <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/bendy-and-the-dark-revival/">72% over on ye olde Metacritic</a>, sees players assume the role of Audrey, "a trapped animator who must navigate a dark, ink-drenched version of her old studio."</p>
<p>You solve puzzles and face off against scary enemies in this inky horror adventure. Will Audrey be able to survive for long enough? It's up to us! Gulp.</p>
<p>Here's some more official deets on the game, including some screenshots, in case you missed it early this year::</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Fight for Survival<br></strong>Sneak, fight, and think your way through a nightmare made real. Use stealth and puzzle-solving to avoid deadly encounters, or face them head-on with evolving inky powers.</p>
<p><strong>Terrifying Foes<br></strong>Face horrifying creatures lurking in the shadows, each more grotesque and relentless than the last. And always, the Ink Demon watches…</p>
<p><strong>A Story Drenched in Mystery<br></strong>Dive into a dark tale where animation and reality collide. Uncover lost secrets, piece together Audrey’s past, and make your way out. If escape is even possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While we missed out on this one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">we did review</a> the game's predecessor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">Bendy And The Ink Machine</a>, which we thought was solid, but lost its magic towards the end.</p>

<p><em>Bendy fan? Picking up this physical edition? Let us know!</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/physics-based-mars-first-logistics-launched-out-of-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/physics-based-mars-rover-building-sim-mars-first-logistics-has-launched-out-of-early-access.1309824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mars First Logistics is a physics-based sim-game developed by Shape Shop and published with support from Outersloth (the publishing and creator fund arm of <a href="https://wccftech.com/among-us-vr-release-window-trailer/">Among Us developer Innersloth</a>) that lets you build your own Mars rover to run around the red planet on. After more than two years of early access, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532200/Mars_First_Logistics/">officially out with the launch of its v1.0.</a></p>



<p>The game first launched in early access on June 22, 2023, and the v1.0 launch adds a new area for players to explore, 10 new endgame contracts, support for seven additional languages, new parts for your rovers, and more.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mars First Logistics 1.0 Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SoDG_Qd5dgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Beyond just building your own rover to trot around Mars on, you'll spend your time transporting various cargo across the face of the planet and trying not to topple over from the planet's awkward terrain on the way. You'll also make a home on Mars with your own shelter that you can build up and expand while you tinker and tweak your rover with well over 100 parts to mix and match.</p>



<p>It's a strong week for physics-based games, with Mars First Logistics' launch following the release of Baby Steps from the creators of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. Interestingly, Baby Steps was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">one of the indie titles that got out of Hollow Knight Silksong's way</a> when it was initially set to release just ahead of Silksong. Now, it's launched right next to a game that it actually has more direct competition with, as they're more aligned genre-wise. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-update-progress</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-still-moving-forward-konami-says.1309821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been wondering what's happened to&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, then wonder no more, because Konami has an update for you on how development is going.</p>

<p>As spotted by social media user <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Outsider Snake</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>),&nbsp;<em>Master Collection&nbsp;</em>producer Noriaki Okamura provided more information about the second volume of the collection during this week's Konami Tokyo Game Show spot.</p>

<p>According to Okamura (via Outsider Snake's translation), development on the second volume is "moving forward properly", and the collection as a whole is "shaping up to be something enjoyable", but fans should "wait just a little longer" for more information about the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=Jkvw5vd8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=A7d8P9Lc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2023, and a second volume is expected.</figcaption></figure><p>Okamura goes on to say that it's "hard to say" exactly how much longer we'll have to wait for more&nbsp;<em>Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>news, but that Konami is still working on the compilation, which feels like good news in and of itself.</p>

<p>Of course, we still know very little about what&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>will feature. Presumably, since the last collection left off at&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>, the new volume will offer a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, but beyond that, it's tough to say.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say <i>Vol. 2&nbsp;</i>will remaster&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Portable Ops</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Peace Walker</em>, and that bonus versions of&nbsp;PSP card battlers&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Ac!d&nbsp;</em>and its sequel will be offered as well, although that might just be wishful thinking on my part.</p>




<p>In any case, if you want to play more&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>, you'll have to content yourself with the recently-released (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">rather successful</a>)&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>for now. Hopefully, we'll get more info about&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">pledged to revive</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>with new titles, as well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Since then, we've seen the release of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>remake, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, so perhaps&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>will get its turn in the sun next (although that would probably turn it to dust).</p>

            <p>I've yet to fully consume <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuoo_zhsAhs">Consume Me</a>, so please take that headline with a pinch of salt (not too much, because apparently salt can cause <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-surprising-link-between-salt-and-weight-gain/">short-term weight gain</a>). Still, I thought I'd rush out a quick "on sale now" piece before the weekend because this game is extremely good, and I worry based on the Steam stats that it's being overlooked. 
</p>
<p>It's a fast-talking, mildly anguished pocket <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> about a high schoolgirl, Jenny, who is trying to lose weight while balancing schoolwork, domestic duties, an emerging social life, and her domineering mom. It broadly consists of household tasks and Coming Of Age Milestones couched as a bunch of Wario Ware-style timed minigame puzzles. Among other antics, you'll fold laundry by clicking on cue, manage a (dis)interest bar during a terrible date, apply your make-up as though doodling yourself in Kid Pix, and surgically arrange food on your plate while passing carbier morsels to your absurdly squishy dog.

<p>The developers are Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson, Jie En Lee, Violet W-P, and Ken "coda" Snyder. They offer the following cautionary note: "Consume Me is a semi-autobiographical game that depicts dieting, disordered eating, and fatphobia. If you are someone who struggles with or has struggled with disordered eating, it's possible that Consume Me will be a stressful or even upsetting experience and we won't begrudge you for giving it a pass."
</p><p>I myself have never had an eating disorder, but to borrow a phrase from Eddie Izzard, I am familiar with the experience of sliding up to the mirror and thinking "well <em>I</em> wouldn't fuck me". The mirror is indeed home to the Furies in Consume Me - it's where Jenny gets her quest assignments from her comically unforgiving reflection. I laughed a lot during my first hour with Consume Me. I think I'll probably cry a bit at some point, too. But even if I reach one of the less-good 13 possible endings, I don't get the sense I'll regret the journey.
</p>
<p>Consume Me's visual wit is balanced by a startling emphasis on resource management that is also a critique of the gamification of wellbeing. It's divided into days, which are divided into scripted and unforeseeable events such as trips to the shops, random hot boy encounters and above all, mealtimes. These see you trying to put enough stuff on Jenny's plate to fill her Gut gauge, without taking too many Bites. In my current save, I started out piling up objects subject to real-time physics, but then I had Jenny glean a few tips from a dieting mag, and the eating minigame evolved into a process of slotting together random Tetris blocks.

<p>Overeat, and you may wish to burn off the pounds by exercising in Jenny's room. Exercise takes the form of dragging an elasticated Jenny around with the cursor to fit various poses. Many of the minigames and cutscenes involve the clownish deformation of Jenny's body. It's amusing, and also a bit painful to watch. Consume Me does a great job of leaning into Looney Tunes slapstick while making clear that the portrayal contains an element of self-loathing.
</p><p>As for those resource gauges, you've got to worry about your energy (used for physical labours like walking the dog), your mood (strongly affected by hunger), and your cash reserves (see also, buying a new swimsuit before the big neighbourhood pool party). While the minigames may seem flimsy, there's a bit of strategy to distributing your time efficiently and unlocking activities, buffs and outfits that juice your stats. Again, though, this feels like critique, not an earnest equation of levelling-up with self-improvement. The developers caution in a brief foreword that Jenny's fortunes may take a turn for the worse even if she masters all these life-hacking gambits.
</p>

<p>The character art and interface design are sumptuously daft, with chunky Walkman buttons and a colour scheme suggestive of a virtual pet game, which I guess this sort of is. The audio is possibly even better: there's different music for each part of Jenny's day, and the sound effects fit the visual gags superbly. Above all, Consume Me is fast. Even when it's dealing with more difficult stuff, like your mom body-shaming you, it rarely prolongs a scene for more than a few sentences.
</p>
<p>Find the joyful, slightly upsetting thing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/">Steam</a>. If you want a second opinion, Oisin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/consume-me-a-life-sim-rpg-thatll-remind-you-that-you-hated-being-a-teenager-actually-has-a-demo-out-now">had some quick thoughts on a demo in May</a>. I suspect one reason Consume Me hasn't yet made a splash is that it's launched in the same week as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-tokyo-game-show-silent-hill-babel-city-building-and-an-rpg-about-a-fugitive-king">various other brillo experimental games</a>.</p><p>In particular, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a> from Bennett Foddy and co, which comes at similar subject matter from a very different direction. I've written previously about how that outwardly depressive game sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baby-steps-isnt-about-humiliation-but-the-joy-of-disobedient-flesh">celebrates the experience of inhabiting a disagreeable lump of flesh</a>. I get the feeling Baby Steps and Consume Me will make natural companion pieces. We'll hopefully have more thoughts on both down the road.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Remember last month when Game Freak revealed that Hawlucha would get a mega form in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>with an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-machamp-trailer-2000620960"><span>animated sports drama</span></a><span> starring the luchador bird and a Machamp? Well, Nintendo partnered with real luchadors to bring this fight to life. Last night, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>took over a Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre event in Mexico City that had several luchadors dressed in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-themed costumes, including two who referenced the rivalry between Hawlucha and Machamp.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre collaboration was a two-hour event full of drama, mayhem, and references to different Pokémon in both costuming and in the set dressing. The ring in which the bouts took place included </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>branding (or </span><i><span>Leyendas Pokémon Z-A</span></i><span>, as it’s called in Spanish). Attendees were given paper hats of Hawlucha and Machamp to wear in the stands, and Pikachu and Eevee mascots were hanging out the whole time. If you want to watch the whole thing, it’s on </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Latam’s YouTube channel, but do keep in mind this was a Spanish event. I don’t speak a word of the language, and the vibes are still pretty great.</span></p>  <p><span>Those who attended the event were gifted a </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span> medal featuring art of Hawlucha and Machamp squaring up. As of right now, there are no plans to distribute this anywhere else outside the event. For those of us who couldn’t make it out to Mexico City, the VOD is still a really fun intersection of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> and a specific culture. Lucha libre wrestling and its aesthetics have been featured in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>before, both with Hawlucha itself and the Pikachu Libre cosplay variant in </span><i><span>Omega Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Alpha Sapphire</span></i><span>, but this event takes that energy to a new level, and it’s fun to see people in the crowd playing into that crossover with their own costumes and chants.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="cs" dir="ltr">Místico Charmander 🔥<br>This is peak <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeyendasPok%C3%A9monZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LeyendasPokémonZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/zYFYDzhBfo">pic.twitter.com/zYFYDzhBfo</a></p> <p>— Emmanuel 🐝 (@Emmanurl_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Emmanurl_/status/1971391237069603185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most aura there's even been in 1 fist bump holy shit<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cmll?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cmll</a> <a href="https://t.co/AtRD8nZSqL">pic.twitter.com/AtRD8nZSqL</a></p> <p>— Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971402106566516846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">LOUD ASS TOGEPI CHANTS IN ARENA MEXICO 😭<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://t.co/q5awnYy46U">pic.twitter.com/q5awnYy46U</a></p> <p>— Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971388353636675678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THIS UMBREON MASK IN THE AUDIENCE <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://t.co/ljUzo9naIe">pic.twitter.com/ljUzo9naIe</a></p> <p>— Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971398611830538419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Hawlucha wins the fight thanks to its Mega Evolution in the trailer, so if Machamp wants to stand a chance, it’ll probably need a new form of its own.

The Metroid-style 2D search action game is coming this November, and a new trailer breaks down its story premise and combat mechanics.</p><p>Coming to PlayStation 5 and PC on November 11, the game takes place in a quarantined city overrun by demons following an interdimensional catastrophe. Players control Luca, a high school student who becomes mortally wounded during the calamity, losing both of her legs.

Though Luca and Rhem don’t always get along, the two must cooperate to escape the city and bring down a corrupt corporation that has been siphoning demonic energy for its own gains.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6la77h-t7rU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6la77h-t7rU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Luca uses ordinary makeshift weapons, ranging from a guitar to a computer mouse, to execute stylish directional combos and air juggles to conquer her demonic adversaries.

            <p>Modded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> guns and equipment are being sold on Ebay with tailored gun parts and effects. However, as of writing, it doesn't appear this grey market of modded loot is particularly profitable.</p>
<p>Ebay - a public e-commerce marketplace - is no stranger to gaming related side hustles, with numerous account, cosmetic, and service sellers setting up camp there over the years with the release of popular online video games. Eurogamer reached out to one Borderlands modded gun merchant to find out how it's going.</p>
<p>"It is fairly difficult to do as they have included a new encryption method to the guns this year that makes doing specific builds very very hard and will take, I would imagine, a long time to get perfected" states one Borderlands modded weapon reseller to Eurogamer under anonymity.</p>

<p>This new encryption method implemented by Gearbox not only makes the act of modding the exact weapon you want difficult, it's also making prospects of profit for resellers unlikely due to the cost of getting the decrypted values for weapons people will actually pay for. When asked how successful business is, the seller told Eurogamer:</p>
<p>"Not very successful. I've sold maybe three or four since release, which is around £15 to £20, which doesn't even cover the costs to build the guns, but I don't do this to make money or profit.</p>
<p>"To make the modded guns you often need to pay for tables that data miners have made that breakdown gun parts. Each part of the gun has an encrypted value, so does the rarity, manufacturer, level etc and the tables can be expensive to buy at around £50 to £100."</p><p>As such, at the moment, it appears that the grey market for selling modded Borderlands 4 loot is more for the hobbyists rather than those looking to make a buck from a hot new release (unless you're a data miner able to sell off valuable info, rather than the sought after weapons themselves).</p>
<p>Whether or not this will become a great problem as time goes on, and more of the game's loot encryption is broken down and made publicly available, remains a potential problem for the future. Although as a PvE game, the modded gear seller made an argument for why the practice of modding isn't doing any harm:</p>
<p>"Borderlands games have always been modded and I've modded them since Borderlands 1 and every game in between. It's a <em>huge</em> part of why I love the games so much."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As much as we all like to joke that “the PS5 has no games,” that’s simply not true. Mine has plenty of PS4 games on it! Ba-dum-tiss. Anyway, there are some awesome PlayStation 5 exclusives. The amazing and cute platformer <em>Astro Bot </em>won Game of the Year last year. <em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>is dropping in under a week. Plus people are still sleeping on 2021’s incredible third-person shooter roguelike <em>Returnal</em>. And then yes of course there really are a bunch of good PS4 games to check if you missed them last generation. A lot of them have great-looking updates too like everything going on with <em>The Last of Us </em>remakes and remasters. Point is there are lots of good games to play, but do you have enough storage space for all of them?</p>
<p>Expand you PS5 storage with the help of Seagate’s officially-licensed game drive for PlayStation consoles. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">This external hard drive connect to your system over USB 3.2 and will&nbsp; let you boost your capacity to store games by a full 2TB</a>. Right now, Amazon has the drive discounted down from $90 to just $80. A $10 savings may not sound like much, but that’s already halfway to getting you <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The PS5 base model only comes with 800GB of internal space (1TB on the Slim), and some of that isn’t even usable to you as it’s got all the system stuff on it that makes the console work. Really you’re working with roughly. The base model really has about 667GB while the Slim has a bout 842.2GB for you to work with, saving your games. This Seagate drive will more than triple your ability to store your game data. nor more deleting and redownloading.</p>



<h2>One Small Caveat</h2>
<p>There is a catch though. You can’t actually&nbsp;<em>play</em> you games off this external drive. The PS5 requires much faster read/write speeds than this supports. You might be thinking, “Okay, then what the heck is the point?” Well, this drive is still helpful because you can move you games from it to your internal drive when you want to play them. This is a much, much faster process than redownloading a game over the internet. Think of it like the digital version of taking your disc off the shelf and popping it into your console. The good news is you can play your PS4 games directly off of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">Unlike the internal SSDs available to expand your PS5 storage, this drive requires no tools to install as it just connects over USB.</a> That makes it totally portable so you can bring it over to a friend’s house and fire it up on their PS5 if you wish. Have your whole gaming library on the go.</p>

              <p>Will<em> Resident Evil 9</em> struggle on Switch 2? Is the new <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch really broken or do players just need to be better at compiling their shaders? And where the hell is the next <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection</em>? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. While all the big gaming showcases have wrapped up, there are still a few more days of Tokyo Game Show proper until the last big gaming festival of the year wraps up. Then it’s on to the fall’s next batch of big game releases. Yes, I’m talking about you <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p> <h2>PlayStation boss touts PS5 as Sony’s most lucrative gaming box yet</h2> <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was the keynote speaker at Tokyo Game Show 2025 and his topic was the PlayStation Store. Covering its evolution and current financial dominance, he flashed a chart showing how revenues have kept climbing with each new console. What’s interesting is that this is happening despite PS5 sales tracking only slightly ahead of the PS4. So where is the growth coming from? In part its the explosion in microtransactions in free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nishino-san says PlayStation 5 is the most successful generation in PlayStation history. <a href="https://t.co/E5feupYHGr">pic.twitter.com/E5feupYHGr</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1971034274536272100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also the expansion of subscription services like PS Plus. And then there’s the fact that people are still playing on PS4, so even though the install bases are similar, the overall footprint of active PlayStation players spending money is seemingly larger. Plus the consoles keep getting more expensive. With graphs like this, did Sony really need to raise the price of the PS5 another $50 nearly five years after it launched? Either way, it’s an interesting data point amid debates about console makers going platform-agnostic. Will PS6 just be a PC with a PlayStation logo on it, or is Sony, like Nintendo, married to the hardware business long-term?</p>

 <h2><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next 2D action game is out in November</h2>  <p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is Heart Machine’s first stab at the Metroidvania formula and arrives the same year its loot shooter, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, entered Early Access. There’s a new trailer showing off more of the game about a high school student who forms a pact with a demon to uncover the mystery behind a catastrophe that’s befallen Sanzu city. It’s out on PS5 and PC on November 11.</p>

 <h2>One of the last significant updates for <em>The Witcher 3</em> has been delayed</h2> <p>CD Projekt Red’s fantasy RPG was supposed to get cross-platform mod support across PC and consoles before the end of the year. The update will <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewitcher.com/post/3lzochplzqc2h">now arrive in 2026</a>, but with no clear window for when players can expect it. Once it finally arrives, PS5 and Xbox Series X players will finally get to experience all of the extra fan-made content modders created for the PC version.</p>

 <h2>Gearbox has some advice if <em>Borderlands 4</em> is running poorly for you <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">after the latest patch</a></h2> <p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1971285941194195311">blames some initial reports</a> of even worse performance following the new update on shader compilation. Basically, the game has to recompile all of the shaders again, which can mess things up while running in the background. “Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing,” the studio wrote on X. “If you’re still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer’s approved method.”</p>

 <p>One fan offered <a href="https://x.com/Ki11ersix/status/1971286391964434615">their own tip</a>: “quit the game once after launching and relaunch it. Now travel into a zone and back out (Idolator Sol’s or a Vault will work) this should compile a BUNCH of shaders and start improving the smoothness.” Big-budget gaming in 2025 folks!</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 9</em> looks pretty decent in first Switch 2 hands-ons</h2>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is the first game in the survival horror series to come day-and-date to a Nintendo platform. Early impressions seem to be that while the game looks and runs best on PC and high-end consoles, the Switch 2 version still performs admirably, especially in hand-held mode. So far both <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have both been better than expected on Nintendo’s new console. Hopefully other third-party ports can continue the trend.</p> <h2>A <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster will arrive eventually</h2> <p>Fans waiting for news on the status of the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em> got an update via a panel at Tokyo Game Show. According to <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">a translation by X user Kuwabara357</a><span>, it will still take a little longer for the next batch of games to get ported. “The project is moving forward properly, and we believe it’s shaping up to be something enjoyable really,” Konami producer Noriaki Okamura reportedly said. “So please wait just a bit more, more information is coming.”</span></p> <h2><em>Payday 2</em> dev apologizes for price-gouging fans</h2> <p>The<em> Payday 2</em> Infamous Collection bundle, which contains every piece of DLC the multiplayer heist shooter has ever received, recently jumped in price from $118 to $170. Starbreeze also announced a new $5-a-month subscription option for players to access all of it. Fans obviously thought the timing of this was a bit cynical.</p> <p>“The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch—and they’re not wrong, it’s terrible timing,” Starbreeze’s Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/starbreeze-says-sorry-reverses-price-increase-on-payday-2-dlc-bundle-we-definitely-didnt-handle-this-right/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We definitely didn’t handle this right, and we’ll be apologizing to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-leaves-nintendo-of-america-2000628868">Nintendo is shaking things up at Nintendo of America with the retirement of Bowser</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-israel-palestine-gaza-phone-calls-xbox-cloud-2000628764">Microsoft has taken the first step toward addressing the Xbox BDS boycott over Israel</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s open world take on Japan will be the game’s biggest map yet</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>One of the big upcoming first-party PlayStation Studios titles is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-is-returnal-developer-housemarques-new-game-starring-rahul-kohli/1100-6529469/" data-ref-id="1100-6529469">Saros</a>, the next game from developer Housemarque. A spiritual sequel to Returnal, Saros builds on the foundation of that roguelike action game and is described as the "ultimate evolution" of the company's approach to gameplay-first adventures. Here's everything we know about the game so far, ahead of its upcoming release in early 2026.</p><h2 id="When_will_Saros_be_released_">When will Saros be released?</h2><p>Housemarque has set a release window of March 20, 2026, for Saros.</p><h2 id="Preorder_Saros">Preorder Saros</h2><p>Preorders are not yet available for Saros.</p><h2 id="Saros_trailer">Saros trailer</h2><p>The first trailer for Saros was released during the February State of Play event--check it out below. The trailer spotlights the setting, tone, and story. We think it looks pretty great.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-uBOF0T2FY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S-uBOF0T2FY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="Saros_platforms">Saros platforms</h2><p>Saros will launch on PS5, but Housemarque hasn't mentioned a PC release yet. Its previous game, Returnal, did come to PC two years after it first arrived on PS5, and with Sony adopting a multiplatform release strategy, it's likely that Saros will eventually find its way to this platform in the future.</p><h2 id="Will_Saros_be_PS5_Pro_Enhanced_">Will Saros be PS5 Pro Enhanced?</h2><p>Creative director Gregory Louden did confirm during State of Play that Saros will be PS5 Pro-enhanced, although what those exact enhancements are remains to be seen. Housemarque makes some of the best-looking games around, with Returnal being one of the more graphically impressive games on PS5 when it first launched. If that game is any indication, you can probably expect some terrific monster designs and particle effects for days when Saros launches.</p><h2 id="Saros_story__setting__and_characters">Saros story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Set on the planet Carcosa, Saros puts you in the boots of Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer who ison the hunt for answers on this lost off-world colony that is currently caught in the shadow of a very ominous eclipse. Housemarque says that it has crafted a haunting story for the game, one full of nightmarish monsters judging by the teaser trailer.</p><p>The studio also added that the game will feature a grounded voice-over, cinematics, audio logs, and conversations with several non-playable characters. There are also Soltari Holograms detailing what happened on Carcosa as you explore the planet, and collecting them will reveal what exactly happened on that planet. Housemarque added that there'll also be more surreal and mysterious storytelling sequences, but it won't be sharing details on them just yet.</p><h2 id="A_familiar_face">A familiar face</h2><p>Your eyes are not deceiving you, that is indeed actor Rahul Kohli lending his voice and likeness to Devraj. According to Housemarque, the Midnight Mass actor delivers a "grounded" performance in Saros. "Every time the sun dies, madness reigns, then everything begins again. "But after every death, I <em>always</em> come back stronger," Devraj says in the trailer.</p><h2 id="Saros_gameplay">Saros gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQiQC16w86I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JQiQC16w86I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Saros looks to be a game where aggression pays off, as Arjun wears an advanced combat suit that gives him several enhanced abilities. Every time you start a run, you can select your loadout from a mix of Soltari human weaponry and Carcosan alien weaponry. The September 2025 State of Play deep dive showed Arjun wielding the Soltari Phosphorous Shotgun, a weapon that can melt through enemies.</p><p>The other big difference between Saros and Returnal is that Arjun can charge straight into danger, thanks to the Soltari Shield. By holding R1, Arjun can absorb the energy from lethal projectiles and charge up a Carcosan Power Weapon to hit hard. Essentially, you can harvest the attacks of your enemies and throw it right back at them. The catch here is that Power Weapons also transform Arjun's right arm into an eclipse-fueled weapon, corrupting him in the process. It's a double-edged sword, but one that he can swing to gain an edge in combat.</p><p>If Arjun does fall in battle, he will have a "second chance" to cheat death and get right back into the thick of things. After discovering how to use eclipse corruption energy to rise back up on first death, Arjun can come back stronger and future runs will give him the option to upgrade his Soltari advanced combat suit and abilities.</p><p>"After every death you will face a changed world, but in Saros you will be able to choose and permanently upgrade your loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades to 'come back stronger' to overcome the challenges you face on Carcosa," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/announcing-saros-the-next-game-from-housemarque-coming-2026/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Housemarque explained</a>.</p><h2 id="Saros_screenshots">Saros screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443632-saros-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443632" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443632-saros-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443632"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443632-saros-6.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443633-saros-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443634-saros-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443635-saros-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443636-saros-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443637-saros-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443633,1300-4443634,1300-4443635,1300-4443636,1300-4443637" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443633-saros-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443634-saros-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443635-saros-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443636-saros-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443637-saros-5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443633-saros-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443634-saros-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443635-saros-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443636-saros-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443637-saros-5.jpg"></figure>

The update doesn't fix everything, though, and now developer Gearbox has given players some advice about how to addresses ongoing stability issues.</p><p>The developer said it's aware of players experiencing stuttering issues following installation of the new update, impacting performance. This is due to shader compilation that's occurring in the background during gameplay, which it said should clear up after 15 minutes of "continuous play." That's an unusual note, as shader compilation is typically handled during start-up, before you begin playing, in order to avoid just these sorts of issues.If the stuttering doesn't clear up after 15 minutes, Gearbox advised clearing your shader cache, which is a process specific to your graphics card's manufacturer.</p>

      </div>
<p>The technical issues with Borderlands 4 prompted Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">post through it</a>, but he's since moved on to <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1970925490556002363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting a lot about the upcoming Now You See Me movie sequel</a>. Pitchford contributed to the magic elements of the movie and says he was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-more-involvement-now-you-see-me-borderlands-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more involved with that film that the Borderlands movie.</a></p><p>The September 25 patch for Borderlands 4 also added an FOV slider on console, which is something fans had asked for (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-notes-add-fov-slider-on-console-stability-and-performance-improvements-and-more/1100-6535022/" data-ref-id="1100-6535022">and something that can reduce performance</a>). The patch also made some balance changes to Vault Hunters, and even more are coming in another update that's planned for next week.</p><p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">Switch 2 edition has been delayed indefinitely and all digital preorders are being refunded.</a> Gearbox delayed the game to help add more polish and to support cross-saves.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4 review</a> and our roundup of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/" data-ref-id="1100-6533833">all the Shift codes.</a></p>

                <p>Despite heaps of critical praise at launch, Square Enix revealed in investor briefings that 2024's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/1100-6526552/" data-ref-id="1100-6526552">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth did not meet sales expectations</a>.

Quite literally, too, as the game is performing well on PC, which will allows the team to do the third installment justice.</p>

<p>"The second entry, FFVII Rebirth, has been doing very well on both PS5 and PC," he said. "I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we'll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third installment."</p><p>Hamaguchi couldn't give specifics about the game or its name--since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-438559">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Part 3 is currently referred to as just that for now--however, he did tell Automaton that development is progressing smoothly.</p><p>“Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely," he said. "A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything."</p><p>As reported by IGN, Hamaguchi told German outlet <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/hamaguchi-ueber-das-schluesselwort-zum-dritten-teil-der-remake-trilogie-zu-final-fantasy-vii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JPGames</a> on September 25 that this third and final entry in the Remake trilogy will be a "suitable finale."</p><p>"In terms of development [of Part 3], we're working on that right now," he said. "We've got builds running where you can actually experience what that theme is through the gameplay. And we know where we're going with it. It's looking like it's going in the right direction, and we'll keep working on it and make it even better. So hopefully in the near future we'll be able to reveal some of that. And yeah, this is going to be the climax, the finale of the series. And we're going to make it a suitable finale, a really great send-off for the game. It will be something ideally we hope will please fans, will delight the fans of this much-loved series, and really reward everyone for sticking with us to the end. So look forward to that. More information in the not too distant future. It's all in safe hands!"</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launched on February 29, 2024, to rave reviews from fans and critics alike, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">GameSpot's review</a> scoring it an 8/10.

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The president of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) has signed a ban on loot boxes for under 18s into law. This ban is set to go into effect in March 2026.</p>
<p>This ban comes as part of <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2025/lei/L15211.htm">a wider digital protection law</a> aimed at protecting young people from abuse and exploitation online. Chapter seven of the law focused on electronic games prohibits loot boxes aimed at children or adolescents for games without an 18+ age rating.</p>
<p>In addition, the law requires games that are likely to have adolescents interact with other people through text, audio, or video messages to adhere to <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2024/Lei/L14852.htm#art16">legal safeguards.</a> These include a report system, information on the progress of said reports, and instruments to request review and reconsideration of imposed penalties.</p>

<p>Debates surrounding a loot box ban have been widespread and global for years now. Back in 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dutch-political-parties-back-gaming-loot-box-ban">Dutch political parties backed a loot box ban</a>, however after some deliberation there was no outright ban. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43906306">Loot boxes were declared illegal in Belgium back in 2018</a>, though in the following years<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-study-claims-belgiums-loot-box-law-isnt-being-enforced"> it's become clear this hasn't been strictly enforced</a>. The UK has slapped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-jagex-and-miniclip-broke-loot-box-advertising-rules">some game companies on the wrist due to not declaring loot boxes in advertisements</a>, but a ban has been far from reach.</p><p>As such, this Brazilian ban for under 18s is a big step forward for those against loot boxes, putting up barriers between what many consider gambling mechanics and younger people. It's been a long time coming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brazilian-authorities-to-investigate-loot-boxes">with investigations into loot boxes starting in 2021</a>. There remain two larger questions: will clear age ratings for games actually prevent young people from buying loot boxes in games they want, and will this law's implementation in a strong market for video games influence change in the industry at large?</p>

		<p>Krafton are teaming up with YouTube series Skibidi Toilet, pitting players against an invasion of sentient toilets. That’s a thing, it’s live now in PUBG Mobile and will launch on PC and consoles later in October.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG MOBILE X Skibidi Toilet | Collaboration Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEWqww6iCK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you are unaware of Skibidi Toilet, it was a viral short-form series “that has expanded into a global franchise spanning animation, consumer products, publishing, gaming, and more.” It has not, however, reached the part of South London I am currently working from, so here’s more from the press release as I have no bloody idea about Skibidi Toilet, it looks very silly.</p>
<p>“Set in an alternate reality, the series follows humanity’s struggle against the Skibidi Toilets, a powerful alien species of mechanized toilet hybrids. Their only hope lies with the Alliance, a coalition of humanoid warriors with cameras, speakers, and TV screens for heads,” say Krafton.</p>
<p>“The new Arcade mode will be available for two weeks on PC and consoles, where players take on the role of the Alliance to defend the world against the powerful Skibidi Toilets and Astro Toilets in a PvE boss battle,” they add. “Through the Event Pass, players can also unlock Alliance-themed outfits inspired by the Skibidi Toilet universe.”</p>

<p>You may be surprised to learn that sentient shitters have a long history of antagonising gamers, the elderly amongst you may recall being chased by munching water closets in the seminal 1984 classic, Jet Set Willy. They have been more useful in recent years with the crappers in Suda 51’s No More Heroes doubling up as a save point whenever you decide to do a number two.</p>
<p>In 2022 an entire horror game was set in a public bathroom, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCrw10P2hA8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Toilet Chronicles</a>. It has a “very Positive” rating on Steam although most comments are along the lines of “What the hell did I just play?”</p>

<p>If you're excited to dive deep into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a> on 30th October, well, you'll be able to do that quite literally, as Square Enix has shown off a brand new region, added to Dragon Quest II specifically, in this remake (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-details-new-content-seabed">Gematsu</a>!).</p>
<p>The Seabed is (as you'd expect) an underwater region that you'll be able to access as soon as you get the boat. And it's here where you'll meet the merfolk, who live in the aptly-named Mersea. But there's no time to relax, as they're being threatened by monsters.</p>
<p>There are new dungeons and enemies to encounter, including Mariella, who is one of Hargon's (the big bad, in case you're new to DQII) Champions.</p>
<p>New story content will also be part of this new region; yesterday, during the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/roundup-all-the-reveals-from-the-xbox-showcase-at-tokyo-game-show-2025">Xbox Tokyo Game Show Showcase</a>, producer Haysaka Masaaki shared a small snippet of gameplay from the Seabed, which you can watch up-top.</p>


<p>We've been getting a lot of DQ I&amp;II news lately, which makes sense given that the game is out next month. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-trailer-showcases-the-remakes-fresh-features">Square Enix gave us a little peak at some other new content</a>, and this is where the Seabed was last teased. It was also shown off briefly during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x60H0alsB5w">Nintendo Direct on 12th September in Japan</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Now that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">is out and in players' hands</a>, besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/">another Metal Gear Solid game being remade</a>, what players are looking for next from Konami, is Vol. 2 of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection.</p>



<p>Which is why it wasn't a surprise that during the Metal Gear Production Hotline at Tokyo Game Show 2025, the topic of where Vol. 2 is and when we'll get to see it came up. Translated by <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">X (formerly Twitter) user Kuwabara357</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/">VGC</a>), series producer Noriaki Okamura stepped up to be the one to try and satisfy players curiosity, but could unfortunately only add that Konami is still working on it.</p>



<p>"<em>It has certainly taken quite a while now,</em>" Okamura began. "<em>Since we called the first installment 'Vol.1,' it's only natural to expect a second one, and that's what we said years ago.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But, as we've repeated several times, we are making it. We've been working on it properly while also producing Metal Gear Solid Delta. At the right timing, we'd like to share with you all not only about its progress but also the direction going forward. I'm sorry, it feels like I always have to say this, but please wait just a little longer. How long 'a little longer' actually means, well, it's hard to say.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But the project is moving forward properly, and we believe it's shaping up to be something enjoyable really. So please, wait just a bit more, more information is coming</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Vol. 1 of the Master Collection <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-release-october/">launched almost two years ago at the time of this writing</a>, and though, as Okamura points out, Konami has previously confirmed that a Vol. 2 is in the works, we've heard next to nothing about it, and which games will be included in the collection.</p>



<p>We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">seen rumours pointing to</a> Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain being the three games in the collection, but nothing concrete. If those are indeed the three titles going to be included, then it's not difficult for fans of the series to understand why Konami is taking its time with Vol. 2. </p>



<p>It's no small task to untangle MGS4 from the PlayStation 3's CELL architecture, which it was initially made on, and then improve it in all the ways players would expect from a game that's 17 years old now running on modern console and PC hardware. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-latest-updates-bring-major-performance-improvements-for-metal-gear-solid-4-red-dead-redemption-and-persona-5/">RPCS3 figured out how to get MGS4 running on a PC years ago</a>. If they can do it, surely Konami can. </p>

"I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we’ll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third instalment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The concern revolved around the suggestion that the scope of Part 3 might have been scaled back as a result of Rebirth's disappointing profits. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-failing-meet-expectations-launch-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-shoots-no3-us-charts-with-steam-debut">But Rebirth has enjoyed a comeback of sorts after debuting strongly on PC via Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi also took the opportunity to assure the community that development on Final Fantasy 7 Part 3 is going "extremely well," adding: "The game is shaping up nicely. A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy  since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal was to see it launch by 2027</u></a>. Excitement for the third and final chapter in the trilogy grew even more when the team revealed that it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix"><u>completed its story earlier this year</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And though he was still being a little coy with the details, in a separate interview with German outlet <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/hamaguchi-ueber-das-schluesselwort-zum-dritten-teil-der-remake-trilogie-zu-final-fantasy-vii/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JPGames</u></a>, Hamaguchi revealed that the "key words [...] that underpin the design philosophy and then the theme for each game" were "reunion" for Remake, and "bonds" for Rebirth. The third instalment also has a key term, but Hamaguchi's keeping that to himself for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of development [of Part 3], we’re working on that right now," he added. "We’ve got builds running where you can actually experience what that theme is through the gameplay. And we know where we’re going with it. It’s looking like it’s going in the right direction, and we’ll keep working on it and make it even better. So hopefully in the near future we’ll be able to reveal some of that. </p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"And yeah, this is going to be the climax, the finale of the series.

It will be something ideally we hope will please fans, will delight the fans of this much-loved series, and really reward everyone for sticking with us to the end. So look forward to that. More information in the not too distant future. It’s all in safe hands!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Co-director Tetsuya Nomura similarly acknowledge he'd heard the cries for updates on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a> earlier this month, and happily reported that development was “progressing really smoothly.” While we wait, you can read up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-we-will-not-cheat-with-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-airship"><u>why the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 team “will not cheat” when it comes to Final Fantasy 7’s iconic airship</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

The tech experts at Digital Foundry have said their <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</u></a> showed significant stutter problems, and advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding to the increased stutter issues reported by PC gamers, Gearbox issued a statement on social media, below, calling on players to give the looter shooter 15 minutes of gameplay to continue to compile shaders in the background, by which time those stuttering issues should resolve. If that doesn’t work, Gearbox suggested manually clearing your shader cache via your video card manufacturer’s approved method. And, if all else fails, Gearbox pointed to its support ticket process.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We've received reports that some players are experiencing reduced stability after downloading today's update.</p><p>Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing.

At least, that’s the running theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox’s latest statement echoes previous advice it issued on Steam that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me read like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.” This latest advice reads much the same to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, some players are recommending traveling to certain zones in the game to brute force shaders to compile before moving on to what they actually want to do in-game. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To expand on this: quit the game once after launching and relaunch it.

<p>Reader, at the time, it was the end of the world.</p>
<p>I was on this plane on 5th September, a mere 24 hours after finally getting my hands on Silksong — one of my most-anticipated games <em>ever</em>. I had put maybe three hours into it the day before, but I was saving myself for the big flight because, well, I'm pretty terrified of air travel and there's nothing like a bit of bug depression to take your mind off being in a pressurised tin can, thousands of feet in the air.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that I decided to bravely soldier and play the damn game regardless. I knew how sound worked in Pharloom at this point, and I knew that it would probably hurt my exploration as a consequence of being without it. But my options were to plough on sans headphones, or read the safety information booklet for the eleventh time and do some breathing exercises.</p>
<p>I returned to my save file and prepared myself for four hours of non-ideal playtime. Three steps into the rainy streets of Greymoor, and all of my stresses dissipated. Why? Because Team Cherry knows how to rumble. HD Rumble, that is.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1bb206182b5d0"><a title="Silksong Rumble" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1bb206182b5d0/silksong-rumble.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As my beloved Hornet stepped out from the area's initial cover and into the downpour, I felt the faint pitter-patter of the drops rumbling in my Joy-Con. Of course, HD Rumble 2 itself is far from news to me — yeah, I paid attention in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> — but these raindrops immediately drew my attention to it in a way that I hadn't noticed it on the console so far.</p>
<p>It wasn't the big buzz I felt when getting punched by a Pilgrim Groveller or Binding that made me perk up and pay attention to the rumble, but these tiny, inconsequential raindrops. Why? Because I hadn't even noticed it was raining in the area.</p>
<p>Without the distraction of sound, I suddenly became acutely aware of how HD Rumble 2 was being used to tell me something I might have otherwise missed. It's easy to tell when a pesky Pharlid is going to pop up from underground once you learn the rumble that announces its arrival. Likewise, that one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/i-have-no-words-silksong-fans-are-losing-their-minds-over-one-bench">nasty trap bench</a> in Hunter's March is far easier avoided if you feel for the click of the spikes before they come swinging down.</p>
<p>Pleasantly pleased with my discovery, I started dashing around Pharloom, taking great joy in the initial <em>BZZT</em> and ensuing mini-<em>bzzts</em> that mark Hornet's initial boost and subsequent speedy steps. I might have been missing out on the odd map thanks to my inability to hear Shakra's singing, but I was exploring in a whole new way.</p>

<p>My tactile travels led me to the Chapel of the Beast in Hunters March, where a series of ever-growing vibrations signposted that something very big and very scary was stomping about inside. As all those who have ventured into this area can attest, there is indeed something very big and very scary inside, and I only wish that I had listened to the intensity of the rumble and taken it as a message to <em>steer clear</em>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I kept on playing in such a manner, guiding my movements via the rumble. The big boss at the end of Act 1 was a pain in the butt, but my soundless attempts would have taken me days was it not for the gradually-increasing rumble letting me know when an off-screen shock attack was heading my way.</p>
<p>Before I had a chance to feel even more like Aragorn tracking an army of Uruk-hai by placing my palm to the ground and feeling out the footsteps, the plane landed and I packed my Switch away.</p>
<p>I had a lovely holiday, thanks for asking. It was mainly spent reading books in the sun and trying to think about anything other than the dark depths of Pharloom. But, rest assured, I made a point to charge my headphones for the flight back.</p>
<p>There's no denying it; the Silksong soundscape is <em>fantastic</em>. Larkin's strings have damn near brought me to tears on several occasions, I grin like a fool whenever I hear Shakra's "Ooshka-ah-aah-ro, kai-lai-lai-lai, ooshka-ro", and the singe of heat or chill of cold comes with its own little aural pang that really sells the '<em>I need to move right now</em>'. I wouldn't want to play the game in its entirety without it, but good grief, it's <em>still</em> a wild ride for those brave enough to reach for the mute button.</p>
<p>So go on, take those headphones out, turn the volume down to zero, or otherwise plug your ears up for a second and take a quick tour around the rumbling roads of Pharloom. Trust me, it's not a feeling to be missed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo of America president and COO Doug Bowser (yes, really) has announced he will step down from the company at the end of the year, and his replacement has already been appointed by the Japanese gaming giant.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Bowser, who has spent "more than a decade in multiple leadership positions" at Nintendo, will retire from the studio on December 31st. He'll be replaced by current marketing executive VP Devon Pritchard, who will also be joining the NOA board of directors.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo's American division will gain Satoru Shibata as its CEO, although he'll be continuing to serve as managing exec and corporate director of Nintendo as a whole as well. That's a heck of a lot of plates to juggle.</p>

<p>Fils-Aime was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-inducted-into-video-game-hall-of-fame" rel="nofollow">inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame</a> in October that same year, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-joins-gamestops-board-of-directors" rel="nofollow">join GameStop's board of directors</a> shortly before the pandemic began (and around ten months before the whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-stock-trading-halted-due-to-sudden-spike" rel="nofollow">GameStop stock debacle</a> kicked off).</p>

<p>Bowser hasn't revealed what he's intending to do next, but he did express pride in what he'd achieved during his time with Nintendo, "in both business results and the experience we've created for consumers".</p>

<p>He also praised his replacement, Devon Pritchard, calling her "exceptional" and pointing to her promotion as "a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to [Nintendo's] growth".</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Bowser does next, but given the way corporate America works, I'd be very surprised indeed if we don't see him popping up on another board of directors somewhere. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lots of awesome games came out this year from <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to <em>Blue Prince</em> to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. <em>Silent Hill f</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> just dropped along with the 1.0 release of <em>Hades 2</em>. If you want to play all of these plus all the other cool stuff that came out in 2025&nbsp;<em>and</em> hang onto all of your other games, you may want to expand your storage. Over the past decade or longer, game file sizes have really started to balloon larger and larger. Some titles even clock in over 100GB. So get yourself a solid internal SSD like the Kingston NV3 drive. It’s available in sizes up to 4TB and is currently on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">Breaking down the different models and discounts, let’s start with the smallest. Kingston has 500GB option for its Gen 4×4 SSD</a>. That one normally goes for $54, but it’s now down to just $39 — saving you $15. Going up, we have the 1TB model. That’s usually $80, but the sale has it to just $58 — a savings of $22. The 2TB is $43 off, bringing it from&nbsp; $158 to just $115. Then lastly we have the massive 4TB model going for $230. That’s a $91 discount off of the starting price of $320. All discounts work out to between 27-28%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Load Times</h2>
<p>The Kingston NV3 SSD has remarkable read and write speeds, coming in at up to 6,000 MB/s for read speeds and up to 5,000 MB/s for write speeds. That means quick load times in all your games. Hope you’re good at them because you’ll have hardly any time to read those quick tips that appear while waiting for levels to load. Those speeds will also help with plenty of non-gaming tasks ranging from video editing to working with large datasets — really any kind of hardware intensive workflow.</p>
<p>Check the specs of what you’re looking to install it on. So long as your laptop, tower, or mini PC has support for PCle 4.0, you’ll be good to go.</p>



<p>If you’re not a PC gamer and are instead looking to expand to storage of your PlayStation 5, it is compatible but with a catch. You will have to separately pick up a heatsink. These little metal casings are used to help dissipate heat to prevent overheating. They’re pretty easy to install into your PS5. You can just follow any number of video tutorials on YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">For a limited time, you can save up to $91 on this internal SSD from Kingston</a>. Choose between four different capacities, starting at just $39.</p>
