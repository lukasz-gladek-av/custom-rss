<p>Marvel Rivals competitive players have been embracing the triple-strategist meta, but the devs are not letting it dominate the higher ranks thanks to some upcoming nerfs. The new <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1891880359345950886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>, which will go in effect at the start of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 second half</a>, shouldn’t kill the triple-strategist meta, but will make it less “oppressive.”</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-loki-other-strategists-to-receive-ultimate-nerfs">Cloak &amp; Dagger, Loki, Other Strategists to Receive Ultimate Nerfs</h2>



<p>The triple-strategist meta has become very popular in competitive Marvel Rivals play. With three characters providing healing and support, vanguards (tanks) can absorb far more damage, making it hard to slow down attacking teams during convoy games. However, the devs have noted concerns that characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki can charge their ultimate abilities really quickly. Because of this, teams running triple-initiator always seem to have an ultimate ready to counter one from an opposing duelist or vanguard.</p>



<p>In the Season 1 mid-season update, the energy costs for “frequent ultimates” like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki’s will be increased. Certain ultimates will also receive targeted nerfs, and the devs have explicitly stated that Cloak &amp; Dagger will be one of the recipients. Further more, some vanguards and duelists such as Venom and Magik will also get a lower energy cost to their ultimates, allowing them to be used more frequently.</p>



<p>These changes will go hand-in-hand with some more announced hero balance changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced survivability of Doctor Strange and Magneto</li>



<li>Buffs to movement-based vanguards (likely Captain America and Venom)</li>



<li>Nerfs to Storm and Moon Knight (reducing buffs from start of Season 1)</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The game’s lead combat designer said the goal is not to get rid of playstyles like the triple-strategist meta, but only to encourage other playstyles and provide an appropriate amount of counterplay opportunities. These changes will officially go into effect when the second half of Season 1 begins on February 21.</p>

<p>When Shuhei Yoshida stepped down as president of SIE Worldwide Studios to lead indie games in 2019, it wasn’t something he outright chose to do. In fact, Yoshida only had two options: go lead a the new initiative with indies or leave PlayStation altogether.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida said that despite only having the one option, it was something he was still excited to do.</p>



<p>“Moving from first-party to indies? Well, I had no choice,” Yoshida said. “When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company. </p>



<p>“But I felt very strongly about the state of PlayStation and indies. I really wanted to do this. I believed I could do something unique for that purpose.”</p>



<p>Yoshida said that moving from first-party games  to indies was a bigger challenge for him than ultimately leaving the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year after 31 years</a>. He said that he feels lucky that the indie community felt like he could help their growth on PlayStation.</p>



<p>“I became an adviser for some of these companies,” he said. “I’m continuing to work with some of the indie publishers and developers I respect. The transition out of Sony to becoming an independent adviser is less of a change than moving out of first-party.”</p>



<p>Following up on that statement, Yoshida said that will continue to work with indies despite no longer being with PlayStation. He says that he loves working with younger, talented developers who “come up with amazing games every year.”</p>



<p>“Every year when you come to one of these events, a couple of the nominees for game of the year are indies,” he said. “They’re bringing something exciting to the industry. It’s a lot of fun. That’s my dream job, to be able to help them.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshida saying he either took the indie leadership position or left PlayStation in 2019?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-channels-the-spirit-of-a-forgotten-god-of-war-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This past weekend saw the first round of network tests for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, the upcoming standalone multiplayer game spun out of FromSoftware’s magnum opus. Unlike last year’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, Nightreign resembles Elden Ring in name and appearance only, trading its parent game’s open world structure for a streamlined survival format in which three-player teams have to drop into gradually shrinking maps to fight off groups of enemies and increasingly challenging bosses. It’s a design that undoubtedly suggests the developers were inspired by the hugely popular Fortnite – unsurprising, considering Epic’s battle royale has been enjoyed by no less than 200 million players this month alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Nightreign bears an even greater resemblance to another game, one not nearly as famous and much more disliked: 2013’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ascension">God of War: Ascension</a>. And that’s a good thing. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/god-of-war-ascension-1739888453295.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Sony Santa Monica / Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Released between 2010’s God of War 3 and 2018’s Norse-flavored God of War reboot, Ascension was a prequel set before the original Greek mythology trilogy that followed Kratos as he tried to break his oath with his soon-to-be-predecessor, Aries. Unable to live up to the initial trilogy’s epic finale, and fueling desire to shake up a tried-and-tested formula, God of War: Ascension quickly became known as the black sheep of the franchise. A half-decent appetizer to an amazing main course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an understandable reputation, but also unfair. Although Kratos’ confrontation with the Furies in Ascension obviously didn’t reach the same heights as his five-stage fight with Zeus, this divisive prequel still had some truly jaw-dropping set-pieces, including the Prison of the Damned, a labyrinthine dungeon carved into the skin and bones of an immobilized, 100-armed giant. But, more importantly, Ascension also deserves credit for trying something the franchise had not done before, and hasn’t since: multiplayer. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Trial of the Gods, is cooperative PvE. And also basically Elden Ring Nightreign. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you make your way through the Prison of the Damned in Ascension’s story, you encounter a chained up NPC who lets out a premature “You saved me!” before being crushed by the level’s boss. Open up the multiplayer mode after reaching this point in the campaign and you’ll find this same NPC is now your player character. Having been teleported to Olympus seconds before your demise, you must pledge allegiance to one of four gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, or Aries – each of whom will provide you with unique weapons, armor pieces, and magic attacks. These are the tools with which you wage war across five different multiplayer modes, four of which are competitive PvP.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fifth mode, Trial of the Gods, is cooperative PvE. And also basically Elden Ring Nightreign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay previews of Nightreign posted ahead of the network tests by prominent “Soulsborne” YouTubers like VaatiyVidya and Iron Pineapple, as well <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-first-impressions-of-the-network-test-build">IGN’s own coverage</a>, have revealed the similarities between FromSoftware’s latest and live service games like Fortnite. Much like those games, Nightreign offers a cocktail of randomized loot, resource management, and environmental hazards that damage a player’s health and limit their area of movement, making runs more challenging as they go on. Nightreign even pays homage to one of Fortnite’s most iconic images, having players drop into the level from the sky, taxied by spirit birds to a position of their choosing. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/eldenring-nightreign-01-4k-1734054366417.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find any “where are we dropping?” action in God of War: Ascension, but go beyond Nightreign’s battle royale-like surface and you’ll find much more common ground. Both Nightreign and Ascension’s Trial of the Gods mode are co-op experiences where teams of two or more face increasingly tougher foes. Both grant players the unexpected but welcome opportunity to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse">take on bosses from previous games</a>, be they Hercules from God of War 3 or the Nameless King from Dark Souls 3. Both have a countdown (although Ascension’s can be paused by defeating enemies) and both take place on maps that are either small or shrinking. And both are multiplayer games developed by studios known for their well-crafted single-player experiences, and were made without oversight from their series’ creators; Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki is working on an as of yet unknown project, while the directors of the original God of War trilogy – David Jaffe, Cory Barlog, and Stig Asmussen – had all left Sony Santa Monica at the time of Ascension’s creation to pursue opportunities elsewhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Above all, Nightreign appears to evoke the same response from players as Ascension’s Trial of the Gods did. Those who participated in FromSoftware’s network test invariably describe their runs as a frantic and exhilarating race against the clock. In contrast to the comparatively cozy vibes of the base game, where players are able to tackle every scenario in a variety of ways, using a variety of weapons and abilities and taking all the time they need, Nightreign forces players to act on instinct by picking up the pace and limiting their resources – constraints that, in <a href="https://youtu.be/7xjW5oGlcUM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VaatiVidya’s words</a>, were “made in the name of speed and efficiency.” To make up for the absence of Torrent, for instance, players now channel their inner spirit horse, being able to run faster and jump higher. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ascension’s multiplayer adjusted its single player blueprint for the sake of tighter pacing, using similar techniques to those adopted by Nightreign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascension’s multiplayer also adjusted its single player blueprint for the sake of tighter pacing, and even used similar techniques to those adopted by Nightreign: it increased the player’s run speed, extended their jumps, automated parkour, and provided them with a grapple attack they could use to pull objects towards them (a mechanic also used by Nightreign’s Wylder character). New moves like this are a lifesaver, because while the combat isn’t too difficult on its own – what with the franchise being a power fantasy and all – Trial of the Gods throws so many enemies at you that every second counts. As a result, you and your teammate find yourselves sprinting around like hungry wolves, or terminators, or, well, Kratoses, hacking and slashing your way through armies without calculated ruthlessness. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign’s resemblance to Ascension is unexpected not only because much of the latter has been forgotten, but also because the Soulslike genre Elden Ring is part of essentially started out as God of War’s complete antithesis. Where one lets you pretend to be a warrior so powerful he can kill literal gods, the other turns you into a nameless, accursed undead for whom even regular enemies pose a considerable challenge. One rarely shows its game over screen, the other beats you over the head with it until you start crying, laughing, and crying again.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet this challenge, so utterly rage-inducing in FromSoftware’s earlier games, has gradually decreased in recent years as fans “got good” and developers provided them with better weapons and spells, culminating in the numerous game-breaking builds that have been put together since Elden Ring launched. Without access to these builds, Nightreign promises to reintroduce a degree of challenge. At the same time, those that have indeed gotten good will be able to enjoy the same thing God of War: Ascension offered: the chance to feel like a vengeful Spartan short on time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

                <p>It's been over 5 years since Rare's in-development project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-everything-we-know/1100-6503918/" data-ref-id="1100-6503918">Everwild</a> was announced by Xbox, and details have been thin on the ground ever since. In a recent interview, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said that Everwild is proceeding well.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/16/xboxera-podcast-episode-250/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>, Spencer mentioned a few games in passing that he's excited for. Everwild was one of those games, with Spencer confirming that Rare is making "progress" on the project. "I do think the work that Double Fine's doing and how [Double Fine founder Tim Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team," Spencer said in part. "And the other one, I'll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Spencer also mentioned State of Decay 3 as part of the same section, with the Xbox boss calling the series "one that I love." Later in the interview, Spencer said that studios like Rare are allowed more time to make long-in-the-oven games like Everwild because Xbox's current slate is already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-has-more-games-slated-for-ps5-this-year-than-sony-so-far/1100-6529489/" data-ref-id="1100-6529489">packed with games</a>. He also indicated that the next studio he's going to visit is The Coalition, the stewards of the Gears of War franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Everwild is one of those "missing games" that it's easy to forget about, given that it was first announced in 2019, even before the start of the current console generation. A 2022 report suggests that the project was internally rebooted following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-boss-resigns-from-rare-marking-another-high-profile-xbox-departure/1100-6483926/" data-ref-id="1100-6483926">the departure</a> of the game's creative director Simon Woodroffe back in 2020. Everwild's current director is Gregg Mayles, a Rare veteran who worked on games like Sea of Thieves, Viva Pinata, and Banjo-Kazooie. We still have no word on a potential release date for Everwild.</p>

In this preview build, players will have the chance to experience six heroes (two Tanks, two DPS – including a new DPS, Tariq, and two Healers) that will be in Fellowship's roster, go on dungeon runs (both Ranked Dungeons and Quick Play Dungeons), take on challenging enemies and acquire epic loot.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Public Playtest, Wccftech was invited for a private play session with the developers. The best analogy really is dungeons from massively multiplayer online roleplaying games (MMORPGs), played after selecting a roster of predefined heroes, each in a specific role of the so-called Holy Trinity (Tank/DPS/Healer). Fellowship strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like. The replayability is also enhanced by Curses, which are gameplay modifiers on the dungeons that are mechanical extra layers that you have to deal with, and these keep rotating for each difficulty and each dungeon you do.</p>
<p>As someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time on MMORPGs, the core concept definitely has a lot of merit. However, I found the execution lacking, mainly because it sticks way too closely to what MMORPGs have been doing for over twenty years. I'm referring particularly to the tab-target combat system, which felt very static and somehow even worse than World of Warcraft's in this regard. The dungeon mechanics I've seen, while introductory, are interesting; but it won't be enough if the combat itself is too stale. In short, yes, I would have attempted action combat, or at least a hybrid system like those featured in games like Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>The graphics are also not at all impressive for a game that's made with Unreal Engine 5. It obviously follows the Blizzard mandate to deliver stylized graphics and ensure maximum compatibility, but one thing's for sure, you won't be playing Fellowship because of its visuals.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's my conversation with Chief Rebel during the play session. The studio was established in 2018 by developers who previously worked on games like World of Warcraft, Diablo, Helldivers, Battlefield, Tom Clancy's The Division, Just Cause, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fellowship Preview Gameplay + Developer Commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4Y_IlJfaow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What's the core premise behind your game?</strong></p>
<p>In many MMOs, this high-complexity PVE content is gated behind hundreds of hours of leveling up. We want to make sure that Fellowship is approachable for newer players and something quick to jump in for veterans.</p>
<p><strong>I see there's a kill score count. Can you explain what it does?</strong></p>
<p>The kill score kind of totals the amount of enemies that we should kill in a dungeon run, so we can't just find some clever route to skip to the bosses. If you hit M on your keyboard, by mousing over enemies on the map, you can kind of see what percentage of the kill score they fill. As a tank who's kind of leading the direction we're going, I can pick out which routes I want lead the party through. But you have to fill the kill score to 100% and kill all the bosses to complete the dungeon, but there's a lot more enemies than 100% in the dungeon.</p>
<p>The intention is, especially when you get to the higher tier and the leaderboard chasing, part of the strategy is finding a good route through the dungeon, what paths should the party skip, what are more dangerous or maybe worth taking, even though they're dangerous using pull downs and all that.</p>
<p>When the timer gets turned on, then you also have to beat the dungeon within the timer to get to the next difficulty, but you're still gonna get all the loot that you would get from the dungeon, regardless of whether you beat the timer. We don't activate the timer until difficulty 4, though.</p>
<p><strong>I assume the timer is going to be a key factor in climbing the leaderboard.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. The timer affects the score as well, so when players start to get to the really high difficulties, it's gonna be a matter of practically milliseconds to determine who's number one on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>By the way, as you can see on the left, we have all kinds of metrics for players to look at just to be able to see how they are improving and how different talents or stats on their gear is affecting their damage or damage mitigation or healing.</p>
<p>You can see each of us there above the action bar. You see our health bars (I'm the purple dude), and you can see on the damage meter how we're doing on that damage, and then, if you mouse over those, you can actually view a breakdown of what abilities are contributing to your damage.</p>
<p>This is also really important if you're going to get into optimizing your gameplay and being competitive and learning how to complete dungeons at really high difficulty, but it's not as important when starting out because, of course, we tune the game to be very forgiving in the beginning.</p>
<p>One of the barriers for a lot of players in some of these types of games is stuff like the DPS meter isn't built into these MMOs. It's something that you have to go online and search for and you gotta download add-ons and all that. As a player trying to find your role in the community, it can be a bit difficult to find your footing.</p>
<p>So, we don't really have any intentions of allowing player-made addons in Fellowship. Instead, we want to make sure that we're providing everything that veteran players want and expect in the game itself to ensure a level playing field for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Aren't you worried about online toxicity? Some MMORPGs have tried to move away from DPS meters mainly because of that issue.</strong></p>
<p>I think that toxicity is always something that there's work to do with. I think that the solution is not to remove the ability for players to understand how to get better. I mean, there's different types of games. In some, your performance doesn't really matter, but in a game where your performance matters, you need to have information to be able to know what to change to improve, or you'll just start to hit your head against the wall.</p>
<p>If there's any kind of competitiveness, just removing data, I don't think that's the solution. I think that needs to be worked with in other ways. We're trying to find lots of other ways of getting ahead of that as well.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have all kinds of metrics for players to look at just to be able to see how they are improving and how different talents or stats on their gear is affecting their damage or damage mitigation or healing.

<p><strong>How do you plan on dealing with the 'meta' situation in your game?</strong></p>
<p>In a lot of the MMOs or games where you're playing with a group, inevitably, a meta is going to be established. One of the reasons why you may choose one character or one class over another is because they have a utility ability that's really important to have at high levels of difficulty. In Fellowship, we've moved a lot of those big utility skills like mass dispel to equippable items that you unlock in higher difficulties so that anyone can bring a battle resurrection or a dispel or stuff like that to a party.</p>
<p>One thing you might notice as well is that we're trying to look into how we can handle some nonverbal communications. If you target one of these buccaneers and you hit V on the keyboard, you'll put your hero portrait next to their name. If you put your marker up and interrupt the enemy, you can see when we interrupt ours, meaning you'll know the cooldown on our interrupt skills so we can more easily manage the cooldowns of the whole group. This is another example where, at low difficulties, interrupting is not that important, but when you start to get to very high difficulties, not interrupting might get you one-shotted. So, it's really important for players to be able to coordinate and work together to ensure they have all the interrupts ready.</p>
<p><strong>How many skills is each hero going to offer?</strong></p>
<p>We're going to have 15 abilities available for each of the heroes. You unlock more and more abilities as you reach higher difficulties. What you're starting out with is just the interrupt, the movement skill, and some basic core kit, but then a lot of the abilities that come are CCs, utilities, cooldowns, and things like that.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the various dungeons and boss fights?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. As the difficulty rises, bosses and enemies in the dungeon learn new abilities. What we're seeing here is this boss's base kit and then, as you get higher, she'll get some new tricks that make the boss a little bit more interesting for when you're ready for the increased challenge.</p>
<p>In Fellowship's dungeons, we have 3 bosses to kill. They take around 20 to 30 minutes to complete, depending on gear, difficulty, skill level, et cetera. And then we also have Adventures in the game. These are single-boss dungeons that take about 10 to 12 minutes to complete. You can compete in both formats for the leaderboard score. To get higher on the leaderboards, you need to improve the average score of all your dungeons. But if you're someone for whom half an hour is a bit too much of an investment to put in, you can just jump in and do the 10-minute ones and still get the full conversion and all that.</p>
<p><strong>Does Fellowship include some sort of crafting?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we have a bunch of different progression systems. Firstly, there are talents that are hero-specific, where you'll unlock ways to customize your hero.&nbsp;There's also the gear itself that has different types of stats, like Crit, Haste, Expertise, and more.</p>
<p>Once you get a little bit higher in difficulty, you'll start to obtain the transmutation resources. This is kind of a crafting system where you can use transmutation resources and some of the gold you earn to transmute items that you've gotten that you don't need. It kind of functions like a bad luck protection thing for loot. If you keep getting the same cloak all the time, you can transmute those cloaks and if you're lucky, you can reroll them into something you actually need.</p>
<p>Then we also have scrapping loot, which gives you resources, and you can upgrade loot as well. One of the bigger systems is also once you get gems and sockets unlocked. We're doing a lot more with gems and sockets than most RPGs do, so it's not just stats on those gems. The gems also unlock new defensive abilities and offensive abilities, passive ones, props and stuff, and do some cool stuff with your character as well.</p>
<p>At the end of a dungeon, you get your loot for completing it. If you right-click on the chest, but you can click on your items to collect them, and on the right side, you can see what everybody in your party got.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're not doing multi-role heroes, at least not for the foreseeable future. Right now, we're focusing on getting a tight core of heroes that deliver on the classical RPG fantasies of big two-handed barbarians and healing priests and shield and sword tanks and stabby rogues and all of that. One of the benefits of Fellowship being a hero game where you don't create your character is that, over time, we're going to be able to explore some really fun and crazy ideas when it comes to heroes.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Is there any way to trade these items if you don't need something and your friend does?</strong></p>
<p>No trading yet. That'll be something we'll potentially look into as part of the live service.</p>
<p><strong>How many heroes will be playable at launch?</strong></p>
<p>We haven't set an exact number. It'll be somewhere around 8 or 9, maybe, at launch. Of course, we are planning to regularly release new heroes in live service as well as dungeons and adventures and other types of formats of playing as well eventually.</p>
<p><strong>They are all limited to a single role, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we're not doing multi-role heroes, at least not for the foreseeable future. Right now, we're focusing on getting a tight core of heroes that deliver on the classical RPG fantasies of big two-handed barbarians and healing priests and shield and sword tanks and stabby rogues and all of that.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of Fellowship being a hero game where you don't create your character is that, over time, we're going to be able to explore some really fun and crazy ideas when it comes to heroes. Like, we could have a character that's a slime blob that clones into other heroes and can use their abilities for a while or any kind of stuff that we want to explore eventually. But we will be starting off with a good, strong foundation of heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you settle on a 4-player group format?</strong></p>
<p>We even experimented with 3, but what we noticed is that when you go down to 3, you only have 1 because we really want to lean into the Holy Trinity, which is the tank healer DPS roles. When you have a party of 3, you're really losing like an X factor, a permutation of the kind of setups you can do with your team.</p>
<p>So, 4 felt like a good number, and just from playtesting, we felt like we're not missing anything with a group of 4 instead of 5. It still feels like we're able to give the same complexity. There's a sweet spot in terms of mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Is this going to be a shared world hub with more players than just your group?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Right now, it's just the four of us connected, but you'll be able to see up to about 20 to 30 other players. We aren't loading every single person into this area because it would get full really quickly, but you should be able to see, connect, and interact with other players here in the hub. If someone else logged in now, they would spawn here with us until we hit the cap for the stronghold and then a new one spins up.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss what the post-launch would look like for Fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>There's lots of stuff we could explore. We really want to build this game with our community. Part of us wanting to get it into the players' hands as soon as possible is for them to help us feel out, hey, what do we want? How do we make the best game for you? We're hoping to have a really close connection there.</p>
<p><strong>What about monetization?</strong></p>
<p>The plan is to be a premium game. It's not free to play; it's not subscription-based. It'll be premium. We're not in a rush to unravel a huge microtransaction plan from the very beginning. We're going to take it a little bit slow. We're not going to be selling anything that is content, so no dungeons, progression features, heroes, or anything like that.</p>
<p>We want to work with our community to understand, if you love this game, what makes sense for you all to spend money on so we can keep making this. The obvious stuff at the top of our list is skins, mounts, and little pets that follow you around.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're intentionally going to double down on PVE coop. Not doing PVP allows us a lot more creative freedom and balancing. It puts us in a position where we can really do some cutting-edge stuff regarding the PVE experience. Fellowship, as the name implies, is really about the co-op experience.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Will there be any cosmetic customization of the heroes?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we have a mirror behind the tree. This is just turned off right now, but of course, we will allow you to cosmetically change the way you look, which will probably be things you can get through microtransactions, but also, of course, the things that you're actually collecting, like the dungeon loot and all of that. We talked about hairstyles and stuff like that. I think there's more to explore there, but nothing final yet.</p>
<p><strong>Would you add a dueling feature to Fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>We're intentionally going to double down on PVE coop. Not doing PVP allows us a lot more creative freedom and balancing. It puts us in a position where we can really do some cutting-edge stuff regarding the PVE experience. Fellowship, as the name implies, is really about the co-op experience.</p>
<p><strong>What about asymmetrical PvP, like doing simultaneous runs of the same dungeons to see who completes it first?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that kind of stuff, we're super interested in. We've talked about maybe a ghost mode where you can play even asymmetrically offline against other people's runs.</p>
<p>We talked about a live Tournament mode thing. We've talked about special game modes where you might be in the same map racing towards a boss. There's lots of cool stuff that we might do.</p>
<p><strong>What about launching on consoles?</strong></p>
<p>I'd say that's definitely very intimately connected to the gamepad support. So yeah, first, we would implement gamepad support. We don't have a date for when we would explore that, but we would do that first and then look at consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Would you add story-based content to Fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>That's a really good example that I consider not something that we would do unless the community clearly shows that that's what they would like.</p>
<p>If the community is like, hey, we really want a story adventure that focuses on letting us know more about our heroes, then cool, but initially, we're just really focused on the dungeon loop.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, it's just the four of us connected, but you'll be able to see up to about 20 to 30 other players. We aren't loading every single person into this area because it would get full really quickly, but you should be able to see, connect, and interact with other players here in the hub.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What about larger group content, like raids?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. When we had our Closed Alpha in August, we forgot to remove the raids tab from our mission table. We're talking about raids. I think it is a natural step. It's the same there, though. It's not something that we're going to roll out from the very start. It's, I would say, one of the features that we're eyeing very intently.</p>
<p>But again, for the health of Fellowship in regards to balancing, I think it's really good to start with getting the 4-player format of dungeons out into the player's hands in the wild for a while so that we can make sure that we get all of the balancing and tuning knobs right and the progression systems starting to add those before we increase the complexity.</p>
<p>Increasing the amount of players you bring to a raid, maybe it's 8 players, maybe it's 12 - we want to do something a little bit smaller than the classical huge 40-man things because they're a mess to manage. But there's some added complexity even for 8 to 12 players, so I think it's healthy for us to make sure that we're delivering top-notch 4-player content before we get into that.</p>
<p><strong>Will you add a guild system, too?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's a pretty natural connection. There's nothing planned at launch, but we're going to listen to our community and figure out what kind of social tools they want. The way we approach what happens after early access is that we have a lot of ideas. We also have a lot of designs pretty fleshed out for various features. We've talked about raids, we've talked about guilds, there's a whole bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>I think it's important to have some kind of discourse with the community about exactly how we want to roll that out rather than us making up the next couple of years of features and then being kind of stuck delivering on that, and maybe after two weeks the players are saying we want something else. So, we're keeping things open. We really want to do this together with the community.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/devonta-smith-cheating-claims-warzone-super-bowl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On February 9, DeVonta Smith won the Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles in front of 127 million viewers. One week later, the superstar wide receiver was staring down accusations that labelled him a malicious cheater in Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>While streaming Warzone in the last few days, Smith came under fire from a slew of allegations across social media, being lambasted by folks hellbent on branding the athlete a lousy cheater. In clips that surfaced online, some suspicious sequences unravelled, but what’s the truth of it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-devonta-smith-cheat-on-call-of-duty">Does DeVonta Smith Cheat on Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>The most talked-about clip of DeVonta Smith’s gameplay appeared on MLFootball on X. It was only a minute-long segment, and it was uploaded to showcase Smith’s humourous comms while streaming Warzone, but it was enough for Call of Duty sleuths to identify some strange goings-on.</p>



<p>Here’s the post with the full clip:</p>



<div><article><p><span>TRENDING: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eagles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Eagles</a><span> star receiver  DeVonta Smith live streaming playing Call of Duty has gone viral for how funny he is.

😭😭😭

Smitty 💀
</span><span></span></p></article></div>







<p>In the video, you can see Smith – who streams under the guise <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/smityyytv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘smityyyTV’</a> – gunning down the opposition on Rebirth Island. It’s plain as day that his accuracy and locks are scarily good, and even targets flying through the air or those appearing suddenly at long range are no challenge for the Eagles star.</p>



<p>The community is torn. If you take a look at the wider picture and check out his VOD content, it becomes less suspicious, and he starts to look like more of a well-rounded player than someone using a little extracurricular software to dominate lobbies.</p>



<p>Smith took advantage of the publicity to promote his content, inviting users to check him out in future streams:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Since yall think im cheating on COD just join the stream tonight 🤷🏽‍♂️🤣</span></p></article></div>







<p>In an effort to vouch for the Super Bowl-winning athlete, Paradox Customs, a PC company, declared on social media that ‘He’s not cheating’. The vouch went hand-in-hand with a revelation that Paradox had built DeVonta’s last two PCs, but gamers were quick to jump on the post and explain how ridiculous a retort that is.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, allegations like this rarely go away. Take Nadia, for example. She became a prolific Warzone streamer off the back of ‘hackusations’ that surfaced a good few years ago <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nadia-delta-force-event-cheater-investigation/">that have followed her around</a> like a bad stink ever since.</p>



<p>Do you think DeVonta Smith is cheating on Warzone? Let us know your observations in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>A pro skater has claimed he will appear in a yet-to-be-announced remastered Tony Hawk video game.</p>
<p>Professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones was chatting during an interview on the Breakfast Club podcast, when he casually stated: "I'm in a Tony Hawk coming out, that's cool... They got a new one they're remastering so that's about to come out, I was in the last one."</p>
<p>As a reminder, Jones was one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-tony-hawks-remaster-does-justice-to-one-of-the-greatest-demos-of-all-time">new playable pro skaters added to the remastered Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a>, which came out in 2020.</p>

<p>But, while Jones is clearly on (skate)board with this upcoming Tony Hawk remaster (could it be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a>+4?), it is worth noting that nothing has been officially announced to be in the works by Activision. That's not to say that there hasn't been plenty of Tony Hawk-flavoured chatter, however.</p>
<p>Plans to give Pro Skater 3 and 4 the remake treatment were reportedly scrapped after A<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">ctivision made the decision to merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> in 2021. But, that apparently wasn't the end of it after all, and in September last year, Tony Hawk himself gave us all a glimmer of hope that something was in the pipeline.</p>
<p>More pertinently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">Hawk revealed he had been "talking to Activision again" last September</a>, and added these talks were " insanely exciting" and he was "working on something" with the studio.</p>
<p>A little later that same month, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAgXDa1PI8a/">Hawk then popped up on Instagram</a> with a post marking the 25th anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. And how did he round everything off? Well, like this:</p>
<p>"I'm not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future."</p>

<p>Hopefully we will hear something more concrete on what exactly this franchise future will look like soon. In the meantime, Eurgamer has contacted Activision Blizzard for comment on Jones' statement regarding a new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-time-to-make-a-tofu-scramble.1112298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tofu-scramble-hell-yeah<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While I wouldn’t agree with Chuck Schumer that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/schumer.senate.gov/post/3li3azl3zfc2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the price of eggs</a> is the <em>most</em> important thing on Americans’ minds these days, there’s no denying that eggs cost a lot more than they used to, and that’s a bummer. If you’re looking for a breakfast alternative, you can’t go wrong with a tofu scramble.</p><p>But let’s be clear here: I don’t mean a fancy one, using <a href="https://nygroove.nyc/vegan-eggs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Just Egg</a> or other egg alternatives that have come about since I was last regularly cooking for vegans. I mean a late 90s/early 2000s tofu scramble, the kind you made in a batch when your trainhopping pals passed through your town, or the kind you woke up to at the punk house where your band crashed. One that kind of looked like eggs, but wasn’t trying to <em>taste</em> like eggs; one that was wholly itself.&nbsp;</p><p>I was first introduced to tofu scramble at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodroot_(restaurant)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feminist vegetarian restaurant</a> I worked at as a teen in the late 90s (a foundational but <a href="https://www.intomore.com/impact/lesbian-feminist-staple-bloodroot-vegetarian-restaurant-is-accused-of-transphobia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complicated</a> bit of Riley lore), where I would sometimes end up taking an entire trashbag of it home after a brunch shift even though I didn’t like it very much. It wasn’t until my 20s, immersed in activist and punk scenes in Boston and New York, that it became a regular feature of my diet, the kind of thing you could reliably whip up and assume that everyone could eat. You could fill it out with whatever vegetables someone had dumpster dived, and in my memory it could be scaled exponentially without needing to run out for more tofu, though obviously that can’t be right.</p><p>The only must-have ingredient I remember it having was turmeric, which is what made it yellow. Several recipes these days suggest adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kala_namak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black salt </a>to mimic the sulphurous taste of eggs, and while that sounds great and I certainly wouldn’t stop you, it feels like gilding the lily. A tofu scramble isn’t “vegan eggs;” it’s a <em>tofu scramble</em>, the staple dish of a certain time and place for me, the fuel of a particular version of myself and my communities.</p><p>This weekend I decided to recreate that tofu scramble, but my memory was hazy beyond tofu and turmeric. So I turned to the pinnacle of vegan cooking at the time (and arguably still today), Isa Chandra Moskowitz of Post Punk Kitchen. There’s a recipe on her site from <a href="https://www.theppk.com/2009/10/tof-u-and-tof-me-scrambled-tofu-revisited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2009</a>, the exact era I hoped to recapture. It features <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-reels-beans-oh-no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nutritional yeast</a>, one of the best things veganism has given us, as well as cumin and thyme, which I don’t remember adding to tofu scrambles but which were great additions, savory and earthy in a way scrambled eggs are not but which tofu scramble definitely is. You rip the tofu into chunks, pan-fry it until it’s browned in some spots, then dump in the spices and mix it all together. The result was precisely what I was hoping for: a little bit dry and ugly as hell, but tasting exactly how I remembered it. I paired it with the home fries recipe I used to make in bucket-sized batches at the feminist restaurant (boiled and then fried, with paprika and peppers), and was transported back to fueling up for marches against the president (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/president-donald-trump-protest-c8796556fbf20e796f42167f61c3d942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oops</a>) or radical queer actions against the HRC (<a href="https://www.them.us/story/human-rights-campaign-layoffs-restructuring-lgbtq-rights-organization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ah damn</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve never been vegan, and I’m not vegetarian these days either, though I don't cook much meat. While I’m glad if the variety of non-dairy milks or Beyond Meat help more people eat differently, I remember those golden years when vegetarian food stopped being pasta primavera or a portobello mushroom cap with balsamic vinegar but before it tried to mimic meat, when <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2014/2/7/6283461/vegan-junk-food-restaurant-foodswings-quietly-shutters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegan junk food</a> or <a href="https://gothamist.com/food/longstanding-east-village-vegetarian-diner-kates-joint-seized-by-marshal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegetarian diners</a> were splurges for when you could scrape enough money together. You do not need sausage that bleeds or something from a carton that cooks up like eggs a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-scrambled-egg-recipes-famous-chefs-2017-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity chef</a> would make. You just need a hunk of tofu and a jar of turmeric to fuel yourself for the fight.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/viktor-antonov-art-director-rip"><h3>RIP Viktor Antonov</h3></a><p>Antonov was one of the driving forces behind the art style of Half-Life 2 and Dishonored</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tony-hawks-remasters-potentially-leaked-by-pro-skater<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pro skater Tyshawn Jones may just have leaked the existence of a brand new collection of&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remasters, if a recent radio interview is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Speaking to New York station Power 105.1FM (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/skater-tyshawn-jones-claims-to-be-in-upcoming-tony-hawk-game-remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), Jones said he's "in a&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk&nbsp;</em>coming out" and that "they got a new one they're remastering, so that's about to come out".</p>

<p>As a reminder, Activision hasn't announced any new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remasters, so if Jones is right and a new collection is imminent, he's gotten ahead of Activision in revealing its existence.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-trick.jpg?itok=gZliE2DZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-trick.jpg?itok=esWJ9Yxi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remaster collection may be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that remasters of PS2 titles&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>were originally on the cards, but Tony Hawk himself said back in 2022 that those plans had been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-plans-for-pro-skater-3-4-remake-were-abandoned-after-blizzard-merger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shelved</a> after Blizzard's merger with Vicarious Visions.</p>

<p>Of course, a lot has happened since then, and it's entirely possible that the plans have been revived. It's also possible that Jones did the work he did for those remasters way back when and that no further development has occurred since their cancellation.</p>

<p>Presumably, the potentially-upcoming collection would include&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, but Activision could decide to skip those games and head straight for&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Underground</em>&nbsp;instead.</p>

<p>Doing so seems like a missed opportunity to me, though; these are popular games, after all, and the two PS2 installments before the series switched to&nbsp;<em>Underground&nbsp;</em>were pretty popular with the critics of their time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-grind.jpg?itok=snp5Sk_d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-grind.jpg?itok=GOUhU0OH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>could be about to get the&nbsp;<em>1 + 2&nbsp;</em>treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>If the&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>remasters are in the works, they'll face some pretty stiff competition thanks to EA's&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">due to land in Early Access sometime this year</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the two games are arguably targeting different audiences;&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>tends to aim for a general audience, while&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>&nbsp;has always seemed to be focused on the hardcore skater crowd.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens with regards to new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>remasters, but my&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>nostalgia and I are certainly hoping Jones is on the money. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>It was only last week that newly Sega-less Company Of Heroes developer Relic Entertainment <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/company-of-heroes-devs-relic-bounce-back-with-plans-for-big-rts-sequels-smaller-experiments-and-spiritual-revivals">announced plans</a> for various smaller <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game projects. Now, here we are with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earth-vs-mars">Earth Vs Mars</a>, a boldly-coloured B-movie homage to Advance Wars in which you can splice units with animals to create tactical monstrosities such as "Squirrel-Cows" and "Cheetah-Flies". Advance Wars aside, the new game harkens back to Relic's 2003 RTS oddity <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/impossible-creatures">Impossible Creatures</a>. The trailer below doesn't contain any Chihuahua Whales, but it's hopefully just a matter of time.</p><!--more-->

<p>Earth vs Mars looks to handle very similarly to Nintendo's turn-based strategy opus. The maps are grids, and clashes between units play out as jazzy split-view pop-ups. Units have unique abilities, and there are commanders that have passive and active traits. The game's splicing mechanic lets you lather all this up with some funky genetic hybridisation. Rhino infantry, for example, appears to have the muscle to knock enemies back a square.</p>
<p>It'll include a single player narrative campaign with "over" 30 missions (please, developers, please just say "around" or "approximately"), together with online PvP in which you can play as either Earthlings or Martians, an AI versus mode and a map editor. All the expected strata-me-doodle fixtures.</p>
<p>Earth vs Mars is the very first Relic Labs game. According to the Steam page, these "will differ from our traditional, big bread-and-butter RTS games (which we'll continue to support and develop)" and "allow us to explore new sub-genres, experiment, get our creative juices going, and release games more frequently." I suspect that last part about frequency is the crucial load-bearing fixture, here. </p>
<p>Find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/">Steam</a>. I'm not massively blown away by that splicing gimmick, but the presentation reminds me just a smidgeon of Kaiju Wars, an unexpected strategy game pleasure. RPS didn't review Kaiju Wars because the editors of the era (2022) were a bunch of gadabouts and chancers. So here's my, ugh, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kaiju-wars-review-a-gigantically-clever-strategy-spoof">Eurogamer review</a> instead. If you're keen to pursue peaceful Earth-Mars relations, perhaps you'd like to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mars-first-logistics-has-turned-into-a-martian-railway-builder-with-some-very-pretty-100-authentic-clouds">build some monorails</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>While Naughty Dog has only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">teased the third installment in The Last of Us franchise</a>, co-writer and director Neil Druckmann discussed recently sequels are never part of his initial plans. Talking along with Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, the two chatted with an audience about their doubts about their creative process.</p><p>After taking a few pre-submitted audience questions, one came across which asked about the development of sequels and how to maintain character development over multiple games. Druckmann said he goes one game at a time and doesn't think that far ahead.</p><p>"That's a very easy question for me to answer, because I never think about multiple games because I'm the game in front of us is so all-consuming," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-says-he-never-plans-for-sequels-that-requires-a-level-of-confidence-i-dont-have" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he responded (via IGN)</a>. "I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one. But I just approach it as, 'what if I never get to do another one?' I'm not saving some idea for the future. If there's a cool idea, I'm doing my best to get it into here."</p><p>Druckmann expanded on how his method for character arcs works which simply boiled down to if they can't move forward, he said he jokingly would kill them off.</p><p>"I'm half joking, but we just find the next game. When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say, 'How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?'," he explained.</p><p>"And we have to come up with a new answer," he continued. "And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?”</p><p>Speaking of new, back in November, Druckmann confirmed during the Jewish Visionaries in Gaming discussion--appearing alongside BioShock designer Ken Levine--that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-hes-been-working-on-new-game-since-2020-and-that-makes-sense/1100-6527766/" data-ref-id="1100-6527766">he was working on his first new game since 2020</a>.</p><p>"I can't talk about it or our bosses will get very mad at me," he said at the time.</p><p>Season 2 of HBO's The Last of Us premieres on Max in April and will cover some of the events The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

            <p>
UK retailer GAME appears to have dropped its widely-criticised delivery fee for in-demand Pokémon Prismatic Evolutions card sets, which saw £11 tins cost £31 to get delivered.
</p>
<p>
Exasperated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-scalping-popular-pokemon-cards-staff-say-demanding-20-shipping-for-11-mini-tin">GAME staff told Eurogamer last week that the chain's inflated postage pricing was a deliberate move</a>, rather than a simple mistake. Employees also told us they were tired of Pokémon card stock being kept back to sell for more money via GAME's website, rather than to customers visiting to try and buy the cards in-store.
</p>
<p>
The story spread online, and Eurogamer heard yesterday from a source close to the chain that GAME's "Oversized Delivery" fee was being reconsidered, or potentially relabelled. Today, Eurogamer has spotted that the Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin no longer has its previous £19.99 "Oversized Delivery" option. 
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>GAME's Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin product page today, with the chain's regular delivery options now available. | <span>Image credit: <cite>GAME / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
That's not to say that GAME's regular options are cheap - the chain's Standard Delivery is £4.99, or you can pay the same amount just for GAME to hold the item for you in store. Alternatively, you can pay £11.99 to get the cards via Next Day Delivery by DPD, or £9.99 to chance it with Next Day Delivery by Evri. 
</p>
<p>
But these are, at least, now GAME's usual rates.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously contacted GAME to ask why a small tin of Pokémon cards no bigger than a mobile phone required a £19.99 "Oversized Delivery" option, when a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> console did not. Eurogamer is still waiting for a response.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-fall-of-game-no-games-no-accessories-instead-we-received-136-zendaya-action-figures">Eurogamer reported on GAME's various ongoing issues as it is further integrated into Sports Direct's Fraser Group</a>, and suffers store closures, redundancies, and stock problems.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/stories-from-sol-the-gun-dog-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog is a classic sci-fi tale wrapped up in a visual novel. With warring factions in the Solar System, conspiracies, and relationships between crewmates aboard a small confined space of the Swift class ship known as The Gun-Dog, tensions can rise very quickly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stories from Sol:The Gun-Dog | Steam PC | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzWoEm9PFA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Stories From Sol: The Gun=Dog’s events take place after a war that rocked the Solar System. The forces of Earth, known as the Solar Federation, have been beaten by the combined forces of the Martian Territories and the Jovian Unified Colony Fleet. Your character, whose name and gender you assign, was a cadet pilot in the war and was meant to fight in the final battle piloting a Frame – essentially a mech. However, your Frame failed to launch and the rest of your squadron, bar one other pilot, were lost in the battle. A few years post-war, you find yourself as the security officer of The Gun-Dog, a ship for screw ups and others that are to be kept out of the way.</p>


<p>The Gun-Dog is a small ship, which means it has a small crew. However, among this crew your character already knows two people. The first is Cassandra, aka Cassie, the second in command and the game’s love interest. The second is Hansen, the other survivor from your former squadron, who has blamed you for the deaths of the squad mates lost in the war as you were not there when they needed you. Other characters include Captain Barthlomews, Lieutenant Vanessa Lord, Chief Engineer Cathays, Cadet Dalton, Ensign Haru, Weapons Officer Dylan, and Doctor Rosarium, the ship’s physician.</p>


<p>Some of these stand out more than others. Cassie is the strongest of the bunch, as you spend a lot of time with her as the plot unfolds, but there is also a lot of interaction and friction with Hansen and Lieutenant Lord. In fact, the developers have to be commended on Lieutenant Lord, because I have not felt such visceral hate towards a character in such a long time. The epitome of self-serving who would step on anyone to get ahead and save their own skin. It’s like Othello’s Iago was the inspiration, but at least he could feign liking Othello. Lord has no such compunction to pretend to like anyone.</p>
<p>Other characters fade into the background, having smaller parts to play. Though they are all unique, Haru is like a hanger on of Hansen, and Dylan is someone you’ll rarely interact with either. These are all decently written characters, and they do have some hidden depths to them, though you will recognise common tropes that they build upon.</p>
<p>A visual novel’s core focus is the flow of its story, and it starts off strong. The Gun-Dog is sent to assist the O’Brien after some strange readings have been detected on the edge of Jovian territory. From early on you can work out that these readings are bad news, but it takes the characters longer to reach that conclusion. What follows is a plot where you essentially becoming a detective to work out what is happening, as well as managing relationships with key characters.</p>
<p>jvbhknjUnpicking that mystery through the story is decent and interesting, but not totally unique. The ending can be impacted by some of the choices you make as well, choices in both responses you give and actions you take. &nbsp;Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog is also supposed to be the first entry into a wider universe of visual novels, so there are some story points left open at the end. I do want to see what happens next, but I don’t really feel that immediate desire to play the next instalment right away.</p>

<p>The gameplay wrapped up in the narrative is pretty straightforward. The presentation of the user interface gives six options to click on, with those being Move, Use, Look, Talk, Item and Function – all pretty self explanatory. It could arguably even just be five, as Function features a map alongside its database and task log that makes Move redundant.&nbsp;Much of the time you will be reading and interacting with the other characters, though there are some puzzles to solve to make progress. These puzzles are pretty simple to work out, so you will not be stuck in place for too long.</p>
<p>The game also has three graphic types. Doujin Mode gives you access to the early visual concept of the game with quite a cartoonish. Studio Mode looks like 90s style anime but in a green palette similar to that of the Game Boy, while Vivid Mode is like Studio Mode but in full colour. You can swap between these at any time. I switched between Vivid and Doujin mode, having used Studio during my playthrough for the preview, and ended up favouring Vivid as it gives so much more detail in the environments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-399/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will likely be priced at $399, a price point that makes the most sense for the company for several reasons, according to an in-depth analysis provided a few days ago.</p>
<p>Joost van Dreunen, co-founder of the SuperData Research firm, recently shared online<a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/nintendo-switchs-second-act"> a very interesting analysis</a> of Nintendo's strategic direction for the future, focusing on the market changes over the release of the company's previous system and how they will affect the Nintendo Switch 2. The new console, according to the analyst, enters a fundamentally different market landscape than its predecessor, and the company's approach seems to reflect this changed market, prioritizing platform sustainability rather than hardware sales. Backward compatibility and seamless transition suggest the company is focusing on installed base retention and software attachment rates, an approach that falls in line with the industry shift of recent times.</p>
<p>With this very different market landscape, Joost van Dreunen believes the Nintendo Switch 2 will be priced at $399. This price point, according to the analyst, is a critical psychological barrier that balances premium hardware aspirations against mainstream market accessibility, and that would allow Nintendo to maintain its hardware margins, position it below the handheld PC market that has blown up in recent years while clearly indicating the new system is a technological advancement, all without alienating the system's core audience. The blowing up of the handheld PC market could actually be a boon for the Nintendo Switch 2, as it has expanded the addressable audience for a portable gaming system and has a very different core audience that doesn't overlap with Nintendo's family-friendly content.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 final price and release date have yet to be announced. More information is likely coming during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>, which will finally provide a proper look at the system and its games.</p>

He’s a sexy fish man who’s a bit rogueish, with a suave voice that brings it all together. Any <em>Mass Effect </em>fan will recognize this voice as Brandon Keener, the actor behind turian vigilante Garrus Vakarian from the original trilogy. Some of my favorite reactions from <em>Avowed</em>’s early access players have been seeing them realize that Kai shares Garrus’ voice. Despite Garrus’ popularity among <em>Mass Effect </em>fans, Keener hasn’t done a ton of video game voice work in the years since. He’s done a lot of “additional voices,” but Kai is probably his most prominent role since Garrus. So for many fans, this is like hearing an old friend for the first time in over a decade.</p><p>The connection between Kai and Garrus doesn’t end in their voice actor, however. Obsidian’s writers are clearly <em>Mass Effect </em>fans, because they include a cheeky reference to Garrus in some of Kai’s dialogue. There’s a scene in <em>Avowed </em>in which a woman is challenging the player and Kai to a fight, to which the aumaua says he’s got plenty of “reach.” This seems like a reference to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380">Garrus’ romance in <em>Mass Effect 2</em></a></span>, in which the character makes a joke about having <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xocKGaw0kxE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xocKGaw0kxE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“reach,” and another Turian he hooked up with having “flexibility.”</a></span></p><p>It’s a fun bit of connective tissue, but Kai is a great character separate from sharing a voice with Garrus, with a depth of personality, a backstory that plays out during the game, and performs the vital role of the faithful friend you know always has your back.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fantasy turn-based strategy game Songs of Conquest has an official mobile release date. Publisher Coffee Stain and developer Lavapotion have announced that Songs of Conquest will release on iOS and Android on March 13.</p>



<p>The game will be available for a one-time purchase of $11.99/£11.99.</p>



<p>Despite it being released on mobile, Coffee Stain says that it will be a full port of Songs of Conquest’s PC version. </p>



<p>“The teams at Coffee Stain and Lavapotion have worked hard to make sure that the experience of playing Songs of Conquest on mobile is seamless and immersive,” Christian Knutsson, Art Director at Lavapotion, said back when the mobile version <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/strategy-game-songs-of-conquest-coming-to-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced</a> in September.</p>



<p>Songs of Conquest first release in Early Access in May 2022. The game’s 1.0 launch on PC took place in May 2024, and has since released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Lavapotion also has multiple expansions and DLC plans in development for the game, the latest being the <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/swipe-right/pressreleases/songs-of-conquest-branches-out-with-roots-upcoming-new-dlc-3370453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently revealed Roots faction</a> for this summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It may seem like a long leap to make from the R-rated streets of Tokyo's red light district to the yarrr-rated pirate-infested waters of the Hawaiian islands, but Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii has successfully pulled off the switch from bareknuckling to swashbuckling with confidence and considerable flair. This jaunty adventure jettisons the series’ typical turf war cliches and pulpy plot twists in favour of spinning a streamlined and spirited tale of seafaring and treasure hunting, without sacrificing any of the addictive diversions and slapstick silliness that have long become its hallmarks. As far as spin-offs from the mainline entries go, Pirate Yakuza makes for an absolutely invigorating seachange that left me feeling perkier than a parrot on a pirate’s shoulder.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially a coda to the events of 2024’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, Pirate Yakuza’s off-the-wall story focuses on loveable series shitstirrer, Goro Majima. It gets straight to it: after awakening on the shores of a secluded island with amnesia, he promptly befriends an enthusiastic young boy and his adorable pet tiger cub, commandeers a pirate ship that for entirely unexplained reasons seems to have sailed in straight out of the 1700s, and sets about on a thrilling quest to find the lost treasure of a legendary sunken Spanish ship. Perhaps as a result of his temporary memory loss, Majima is considerably less manic in Pirate Yakuza than he has been in previous Like a Dragon stories, but he’s still every bit as gleefully mischievous. There was never a dull moment between him and his evergrowing gang of goons turned treasure-seeking Goonies as I explored the seas and shores of Pirate Yakuza’s vibrant tropical setting. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an unpredictable voyage that regularly veers from intense highs to more laidback lows, much like the waves that Majima sails upon. In one moment I’d be trapped in a desperate battle against a towering sea creature or an army of pirates of almost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>-esque proportions, while the next I’d be adopting homeless animals off the street to shelter in my personal petting zoo and throwing parties for me hearties whenever morale amongst my crew was on the wane. Pirate Yakuza doesn’t just regularly hoist the Jolly Roger, it also lets its freak flag fly in a consistently entertaining fashion – from its rousing opening musical number through to the dynamic dance sequence that drops the curtain on its story 25 hours later – and it kept me hooked harder than a handshake from, well, Captain Hook.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nautical by Nature</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While 2023’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name">Like a Dragon Gaiden</a> experimented with a fairly superficial secret agent spin on the series’ template, Pirate Yakuza steers Like a Dragon into some truly uncharted waters. There’s plenty of lively naval combat to be enjoyed aboard Majima’s adopted pirate ship, although to be clear, in terms of exploration it doesn’t attempt to match the sense of freedom I felt in the Caribbean setting of 2013’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</a>. Instead, Pirate Yakuza’s waters are broken down into a handful of smaller maps to warp between rather than one big open waterworld, and outside of the main Honolulu hub and a stunning ship graveyard turned casino district called Madlantis, many of the smaller islands are constructed out of the same recycled layouts. So over time, the sense of discovery slightly diminished whenever I dropped anchor and saw something a bit too familiar. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pirate Yakuza doesn’t just regularly hoist the Jolly Roger, it also lets its freak flag fly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there’s enough spectacle and strategic depth to the actual open-water combat that I remained engaged anytime I was at the helm of Majima’s ship. In each bilgewater battle you can attack front-on with machine gun fire or perform a boost-based ram into an enemy’s hull, as well as manouevre alongside a rival to deliver more damaging broadside attacks from your port or starboard cannons. These cannons can be upgraded by harvesting resources found drifting at sea or tucked around Pirate Yakuza’s smattering of ports, and although Majima’s frigate can be equipped with everything from flamethrowers to freeze guns, I soon set my sights on scraping together enough spare parts to outfit my vessel with powerful lasers to cut crossways through my opponents from ear to buccaneer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was also regularly recruiting new pirates to my crew in every port I docked in, and it quickly became clear that assigning a crew member to specific roles had measurable impacts on each naval skirmish. Individual members of your pirating posse are ranked in areas like attack, defense, and cannon power, and anytime I placed some underpowered or inexperienced comrades in, say, my boarding party, I was forced to watch my crew go from ragtag to bodybags in quick succession.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After some experimentation I eventually got the balance right, and that included determining the right pirate to be my first mate. While some candidates offered increased damage buffs or additional fuel drums to burn with my ship’s boost, I opted to promote a mechanic into the role because it gave me two extra repair kits per clash. Given I approach naval battles like Dave Chappelle approaches his stand-up sets – always on the offensive and typically blazed up by the end – it was enormously helpful to have those extra kits to haul my battlescarred hull to glory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the naval combat functions do seem a little superfluous, though. For example, at no point in the story did I feel the need to step away from the helm in order to use Majima’s rocket launcher, since the ship’s artillery usually seemed ample enough, and it was also rare that I was compelled to manually put out fires on deck or thaw out ice that was blocking my cannons. That did change, however, after I beat the story and returned to complete the 30-odd escalating battles in Madlantis’ pirate coliseum, as surviving its toughest encounters demanded the considered use of every ability at my disposal. That finally made for some welcome optional challenges outside of the main story path, but I wished they’d been in play earlier in the campaign.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Captain Hookshot</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, given that this is a Like a Dragon adventure, there are still plenty of opportunities for fisticuffs either ashore or on-deck anytime you board an enemy ship by force. In the default Mad Dog fighting stance, Pirate Yakuza reverts to the familiar brand of combo-based street fighting that was a staple of the series before the main entries shifted to turn-based brawls with 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>. Majima can pull off fast and fluid combinations of punches, kicks, and rapid dagger slashes, each attack enhanced by flashy neon movement trails and punctuated by enemies that erupt into fountains of gold coins as though they’re crowds of criminal question blocks from the Mushroom Kingdom. However, Majima feels noticeably more agile than Kazuma Kiryu ever was, with a snappier quickstep to open overbalanced enemies up to counter attack, plus the useful ability to jump and air-dodge out of harm’s way anytime he’s overwhelmed by a surprisingly numerous horde.</p><div id="how-do-you-rank-these-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">How do you rank these Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio games?</h3><h3>How do you rank these Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio games?</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, once I’d unlocked the Sea Dog fighting stance a few hours into my 25-hour tour of Pirate Yakuza, I basically never looked back. While in previous Like a Dragon instalments I’ve relished the freedom to switch between stances to best counter each enemy type or situation, Sea Dog is basically a one-size-fits-<em>brawl </em>fighting style that feels adaptive enough to suit any given showdown. This pirating pose allows Majima to cut loose with a pair of cutlasses, either hurling them like bladed boomerangs or performing a brutal ballet of spinning slashes to cut through enemies in clusters. It equips him with a handy hookshot that allows him to zip directly to a targeted enemy like some sort of seafaring Spider-Man, which is extremely useful for picking off the more heavily-armed goons that tend to snipe you from the far edges of each battle arena. If that’s not enough, it also gives Majima a flintlock pistol of his own, and after investing in the skill tree to increase its power and widen its radius, I was able to use it to wipe out more pirates than dysentery at the charged-up press of a button.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sea Dog is basically a one-size-fits-brawl fighting style that feels adaptive enough to suit any given showdown.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So well-rounded and entertaining to use was the Sea Dog style, in fact, that the only time I ever felt the need to switch back to Mad Dog was in order to unleash Majima’s slightly overpowered Doppelganger attack. Available after you’ve chained together enough successful attacks to fill up a special meter, this devastating ability conjures up twin Majima clones that swarm enemies and chew through their health bars for a short time like a pair of piranhas, and I was happy to have it in my back pocket for whenever I came up against one of the more brutish boss encounters. Although I think Infinite Wealth’s hybrid turn-based combat has quite rightfully become the standard for the Like a Dragon series, Pirate Yakuza’s flashy fighting remained engaging from the first sword slash through to the final throat cut, and I found it to be a substantial step up from the gadget-heavy grappling of Like a Dragon Gaiden.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pleasure Island</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Pirate Yakuza’s Honolulu setting is more or less the same sundrenched sprawl that featured in Infinite Wealth, there are enough new secrets and distractions that made it rewarding to explore a second time around. Outside of combat, Majima’s hookshot can be employed to zip him up to anchor points on certain buildings, meaning that treasure chests full of alternate character costumes and other goodies are tucked away on hotel awnings and various other elevated spots all over the island. There are also countless bounty targets to track down and beat up for beefy cash bonuses, and games for the safehouse Master System to seek out. Although, I must admit that I feel like it’s about time that developer Ryu Ga Gotoku moved on to an in-game Mega Drive (or Genesis for US fans), or at the very least a Game Gear. After collecting mostly the same set of 8-bit cartridges in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-judgment">Lost Judgment</a>, Like a Dragon Gaiden, and now Pirate Yakuza, I feel like I’ve well and truly mastered the Master System at this point. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, there’s still more: in addition to the fiend-photographing Sicko Snap and the infectiously giddy Super Crazy Delivery minigames that return from Infinite Wealth, Pirate Yakuza brings back Dragon Kart from Yakuza: Like a Dragon, only this time in addition to its riotous racing circuits they’ve bolted on an arena-based battle mode which made for some intense, four-wheeled firefights. Meanwhile, the series’ standard-issue batting cage minigame has been revitalised by swapping baseballs for cannonballs, and I had a great time knocking destructive dingers into descending stacks of explosive barrels.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was also delighted with almost every substory I completed in Majima’s adventure. Some were utterly wholesome, like the time I agreed to bring an aging businessman aboard my ship in order to live out his boyhood fantasies of becoming a pirate. Others were funny pisstakes of online culture, like when Majima was recruited to become a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-3tb">Virtua Fighter 3</a> streamer and I had to choose the liveliest possible reactions for him in order to prevent the comments section from turning too hostile. Others still were completely bonkers, like the substory that suddenly spins out into a live-action episode of a dating show inspired by The Bachelor, as the ship’s cook Masaru tried to woo five different potential dates with hilariously awkward results. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan Ogilvie's Favourite Pirate Games</h3><p>Not to be confused with pirated games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even a supersized substory that sees Majima and his ever expanding crew hunt down the dread pirate Zeus and his intimidating Devil Flags fleet. This chunky optional quest opened up additional maps to navigate, including an archipelago of volcanic islands and even an ice realm, each overloaded with increasingly powerful naval vessels to face off against and pirate headquarters to plunder. Not only is undertaking this journey worthwhile purely for harvesting the doubloons required to upgrade Majima’s ship with decked out drip – including a carved Kazuma Kiryu figurehead for its bow – but it’s also the only way to track down all four fabled instruments of the Dark Gods. These cursed instruments can be charged up during on-shore skirmishes and unleashed to spectacularly turn the tides of a battle, with a violin that brings the violence by summoning a horde of spectral land sharks to turn enemy packs into fleshy snacks, or an electric guitar that can be energetically shredded while a towering ape stomps into the fray and chimp-slaps your opponents straight into Davy Jones’ locker. These are some of the most powerful attacks in Pirate Yakuza, so it’s a little odd that they’re locked away in an entirely optional substory that’s so easy to overlook.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether your <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-games-in-order">first hunt dates back to the original game on PlayStation 2</a>, or you hopped in when 2018's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-world-sells-over-25-million">Monster Hunter: World dominated the charts</a>, you're bound to have that one monster you've grown attached to and love more than any other. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s hugely popular hunting RPG series boast over 200 monsters in total, so we've gone through them all to find our top 25 – the very best of the best, and the beasts we love to gush over as much as we hate battling them. And with Monster Hunter Wilds adding to that tally, now is the perfect time to take a look at some of the best monsters the series has to offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>25. Malzeno</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/25-malzeno-1739888223847.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Malzeno is a powerful Elder Dragon that made quite an impression when it flew onto the scene in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-rise/Sunbreak_Expansion">Monster Hunter Rise’s Sunbreak expansion</a>. This monster’s strength comes not only through its visual design, which features a glowing aura permeating throughout Malzeno’s entire body, but also its ability to literally drain the life-force from anything around it. This bloodsucking vampire of a monster is horrifying in both design and execution. Hunting it around Sunbreak’s dilapidated castle ruins only further adds to the practically gothic ambience and aesthetic, which cements Malzeno and the fight against it as a standout moment that fans won't forget anytime soon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>24. Behemoth</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/24-behemoth-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to a crossover event with Final Fantasy 14, Monster Hunter World received the hulking Behemoth as a new foe for hunters to take on. Its unique mechanics, pulled from the beast’s iconic Final Fantasy moveset, make it a formidable foe. Behemoth forces you to think about party composition in the terms of a traditional MMO, designating a tank to pull aggro, a healer to keep everyone alive, and damage dealers to press the advantage. Attempting to dodge Behemoth's instant knockout Ecliptic Meteor attack still gives us nightmares to this day, but when you finally nail it, there's nothing else quite like it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>23. Vaal Hazak</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/23-vaal-hazak-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A grotesque Elder Dragon that resides in the darkest depths of the Rotten Vale, Vaal Hazak was first introduced in Monster Hunter: World, found in a den filled with a never ending sea of bones. Spewing disgusting poisonous gas from its mouth, Vaal Hazak can make quick work of any unprepared hunter. Even years after its first sighting, the mere thought of Vaal Hazak still sends shivers down our spines thanks to its red flesh-laced wings and the rotting corpses that hang from its body. Who designed this monstrosity? We just want to talk. As you can probably tell, this is not a fight for the faint of heart or someone with a weak stomach. Vaal Hazak's design and combat arena give other monsters in the series a serious run for their money. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>22. Legiana</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/22-legiana-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Chasing the speedy wyvern Legiana across the steep cliff sides of the Coral Highlands is a standout moment in Monster Hunter: World. Legiana's high speed and precision make it a deadly assassin, and learning how to dance around its icy attacks is a true test of skill. Giving this fast and fluid beast any room to maneuver can very easily spell your death. So no matter how many times you go up against it, you'll always need to stay on your toes. Legiana has a shrieking variant introduced in the Iceborne expansion, but it's the original we pay respects to here. Legiana teaches hunters about the importance of staying fleet-footed and never being overconfident. This makes Legiana a valuable teaching moment for many new hunters and a sharp reminder for veterans. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>21. Bazelgeuse</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/21-bazelgeuse-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bazelgeuse is the bane of our existence. This flying wyvern has been the cause of many late-night frustrations and trips back to camp after an entire teamwipe. If you see a Bazelgeuse flying toward you, it's probably already too late, as this incredibly aggressive apex predator actively seeks out targets across the battlefield and drops bombs on anything in its path of total destruction. Practicing patience while hunting can get lost in the shuffle as you progress further into Monster Hunter games, and Bazelguese is here to remind players the importance of waiting for the perfect moment to strike. All this means that you’d best get ready for an explosive fight, one that you probably won't forget anytime soon.. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>20. Black Diablos</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/20-black-diablos-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Diablos are not a variant of Diablos. They are actually female Diablos getting ready to mate. This causes them to become more territorial and aggressive, and so any monster or hunter that comes within their domain should approach with caution. The Black Diablos can bury itself in the sand and later erupt from underneath the desert dunes, sending anything in its path flying upward. The sheer carnage a Black Diablos can cause makes it a difficult creature to fight, and you'll need to prepare for a long haul. Getting into a tussle with a Black Diablo is a slugfest, as you trade blows back and forth in hope of chipping away at its heavy plates of armor. While standard Diablos is cool, we all know it’s the Black Diablos that reigns supreme. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>19. Shara Ishvalda</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/19-shara-ishvalda-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the final boss of Monster Hunter: World's Iceborne expansion, Shara Ishvalda perfectly encapsulates the massive scale of the series’ best monster battles. Initially appearing to be some kind of rock monster, Shara Ishvalda’s first form boasts a rugged exterior that you slowly chip away at. But as rocks crumble off its body, Shara's real form begins to show: this is a large-scale Elder Dragon, and it acts as one of the ultimate Monster Hunter set pieces. Finger-like appendages on its wings appear more like two huge hands sprouting from its body, creating something both terrifying and majestic in form. The final confrontation with Shara Ishvalda and its strange finger-wings will forever be etched into our memories.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>18. Furious Rajang</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/18-furious-rajang-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Furious Rajang, the more aggressive and powerful variant of the original Rajang, is a force to be reckoned with. Its glowing golden fur charges up with electrical energy as the fight plays out<strong>, </strong>essentially turning it Super Saiyan. Hunters have spent countless hours being tossed around the battlefield by the Furious Rajang, thanks to its high-flying acrobatic wrestling stunts that leave us as little more than lifeless corpses. Between its incredibly fast movement around the arena and its quick combos, Furious Rajang seems like a fighting game character hitting you with infinite combos. We don't have to love the Furious Rajang, but we sure do respect it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>17. Astalos</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/17-astalos-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Astalos was first seen in Monster Hunter Generations, but received quite the glow up in Monster Hunter Rise's Sunbreak expansion. This flying wyvern’s hyper-aggressive nature means near certain death for any hunter or monster silly enough to walk into its line of sight. It's sort of like that high-school bully that is always looking to fight, even if there's no actual reason to. Thanks to its flashy lightning attacks and prismatic wings, Astalos is as beautiful as it is dangerous. This means that every encounter with Astalos is an important moment because you'll need to make a quick decision to hightail it out of there, or stand and hold your ground. Just make sure you bring a weapon big enough to bonk it on the head and take it down a peg or two if you decide to fight.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>16. Amatsu</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/16-amatsu-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Dragon Amatsu is a sight to behold. Adorned with golden horns, it swims through the skies like a fish in the ocean. Its ability to control storms and wind makes Amatsu a fearsome monster to hunt; It’ll throw out massive tornadoes and gusts of wind across a rainy battlefield arena, which all make for a memorable fight. While initially introduced in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, it's in Rise’s Sunbreak expansion that Amatsu's whimsical nature truly shines, where it will hurl you through the skies and pull you in through tunnels of wind  like a surfer gliding through a tube of water towards a monster’s maw. More than anything though, Amatsu signifies great calamity, making it feared by everyone throughout the land. Its set piece moment in Sunbreak, where it swirls around darkened skies to announce itself as a true end-game level threat, helps put it above many other monsters on this list. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>15. Raging Brachydios</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/15-raging-brachydios-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's something about a big boy monster who just wants to hit stuff, and Raging Brachydios is exactly that. A giant rock monster with fire hands and a thirst for blood, Raging Brachydios will keep you on your toes by smashing the ground and erupting the slime on its body to create arena-wide explosions. The Raging variant of the Brachydios is much deadlier than the regular version thanks to a more volatile slime that coats its body, causing faster and more potent explosions. Don't worry, we find the slime kind of gross, which is why we're determined to ensure this monster doesn't live to see another day. This variant ensures you're always on the move, making it difficult to position yourself for massive damage, but once you learn the rhythm of the fight it makes for the most rewarding sense of accomplishment. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>14. Glavenus</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/14-glavenus-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">How could you not fall in love with a giant dinosaur with a massive blade for a tail? Glavenus swings its giant sharpened appendage like a broadsword, cleaving anything in its path in two. As its tail dulls, Glavenus uses its own teeth to sharpen the blade, and we can't think of anything more metal than that. Originally introduced in Monster Hunter Generations, most folks likely remember Glavenus thrashing around in Monster Hunter: World's Iceborne expansion. While Glavenus might not be as popular as Rathalos or other monsters, its unique design and brutal attack damage make it a standout monster and one we always love to fight. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>13. Teostra</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/13-teostra-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Teostra is something of a celebrity in the Monster Hunter series. Dating all the way back to 2006’s Monster Hunter 2, Teostra has appeared in a total of 17 games, expansions, and spin-offs, ranging from Freedom 2 to Rise. Teostra's command of fire makes hunting it an incredibly brutal activity. Whether it's heating up its body and producing flames so hot it can burn hunters at range or spewing fire across the battlefield, Teostra is not to be trifled with. Its supernova attack, triggered by a spark of its teeth, is enough to bring any hunter to their knees. Teostra is a classic, and one that no Monster Hunter journey is complete without. Sometimes the classics don't reinvent the wheel, but provide a strong foundation to build upon afterward. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>12. Namielle</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/12-namielle-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Namielle is an interesting Elder Dragon as it commands both water and electricity, a combo not often seen together. With its large black wings and slimy outer layer, Namielle can slide around the battlefield and cover it in water. Despite being an Elder Dragon, its moveset is closer to that of the monster Mizutsune, shooting jetstreams of water from its mouth and quickly moving about the arena. As mentioned, Namielle can also produce electricity, which it uses to shock hunters or other prey. While initially appearing a rather passive monster, Namielle is a powerhouse when provoked. Namielle's unique combination of elemental attacks provides hunters with a nice change of pace and creates a monster that feels elevated in both form and function. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>11. Gore Magala</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/11-gore-magala-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gore Magala is a complete nightmare of a creature. This six-limbed young Elder Dragon has huge, grabbing claws on its back that can shred through almost anything in reach. Born without eyes, it emits pollen-like scales that attach to prey, which allows Gore Megala to sense their target’s body heat. As it scatters more scales it will change the color of the sky and enter into a frenzy, reaching a new, heightened power level. Gore Magala is powerful on its own terms, but once it reaches adulthood it sheds its skin and becomes Shagaru Magala, a more fearsome, golden winged, adult form of its previous self. This transformation provides a level of insight into a monster’s lifecycle previously unseen in the series, which makes Gore Magala a stand out creature on this list.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Rathalos</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/10-rathalos-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rathalos, the red wyvern first seen on the cover of the original game, is the de facto Monster Hunter series mascot. Our large friend has appeared in every single entry of the Monster Hunter series, as well as making appearances in Final Fantasy 14, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and even Metal Gear Solid: Peacewalker, and so this list would not be complete without what is arguably the franchise's most iconic creature. The Rathalos is a fan-favorite and one that can often give newcomers and veterans alike a hard time in the wild. So this slot is for our beautiful baby, our cherished pal, our good buddy Rathalos. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. Fatalis</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/9-fatalis-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatalis is arguably one of the strongest monsters in the series. Originally introduced in the very first Monster Hunter, this massive black Elder Dragon is known for its ability to level entire castles on a whim. It was most recently included in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne’s final update, which made Fatalis the true final fight of the game. Its massive scale and imposing figure make it one of the most difficult fights in the series, in part thanks to its fire breath being able to ignite an entire arena and leave only destruction in its wake. Fatalis is a monster to be truly feared, and a standing reminder of what Elder Dragons are capable of. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Kirin</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/8-kirin-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Do not be fooled by Kirin's graceful form and demeanor. This unicorn-like Elder Dragon will not hesitate to impale you on its giant horn like a chicken kebab. Its quick dashes and lightning attacks will leave your head spinning. It often circles you faster than you can rotate the camera, which means you’ll need to make use of perfect positioning unless you want to have your favorite Palicos wheeling you back to camp with nothing left but your life. As Kirin leaps across the battlefield and you revel in its splendor, keep your head on a swivel and your blade sharpened. This monster is a perfect reminder that sometimes beautiful things can also be deadly. Kirin is a staple of the Monster Hunter series and one fans come to expect with each new entry. Kirin is more than just another monster, but a series icon that is adored by fans, even if it's the cause of many hunter deaths.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. Mizutsune</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/7-mizutsune-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mizutsune is a leviathan similar to Amatsu. It’s armed with pressurized water jet blasts and has the ability to slide around the arena fluidly. However, Mizutsune doesn't come packaged with Amatsu’s world ending calamity and is a little prettier to look at, so it scores a higher place on our list. Its ability to blow bubbles that hinder your movement and eventually knock you over makes this a pretty dangerous monster to get tangled up with. However, Mitzusune's movements are majestic, which makes each and every moment of the battle a spectacle, akin to watching a perfectly choreographed dance sequence centerstage. While Mizutsune might not be the most technical or complex fight on this list, it's one that reminds us that hunts can be enchanting, and getting lost in such a moment is what makes the series special. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. Lagiacrus</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/6-lagiacrus-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another leviathan makes the list and with good reason. Lagiacrus, originally introduced in Monster Hunter 3, is a true menace. Diving below the water and finding this giant, long necked, dinosaur-like monster is a memory seared into the deepest parts of our brain. Having to navigate this fight underwater in your slow and bulky armor puts you at a disadvantage, and so as Lagiacrus swims circles around you, learning how to seize each opportunity to land a strike becomes a game of its own. Lagiacrus is a formidable opponent, and one we hope to meet again down in the ocean’s depths, but it's been nearly a decade since we've last seen it. Lagiacrus defines a generation of hunters and those hunters will never forget their first fight against the Monster Hunter 3's cover art beast. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Crimson Glow Valstrax</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/5-crimson-glow-valstrax-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Have you ever thought "I wish the monsters in Monster Hunter looked more like a fighter jet speeding across the sky?" Well, you're in luck. Crimson Glow Valstrax, introduced as post-launch DLC for Monster Hunter: Rise, is a variant of Vlastrax that has been given afterburners. Its glowing red wings shoot flames as it darts across the sky, making for one of the coolest introductions to a monster in the series history. Using its large sharp wings as blades, Crimson Glow Valstrax is one of the series’ most unique monster designs in recent memory. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Savage Deviljho</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/4-savage-deviljho-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Every hunter's favorite pickle boy, the original Deviljho is something of a Monster Hunter legend. Known in the early games for its relentless nature and ability to dish out absurd amounts of damage, the Deviljho rose to fame in the community rather quickly. In Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate the Savage Deviljho was born, a red variant with some new moves and a much needed facelift. Its constant rage and larger radius breath attacks make the savage version much more, well, savage. Its near-constant frenzy leads it to attack anything and everything in its sight, leaving no stone unturned in its neverending attempt to quench its bloodthirst. Savage Deviljho is proof that no matter how difficult you think a fight can be, there's always something even harder right around the corner.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Nargacuga</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/3-nargacuga-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nargacuga's features resemble that of a black panther… well, a black panther with wings and a giant spiked tail. It lurks in the shadows, waiting to get the drop on unsuspecting hunters. Its ferocious nature and natural ability to hunt prey makes the Nargacuga completely terrifying. Whether it's getting ambushed by one in a battle or having to go toe to toe against this vicious predator, Nargacuga makes a strong case for being one of the best monster designs in the series. Speed is one of Nargacuga's biggest strengths, so you best be prepared to stay on the move. Despite Nargacuga never really changing from game to game, it's a prime example of getting a monster right the first time, and having everyone look forward to fighting it again and again. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Nergigante</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/2-nergigante-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nergigante is Monster Hunter World’s signature beast. This dangerous Elder Dragon is the star of one of the game’s climactic fights, a battle where you finally get to tussle against the fearsome foe depicted on the collector’s edition box art.. Nergigante is covered in spiky horns that regenerate over time, and the only way to prevent huge damage from coming your way is to stay aggressive and stop them from regenerating. Nergigante's den, covered in crystalized rock, makes for a thematically appropriate arena that only adds to this monster's mystique. Its ability to pummel you into the ground in a flash can make light work of even seasoned hunters. Between its design, arena, and theme, Nergigante stands tall among the greatest monsters of the series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Zinogre</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/1-zinogre-1739888257431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Our top dog, our best fanged wyvern. The thunder cat Zinogre takes our number one spot. Zinogre exudes a confidence unlike any other monster in the Monster Hunter universe. If Furious Rajang goes Super Saiyan when its fur glows yellow, then Zinogre goes Super Saiyan Blue. Its glorious scaled design and potent lightning attacks make Zinogre a truly fantastic monster. Thanks to storing Thunderbugs in its horns, it has the ability to supercharge itself with electric energy, which covers the arena in a light show rivaled only by a rave or late-night club excursion. Anytime this brawny wyvern commands the screen, we welcome it with open-arms, ready to lock horns with it. Zinogre is not a monster to be messed with, and one that we are always cheering for when it makes its return. Not only did Zinogre capture the hearts of fans when it debuted in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, but it captured the true spirit of the franchise. This creature is the blueprint for an excellent fight that contains fast-paced action, devastating power, and a rocking theme that worms its way into our brains. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are our top 25 monsters from the Monster Hunter series. There are literally hundreds of others that didn't make the cut, but from our adventures, these are creatures that we cherished facing the most. Let us know in the comments below what your favorite monster is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse Vitelli is a freelance writer and published author.

                <p>Sony's big push into the live-service market has been hit and miss, and the company is continuing to invest in the space with the next game from former Assassin's Creed boss Jade Raymond. Her team at the PlayStation-owned Haven Studios is making a heist-themed competitive game for PS5 and PC called Fairgame$--and yes, it's really styled that way.</p><p>Described as a "fresh, modern take on the heist genre," Fairgame$ aims to be a competitive heist game where people steal from the rich to "rebalance the scales" in a society where billionaires hold an increasingly large share of the wealth. While the game was conceived of years ago, this setup is certainly something that remains topical today.</p><p>Not much has been said or shown of the game, but there have been some details released so far, which we're compiling together in this post.</p><h2 id="When_will_Fairgame__be_released_"><strong>When will Fairgame$ be released?</strong></h2><p>Fairgame$ was announced in 2023 but was not given a release date, or window, at the time or since then. Recently, however, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonys-ps5-live-service-title-fairgame-has-reportedly-slipped/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb</a> reported that the game slipped internally and is now tentatively set for release in 2026.</p><p>Fairgame$ is the debut title from Haven Studios. As for Raymond, she's had a turbulent career after leaving Ubisoft. She<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-ea-assassins-creed-boss-joins-google-ahead-/1100-6465543/" data-ref-id="1100-6465543"> joined Google in 2019 to head up a new internal game team</a>, but in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-is-shutting-down-its-game-studios-impacting-150-people-including-jade-raymond/1100-6486978/" data-ref-id="1100-6486978">Google closed its game studios and Raymond departed.</a> In 2021, she founded Haven. Sony bought the company in 2022.</p><h2 id="Preorder_Fairgame_"><strong>Preorder Fairgame$</strong></h2><p>Fairgame$ is not yet available to preorder. In fact, we don't even know if it's going to be paid game at all.</p><h2 id="Fairgame__trailer"><strong>Fairgame$ trailer</strong></h2><p>The debut trailer for Fairgame$ was striking and impressive, but it didn't have any gameplay footage. Instead, the CG trailer was focused on setting the mood and tone for the game, which involves stealing from the rich as part of a heist-themed multiplayer experience. Check out the trailer below.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="273506159" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Sony doesn't bring its single-player games to PC simulataneously with PS5, but it does do that for live-service games. As such, Fairgame$ would be expected to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-wont-bring-first-party-titles-to-pc-for-at-least-a-year-except-live-service/1100-6508026/" data-ref-id="1100-6508026"> launch at the same time across PS5 and PC.</a></p><h2 id="Fairgame__story__setting__and_characters">Fairgame$ story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Creative director Mathieu Leduc said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-fairgame-a-competitive-heist-experience-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that Haven was founded with the goal of making games that its staffers wanted to play, and that's why the team chose a competitive multiplayer game.</p><p>"Fairgame$ came from a desire to create a new type of PvP game with emergent sandbox gameplay. We want to deliver a fresh multiplayer experience that rewards creativity and mastery and delivers surprising stories each and every time you play," Leduc said.</p><p>"In a nutshell, this is a thrilling competitive heist game where you join an underground movement to rob the ultra-rich and rebalance the scales," Leduc said.</p><p>As you can see in the announcement trailer, Fairgame$ has players going after billionaires who have "too much money and too much power." In the trailer, we see a squad of players infiltrating some kind of compound, working together to take down security guards with the apparent aim of sticking it to the man.</p><p>"Fairgame$ will give you an opportunity to break the rules as a modern-day Robin Hood, a thrill seeker, or just someone who wants to collect cool loot," Leduc said. "Trespass inside forbidden locations around the world, fill your pockets like a kid in a candy store and unravel the nefarious plans of untouchable billionaires."</p><h2 id="What_s_going_on_with_Sony_s_live_service_push_"><strong>What's going on with Sony's live-service push?</strong></h2><p>Back when Fairgame$ was announced in 2023, Sony was in the midst of a huge push and investment into the live-service market. At one point in time, Sony wanted to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games over the coming years</a> (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">halving its planned live-service game output</a>, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled</a> in December 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">smash sales records</a> and become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.</a></p><p>In July 2024, Sony's Destiny developer Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">announced mass layoffs and major structural changes</a>. A month later, Sony launched the multiplayer game Concord. It had such a dismal performance out of the gate that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players</a>. Its developer, Firewalk, was later closed.</p><p>At the end of 2024, Sony confirmed that it canceled multiple projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">live-service God of War and another live-service title from Bend.</a></p><p dir="ltr">It was reported in 2023 that PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who left Sony in 2024, had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">mandate that Sony's teams should make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were reportedly upset with this, and the blame was said to have fallen not on Ryan but Connie Booth, one of the most important and veteran PlayStation developers, leading to her eventual departure.</p><p dir="ltr">Another former PlayStation boss, Shuhei Yoshida, recently said the chance of finding success in the competitive live-service market was "small," but his replacement, Hermen Hulst, was given the resources to fund both single-player games and live-service titles at the same time. However, had Yoshida stayed in that role, he said he would have <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/" rel="nofollow ">"tried to resist"</a> the push into the live-service market. He joked, "That's one of the reasons they removed me."</p><p dir="ltr">For more on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/" data-ref-id="2900-6143">Sony's live-service games</a>, check out the gallery below to get the latest on the status of all the projects in the works.</p>
