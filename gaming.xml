<p>Small Indie Company has revealed that We The People will be playable during Steam’s Zombie Fest event, which starts on May 26 and runs to June 2. We The People is a tactical first-person shooter that has been in development for a few years at Small Indie Company. It’s inspired by games like Escape from Tarkov, Fallout, and Rainbow Six, and at first blush, it looks great.</p>



<p>I was fortunate enough to put the team at Small Indie Company to a few questions back in 2023. What I learned about We The People excited me, and in the latest devlog, the squad revealed the innovations and enhancements applied to the developing title over the last few months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-evolving">Evolving</h2>



<p>We The People will launch on Steam in early access <strong>when it’s ready</strong>. There’s no date for the game to hit the market just yet, but a playable demo will surface on May 26, giving gamers a limited window in which to test out the latest upgrades.</p>



<p>In a devlog posted on March 1, which was the first posted since April 2024, the team revealed what it had been working on for almost a year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Our Biggest Update Yet | Devlog #5 | We The People" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bw9Gn3k3Sf8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The key upgrades to We The People are centered around immersive in-game elements like recoil, weapon malfunctions, and suppression mechanics. The team has also fine-tuned throwables and the inventory menu, as well as optimised environments and tweaked movement mechanics.</p>



<p>This is all based on feedback secured during the last playtest.</p>



<p>We The People is set in a post-apocalyptic rendition of the United States, and that wasteland, you’re ‘one of the few left amongst the living dead’. I learned how all this would work when I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-the-people-game-interview/">caught up with Small Indie Company in 2023</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In many ways, we acknowledge we’re standing on the shoulders of giants like EFT and DayZ, and want to pay homage to them, show a level of irreverence for the work they’ve done and continue moving the extraction genre forward in a meaningful way.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re looking at We The People as a love letter to the genre, something that people will get to watch grow over time.</em>&nbsp;<em>We know what we want to provide in terms of a&nbsp; minimum viable product leading to our Early Access launch on Steam, as well as long-term plans for the game’s evolution over time</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Back then, I learned that the plan is to host in-game auction houses that operate on a peer-to-peer level, as well as vendors, dedicated questlines, and progression systems. There are desires to build out a safe zone which acts as a ‘hub’ central to the extraction shooter formula.</p>



<p>We The People <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2261560/We_The_People/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be wishlisted on Steam</a> ahead of the next playable demo going live.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twisted Metal Reboot Would Have Been a Third-Person Battle Royale, Images Reveal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twisted-metal-cancelled-battle-royale/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twisted-metal-reboot-would-have-been-a-third-person-battle-royale-images-reveal.1123098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twisted-metal-cancelled-battle-royale/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In February 2024, we reported on the cancellation of a new Twisted Metal game. The project was scrapped just a couple of months before the debut of the Twisted Metal live-action adaptation. The news came hand-in-hand with the revelation that a whopping 900 employees would be laid off, almost wiping out the studio making the game. </p>



<p>Not much was known or revealed about Twisted Metal when it was cancelled. It was confirmed that it had been in development ‘for some time’, but that’s as far as we got. Now, thanks to a former developer from Firesprite, the studio that was working on Twisted Metal, we know much more about the ill-fated title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-of-course">Battle Royale, Of Course</h2>



<p>On the portfolio site of a former UI lead who worked at Firesprite between 2022 and 2023, a few blurred images of the Twisted Metal title, along with a bit of context, were discovered.</p>



<p>Here’s what the UI programmer, Hugo Silva, <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote about Twisted Metal</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Project Copper was a 3rd person vehicular action combat game, it was based on a classic IP owned by PlayStation developed by Firesprite (PlayStation Studios) it had 3rd person shooter mechanics wrapped with 3rd person vehicle combat with the objective of being the last one standing.</p>



<p>I joined the team as the Lead UI Programmer and had to create the base UI system to be within the company moving forward, after establishing the system I had to start working on the bespoke needs of the project while managing the UI code team and being the bridge with the UX and UI art teams.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The images are branded with the blocker ‘UNDER NDA’, but it’s not exactly difficult to work out what game he’s referring to based on the information provided.</p>



<p>Sadly, the screenshots reveal something that could be stripped clean out of Fortnite, which is hardly impressive. The third-person perspective fused with vehicular combat and boots-on-the-ground fighting mechanics is hardly a fresh concept, and it might not have moved mountains were it ever released to the wider market.</p>



<p>Do you think a Twisted Metal battle royale would have done well? Let us know in the comments what you think.</p>



<p>(<em>thanks to MP1st for the Hugo Silva spot</em>)</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-verdansk-collection-stores/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-teases-%E2%80%98verdansk-collection%E2%80%99-that%E2%80%99s-set-to-drop-on-march-10.1123095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-verdansk-collection-stores/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you head to the Call of Duty merch store, you’ll be met with a pop-up promoting the ‘Verdansk Collection’, which comes with the tagline ‘drop back in’. There’s also a countdown set to expire on March 10, which has many thinking that the return of Verdansk will be formally announced on that day.</p>



<p>It has long been rumoured that Verdansk will make a grand return on March 20, five years after it first appeared when Call of Duty: Warzone debuted worldwide. It was Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively revealed the plans</a> to bring back Verdansk, the iconic first map in the insanely popular battle royale game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-coming">It’s Coming</h2>



<p>The prompt on the <a href="http://shop.callofduty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty shop</a> bears an iconic throwback to Verdnask – an image of the damn and the crashed plane in the wastelands beneath. It’s a snowy vista that we’ve all seen time and again, and on March 10, the full ‘Verdansk Collection’ will be revealed, whatever it may contain.</p>



<p>Fans have been chomping at the bit to get back to Verdansk since it was removed from the game in 2021. I’ve maintained that we don’t miss Verdansk, but the vibes we experienced playing it with our friends for the first time. The world was a different place back then, struggling under the weight of COVID-19, and Warzone made for a flawless escape from all that.</p>



<p>However, it’s not all sunshine and lollipops, as some prolific creators have stressed that even Verdansk isn’t enough to bring them back, given the state of the game. It’s no big secret that Warzone still has issues with performance, network stability, and cheaters.</p>



<p>Let’s hope all that is resolved (big hope) by March 10 – and even more so by March 20.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing what the Verdansk Collection contains? Let us know what you’re hoping to see in the comments below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Looks Like Daily Rewards Are Coming Back to Call of Duty]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/daily-rewards-coming-back-to-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-daily-rewards-are-coming-back-to-call-of-duty.1123023/</guid>

<p>In a post published on social media by a Call of Duty dataminer, it was suggested that a daily rewards system could be coming to Black Ops 6 when season three drops in March. The season is expected to bring back Verdansk in Warzone for the first time since 2021, so it makes sense that teams are anticipating ways to retain players to make the comeback much more worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-day-new-rewards">Every Day, New Rewards</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 doesn’t feature a daily login bonus system – even the free rewards periodically unlocked in the store have been paltry. Most players report getting endless strings of Double XP tokens and nothing else, whereas in previous games, players could get charms, sprays, calling cards, and emblems, all for free.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1895867334948241728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post from realityuk_</a> on Twitter, that might be set to change.</p>



<p>While the dataminer has uncovered nothing more than a menu and a prompt, it’s enough to assume that daily rewards are coming back when season three hits later this month.</p>



<p>In one image, Reality found a ‘Daily Login Reward’ pop-up that read:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To earn all rewards, log in on 7 seperate days before unclaimed rewards expire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This hasn’t been addressed or even alluded to by the teams working on Black Ops 6, and as it’s a datamined asset, it’s worth taking the imagery with a pinch of salt. These things are always subject to change, unfortunately.</p>



<p>It’s nice if it’s true, though. Despite the state of Warzone right now, the return of Verdansk is guaranteed to bring players flooding back, and nothing makes players happy like free items.</p>



<p>It was suggested recently by a Call of Duty leaker that Verdansk is returning to Warzone as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/">pretty much the OG version</a>‘ that was released in 2020. That was when Warzone was created, becoming one of the most popular battle royale games in history as tens of millions of players flocked to the title.</p>



<p>Will you be taking advantage of free daily rewards if they come to Black Ops 6? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>PlayStation's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">recently cancelled Twisted Metal game</a> was reportedly a battle royale.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/cancelled-twisted-metal-live-service-a-battle-royale-featuring-out-of-vehicle-combat">MP1st</a>, the abandoned game - known internally as Project Copper - allegedly blended third-person shooting mechanics alongside the vehicular combat the series is known for.</p>

<p>How do we know this? A UI programmer working at Firesprite from April 2022 to October 2023 has <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1">uploaded</a> obscured screenshots from the work-in-progress to their portfolio. Whilst the game isn't explicitly mentioned and the images are blurred, you can nonetheless still see early prototypes of the third-person action both in and out of vehicles.</p>
<p>"I was part of Project Copper leading the UI team," the developer wrote on their online portfolio. "I was tasked with creating a generic UI system to be used in multiple projects in the company, I was also managing a team of 2 UI Programmers while working with other teams."</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Firesprite</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for the game itself? The dev describes Project Copper a "third person vehicular action combat game based on a classic IP owned by PlayStation developed by Firesprite (PlayStation Studios)".</p>
<p>"It had third person shooter mechanics wrapped with third person vehicle combat with the objective of being the last one standing," they added.</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including two more in January</a>.
</p>
<p>In related news, just last week, Peacock shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-twisted-metal-season-two">first trailer for the second season of Twisted Metal</a>. The upcoming second series stars Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, Joe Seanoa, Will Arnett and Anthony Carrigan.</p>
<p>"As they try to survive an onslaught of dangerous new foes and familiar faces alike, including the murderous clown Sweet Tooth, things get complicated for John when he reunites with his long-lost sister, the vigilante Dollface," reads the official blurb.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhorse has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> official mod support&nbsp;<span>for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 soon, but in the meantime, modders continue to find ways to improve the highly successful first-person open world role-playing game that just celebrated selling</span>&nbsp;two million units in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>Nexus user nimbul recently <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a utility mod that loads configuration (CFG) variables correctly even after level loading. Without it, the game reverts to default variables. Thanks to this mod, Nexus user vktrfly worked on those variables to improve the global illumination quality in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with great results</a>, as you can see in the screenshots and the footage below.</p>

<figure></figure>


<figure></figure>


<figure></figure>


<figure></figure>

<p>According to the modder, the following two variables can be used to further enhance indirect lighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>e_svoTI_DiffuseConeWidth = 4 ; Reduces light leak, default is 8</li>
<li>e_svoTI_NumberOfBounces = 2 ; Medium performance impact. Default is 2 at Ultra and above</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter can go up to 3 but will have a greater performance impact and may not be worth it, according to the author. Still, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-polished-impeccable-smoothness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is extremely well optimized</a>, so users with the latest GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards may be tempted to try it - especially if they are subscribed to PureDark's Patreon and can, therefore, access his DLSS Multi Frame Generation mod for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>

<p>There is a downside, however: this global illumination mod cannot be used in conjunction with the previously covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Async Compute mod</a>. The author wrote:</p>
<p><em>If you encounter strobing, flickering, or pulsing lighting effects, they are not caused by this mod. Make sure you are not using AsyncCompute Enabler and e_svoTI_AsyncCompute = 1 is not in your user.cfg. AsyncCompute causes issues with global illumination, and Enhanced GI makes those issues extremely apparent.</em></p>
<p>Warhorse is currently preparing <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's first free content update</a>. Scheduled to launch in Spring, it will add barbers to change Henry's look, horse racing, and a proper Hardcore mode. Later this year, three premium DLCs will also be released.</p>

<p>Raven Forge have announced two brand-new full-scale replica swords from Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Both Yasuke’s Wakizashi &amp; Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;from Assassin’s Creed Shadows are <a href="https://ravenforge.com/collections/the-raven-forge-legend-collection-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now for pre-order</a>, with Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;costing £139.99 and Yasuke’s Wakizashi costing £199.99. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first full-scale replica from Raven Forge on Assassin’s Creed either, as late late year the company announced&nbsp;a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-scale-replica-of-assassins-creeds-altairs-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica of Assassins Creed’s Altaïr’s Sword</a> from the original game.</p>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-s-wakizashi">Yasuke’s Wakizashi&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The wakizashi, a revered sidearm of the samurai, was traditionally worn alongside a katana—a symbol of status, duty, and skill. This exceptional replica features an intricately wrapped faux rayskin handle and saya (scabbard), custom menuki (handle ornaments), and a tsuba inspired by the crest of the Oda clan. Every detail has been thoughtfully recreated to bring Yasuke’s weapon to life.</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 670mm<br>Blade Length: 500mm<br>Grip Length: 170mm<br>Blade Width (base): 30mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 776g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></p></div>



<h2 id="h-naoe-s-tanto">Naoe’s Tantō</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A weapon of both practicality and prestige, the tantō served as a trusted sidearm of the samurai and was also wielded with remarkable skill by the Onna-musha, the warrior women of feudal Japan. This faithful reproduction features a beautifully wrapped faux rayskin handle, ornate menuki (handle embellishments), and a strikingly detailed saya (scabbard).</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 430mm<br>Blade Length: 295mm<br>Grip Length: 128mm<br>Blade Width (base): 26mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 425g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel&nbsp;<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></strong></p></div>

            <p>Once Human's cross-platform test for PC and mobile is now live.</p>
<p>Running from now until 30th March, players in Europe, Japan, and North America are able to jump into NetEase's free-to-play PvPvE sandbox action horror before the mobile port - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">back in September</a> - launches in April 2025 and test the "seamless" cross-progression features across PC and mobile.</p>

<p>"Once Human's cross-platform test uses the current global server environment that's being used by the PC version of the game," NetEase explains. "This means that all of the content from the PC version, including all the Scenarios and the Visional Wheel/Lunar Oracle, can be experienced by mobile players throughout the test."</p>

<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671570/Out_and_About/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> has all the bright colors and cheerful local people you’d expect of the genre, but the core of the game is surprisingly realistic, asking you to correctly identify various real-life plants.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Out and About - Short Steam Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3lqJUUH76B8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>At the start of the demo, a storm destroys the town where you’re visiting your grandmother. On your way from your campsite you meet the local forager, who tasks you with finding plants to heal an injured resident. Developer Yaldi Games says the game contains over 100 real-world plants; each one you find grows next to one that looks very similar. Some of these similarities are no big deal–the consequences of mixing up chamomile and daisy are fairly minor–but others have toxic lookalikes, like hemlock and yarrow.</p><p>The plant identification mini-game is pretty simple: after taking a photo of your finds (<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alas</a>), you’re given two cards with clues to each plant’s identity. Verifying which plant is which involves clicking around on the plant until you check the various details listed on the card. Then, you can harvest the plant, taking care not to take too much of its flowers and leaves. You’re also tasked with sorting the plants you’ve collected, which presents a slightly harder identification game that only gives you bits of cuttings and less clues. None of it is too taxing, but I really enjoyed studying the game’s renditions of real plants and learning about their uses.</p><p>You use the plants you’ve gathered to craft–in the demo, you make a stinging nettle soup, a green I’ve sometimes seen at the farmer’s market and never understood why people buy, and which I am now really curious to use; thanks, video games! You sell the stuff you craft at the local market, where customers come to you with various needs that can be met by your snacks, balms, and medicines. Again, it’s not too hard, but it’s fun to think about what might be best for the townsfolk from your stock. Yaldi writes that “All 150+ recipes in the game are real, and we'll give you step-by-step instructions on how to make them at home,” which sounds very cool. (The game also opens with a giant-font warning that it is not a guide to real-life foraging, which feels like a very necessary caveat.)</p><p>Aesthetically, <em>Out and About</em> looks like the kind of game I tend to find a little too twee, but your mileage will vary there given your own personal tastes. In a press release, Yaldi described itself as having "a mission to craft hobby games infused with real, actionable knowledge that enriches players' lives." I’m intrigued by that claim to fidelity and really enjoyed what I experienced of it in the demo. The full game is set to release later this year.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman"><h3>Major Publishers Can’t Keep Making Fewer, Bigger Games</h3></a><p>"Destined to fail.
