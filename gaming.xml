            <p>Results of a Capcom poll designed to find out its players' most beloved games and characters have been published, and Dino Crisis fared pretty well overall.</p>
<p>When those taking part were asked if there were any Capcom franchises they would like to see get either a sequel or a new game, the Dino Crisis series came out on tricera-top, with 80,769 votes. "Please remake Dino Crisis or release a sequel. I know my message will be one of possibly millions but please release one for us fans," one respondent wrote.</p>
<p>When asked which Capcom games players liked the best, 10,978 of 254,148 respondents listed Dino Crisis. This put Capcom's reptilian survival horror in second place for this particular category, with Devil May Cry 5 taking first with 15,157 votes. Last year's Resident Evil 4 rounded out the top three, with 9017 total votes.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is clear that even years after its most recent entry, Dino Crisis remains beloved. In fact, when Capcom first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-announces-exoprimal-a-new-dinosaur-game-for-playstation">unveiled Exoprimal back in 2022</a>, many assumed and hoped this was Dino Crisis getting some sort of reboot. However, this was not the case.</p>
<p>But will Capcom ever look at its latest community findings and decide to give Dino Crisis the remake treatment? After all, it has been steadily doing that with its Resident Evil games, with latest reports suggesting Capcom has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">remakes of both Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> in the pipeline. Sadly, I cannot say right now, but I have emailed Capcom to see if it has any comment on Dino Crisis' enduring popularity. It is quite impressive to see the series still rated so highly among the Capcom community.</p>

			<p>Microsoft's rumored Xbox Gamescom 2024 showcase is said to be a major event, according to Xbox insider and&nbsp;Kinda Funny XCast's Parris Lilly.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Microsoft's Xbox showcase from some days ago was among Xbox's best showcases to date. Granted, given the recent controversy over Microsoft's multi-platform route, a solid show was needed. Still, credit needs to be given where credit is due and Xbox delivered with bangers such as the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War reboot</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, but also <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-compulsion-games-upcoming-deep-south-folktale-receives-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, however, the Xbox team had much more up on its sleeve, and there's a lot more coming from Xbox as part of this year's annual Gamescom event in Cologne. At least, that is what Parris Lilly <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot31-perfect-doom.894510/page-81?post=124310400#post-124310400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> on the ResetEra forums recently. "told ya that Showcase was gonna be good and the wild thing is I had multiple people at Xbox tell me there was so much more they could have shown", the Xbox insider wrote. He added, "Gamescom is shaping up to be a big show too."</p>
<p>No additional details were shared, but we're pretty interested to learn if Microsoft indeed has more to show to the community. Games that spring to mind include Project Mara, Clockwork Revolution, Everwild, Blade, Kojima's OD, The Elder Scrolls VI, Contraband, and various others.</p>
<p>Microsoft has yet to officially confirm its presence during Gamescom 2024, but given its attendance during the annual event over the past decade, it's likely that the brand will be attending the event in Cologne this year as well. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about this year's Gamescom event. What are you expecting from Gamescom 2024? Which parties do you expect to attend the event? As covered back in April of this year - <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-switch-2-reveal-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo won't be attending the event</a>. Meanwhile, rival Sony has also yet to confirm whether it will attend the event in Germany.</p>

Picking up right after the cliffhanger ending of the first season—which saw Jinx launching a rocket at the Piltover council—the season is going to be a hectic battle between the cities of Piltover and Zaun. To set the stage, we see Caitlyn forming a special task force of enforcers with the mission of going into Zaun and taking down Jinx. Vi (Jinx’s sister and dual protagonist of the show alongside Caitlyn) is on the task force, decked out in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arcane-season-2-netflix-teaser-caitlyn-vi-enforcer-1851526004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arcane-season-2-netflix-teaser-caitlyn-vi-enforcer-1851526004">enforcer uniform</a></span> that signals how much her allegiances have changed. </p><p>A climactic confrontation between Jinx and Vi near the end of the trailer has Vi calling her sister Jinx rather than her original name of Powder, further showing that she no longer sees Jinx as redeemable. The dour tone of the trailer is starting to make me even more worried for the show’s finale, which Jinx actor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-sex-bethesda-amazon-1851423433&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-sex-bethesda-amazon-1851423433">Ella Purnell</a></span> teased would be “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/i-cried-arcane-star-claims-season-2-of-the-hit-netflix-show-will-emotionally-devastate-fans&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/i-cried-arcane-star-claims-season-2-of-the-hit-netflix-show-will-emotionally-devastate-fans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devastating</a></span>.”</p><p>But there is still hope for life after <em>Arcane</em> because while it is indeed the final season of the show, Riot doesn’t seem to be done with adaptations. Anticipating fan outcry, the official <em>Arcane</em> Twitter account posted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1800545290241667414&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1800545290241667414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">message</a></span> from show co-creator (and Riot Creative Director) Christian Linke directly under the trailer. First off, Linke assures fans that the team has always had a specific ending in mind, so the story of <em>Arcane</em> isn’t being rushed in the finale. Linke then goes on to say that the show is “just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey,” as well as revealing that Riot is currently working on new projects across film and television that will give other <em>League of Legends </em>characters the spotlight. Linke also revealed that Riot’s partnership with Fortiche, the animation studio behind <em>Arcane</em>, is not over.</p><hr><p>As for what other characters could possibly get the <em>Arcane</em> treatment, Linke didn’t drop any hints. I personally want a pirate story set in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-new-turn-based-league-of-legends-game-is-one-of-the-1848137822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-new-turn-based-league-of-legends-game-is-one-of-the-1848137822">Bilgewater</a></span> starring Miss Fortune, though I think a project focused on the more magical side of the <em>League of Legends </em>world is also full of potential. But for now, I’ll just wait to watch <em>Arcane</em>’s end.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of them is Emmrich Volkarin, a human necromancer who is part of the Mourn Watch faction in the magical country of Tevinter. He’s also a romance option.

In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, Busche discussed the RPG’s romance and sex scenes, and brought up Emmrich’s specifically. While she didn’t go into much detail, she did describe the mage’s love scene as “more intimate and sensual,” compared to other party members.</p><p>“Some of them are more spicy than others,” Busche told <em>IGN</em>. “Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive, and some of them are more...we have a gentleman necromancer, for instance, that is more intimate and sensual.”</p><p>Fans proceeded to go absolutely feral.</p><p>Like the rest of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s party members, Emmrich will be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">romanceable by any variation of protagonist Rook</a></span>. So this is equal opportunity thirst for an old man floating around the <em>Dragon Age </em>fandom. Personally, I already fell in love with a mustached Tevinter mage in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, so I’m not trying to repeat myself in the fourth game. But who knows, he may steal my heart just as Dorian did ten years ago.</p><p>If you want to learn more about Emmrich, he debuted in the <em>Tevinters Nights </em>anthology book, in which we get a sense of his necromancy skills. He has a skeleton assistant named Manfred, though it remains to be seen if he will have any opinions on the thirst people are feeling for his boss. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Epic Games has announced that legendary metal band Metallica is coming to Fortnite Festival with Season 4 alongside a brand new game mode called Battle Stage.</p>



<p>Battle Stage is a PvP mode where 16 players battle across a four-song setlist to be the last rockstar standing. Players will be able to attack each other in order to disrupt performances, and knockout them out of the battle.</p>



<p>“Each public Battle Stage match begins with up to 16 players, all competing to get the highest score on a randomly chosen song from Festival’s featured rotation,” Epic Games said. “You’ll play the same track as other players but get to choose your song part and difficulty as you riff your way to the highest score. Owned Jam Tracks cannot be selected, so no one player has an advantage. </p>



<p>“The four lowest-scoring players are eliminated at the end of each song until there’s a single victor!”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, it has been revealed that Valve is facing a £656 million ($840 million) lawsuit, with accusations surfacing that the tech titan is using Steam to ‘take advantage of UK gamers’. At the heart of the suit is the claim that Valve has been ‘rigging the market’ for years, shutting out competition and holding a monopoly over the PC gaming market.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-lot-of-damage-s">That’s a Lot of Damage(s)</h2>



<p>This landmark lawsuit seeks serious reparations from Valve in the United Kingdom. In 2023, Valve reported record-high revenues on Steam, pulling in more than $9 billion globally and selling more than 580 million games. This data comes courtesy of VG Insights (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via the BBC</a>). </p>



<p>It has been alleged by the claim filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal that Valve charges excessive commissions on games, which forces UK-based PC gamers to purchase digital software at a price far higher than they would on other platforms, such as Xbox or PlayStation. In this collective action claim, Valve has been slammed by digital rights campaigners who have branded the company as ‘unlawful’.</p>



<p>In a statement, Milberg’s Natasha Pearman, the leading partner in this lawsuit, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>UK gamers spend billions every year and Valve has a stranglehold on the PC gaming market. Competition law is there to protect consumers and ensure that markets work properly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Historically, Milberg has worked with consumers to combat the likes of Sony – in 2022, the London-based law firm took the titanic Japanese tech company to court with a £5 billion class-action suit for similar claims.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite Festival</a> Season 4 is coming very soon, and before you head into it yourself, be sure to hydrate, remove your glasses, and wear your moshing shoes, because it's Metallica season. Following three seasons focused on major pop artists, Fortnite Festival is leaning into an entirely new genre for Harmonix's game within a game. Here's what to expect with the launch of Fortnite Season 4.</p><h2>Fortnite Festival Pass - Season 4</h2><p>This season's pass offers the customary free and paid paths, both of which include several new cosmetics. One big change this season, however, is how many more skins you'll get for buying into the premium track of the Festival Pass. All four members of Metallica have been turned into Fortnite outfits, with Lars Ulrich unlocking immediately upon purchasing the premium track, while Kirk Hamett, Robert, Trujilio, and frontman James Hetfield can be unlocked as you progress through the season's challenges.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmVDgkr1WIM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JmVDgkr1WIM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The premium version of the pass also includes Metallica's nearly eight-minute banger, One, which will make for quite an endurance test in the game. The band members' iconic instruments can be found in the premium pass too, such as Ulrich's TAMA drum kit and Hammett's Gibson "Greeny" Les Paul guitar.</p><p>The premium track of the pass can be unlocked for 1800 V-Bucks (about $18). If you stick to the free track, you'll still enjoy the new Slurp Blaster guitar, as well as several new songs from Epic Games: S.O.M.P., The Night Porter (Winnage), and Dreamer. Additionally, you can claim the mosh-pit-approved Dark Flame Aura and Roundhouse emote.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317605-1%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317605" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317605-1%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317605"></a><figcaption>Instrument rewards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317605-1%2816%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317607-1%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317608-1%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317609-1%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317610-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317607,1300-4317608,1300-4317609,1300-4317610" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317607-1%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317608-1%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317609-1%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317610-1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317607-1%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317608-1%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317609-1%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317610-1.jpg"></figure><h2>Fortnite Festival Battle Stage</h2><p>Fortnite Festival is getting a new competitive PvP mode, throwing 16 players into a last-rockstar-standing match. Played with a four-song setlist, four players will be eliminated after each song--three for the last song--until one musical maestro stands victorious.</p><p>To even the playing field, you'll choose your instrument and difficulty but can't select songs from your library. The Overdrive multiplier feature already seen in Festival will now allow for attacks to be launched at your rivals, which can disrupt their streaks and slow their scoring. The game also uses a skill-based matchmaking system so players can be grouped with others at their level rather than land in a lobby with Tosin Abasi.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317611-1%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317611" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317611-1%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317611"></a><figcaption>The Battle Stage has arrived.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317611-1%289%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317612-1%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317613-1%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317614-1%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317615-1%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317612,1300-4317613,1300-4317614,1300-4317615" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317612-1%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317613-1%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317614-1%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4317615-1%287%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317612-1%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317613-1%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317614-1%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317615-1%287%29.jpg"></figure><h2>New Fortnite Festival Shop Items</h2><p>Like other seasons of Harmonix's social music game, you can also find alternative versions of Metallica's foursome in the Item Shop.

			<p>Shin Megami Tensei 5 Vengeance asks a very simple, but poignant question: what if the world had ended, and we didn’t even realise? From the Mayans to Nostradamus, many soothsayers have predicted the end times over the years, and while we laughed, we moved on…. what if they were right? What if God had plucked us from existence and let us live on in a parallel world while war rages in the real world? A war started the Christian God who took the throne at the top of the pantheon by turning His brethren into demons by taking their Knowledge.</p>
<p>The snake that tempted Adam and Eve? A demon trying to regain godhood by regaining its Knowledge. The end of the world? Legions of demons dethroning the God of Law who usurped the throne millennia ago.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance - Launch Trailer | NSW, PS5/4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Steam, PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/esJS9uV4qYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For such an interesting narrative, Shin Megami Tensei 5 — and its new, definitive edition, Vengeance — has a paper thin plot that you really have to work to unlock. It’s always going to be difficult not to compare the SMT franchise to its spin off series, Persona, in part because of the shared pantheon and battle systems, but when the Persona franchise drips panache and charm at every turn, newcomers to SMT are going to come with extremely high hopes and standards.</p>
<p>While SMT5V is very good, long-time Persona fans should temper their expectations.</p>

<p>Initially a Switch exclusive when it launched in 2021, this fifth instalment in the franchise was well received for its interesting battle systems, excellent music, overall wit and charm. Even its graphics were heralded, as long as you didn’t look too far into the distance.</p>

<p>The core gameplay for the multi-platform Vengeance is much the same — you’re very swiftly swept into Da’at (a post-apocalyptic Tokyo), and forced to fight to survive. The gameplay, even on Casual mode, can be punishing, meaning that you need to start expanding your party by charming demons with your silver tongue, and grinding all of the XP you can out of lower-level demons. It takes a solid ten hours to fight your way back to the real world for the first meaningful, albeit short-lived, dose of the plot.</p>
<p>Vengeance is the definitive edition of the game, adding an entirely new storyline that runs in parallel. While the original did give you choices, they boiled down to basically ‘say yes’ or ‘gloomily say yes’; there was no meaningful difference to your decision. Vengeance offers you an actual choice from the start: do you chose the Path of Creation (the original story) or the all new Path of Vengeance?</p>

<p>It’s a little jarring for newbies to be presented such a meaningful choice so early in the game, with no idea or context as to how this will shape things. Still, seasoned veterans of Da’at will likely enjoy knowing early on that they’re locked into the new experience that they will pick up the game to play.</p>
<p>Talking of the new stuff, the graphics have been overhauled, as is standard for Switch games being ported to anything more powerful (which is basically everything). The things that you should care about, like your demon army and the cast of named characters look great. However, many other NPCs exist as creepy, faceless creatures. There aren’t that many NPCs that adding a pair of eyes would break the PS5 hardware, so it must be a strange creative choice that Atlus has stuck with.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there’s a couple of other new additions, from an expanded demon compendium to being able to save anywhere on the overworld map — a huge boon in such a difficult game where you could previously only save at specific checkpoints</p>
<p>The expanded compendium is always going to be a plus — the demons in this franchise have always been great fun, and talking to them is incredibly personable. Some are cute and meek, others are sweary brutes; each new encounter is an engaging conversation. Being able to talk to these demons in the overworld is also incredible, with friendly demons chatting to you or giving you quests. It all adds to the feeling of a lived in world, no matter how dark and unnerving the Tokyo wasteland has become.</p>

<p>Auto battle is also a nice addition, allowing your team to auto-pilot their way through battles, using the right spells against enemies you know the weaknesses of, and testing the water with newer enemies by trying different spells and seeing what works.</p>
<p>Everything else remains the same — a brutally tough grind that, if you can get past the rougher edges, reveals a very well put-together RPG that hardcore fans will love.</p>

		<p>It might feel like it’s been almost no time at all since the launch of Fallout 76, but what if I told you that it’s been over five years? You might feel yourself physically withering away, your face peeling away like it’s the claymation death of an Indiana Jones baddie, transforming you into a noseless Ghoul. Speaking of which…</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: Skyline Valley Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yHLtDrbLqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The next big update for Fallout 76 is upon us, with Bethesda having pumped out content update after content update in the last few years, after that initial recovery drive from the game’s ill-fated initial launch. We’ve had big updates in the past, such as 2020’s Wastelanders bringing NPCs into the world, or the more recent addition of Expeditions to places like Atlantic City, but with today’s Skyline Valley update, we’re getting the first expansion to the core map of Appalachia.</p>
<p>This is the first of its kind, bolting a new area to explore onto the bottom of Appalachia, the forests of the Shenandoah National Park. Importantly, it’s been designed so that both newcomers and veteran players can explore this region as they see fit, allowing everyone to jump straight into the new stuff.</p>


<p>The Forest is blanketed by a permanent and ominous looking storm cloud, crackling with ozone, and playing home to some new creatures and creations to encounter. At its epicentre is Vault 63, a vault entirely inhabited by Ghouls… but not just any type of Ghouls. The Lost, as they call themselves, are strangely electrified, and are fiercely protective of their small enclave, willing to defend themselves against all outsides.</p>
<p>There’s basically just one exception to this in the character of Hugo Stoltz, a character that you’ll be able to befriend, or betray as you learn more about them.</p>
<p>Also stepping out from Vault 63 are the Storm Goliaths, supersized robo-brans with electrical attacks that have been developed by the geniuses in the vault. At the other end of the scale is the Thrasher, an oversized turkey velociraptor monstrosity that you’ll have to deal with.</p>

<p>In addition to the main story of this new locale is a hefty batch of quest content equivalent to the Steel Dawn and Steel Reign updates combined – there’s 12 quests to follow. Then there’s new camp themed rewards to earn with the mascot Marshal Mallow and Season 17, and a new public event, Dangerous Pastimes, which challenges you to go storm chasing and charge up a lightning rod with electrical energy.</p>
<p>More than anything, Skyline Valley will give Bethesda a fresh canvas to paint on in the months and years to come. Later this year they’ll bring more content into this space, including the Halloween themed Mischief Night event, and Milepost Zero, which introduces Blueridge Caravan Company routes that you’ll be able to take missions to defend from ambushes and attacks. Successfully run these convoy missions and you’ll unlock a caravan outpost of your own, similar in function to houses in Skyrim. You’ll be able to upgrade the decor, expand it and add specialty vendors that will sell exclusive gear.</p>

<p>It will all come to a head in early 2025 where the ability to play as a Ghoul will be added. This unlocks for players as they reach level 50, presenting them with a quest to start transforming into a Ghoul, doling out unique benefits that can be drawn from radiation as well as Ghoul-specific perk cards that will layer on top of everything you’ve already earned. This distinctive appearance will certainly help you stand out from other players, and it will also affect faction relationships and bring fresh in-game experiences to test your high level character.</p>
<p>But details on that will have to wait for another day…</p>
<p>For now, Bethesda are happily touting that more than 17 million players have dipped a toe into Fallout 76 at one time or another. With the series as a whole enjoying the warm glow of success from the Fallout TV show, and with Skyline Valley giving plenty of reasons to either get back into or visit Appalachia for the first time, I can see that number climbing a fair bit higher in the next few weeks and months.</p>

  <p id="zx7887">The world of <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em> can be an unforgiving place.</p>
<p id="tpuERD">Tokyo is under siege by demons of all stripes. The throne of heaven sits silent and unoccupied. An extradimensional civil war threatens to rip reality apart. And just to add to insult to injury, Mothman is waiting to shake you down for cash during a random battle, leaving you with no choice but to fork over thousands of bucks and slink away with your tail between your legs despite fielding a team of literal gods because you’re still reeling from the poor choices you made in a previous fight and you don’t want to lose half an hour of progress returning to an earlier save.</p>
<p id="VWTvfI">Unlike, say, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/21/12992500/shin-megami-tensei-4-apocalypse-review-nintendo-3ds"><em>Shin Megami Tensei 4: Apocalyps</em>e</a>’s relationship to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/11/4512914/shin-megami-tensei-4-review-sympathy-for-the-devil"><em>Shin Megami Tensei 4</em></a> on the Nintendo 3DS, <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em> acts as more of an expansion than a sequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22762591/shin-megami-tensei-5-review-atlus-nintendo-switch">the 2021 original</a>. The move from Switch exclusivity to also launching simultaneously on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Windows PC means the game looks gorgeous and performs a great deal better on those beefier platforms. More importantly, it also includes a handful of quality-of-life features as well as a reimagined narrative with new characters and story beats. But don’t worry if you skipped <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5</em> the first time around, as you get to choose between the vanilla and updated plots at the beginning of the game.</p>

<p id="enXoMA"><em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em>, at least on paper, stands tall among even the franchise’s best entries thanks to a mix of compelling gameplay and stylish aesthetics. Every battle, the foundations of which rely on exploiting enemies’ elemental weaknesses to earn yourself more turns for damage-dealing, health-healing, and status-effecting, plays out with the layered strategy of a chess match. Megami Tensei is unlike any of its genre contemporaries, sporting a combat rhythm made more exciting in <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5</em> and, now, <em>Vengeance</em> thanks to the introduction of a Street Fighter-like special meter used for activating techniques that range from guaranteeing critical damage to improving all of your team’s stats for a limited time.</p>
<p id="MMYjGc">Exploration in <em>Vengeance</em> is also far more easygoing compared to the original <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5</em>. Allowing players to save their progress anywhere rather than just at designated checkpoints and to utilize rail-grinding shortcuts for bypassing repeated trips through tough areas makes it so there are fewer opportunities for gut-wrenching game overs. That’s not to say there’s no danger at all, of course: Every battle, from boss encounters to those scary, random fights against Mothman and his buddies, carries the same weight. All it takes is one wrong move to see your entire turn disappear and your enemies given free rein to barrage you with their strongest attacks. Still, you’ll rarely lose much progress upon being sent back bloodied and bruised to the title screen if you take advantage of the game’s various quality-of-life adjustments.</p>
<p id="1SBddr">Unfortunately, useful safety nets like these only exacerbate my deepest criticisms elsewhere. <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em> is so fun and user-friendly that, when combined with a narrative that’s paper-thin and lightweight during even the most serious story moments, it’s often too easy to overlook or even forget altogether the grim trappings the game should have inherited from its predecessors. Megami Tensei franchise heavyweights like<em> Nocturne</em>, <em>Strange Journey</em>, and the Digital Devil Saga duology balanced captivating combat and beautiful visuals with oppressive atmospheres that imparted the overwhelming weight of their almost Lovecraftian storylines. Imparting that weight effectively is not just about difficulty despite Megami Tensei games being known for their brutal, slogging campaigns.</p>

<p id="QSFXOS"><em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em> rarely treats the inherent horror of staring down ancient, supernatural forces that exist outside the realm of human consciousness with the gravity that the premise deserves, either through gameplay or in its dual plotlines. Put simply, the abyss blinks. Important characters die and are resurrected without so much as a double-take from the largely emotionless cast. Worldview-shattering revelations are given little room to resonate before the player gets sent off on their next mission. And rather than being characters who evolve naturally over the course of the story, allies and enemies alike deliver baffling soliloquies with all the passion of a middle school play. </p>
<p id="wsrwID">While it’s common to joke about the trend of role-playing games like Final Fantasy culminating in climactic “kill god” moments, the uppercase God of Christianity is very real (and often very pissed) in the Megami Tensei mythos, existing alongside a cornucopia of deities, spirits, and other supernatural entities from just about every real-world religion and culture across the globe. No matter your belief system, there’s a big difference between facing off against a <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Kefka_Palazzo">clown-makeup-wearing magician</a> elevated to artificial godhood and attempting to wipe the literal creator of all things from existence, but Megami Tensei’s operated with this level of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMGWWpyFGFU">Vince McMahon-style hubris</a> for close to four decades. It’s because of this pedigree that <em>Vengeance</em>’s failure to elevate <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5</em>’s narrative shortcomings as much as it elevated everything else in the original feels like such a disappointment.</p>

<p id="AHbNvW">I also can’t wrap my head around the addition of the new Demon Haunts feature, which provides players the opportunity to hang out with the ghouls and ghosts currently in their squad. You can chat them up and even give them gifts, and they’ll reward you with basic items and marginal stat gains. A diversion like this would feel right at home in Pokémon, where you’re encouraged to grow attached to your favorite pocket monsters, but it just winds up being confusing here. You shouldn’t form attachments to the monsters in this game because you won’t be seeing them for long, at least if you want to make any headway against late-game bosses. Due to <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em>’s slow experience gains and limited move pools, you need to treat your allies as fodder for fusing into bigger, stronger demons, or else you’re leaving yourself open to copious ass beatings. Let’s face it: The usefulness of cutesy franchise mascot Jack Frost pales in comparison to a late-game powerhouse like Maria, the literal mother of Jesus Christ. I learned to mostly ignore the Demon Haunt system after my first several hours with <em>Vengeance</em> and didn’t feel like I missed out on anything important.</p>
<p id="zR1UUT">I, like many others, used to describe the Megami Tensei series as “Pokémon for adults,” but I no longer believe that shorthand is entirely accurate. Megami Tensei is Pokémon for the ruthless, those able to exchange compassion and attachment for the cold reality of spiritual warfare. <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em>’s “save anywhere” feature, overworld shortcuts, and shallow storyline, however, result in a too-frictionless and therefore flat experience. The moment-to-moment gameplay may still be as fulfilling as any previous Megami Tensei game when it strikes a delicate balance between new and old mechanics, but <em>Vengeance</em>’s overall lack of texture fails to live up to the important narrative themes of struggle, loss, sacrifice, and rebirth established by the franchise over the last 40 years. </p>

  <p id="tn5zCw"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22979840/unmatched-hells-kitchen-board-game-review"><em>Unmatched</em></a>, the tremendous action board game franchise from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22778194/thunder-road-kickstarter-canceled-restoration-games-interview">Restoration Games</a>, sends its newest standalone expansion into the world today. Titled <a href="https://restorationgames.com/shop/unmatched-slings-and-arrows/"><em>Unmatched: Slings and Arrows</em></a>, it stars The Bard himself, master William Shakespeare, alongside a handful of his most memorable creations. If you have ever suffered through sophomore English Language Arts class or, gods forbid, actually majored in English literature as I have, you’re in for a treat.</p>
<p id="aTVBAm">In Unmatched, players take on the role of beloved characters from pop culture only to pit them against one another in 1v1 or 2v2 battles. The system relies on action cards to power its combat, as well as collectible game boards that provide unique limitations on movement and line of sight. But beyond that solid foundation of gameplay, the franchise is best known for its ever growing collection of characters which include Robin Hood, Ms. Marvel, Houdini, and Bruce Lee, to name just a few. It’s the only modern board game I know of that will allow you to pit Spider-Man against the cast of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, then let the raptors from <em>Jurassic Park</em> take on the winner.</p>
<p id="V5V4SA"><em>Slings and Arrows</em> adds six new mainline characters to the <em>Unmatched</em> universe, as well as a smattering of sidekicks. Best of all, each of the four potent forces inside the box plays completely differently.</p>

<p id="TXisou">Shakespeare is accompanied by three sidekicks, which are essentially nameless actors. His cards are powerful enough, with plenty of ways to land a blow or take one in stride. The gimmick is that in playing cards to the table, you’re also trying to create a 10-syllable line of poetry. Once you string together enough words, you get a bonus effect from the first card played in the line. And yes, performance of that line, once formed, is required to score —  it’s in the rules!</p>

<p id="xtRduH">The Wayward Sisters, also known as the three witches from Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em>, come with their own cardboard cauldron. Each of their action cards contains an ingredient, and by playing cards of the right type in the right order you’ll be able to cast spells granting additional movement, enhanced damage, and more.</p>

<p id="M6is3n">Unmatched gives some additional color to Hamlet, interpreting him in its own way just as the best actors have over the centuries. Here his “madness” is very much in his control, indicated by a token marked “To be” on one side and “Not to be” on the other. Depending on which side it up, Hamlet can either draw additional cards or do extra damage in combat. Meanwhile, his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern look on approvingly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/first-gameplay-of-image-of-anno-117-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As first spotted by fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de51n0/screenshot_of_newly_announced_anno_117_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a>, an early build screenshot of Anno 117 Pax Romana gameplay appeared to leak online. The image seemed to surface via the official Anno Union website itself.</p>



<p>The image shows an overview shot of a large coastal city, complete with major landmarks and homes. The leaked image also has a unique angle of the city, suggesting Anno 117 could introduce other new mechanics.</p>



<p>Ubisoft first announced Anno 117 Pax Romana during the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forward-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Forward showcase</a> with a reveal trailer. However, it was a live-action trailer, so it did not feature any gameplay, or even cinematics. </p>



<p>Some fans of the series were dismayed no Anno 117 Pax Romana gameplay appeared, and the Ubisoft Forward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-was-with-that-disappointing-ubisoft-forward-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generally seemed to disappoint</a> overall.</p>



<p>For now, Anno fans only have a clear look at some concept art on the Anno Union website.  In Anno 117 Pax Romana, players take the role of a Roman governor, exploring the strategies of unique provinces with choices that matter.</p>



<p>The most recent title in the economic strategy Anno series was Anno 1800, which launched in 2019. It focused on the Industrial Revolution, and still has Mostly Positive reviews on Steam. </p>



<p>There is currently no concrete release date for Anno 117 Pax Romana. It will launch sometime in 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and the Xbox Series X|S. </p>

Game director Corinne Busche spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> recently about why a linear setup was in the best interest of the game.</p><p>"Yeah, so it is a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated," Busche said. "We believe that's how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official 20 Minute Gameplay Reveal</p>
      </div>
<p>While The Veilguard is a mission-based, linear game, there are parts of the game that have more open sequences that offer players a greater sense of freedom of exploration, Busche said.</p><p>"Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game," the developer said.</p><p>The Veilguard, which was previously known as Dreadwolf, launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It is the first new entry in the series since the highly acclaimed Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-ubisoft-s-open-world-model-work-for-star-wars-outlaws<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For years, Ubisoft has been known for its open-world game formula, complete with large sprawling maps, a litany of side quest markers, and landmarks for players to discover. This formula can be seen across most of Ubisoft’s biggest franchises, including Assassin’s Creed, Watch Dogs, and Far Cry. In a quest for seemingly endless content, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to be following in those footsteps. However, it can be a challenge to fill such big worlds with more intimate, tightly knit stories.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To tell a great story, game developers do need a good sense of visual direction. And there’s always unique challenges in working with a licensed property as tightly controlled as Star Wars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Ubisoft Forward, Game Developer sat down to play one hour of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as well as had the opportunity to chat with associate world designer Cloe Hammond and associate drt director Marthe Jonkers discuss the inspirations behind the main characters’ designs and trying to aim for the Star Wars aesthetic while still making Outlaws look unique.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Star Wars Outlaws' "><span>Star Wars Outlaws' </span>heroine is a 'survivalist'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> follows rookie scoundrel Kay Vess and her pet companion Nix. Kay has a bit of Han Solo inspiration in her design, but the developers wanted to be clear that she’s still a rookie thief. Her survivalist mindset and scrappy nature lets her make tools out of anything, including her hairpin, which acts as a makeshift lockpick. These small details are what make Vess a much more relatable and grounded character. Her companion is a cute animal named Nix, and he’s part of a brand new species introduced in Outlaws called a Merqaal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His design was inspired by creatures that could survive in jungle-like environments. For example, his scales could protect him from harsh weather. Nix closely resembles an axolotl with his whiskers too, and the development team wanted to give him something that he could emote with. In the game, Vess can call on Nix to distract, attack, and even steal from enemies.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many open-world video games typically have distraction methods, with characters throwing stones or having robots to short circuit nearby electronics to lure away enemies. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Nix himself is used, as sometimes he’ll lie stretched out on the ground while enemies walk over to him confused as to what he’s even doing. This adds a layer of personality to Nix, and it’s unsurprising that Nix embodies the “cute” alien creature trend ever since the baby Yoda-looking Grogu companion exploded in popularity in the hit Star Wars spin-off TV show, the Mandalorian.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The constant interaction between Vess and Nix really lends the idea that they’re family and constantly looking out for each other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There were many inspirations that were very grounded to make sure that Nix steel feels like a believable creature that can really survive in a world of Star Wars,” said Jonkers. “But at the same time, it'd be a very nice companion to Vess.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vess also has access to her own ship, the Trailblazer. Like Nix, the Trailblazer was also inspired by a real-world animals, in this case, the humble turtle. Its design was influenced by 60s and 70s monorail and hints of retrofuturism—or imagining what the future might have looked like in the era when George Lucas was first cooking up Star Wars. Back then, people were imaging a future in the 2000s with flying cars and robot servants, which isn’t too off the mark of what Star Wars has.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On planets, Vess can ride on her motocross called the Speeder, which Jonkers added was also inspired by the retro futuristic style. “There's a familiarity in every Star Wars design,” she said. “But there's also a small percentage of exotic and alien to it.” While retrofuturism had its roots in the late 1800s, it continued into the 60s with the Space Age and into the 70s when Star Wars became a cultural phenomenon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Crafting a new world">Crafting a new world</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the demo didn’t include any open-world portions of gameplay,Hammond explained that the team wanted to craft open-world content through three unique ways. The first was to make sure that cities are dense where players can overhear conversations and rumors, something that a scoundrel like Vess would be interested in. Vess can gain intel and track down characters to learn new skills, giving a gameplay incentive for players to engage with open-world activities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second way is through the use of vehicles and traveling. With the Trailblazer, players are able to discover new space stations and orbital regions. What makes this aspect stand out is that players can actually fly closer towards planets before the option to embark appears, which is a much more engaging gameplay feature than just only being able to select a planet and choosing to land on it like in games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starfield </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mass Effect</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The third aspect was to convey the spectacular environments and wide vistas on worlds that Vess comes across throughout her journey. The demo placed Vess in different biomes, including tropical and snow-filled ones, which gave glimpses into the variety of settings players can expect.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the surface, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> seems like a Star Wars skin on the typical Ubisoft open-world formula with a checklist of activities to complete. However, the relationship between Vess and Nix is what will keep players invested throughout the entire journey. It’s also clear that developer Massive Entertainment poured a lot of heart and soul into creating this world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“They're going to start really small as a rookie thief duo and navigate the underworld,” Hammond said in allusion to Vess and her alien sidekick. “I think we’re providing diversity. Whether it's in locations, quests, or different characters, all of it is very tailor made to this authentic storytelling that we’re trying to do.”</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/visions-of-mana-closer-look?utm_source=sqex-social&amp;utm_content=launchdatetrailerblog&amp;utm_campaign=VisionsofMana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a>, Square Enix announced that the anticipated new entry in the Visions of Mana series will launch on August 29, 2024. Pre-orders will be available today for all available platforms. </p>



<p>Today’s post also breaks down the various characters, combat mechanics, and other key details coming to Visions of Mana. </p>



<p>The central heroes are Val, the newly appointed soul guard to the alms, and their childhood friend Hinna. However, players will have access to multiple heroes they can “fully control in battle and when exploring the world.” </p>



<p>Square Enix also released a new trailer featuring gameplay, including both combat and exploration.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Visions of Mana | Launch Date Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io4_CfCLlW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Players can use companion creatures to traverse the map, with a unique companion for different types of terrain.  A Pikul helps players travel on land, the Vuscav can travel across water, and the Flammie is used for air travel. </p>



<p>Combat is resolved in real-time, and today’s blog did confirm the Ring Menu is returning for the new Visions of Mana title. So, battle will pause for the Ring Menu, again encouraging players to use strategy.</p>



<p>There will also be an Elemental Vessel system, where mystical artifacts grant players elemental powers they can use both in combat and during exploration.</p>



<p>Visions of Mana will be available on PC via Windows and Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S when it launches this August.</p>

                <p>When you've suffered several consecutive defeats at the hands of a particularly tough boss in a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>, there's no shame in consulting a guide for some tips. That's something From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki is aware of, and in a new interview, he explained how the studio doesn't aim to create a cottage industry for guides writers or in-depth lore historians with its games. Instead, From Software aims to make games that players can progress through organically.</p><p>"Of course, players are going to consult guides, and there's going to be a wealth of information on the web and in their communities where they have access to the secrets and the strategies. We expect that," Miyazaki said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-developers-know-most-players-use-guides-but-still-try-to-cater-to-those-who-go-in-blind-if-they-cant-do-it-then-theres-some-room-for-improvement-on-our-behalf/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "We obviously understand [players use guides], but we don't make or plan anything with that as a prerequisite. If anything, we try to cater to the player who is completely blind and wants to go through organically. If they can't do it, then there's some room for improvement on our behalf, and we'd like to try to embrace those players more in the future."</p>

<p data-characters="240" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ubisoft has dropped a major update for <em>XDefiant</em> on June 12, finally introducing flinch to enemies who scope using a sniper rifle, while punishing players who spam jumping and crouching during matches. Read the full Y1S0.3 patch notes below.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">One of the biggest issues in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-overpowered-sniper-rifles-are-finally-getting-nerfed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XDefiant </em>has been the overpowered sniper rifles</a>, which have dominated matches since launch. The biggest complaint was that the weapon had no flinch, which meant players could aim down the scope of the weapon while being shot, and have no issues aiming their gun. Now, players who are hit will have increased flinch, which will continue as more bullets slam into you. </p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="739" data-injectable="true">Elsewhere, fans were also upset that there was no penalty when <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-players-question-if-crosshair-expansion-from-jumping-should-make-your-weapons-fire-sideways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumping</a> or crouching while firing weapons, meaning that you would often encounter opponents who were bouncing around and impossible to hit. Thankfully, Ubisoft has now added an aiming penalty, so that you are less accurate when jumping or crouching, putting you at a disadvantage.</p>
 <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">There have also been fixes for a weird bug that meant your legs didn’t follow your body when you pushed the package in Escort, tweaks to long-distance shooting, and other useful bug fixes. </p> <figure data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>No more jumping enemies.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-epic-games-store-leak-ff9-remake</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/massive-epic-games-store-leak-reveals-ff9-remake-and-much-more.899025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-epic-games-store-leak-ff9-remake<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A huge Epic Games Store leak has resulted in several major projects being leaked, and though many of them are hidden behind codenames, enterprising onlookers are already doing the work to uncover the games' identities.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-lot-of-unannounced-games-are-leaking-via-epicdb.898755/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra user MondoMega</a>, this leak occurred thanks to the launch of <a href="https://steamdb.info/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>-esque website EpicDB (which is currently down at time of writing). Searching a publisher's page on EpicDB uncovers tons of projects that were seemingly not intended for public eyes.</p>
<p>The good folks over on the Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">compiled a list</a> of those projects, with major publishers like Square Enix, Sega, Rockstar, and Sony being included in the leak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-ix-remake-leak-epic-games-store.jpg?itok=akpaiCA7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-ix-remake-leak-epic-games-store.jpg?itok=MXqnh5Kw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, this leak has some good things in store for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the games have fairly unhelpful codenames, although there are exceptions. Saber Interactive, for instance, has a project listed that's simply named&nbsp;<em>Turok</em>, which is, incredibly enough, likely a new&nbsp;<em>Turok&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>On THQ Nordic's page, a project titled&nbsp;<em>Remnant 3&nbsp;</em>can be seen, and it's not hard to guess what that might be. Others, meanwhile, are much more obscure; what, for instance, are Sega's&nbsp;<em>Porridge</em>,&nbsp;<em>Croquembouche</em>, and&nbsp;<em>CurlyWurly</em>, other than great names?</p>
<p>Some projects, despite being codenamed, are fairly easy to decipher given the additional information that was available on EpicDB.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Momo</em>, for instance, is almost certainly the long-rumored&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IX&nbsp;</em>remake, given that it apparently offers the "Tetra Master Starter Pack" and "Thief's Knives" as pre-order DLC bonuses.</p>
<p>A PC version of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, which we <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-requirements-demo">know is currently in the works at Square Enix</a>, is also apparently on the cards for Epic, as examining the data for the codenamed entry&nbsp;<em>Skobeloff&nbsp;</em>seemingly leads to&nbsp;<em>FFXVI&nbsp;</em>being named.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-epic-games-store-leak.jpg?itok=XPAhJstQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-epic-games-store-leak.jpg?itok=-eJLRwJK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s PC version is also seemingly included in this Epic Games Store leak.</figcaption></figure><p>Other projects include a potential PC release for&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, as well as Epic listings for&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the existence of these games in Epic's database doesn't necessarily mean their release is imminent, or even that they're still active projects.</p>
<p>Publishers might create database entries for games like these for a lot of reasons, and many of the entries in the leak, including the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IX&nbsp;</em>remake, haven't been updated in several months or even years.</p>
<p>As an example, there's an entry for a game codenamed&nbsp;<em>Testament</em>, which users are suggesting could be Sony's&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. That game was never released on Epic Games Store, and while a launch on the store isn't impossible, it might just be an aborted database entry that was never needed in the end.</p>
<p>While the entries in the database might be contested, the leak itself isn't; this is all internal data from Epic's database, so these projects certainly exist in Epic's backend.</p>
<p>However, Epic has subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-epic-leak-hints-at-unannounced-games-coming-to-epic-games-store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> confirming that database tools can't crawl for unannounced titles anymore, so a leak like this isn't likely to happen again. Still, the data gleaned from the leak isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Phantom Blade Zero Preview - A Blast of Fast-Paced Action]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/phantom-blade-zero-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phantom-blade-zero-preview-a-blast-of-fast-paced-action.899022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/phantom-blade-zero-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> first appeared last year during PlayStation's State of Play with a super flashy trailer. That continued again this year, with another trailer to end the Summer Game Fest stream. After playing some of the game myself, the trailers were accurate.</p>
<p>When I first saw <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em>, I thought that it was another soulslike. This is something that the developer told me they've heard a lot of, and I imagine a large part of that has to do with the dark fantasy artstyle.</p>
<p>However, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> is an action game more in the vein of the <em>Devil May Cry</em> series than anything else.</p>

<p>You have your standard light attack, heavy attack, dodge, block, and parry. One thing the developers mentioned is that they made blocking easy, just hold down a button, to make the game have a lower barrier to entry. That doesn't mean you can just block your way to victory, however.</p>
<p>Dodging and attacking use stamina, but you can keep your combo going if you switch to your second set of weapons mid-combo. That will refresh the stamina meter, letting you continue to wail on your opponent.</p>
<p>I was equipped with a sword and another seat of weapons in two short swords/daggers. I also had access to a bow and two special abilities, one of which was a cannon I could charge up to three levels and devastate enemies.</p>
<p>Having played about 20 minutes or so of the game, i was just starting to get into a flow with the combat before my time was up. It is quick, twitchy, and greatly rewards those with good reflexes.</p>
<p>Parrying at the right moment will let you hit enemies with a pretty good attack, but they also have some attacks that are not blockable or parryable, so you'll need to dodge them. Those flash with the now industry standard red, while moves you can parry flash blue.</p>
<p>I should note that the general attacks were not something I could parry. Parrying was set up for specific attacks, otherwise you have to dodge out of the way or block your enemy's attacks.</p>

<p>The enemy design was fairly basic, but I imagine that's just due to showing off the game for the first time to folks. I did fight the one boss featured in the second trailer they put out, and he was a bit tougher.</p>
<p>He had a large flail-like weapon that he would flash out an attack with every so often, which would break up his pattern some. Learning the little ticks and tells of what he was going to do was satisfying, and it just made me want to keep going.</p>
<h2>Phantom Blade Zero Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>All I can say is that this felt like a fairly polished action game that will satisfy everyone that likes fast-paced gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad news is we all have to wait a while, as we won't see <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> for at least a couple of more years. The fact that it already feels this great from a core mechanic view is really encouraging, however.</p>
<p>Let's all hope for some more insane trailers over the next couple of years.</p>

  <p id="17gSVc">It seems as though Nintendo, like everyone else, is finally fed up with toxicity, engagement farming, NSFW replies, and the utter randomness of the For You feed. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information">latest Nintendo Switch firmware update</a> has removed all integration with X (formerly Twitter), Elon Musk’s social network.</p>
<p id="Gs0a6D"><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057/~/discontinuation-of-x-%28formerly-twitter%29-integration-and-social-media">As of June 10</a>, you can no longer post screenshots to X from your Switch, or link your X and Nintendo Accounts. Nintendo also removed the ability send friend requests to friends and followers on all social media platforms. Just to prove it’s nothing personal against Elon, Nintendo hinted that image-sharing via Facebook may be removed “at a later date,” too.</p>
<p id="h9j5GP">If you want to share images from your Switch’s photo album on X, you now have to transfer them to another device first — either via USB connection to a PC, or wirelessly (using Nintendo’s quite clever QR code system) to a smart device.</p>
<p id="ZVQDxI">Nintendo is actually the last platform holder to turn its back on X integration; Microsoft and Sony disabled the feature on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23692583/microsoft-twitter-api-elon-musk-pricing-xbox">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23949334/playstation-twitter-x-ps4-ps5-ps-app">PlayStation</a> consoles, respectively, last year. It’s likely that the console makers have left X due to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662832/twitter-api-tiers-free-bot-novelty-accounts-basic-enterprice-monthly-price">exorbitant API fees</a> imposed by Musk, which can result in companies paying over $40,000 per month for little-used features.</p>
<p id="5jyhX7">At time of writing, Nintendo had yet to post links to its Bluesky and Mastodon accounts on its profile page.</p>

  <p id="Zvp228">When the first <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24105856/it-looks-like-star-wars-is-finally-getting-its-watchmen-in-the-acolyte">trailer for Lucasfilm’s latest Star Wars series</a>, <em>The Acolyte</em>, dropped back in March, the group email for my <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24145239/best-star-wars-board-games-ttrpg-rebellion-unlimited-shatterpoint-edge-of-empire">Star Wars: Edge of the Empire</a> role-playing game immediately blew up. The tongue-in-cheek question on our minds was whether someone at Lucasfilm had been secretly monitoring our latest story arc: Our game is set during the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23845775/star-wars-old-republic-hella-tight">Old Republic era</a> and <em>The Acolyte</em> is a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what">High Republic-era story</a>, but otherwise, everything we knew about the new series seemed entirely compatible with the original story our game master had whipped up, about a Jedi kidnapping dozens of Force-sensitive children for training, and quietly advising the local Commerce Guild outpost on ways to violently suppress the local uprising that resulted.</p>
<p id="GGdMpW">From what we knew about <em>The Acolyte</em> back then, it just seemed like a funny coincidence that the show’s teaser and the arc we were about to conclude were so in sync. We assumed once the series aired and its storyline was clearer, it’d be a lot more obvious that the Jedi were meant to be the heroes in <em>The Acolyte</em>, and any seeming morally gray areas would be cleared up.</p>
<p id="Ezem6U">But episode 3 of <em>The Acolyte </em>doesn’t make anything clearer. If anything, it muddies the already pretty murky waters around the ways the Jedi acquire kids for training, and how they treat those kids once they have them. The episode deliberately obfuscates a lot of important detail about what happened on the planet Brendok, clearly with some form of reveal to come, possibly even exonerating the Jedi from, for instance, murdering everyone in Mae and Osha’s witch coven. But what it does show us about Jedi recruitment tactics sure doesn’t paint them in a positive light.</p>

<p id="630qgl">Consider the events of this episode in the most generous light possible, from the presumed Jedi perspective. At this point in the Star Wars timeline, they’re a significant power in the galaxy, essentially space cops out to protect the Republic, prevent the balance of the Force from shifting toward darkness, and prevent war from spreading across the galaxy. They find a forbidden cult creating and training children, all while lying to the authorities and claiming they aren’t doing any of that.</p>
<p id="LtUF67">Galactic law might allow the Jedi to carve a path through these criminal sect members and take the children into custody, but instead, they simply note that they’d like to know whether Mae and Osha are fit for Jedi training and interested in joining up. Osha is, so they invite her to join them. Mae then goes ham, somehow kills everyone else present by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23940294">setting a stone mountain on fire</a>, then dies in the aftermath. Fortunately, the noble Jedi are there to give the poor surviving orphan girl a home.</p>
<p id="QHuT0J">A strong pro-Jedi viewer stance — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSOBeD1GC_Y&amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim">looking at the situation from a certain point of view, as it were</a> — makes that read at least possible, if not entirely plausible. But the same story looks radically different from the victims’ perspective, which seems to be what the episode is taking as text. It’s entirely unclear why this Force-using coven was banned and ordered not to train children. There’s never any sense that they’re doing any harm. Their coven seems like a warm, supportive place to grow up. Their only questionable act is impressing their values and training on Osha, who’s dubious about whether this is the future she wants. But the fact that their induction ritual clearly requires her consent — and the fact that they’ve obviously educated her about the Jedi in a neutral enough way that she was allowed to decide for herself that they’re heroes — are both votes in their favor.</p>

<p id="isMqHz">And then these outsiders come along and stalk the children without notifying their mother or other guardians. They confront the coven in the middle of a sacred ritual. They force the children to take a Jedi suitability test without allowing their mother to be present, or telling her anything about what’s involved. (And at least half of it appears to be a medical test for midi-chlorian levels, administered without warning or consent.) After the test, they invite a minor child to join their sect, again without conferring with her mother. Whatever happens next isn’t necessarily their fault, but it unquestionably happens because they invade a seemingly peaceful, obscure separatist group and try to talk one of their children into permanently abandoning her family and coming away with them to a distant planet, where they plan to inculcate her with their own values, including a belief that emotional connections of any kind are inherently bad and forbidden.</p>
<p id="yUDG4Z">None of this is a good look for the Jedi. The whole sequence, with its deliberate omissions and obfuscations, feeds directly into the questions fans have had about Jedi recruitment since the prequel movies started showing us more about the induction process. The baseline Jedi rules are remarkably similar to <a href="https://people.howstuffworks.com/cult4.htm">real-world cult tactics</a>: Trainees are separated from their families and taught to disavow any personal connections, they’re forced to accept their teachers’ proscriptive ascetic values, and it’s made clear that any deviation or pushback against them is cause for expulsion from their replacement family. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/5/18/18629598/phantom-menace-star-wars-prequels-expanded-universe-best-books-tv-series-comics"><em>Phantom Menace</em></a>-era Jedi also refuse trainees as “too old” starting at least at age 9, which reads as a feeling that inductees should be young enough to be malleable, without any pesky emotional attachments or opinions of their own.</p>
<p id="FMr5xp">Add all that to the Jedi tendency toward doctrinaire thinking and arrogance, and you have a recipe for the entirely plausible situation we were navigating in my Edge of the Empire game, where a single Jedi decided it was so important that Force-sensitive younglings receive “proper” training that she engineered false-flag medical programs in order to get her hands on local children, test them, and then take them from their parents by force. Given some of the arrogance we’ve already seen from Jedi in the Star Wars movie and TV canon, an overreaching Jedi driven by self-righteousness seemed like an entirely plausible villain. Which is why, when that first <em>Acolyte</em> trailer dropped, my gaming group started trading internet memes that tapped into the same uncomfortable response to Jedi behavior around children and indoctrination.  </p>

<p id="Fm2t8B">We’ve already seen quite a bit of the same arrogance in <em>The Acolyte</em>, particularly in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what">Vernestra Rwoh</a> heavily implying that Osha needed to be rounded up quickly and sentenced quickly for Indara’s murder, as a show of Jedi strength — even if there was no evidence that Osha was guilty. Even if no one bothered with the barest baseline of investigation — for instance, checking the flight logs on the ship she was working on, to see whether she plausibly could have been in a different part of the galaxy an unknown number of parsecs away in order to kill Indara. That same arrogance leads the Jedi to drop a supposedly superpowered, Jedi-killing Force user on a droid-operated prison ship, with no guards or oversight.</p>
<p id="ESgoG6">And it leads Indara and her team to handle the Brendok operation in either the clumsiest, most intrusive way possible, or the most purposefully disruptive. Episode 3<strong> </strong>deliberately hides information from the audience to make it unclear which is true — but there’s still no way to read these events so the Jedi are diplomatic, tactful, or blameless when things go wrong.</p>
<p id="lKRvBc">The upside of all of this, at least for Star Wars fans, is that Jedi can be terrific antagonists for a Star Wars RPG without any need for GMs to twist the canon, or for players to embrace the dark side of the Force. Arrogant agents of a Galactic organization that outlaws any organizations that disagree with its dogma, then punishes them for their beliefs by taking their children away for re-education, are already neatly set up to be villains. </p>
<p id="QT4ian">All the grotesque questions <em>The Phantom Menace </em>raised come up again in the light of <em>The Acolyte</em>’s story. Why, after a Jedi lured Anakin Skywalker away from his planet and his enslaved mother, was the Jedi Council so willing to disavow the kid? When Qui-Gon insisted on training him anyway, why did he refuse to even consider the trivial effort needed to rescue Anakin’s mother, guaranteeing the kid would never be able to stop worrying about her and let go of his attachment? Why make it so clear that Anakin was only valuable as a Force-powered asset, and that his mother’s freedom, dignity, and life were beneath Jedi notice?</p>

<p id="cWRyCH">Indara and her crew in <em>The Acolyte</em> are just as cold about Mae and Osha. If the coven’s beliefs or behaviors are somehow harmful and dangerous in a way we never see, the Jedi should be trying to rescue the girls, regardless of whether they test as valuable assets. If the coven isn’t dangerous or harmful, the Jedi have no business stealing their children, or circumnavigating the coven to lure their kids into a potentially permanent career path that will start with isolation and indoctrination. And the testing being mandatory and the coven being illegal both suggest that if Mae and Osha test as potentially useful to the Jedi, they aren’t going to be permitted to choose to stay on Brendok.</p>
<p id="Mka5fw">It’s still possible (though given Star Wars franchise history, I doubt it) that <em>The Acolyte</em> is embracing fans’ discomfort with the Jedi’s questionable, distasteful, and even predatory way of handling children, and exploring it with an eye toward clearing up some of the questions. We won’t find out for sure until we get to the parts of the story<strong> </strong>this episode deliberately obscures.</p>
<p id="CiNL3D">Until then, fans have their own ways of exploring these dubious aspects of the franchise. My RPG group resolved our own immediate crisis just before <em>The Acolyte</em> premiered, by aiding our own local Jedi in brokering a local peace, fighting the out-of-control Commerce Guild forces to a standstill, and helping resolve the imbalance in the Force that her hubris had caused. But that leaves us at the start of a new arc, where dozens of children are scattered throughout the Jedi training system, isolated from each other and their families, and undergoing “training” they didn’t necessarily sign up for. </p>
<p id="uxi07z">To me, at least, that situation feels like an entirely fair reflection of what the official canon has said about the Jedi and their youngling inductees. Within Star Wars canon, it feels like a given that the Jedi are always the heroes, and anyone who resists them is acting out of stupidity, greed, or outright evil. But the way they deal with children has always felt potentially villainous. We’ll see soon enough whether <em>The Acolyte</em>’s creative team agrees, or are just teasing us with a little more fuel for a long-standing debate, while planning to gloss over the whole issue and move on without answering any of the questions it leaves standing open. </p>

That’s because I was playing the game like I would its predecessor, something subsequent playthroughs would teach me was a mistake.<em> Starward Vector</em> is a completely different beast than what came before. It’s a shockingly big game with so many new systems to learn. But above all, it’s more dangerous, and I couldn’t be happier about it.</p><h2 id="h1319"><a id=""></a><strong>Welcome back Sleeper</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3aa865efd5377c266f71d2287aa90825" data-recommend-id="image://3aa865efd5377c266f71d2287aa90825" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A damaged ship sits in a space port" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A damaged ship sits in a space port" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3aa865efd5377c266f71d2287aa90825" data-recommend-id="image://3aa865efd5377c266f71d2287aa90825" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A damaged ship sits in a space port" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Starward Vector</em>’s early moments pick up on a tantalizing loose thread. Where the original game confined its story to a single space station, its final moments teased life beyond The Eye, and a universe made up of many similar spaceports and stations that those lucky enough to have ships could travel between. That is the premise of <em>Starward Vector</em>, which gives your new Sleeper command of one of those prized ships (albeit a slightly banged-up one) with which they can eke out a living while running from their previous owner.<br></p><p>With the aid of a friend and possession of a stolen ship, my Sleeper manages to find brief safety at the beginning of the preview in a small spaceport. Our ship is damaged and we need to repair it and get out of here fast as my previous owner is hunting us down quickly (Sleepers are still a source of slave labor in the universe and considered property). My first drive (or mission objective) is to fix the ship. </p><figure id="" data-id="31a84df4070d4e63dbb4006109fe3bc0" data-recommend-id="image://31a84df4070d4e63dbb4006109fe3bc0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character screen shows skill trees for the Operator class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character screen shows skill trees for the Operator class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31a84df4070d4e63dbb4006109fe3bc0" data-recommend-id="image://31a84df4070d4e63dbb4006109fe3bc0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character screen shows skill trees for the Operator class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Starward Vector</em> is built on the same core systems as the original game: exploring points on a map, completing skill checks with the five available dies provided at the beginning of every cycle, and talking to characters that inhabit the world. While my hands-on preview only consisted of one spaceport and its surrounding area (we will get to that later) developer Gareth Damian Martin showed off a brief look at the larger map of the game over a video call, revealing close to a dozen systems players will eventually be able to travel between, each with their own ports, stations, and stories to uncover.<br></p><p>After working some odd jobs and chatting up workers at the local dive, I find my way to a merchant with the parts I need. I can get it if I have the money (which I obviously do not, as it is hard to come by early on) or I can do a risky salvage job in exchange for the goods I need. Job it is. </p><h2 id="h1320"><a id=""></a><strong>Odd jobs</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="236a9b2b97627efca50fb96f7cd34ba9" data-recommend-id="image://236a9b2b97627efca50fb96f7cd34ba9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dark desolate rock with multiple pieces of broken ships orbiting it" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dark desolate rock with multiple pieces of broken ships orbiting it" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="236a9b2b97627efca50fb96f7cd34ba9" data-recommend-id="image://236a9b2b97627efca50fb96f7cd34ba9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dark desolate rock with multiple pieces of broken ships orbiting it" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This job is a contract, a new feature in <em>Starward Vector</em> centered around the opportunities owning a ship opens up to you. You’ll have contracts available to complete in the area of space surrounding a port or station, which will reward you with money or resources. This job required me to go out to an abandoned ship and hunt down its core. In my first playthrough, I received this contract and immediately flew out to the ship. Once on the ship, the usual list of tasks pops on screen. After a series of poor rolls,resulting in several failures, I notice a counter quickly creeping up. It indicates the damage to the ship, and I am informed that if that counter reaches its maximum the ship will break apart.<br></p><p>To make it worse, with each cycle I spend on the ship new issues are popping up—including a leak in the hull. This stretches my dice rolls thin as I balance them between finishing the job and keeping the ship together, which is made worse as the job stretches across cycles and my Sleeper starts starving to death because I didn’t properly stock up on supplies. That is where the crisis system comes into play. The more I starve, the more stressed my Sleeper becomes and the riskier dice rolls are. Not because I might fail them, but because a dice might break, making it even more prone to failure. Once it has broken three times, the dice will fully become unusable (until manually repaired). </p><figure id="" data-id="46780961393fdba42cbef2e6e51a4781" data-recommend-id="image://46780961393fdba42cbef2e6e51a4781" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A salvage mission shows multiple tasks and crew mates attempting to complete the mission" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A salvage mission shows multiple tasks and crew mates attempting to complete the mission" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46780961393fdba42cbef2e6e51a4781" data-recommend-id="image://46780961393fdba42cbef2e6e51a4781" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A salvage mission shows multiple tasks and crew mates attempting to complete the mission" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a dangerous evolution of the stabilizer system which required a steady dose of the rare medication every few cycles in order to keep all of your dice but lacked real friction as you progressed further into the game. The crisis system is a little more luck-based and not as easy to fix when it is so far gone. All of these knocks against me added up and a final failed skill check which caused the ship to break apart and had me quickly flying back to safety with nothing but a failed contract.<br></p><p>In my next playthrough, I learned from my mistakes. I stock up on supplies, which are consumed every cycle while out on a contract, and also made sure to fully explore the port before leaving. This led me to encounter more of the game’s characters, which now have an extra utility not seen in the first game: they can serve as crew members on jobs. Like the Sleeper, characters now have certain affinities for certain skills and when on a job they even get to roll two of their own dies for you to use as you see fit. It helps give you an edge on tough jobs. But characters aren’t just tools for you to use for your benefit.</p><h2 id="h1321"><a id=""></a><strong>I’m putting together a crew</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="644191d3ee29e2d90425bd0b795f070a" data-recommend-id="image://644191d3ee29e2d90425bd0b795f070a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three character portraits are shown under a &quot;select crew&quot; prompt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three character portraits are shown under a &quot;select crew&quot; prompt" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="644191d3ee29e2d90425bd0b795f070a" data-recommend-id="image://644191d3ee29e2d90425bd0b795f070a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three character portraits are shown under a &quot;select crew&quot; prompt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The people you meet in the original <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> were a major highlight of the game. Amongst <em>Starward Vector’s stars</em>, that still holds true, and each character has their own motivations and desires. As the captain of a ship, you have something people want and they will try to use you the way you are using them. They also have their own baggage. Picking up certain crew members will inadvertently get you put on somebody’s shit list, which will bite you in the ass later if you aren’t careful. You also have to play peacekeeper between your crew, as not everybody gets along. This system is a direct response to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/citizen-sleeper-gareth-martin-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/citizen-sleeper-gareth-martin-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gareth Damian Martin’s criticism</a></span> of RPGs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-2-review-once-more-unto-the-breach-5456089&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-2-review-once-more-unto-the-breach-5456089"><em>Mass Effect 2</em></a></span>, which they see as casting the player as a glorified super cop who doesn’t take the party’s feelings into account. Previously they joked that Commander Shepard reminds them of bosses they’ve had (not in a good way) and<em> Starward Vector</em> challenges the player to not be that shitty boss. Even while you are on the run, you have a newfound responsibility to your crew<br></p><p>Some crew will be locked to certain stations, while others have ships of their own and will wander the systems at the same time you do, only briefly crossing paths in your narrative. To further boost the risk of character interaction the dialogue moments of the game are occasionally interspersed with choices tied to skill checks, a new feature in <em>Starward Vector</em>. Juni, a crew member I had picked up for the risky salvage job, revealed to me during our mission that she was taking the salvage for herself. This put us in conflict and I was given the option to attempt to wrestle the core from her. It felt like a desperate action, but my Sleeper’s life was in danger so I made that choice. I held my breath as I waited for the skill check and released it when I succeeded. But I felt like absolutely shit after I then left Juni on the abandoned ship as punishment for her betrayal. I had succeeded in the mission but still felt like I had lost, and the moment-to-moment of the job’s many cycles was still full of tension.</p><h2 id="h1322"><a id=""></a><strong>High-risk, high-reward</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2b4c4c0c7c9b810620df3edce971d149" data-recommend-id="image://2b4c4c0c7c9b810620df3edce971d149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl floats in space dressed in courier's garb" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl floats in space dressed in courier's garb" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b4c4c0c7c9b810620df3edce971d149" data-recommend-id="image://2b4c4c0c7c9b810620df3edce971d149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl floats in space dressed in courier's garb" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That tension is the defining feeling of <em>Starward Vector</em>.

<p>The US labor union Communications Workers of America (CWA) has filed Unfair Labor Practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Lionbridge Technologies, Inc.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CWA press release reveals</a> that the 160-strong QA team in Boise, Idaho, who provided QA testing for Activision, believes they were laid off in retaliation for attempting to unionize. In addition to the layoffs, it’s also been alleged that Lionbridge “offered workers a severance package that required them to agree to overly broad confidentiality terms and to waive rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act. This practice&nbsp;has been ruled unlawful by the NLRB.”</p>



<p>Workers on the project were told by Lionbridge that the reason for their termination was that the project they were working on had ended; however, teams based in Mexico and Poland continue to work on it.</p>



<p>The CMA also outlined that Lionbridge has a documented history of past union-busting efforts. “In 2016, it laid off all the members of a union&nbsp;in Bellevue, Wash., shortly after workers finalized a first collectively bargained contract with the company. That unit also provided subcontracted labor to Microsoft”, says the CWA. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and Activision for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Square Enis has announced that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/visions-of-mana">Visions of Mana</a> launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.</p>

<p>In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu),&nbsp;Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-fans-arent-happy-bethesdas-charging-6-for-a-single-creation-mission<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a> players have left a flurry of negative reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a> - more than 500 in the last 48 hours - following the launch of the game's Creations storefront. 
</p>
<p>
While the Creation Kit is free to download, this method of adding customised content to the game also opens the doors to paid add-ons built by both Bethesda and fans. And it's one of these - a <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/4bf1a31f-46d5-47bf-a5e6-d0f9e2496d0c/Trackers_Alliance__The_Vulture">single mission named The Vulture</a> priced at 700 Starfield Creation Credits (roughly £6.30) that has prompted the current ruckus. 
</p>
<p>
For starters, this is the second mission in the Trackers Alliance series (the first, titled The Starjacker is free) and it sounds like Bethesda has more on the way. Players have criticised the relatively high price for a single quest, and that this opens the door to more in the future.

</figure>
<p>"New missions have been added to Starfield as part of this update," Bethesda wrote in its latest blog post. "Trackers Alliance establishes the first of several missions enabling you to live your best bounty-hunting life. The first mission, The Starjacker will have you in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in settlements throughout the Settled Systems. From there, let the hunts begin!
</p>
<p>"The second Trackers Alliance mission, The Vulture is available within the new Creations menu. And what bounty hunter is without their trusted methods to get the job done?"</p>
<p>
Head on into the Creations menu, however, and it's here you discover you now need to cough up about £6. There's also the issue that you can't actually cough up £6, as Starfield Creation Credits are only sold in specific amounts, meaning you actually have to cough up £9 for 1000 Credits and sit there with 300 Credits left over. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?author_displayname=BethesdaGameStudios">Bethesda currently has a half dozen items to acquire from its Creation Kit storefront</a> and some of them are free, to help sweeten the deal (a new spacesuit, observatory building and gun skin). You can also pay 300 Credits (hey, you can use up those left over ones!) on a Constellation Plushie Set, or another full 1000 Credits/£9's worth on an Ancient Mariner Module.
</p>

<p>
"Really? Another push for curated paid mods no one asked for?" wrote one reviewer. "£7 for a single quest is absurd. The game isn't even finished I still routinely get enemies clipping through the geometry," wrote another. "Not recommended until these $7 single mission experiments end," wrote a third. "Would have recommended right up til that decision. Modders make better content for free in a fraction of the time."
</p>
<p>
Further off, Bethesda is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-starfields-shattered-space-expansion-but-still-no-release-date">still planning to launch Starfield's first proper expansion this year</a> at some point - though last week's Xbox Games Showcase did not provide a specific date. Shattered Space will offer a fresh mystery involving the snake-loving House Va'ruun, at some point later in 2024.

            <p>Visions of Mana, the next entry in Square Enix's Mana series, is set to release this summer.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the company revealed the game will launch on 29th August, across <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10008215/">PlayStation 5, PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/visions-of-mana/9nj5wv40pd08">Xbox series X/S</a>, and PC via Windows and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/">Steam</a>. Pre-orders are available now. Despite earlier confusion, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-not-coming-to-game-pass-xbox-confirms">not be coming to Game Pass</a> on its debut.</p>
<p>Today's announcement came with a new Visions of Mana release date trailer, which you can see below.</p>

<p>"Every four years, people around the world are selected by the Faerie to travel to the Tree of Mana and rejuvenate the flow of mana power by offering their souls. These chosen people are named 'alms' and accompanied on their pilgrimage by a soul guard," Square Enix wrote in a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/visions-of-mana-closer-look?utm_source=sqex-social&amp;utm_content=launchdatetrailerblog&amp;utm_campaign=VisionsofMana">Visions of Mana blog post</a>, explaining what its upcoming game is about.</p>
<p>"In the Fire Village, Tianeea, the residents are excitedly preparing for the coming of the Faerie and the naming of their new alm. Val, a new soul guard, brings his childhood friend, Hinna, to the festival. As the sun falls beneath the horizon, the Faerie descends and names Hinna as the Alm of Fire. So, Val and Hinna set out towards the Mana Tree, and the journey of a lifetime begins..."</p>
<p>On its release this August, Visions of Mana will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-announces-visions-of-mana-out-next-year">first game in the Mana series for over 15 years</a>. Our Ed has already been hands-on with the upcoming game, but while he said it was a "fun, bubbly, frivolous experience", he also believed it lacks some truly fresh ideas.</p>
<p>"It's balancing old and new, then, and embracing a sort of breezy retro simplicity. Pleasing as that is, though, it so far feels a little shallow by comparison to other genre heavy-hitters," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-returns-to-series-roots-but-is-yet-to-flower-into-a-truly-original-experience">Eurogamer's Visions of Mana preview</a> earlier this year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-current-unreal-engine-5-can-run-at-native-4k-resolution-with-decent-performance-due-to-engine-design.898980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's no current Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can run at native 4K resolution with acceptable performance, but that has nothing to do with developers but rather with how the engine is built.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Infuse Studio co-founder Jacob Sutton discussed the idea that some users have that upscaling solutions such as NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS are being used as a crutch for developers to fix optimization issues, saying that upscaling is sort of becoming a requirement, using the Unreal Engine 5 as an example. Epic's engine comes with an upscaling software solution called TSR, Temporal Super Resolution, and a feature that is implemented by default is not a bonus but, essentially, a requirement. With upscaling built-in, there's no current Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can run at native 4K with decent performance because it is expected that upscaling is used to achieve desirable framerates.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Performance, PS5 Pro, AMD Zen 5 | Spirit of the North 2 Devs | Broken Silicon 261" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcPdwhz705o?start=5020&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That current games powered by Unreal Engine 5 are rather demanding is no surprise, as there have been titles using the full range of features, such as Nanite and Lumen, that struggle to run smoothly, especially on consoles. Multiple tech demos are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-abandoned-manor-demo-rtx-4080-limits-hardware-lumen/">pushing current powerful GPUs like NVIDIA RTX 4080 to the limit</a> in terms of performance at 4K resolution, so it will be very interesting to see how the engine and upscaling solutions will improve to provide smooth gaming experiences even in highly demanding titles.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.4. You can learn more about the changes introduced by it on the engine's <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battle Aces Preview - An RTS That Gets Straight to the Point]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battle-aces-preview-rts-that-gets-straight-to-point</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battle-aces-preview-an-rts-that-gets-straight-to-the-point.898977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battle-aces-preview-rts-that-gets-straight-to-point<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tactical depth coupled with its epic scale makes the RTS genre unmatched in some ways, though it can sometimes feel way too intimidating or take too much time to get to the action. <em>Battle Aces </em>is here to solve that problem.</p>
<h2>Battle Aces is RTS Made Easy, Not Simply</h2>
<p><em>Battle Aces </em>is an RTS that sees matches take place in just 10 minutes. That is likely a shockingly low number to RTS veterans, but that's part of the point. A game of<em> Battle Aces</em> is quick, on average lasting just five minutes according to the developer.</p>
<p>To get to that short match length, a lot of the RTS trappings have been stripped away. There is no base building to worry about, the tech upgrades are streamlined to just two paths, and you don't need to worry about managing workers.</p>

<p>Even things like expansion bases are automated. With the hit of a button, you'll slap down a new expansion base that will auto-generate workers to start getting resources going for you.</p>
<p>When you do that, your opponent knows you've expanded as well, so they can try to counter that themselves if they wish. What this often means is that you and your opponent are on relatively equal terms with resource generation, so it becomes who can use them better.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still send off a pack of units to kill some workers to interrupt their economy. If that happens to you, <em>Battle Aces</em> will take care or replacing workers for you.</p>
<p>That is just one of many examples where <em>Battle Aces </em>has the philosophy of taking care of anything that may distract you from the action of the game. Producing a sizeable army happens quickly, and then the game becomes all about using them to their maximum effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Armies Grow Quickly and Clash Often</h2>
<p>Unit production is near instantaneous, so losing group of units isn't immediately devastating -- though still a big deal. You can try to recover quickly enough by producing more units in a snap. On the flip side, it gives you the opportunity to defend yourself quickly if you're caught out.</p>
<p>One thing to remember about unit production, however, is that it is tied to the main, core base. Units are produced from that structure, so backing up an expansion a ways down the map will be a little more difficult.</p>
<p>Once I got back into the RTS swing, getting more comfortable with hotkeys and the muscle memory of moving a bunch of units around, I was completely enthralled by <em>Battle Aces</em>.</p>
<p>I didn't know this was something I wanted, but it scratched that itch of playing an RTS that I wanted every time I played but couldn't always accomplish. Competently building an effective army, and feeling like I had the ability to recover from mistakes, isn't easy in most RTS games.</p>
<p><em>Battle Aces</em> helps take away that RTS anxiety I know a lot of people, myself included, have experienced. There was nothing more panic-inducing that waiting for a <em>Starcraft II</em> match to start. Will I make a mistake in the optimal build sequence, thus screwing me over? Will I look real dumb for doing things "incorrectly'?</p>
<p>Here,<em> Battle Aces</em> is all about the battles themselves. You build up an army and then strategize from there, whether that is through positioning something for flanks, getting around enemies to their base, or whatever scenarios you can dream up.</p>
<p>What's funner than seeing two massive armies duke it out, hundreds of units with bullets, missiles, and more flying through the air?</p>

<p>A large part of the strategy in <em>Battle Aces</em> is going to simply come from the unit composition, of course. There is a deck-like system where you select up to 8 units, which will form the pool of units you can use in a match.</p>
<p>At the start of a match, you can see what your opponent has so you can plan accordingly what tech upgrades or what units you want to use to counter theirs.</p>
<p>Learning a familiarity with those units, their abilities, strengths and weaknesses, and more will have huge factors on success in the game.</p>
<p>Not all units have abilities, but I saw some classics show up like one that hastened movement and attack speed, another that let units blink on the map. One interesting wrinkle to consider is that air units can shoot on the move -- all of them.</p>
<h2>10 Minute Matches Ratchet the Tension</h2>
<p>A final thing I want to circle back on is the 10 minute timer for matches. That 10 minutes is a hard cap, and some interesting things happen before the game ends.</p>
<p>First, at eight minutes all of the workers die at your main base and will not return. That means if you haven't expanded, or those bases have been destroyed, you're pretty screwed.</p>
<p>At nine minutes, a fighting game-like meter shows up at the top of the screen assigning a percentage "win" meter to each player. That gives the losing player one final minute to try to make up for lost ground.</p>
<p>The percentage of winning is determined by the efficiency of your resource gathering. Basically, the math is how many units you've lost versus resources used.</p>
<h2>Battle Aces Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Battle Aces</em> is one of those games that will reward you for just how much you put into it. It is simple to pick up and go, and those that really want to dig into the optimal army composition and learn how to adjust on the fly will find a lot to love here.</p>

Initial results for publishers like Square Enix and Rockstar Games revealed entries with code names for games that haven’t been announced yet, or don’t currently have PC versions. Fans have been combing through the names and looking at corresponding data like cloud save file paths, file sizes, and associated DLC to speculate about what the mystery listings might be. </p><p>One is called “Momo” and appears to be for a long-rumored<em> Final Fantasy IX</em> remake. That’s because associated DLC listings describe things like “Tetra Master Starter Pack” and “Thief’s Knives.” There is also a separate listing for “Skobeloff” which fans believe to be the PC port of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>. Other listings from other publishers also point to potential surprises. One entry called “Semla” under Rockstar Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be</a></span> the rumored PC port of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, given a reportedly similar file size with the recent remaster of the game for consoles. </p><p>Saber Interactive, meanwhile, appears to have a hidden Epic Games Store entry that simply reads “Turok,” giving some fans hope that the dino-hunting classic might finally get a new sequel. Other codenamed entries are less surprising, like “Rhodeisland” which is possibly the upcoming PC port of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. The whole thing has led fans on a wild scavenger hunt searching for publisher codenames and trying to deduce what unannounced projects or ports they might be for.</p><p>It’s reminiscent of the massive Nvidia leak years ago, which included entries so shocking, like <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, that many presumed it to be an elaborate fake. One-by-one, however, many (though not all) of those leaked games were proven to be real. It’s always possible that some of the entries mined from the Epic Games Store are fake, speculative, or serving the purpose of a placeholder. But the fact that many are codenames rather than actual game titles has many convinced these are real projects that Epic Games just accidentally exposed. </p><p>A spokesperson for Epic said the company has since patched the store overnight to prevent further data scraping. “We released an update tonight so third-party tools can’t surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalog,” they told Kotaku in an email. The website for the EpicDB tool also now reports that the Cloudflare server for it is down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A soul guard accompanies the chosen alms to ensure their safe pilgrimage.</p><p>On the day of the Faerie’s arrival, Val, the new soul guard, brings his childhood friend, Hinna, to the festival. As the sun falls beneath the skyline, all the spectators wait with bated breath, hoping to be chosen as an alm.

Each vessel contains mana from a different element. You can wield these powers in combat and while exploring.</p><p><strong>Exploration: Elemental Triggers</strong></p><p>You can use an elemental vessel at the curiously glowing triggers scattered throughout the land and harness its individual power to generate gusts of wind, move rocks, or even slow down time to open pathways and find hidden items on the map. Once you get a new vessel, don’t forget to revisit areas you’ve already passed through. Accessing other triggers will unlock new places for you to explore/</p><p><strong>Battles: Switching Classes</strong></p><p>Obtain the various elemental vessels to switch your characters to new classes. Different classes unlock different stats, weapon types, and unique moves or abilities based on their corresponding elemental. Some abilities can restrict an enemy’s movements or cast regenerative effects to heal your allies. Change classes to see which element has the best skills for your individual fighting style!</p><p><strong>■ Elemental Vessels: Exploration and Triggers</strong></p><p>Here are some examples of what you can do with those mysterious elemental vessels out in the huge semi-open field. Use the corresponding vessel to activate the trigger and continue your adventure.</p><p><strong>Vessel of Water: Undine Flask</strong></p><p>Undine is the elemental of water.

His elemental vessel can harness the power of flame. While exploring the field, you can ride on the Salamando Candle to propel yourself through the air like a rocket.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_023.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_024.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_025.png"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Elemental Vessels: Battles and Classes</strong></p><p>Use the elemental powers in the vessels to change classes and gain new abilities.

Advancing along the plot is how you acquire powerful moves and abilities. A branch of the plot is unlocked whenever you obtain a new vessel.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_038.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_039.jpg"></a></figure><p>Moves learned from the elemental plot are still usable even if you switch classes. Meanwhile, abilities are class-specific and only take effect when the corresponding class is in use. These abilities have unique effects, so experiment with different strategies to best leverage each character’s innate skills!</p><p><strong>Moves</strong></p><p>Strong skills that require MP to use. Moves come in a variety of types, such as magic spells or traps.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_040.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Abilities</strong></p><p>Abilities can improve character stats such as attack or defense, as well as a variety of other effects that aid the party in battle.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_041.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_042.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Starter Classes</strong></p><p>Starter class refers to the class a character assumes when not equipped with an elemental vessel.</p><p>Maxing out the elemental plot of a single element will allow the starter class to equip weapons which were previously unable to equip, assign abilities not native to their class, and use class strikes from other classes.</p><p>Certain items can be also used to expand the plot, granting the character access to a higher tier of powerful moves.</p><p><strong>■ Battles: Ring Menu and Shortcuts</strong></p><p>Moves—powerful maneuvers that cost MP to execute—can be utilized from the ring menu, a <em>Mana</em> series staple. Only moves that have been set to the ring menu can be used in battle, so it’s important to consider both the team line-up and your personal play style when customizing your ring menu. Combat will pause while the ring menu is open, giving you time to plan out your next move.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_043.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_044.jpg"></a></figure><p>↓</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_045.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_046.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition to the ring menu, shortcuts are another way to instantly execute moves or access items. Assigning frequently used spells and items to a shortcut allows for a more intuitive and fast-paced playing experience.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_047.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_048.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Trusty Companions: Vuscav and Flammie</strong></p><p>Beloved <em>Mana</em> series travel companions Vuscav and Flammie make a welcome return in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, ready to sail the sea or soar above the clouds with you!
