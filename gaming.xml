		<p>The ever delightful Gearbox CEO, Randy Pitchford, has reminded PC players in his own unique style that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/"> Borderlands 4</a> has minimum spec requirements and it’s not going to work very well on older PCs.</p>
<p>His comments follow PC gamers complaining of performance issues and suggested that players need to “learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game”.</p>


<p>“The minimum and recommended specs are published. The most common hardware is a four year old cell phone. Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers. Just as Borderlands 4 cannot run on a PlayStation 4, it cannot be expected to run on too-old PC hardware”, he<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985"> tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>“Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub optimal hardware for the game try to play it. So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features. This is not a game made to run on 10 year old PC’s – this game uses the full capabilities of modern bus, CPU, and GPU.”</p>
<p>“If you’re trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower’s motor, you’re going to be disappointed. If you discover your system can’t run the game well by accident or wishful thinking and/or don’t want to try to mess with settings to make things good enough for you, please use the refund feature on Steam rather than have a subpar experience.”</p>

<p>Silver wallet linings?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>There's been some fairly heated debate since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, over the remastered collection's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">hefty price tag</a>. It's quite a lot of money for a pair of Wii games, as absolutely phenomenal as they are, there's no getting around it.</p>
<p>However, we do already know that the games present at 4K/1080p on Switch 2 (1080p docked on Switch 1), and that they offer up a sprinkling of new features such as a new Assist Mode, a new chapter of Rosalina's storybook, amiibo support, and what's described as "visual enhancements". How very vague of you, Nintendo.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Mario Galaxy</a> has already been re-released not so long ago as part of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection on Switch, and it's this version that those fine folk over at <a href="https://youtu.be/wOF6b0HgxCA?si=v1yUJir69RRo0CpC">GVG</a> have been checking out in a comparison video that gives us hope that we'll get a little more for our money than Nintendo was being clear about.</p>
<p>You can check out the full video above, which includes a playthrough comparison of the five minutes of Super Mario Galaxy's latest port (on Switch) as posted on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Super-Mario-Galaxy-Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-2915270.html">Nintendo UK's website</a> versus the one we got with Super Mario 3D All-Stars, giving better examples of texture work that's been done than "visual enhancements" really gets across. Just check out the cobblestones in the area shown below as Mario lands; there's a big difference in the detail.</p>

<p>Cutscenes have also been properly re-rendered this time out, rather than upscaled, which introduced some banding issues in the 3D All-Stars collection - they're now gone, according to GVG. Oh, and the aspect ratio has also been changed to fill the screen. Nice.</p>
<p>Another interesting point to note here is that all the footage on Nintendo's aite, it seems, is from the Switch versions of the games, so we have yet to actually get a look at just how they'll look with the full Switch 2 treatment. Fingers crossed we're in for more of a surprise from these re-releases than first appeared.</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to Super Mario Galaxy 1 + Super Mario Galaxy 2 when they release on the 2nd of October? Think the price is still too much? Make sure to let us know all your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

Palworld will launch proper alongside what sounds like a huge update, which Pocketpair is now focusing on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, Bucky said, means the rest of this year will be a little quieter for Palworld, although a winter update is still planned.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢About Palworld Ver. 1.0</p><p>Hello everyone.<br>Palworld will officially release (Ver. 1.0) in 2026.</p><p>We are currently developing a massive amount of content for this milestone, and also planning some surprises for the rest of 2025.</p><p>Please watch the video below for more details: <a href="https://t.co/rpP5gmLtjs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rpP5gmLtjs</a></p></div>— Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1967755319418724713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game,” Bucky explained. This “cleanup” starts this year, with 1.0 coming next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game,” Bucky continued. “It means things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year.” Related, the upcoming winter update won’t be as big as December 2024’s Feybreak update, although Bucky teased “a few surprises.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">1.0 will be a “major milestone," Bucky continued, “and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Pocketpair is “experimenting with other ideas for games,” although Bucky insisted “most of the company’s focus is on Palworld.” We will hear about these smaller teams and their ideas soon, he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Palworld news comes as Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s high-profile patent lawsuit against Pocketpair soldiers on. Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-should-never-have-received-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-ip-lawyers-say">some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted</a> — as it develops its case. Meanwhile, Pocketpair has vowed to defend itself in court, and continue to update Palworld along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. Then, in July, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>reworded one of the patents in the case</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At GDC in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with Bucky</u></a> following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>One technical issue the console version of Borderlands 4 is facing is a lack of a customisable field of vision slider, as the game has on PC. Currently the console FOV is low and the zoomed-in perspective is making some players feel sick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-is-pretty-damn-optimal-randy-pitchford-responds-to-borderlands-4-pc-performance-complaints">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford polled console players recently</a> about how strongly they felt about changing this, and three quarters of respondents felt very strongly about it. So, Gearbox appears to be doing something about it.</p>
<p>"We have heard your feedback on FOV (Field of View) sliders on console," <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1967001003422871921">Gearbox announced on the Borderlands 4 X account.</a> "The team is currently exploring how to bring these sliders to both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions. We will continue to read your feedback &amp; prioritise game updates with your experience in mind."</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 had a popular opening weekend but is facing some backlash on PC for its technical performance there. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-exploring-getting-borderlands-4-fov-sliders-on-console">Randy Pitchford took to X over the weekend</a> to tell players they needed to make some graphical trade-offs if they wanted high frame-rates, and suggested high frame-rates weren't, in a campaign-based looter shooter like this, the studio's top priority. "It's not a competitive FPS," he said.</p>
<p>Our Borderlands 4 review is currently in the works.</p>

            <p>
Sales of physical software accounted for just three percent of PlayStation sales last year, according to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf">latest corporate report</a>.
</p>
<p>
Considering the company's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q4_sonypre.pdf">total gaming division sales in 2024</a> were 4,670bn yen (around $31.77bn by today's conversion), Sony still made around $953m in physical software sales (as a rough estimate). 
</p>
<p>
However, that number has dropped from six percent of sales <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2020_E.pdf">back in 2020</a>. It's no wonder Sony's PS5 consoles are primarily digital-only when fewer consumers are buying physical games, even with the option of a disc drive. Or has there been a decline in physical games <em>because</em> of the digital-only consoles? And with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/">reports</a> the PS6 will also be digital-only with an optional disc drive, it's a trend that's only set to continue.

<p>
By comparison, hardware makes up 24 percent of sales, though that's a given considering the high cost of consoles - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">price that keeps getting higher</a>. That's increased from 19 percent in 2020.
</p>
<p>
Digital software sales, meanwhile, account for 20 percent of revenue - a huge margin compared with physical sales. 
</p>
<p>
Add-on content (DLC, effectively), accounts for 29 percent of sales, the biggest revenue driver of all. It's no wonder, then, Sony is so keen to push live-service games - its report highlights the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, Gran Turismo and MLB The Show, as well as noting the "eagerly awaited Marathon".
</p><p>Interestingly, the proportion of network services sales has dropped since 2020 from 17 to 14 percent (perhaps due to the rise in hardware sales). However, since 2022, monthly active users have increased 14 percent to 124 million accounts in 2024.</p>

<p>
Another reason for the lower physical software sales last year could be the limited number of first-party games released, which tend to be bought more as physical editions. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> was the company's biggest release last year, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">sold 1.5m in its first month</a>, but it was otherwise a quiet year.
</p><p>
PlayStation's decline in physical game sales parallels Nintendo's struggles with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>. As game sizes have increased, it's become more difficult to squeeze them onto physical media - that's why Switch 2 uses game key cards that act as a key for a download. But with digital storage at a premium, it means massive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">games like Final Fantasy 7 Remake will take up huge amounts of capacity</a>.

            <p><a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/home/">The Crew Unlimited</a>, a fan project making Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> playable again following its unceremonious shutdown last year, released yesterday, September 15th. There's been some early issues to rectify, with the developers having put out two hotfixes already and emphasised that they're "not responsible" for any problems caused by people having grabbed "broken/corrupted game files" from "shady sources".</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">reported earlier this month</a>, The Crew Unlimited's devs started working on it not long after Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play"> pulled the racer's official servers offline</a> in March 2024, rendering it unplayable. Cue a group of fans deciding to set up a server emulator that'd allow them to get it up and running again for players who still had the game files installed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon opening up its gullwing doors yesterday, the project quickly ran into some teething issues. In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1107329778396172348/1417303193984962570">an announcement on Discord</a> early this morning, project lead whammy4 revealed that the team have performed "over 10 hours of non-stop tech support" out of the gate, and it looks like the majority of the issues have affected folks who didn't already legitmately own The Crew's game files via Steam prior to grabbing The Crew Unlimited.</p>
<p>"It has come to my attention that a lot of you have acquired (by whichever shady methods...) broken/corrupted game files," the developer wrote. "If you have acquired the game files from shady sources then we are not responsible for whether your game works or not. Players with legit Steam copies have had by far the least issues, no wonder. Also, to those who expect swift 24/7 around-the-clock support for them and them personally - I don't want to say rude things in announcements."</p><p>Prior to the project's release, its developers had acknowledged via their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1246439486641143960/1246479173502107678">Discord FAQ page</a> that while they wouldn't be distributing any of The Crew's game files, "as long as you manage to run the game files, we have absolutely no way to tell a legit copy from a non-legit one, so we just have to let you in."</p>
<p>Around that announcement, the team have put out a number of fixes. The first, a launcher update called <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417254654672113735">version 1.1.0.0</a>, fixed the default save "disappearing and preventing the game from logging you in", as well as some DateTime string errors. It also added an 'Apply' button to the cheats section in the hopes of averting some "interface confusion".</p>
<p>That update's been followed by two hotfixes. <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417310879262965870">Version 1.1.1.0</a> stopes a default 'TCUPlayer' profile being automatically created and save game names being left blank, while <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417332986105430066">version 1.1.2.0</a> rectifies the player being automatically given the username, er, "UserName" instead of the default 'TCUPlayer' due to "a logic error in the launcher" if you clicked play straight away.</p>
<p>I can't remember if I've mentioned this before, but my defining memory of The Crew is not being able to get the Artic Monkeys' 'Do I Wanna Know?' out of my head, no matter what I tried. I'm not sure I wanna know if it's as overplayed in this fan revival.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/overseas-publishers-microsoft-want-games-done-quickly-as-possible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overseas-publishers-like-microsoft-want-games-done-as-quickly-as-possible-says-kamiya-who-still-can%E2%80%99t-let-scalebound-go.1298853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It may be over eight and a half years since Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Scale</a>bound, the action game it would publish as a PC and Xbox exclusive from developer PlatinumGames, but Game Director Hideki Kamiya still hasn't let this go.</p>



<p>In the following years, the veteran game designer and director, whose works include Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Ōkami, Bayonetta, and The Wonderful 101 among others, often remarked on how disappointed he was in what happened with that project. Earlier this year, he even <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to resurrect Scalebound someday.</p>



<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, he returned to the subject from another perspective: discussing the differences between Japanese and Western publishers.</p>



<p><em>What it feels like when working with Japanese publishers is that the development culture feels closer to mind, and they tend to be more understanding toward creators. On the Japanese side, my impression is that they see you’re trying to make a new invention. They understand the struggle of trying to give birth to something new, and they watch over the process with patience. That’s where I see there’s a difference with publishers.</em></p>



<p>When asked if Scalebound could have made it with a Japanese publisher, Kamiya answered that overseas publishers (like Microsoft in this case) tend to want a game done as quickly as possible. In contrast, Japanese ones might have been more understanding of the difficulties.</p>



<p><em>I do think it would’ve been different. I don’t mean that if it had been a Japanese publisher, the game would necessarily have been completed and released, but I imagine the process itself would have played out differently. Japanese companies tend to be more open to new challenges, and I think the conversations would have been more positive, like, “Okay, so how should we approach this together? For me personally, overseas publishers seem to have a much stronger desire to see a finished product as quickly as possible. If it had been a Japanese publisher, I feel they might have given us more leeway</em></p>



<p>As Kamiya had mentioned before, PlatinumGames did not have a frame of reference for a game where players controlled a dragon and a human character at the same time, which caused problems. Still, having said that, the game director maintains that the ultimate responsibility was his, and with Scalebound's experience, he might work better with a Western publisher in the future.</p>



<p>Kamiya is now working at Clovers, a new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing an Ōkami sequel for CAPCOM</a>.</p>

			<p>The recent release of Chibi-Robo on the Switch 2 Online service was welcome news as the Gamecube title is one of my favourite games of all time. The adventures of a tiny robot whose purpose is to clean may not have sounded like the most exciting premise for a game, but the charm and design elevated it to a true classic. Misc. A Tiny Tale is very clearly inspired by the earlier game and offers a more linear and focused take on the gameplay elements while retaining the charm and humour in spades.</p>

A Tiny Tale - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlRa1fpf_d4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Whilst Chibi-Robo has a lot of interactions between Chibi and the humans in the house, Misc takes place in a posthuman world where all that is left is the remains of civilisation and a new world is being built by tiny robots. This seemingly grim future is not a depressing setting per se, and instead serves to provide an empty playground for the robots to take centre stage. There is the subtle suggestion that humanity has brought about its own downfall, but this is more of a context than a narrative point. The end result, however, is that a story devoid of humans is paradoxically filled with humanity.</p>


<p>You play as Buddy, a cute little robot with a basic range of platforming abilities and a seemingly bottomless capacity for trash (a trait I can certainly identify with). You can jump, both single and double, hover to reach distant platforms, and move and carry objects. Nothing revolutionary by any means but the tools at your disposal are well used to make each level feel developed and interesting. The biggest nod to Chibi Robo (aside from picking up rubbish) is the little brush you use to clean up stains and spills. This tiny mechanic feels far more satisfying than it should – especially when you’re sat in a messy room trying to avoid actual housework.</p>


<p>The world of Misc is wonderfully detailed and full of character. While it plays out in distinct levels rather than an integrated map this does help to give each area a feel of its own. You’ll travel through various different villages, desolate areas, a junkyard, and even an abandoned human-scale house. Along the way you’ll help a varied cast of other tiny robots and get to know more about your protagonist and his best friend Bag Boy. The latter is distinguished by wearing a paper bag for reasons that only become apparent in the later levels of the game. He is also constantly accompanied by a grumpy and eternally hungry robot cat – which is always a plus point.</p>
<p>The immediate backstory for Misc involves a mysterious explosion that is the catalyst for Buddy’s big adventure. The explosion leaves strange golden cogs scattered around the world – cogs that are needed to activate the doors at the end of each level. While there are ten to find in each stage, only eight are required to progress, whilst there are also incentives to clean all the stains and pick up every piece of rubbish. The levels are easily replayed through the map screen and it is clear what you still have to do in each – although there are times when you’ll need to scour the map to find the last piece of rubbish or spillage. Fortunately you can buy a radar tracker once you’ve found all the golden cogs on a level to help you track down any missed objects.</p>

<p>Some golden cogs are located in difficult to reach areas and require accurate platforming skills whilst others are rewards for helping out other bots. Requests range from watering all the plants in a garden to finding an accessory to make a staple remover hydra feel less intimidating. The main connecting tissue is Buddy, an endlessly optimistic (despite being voiceless) presence who is driven by a pure curiosity and desire to help.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Misc. A Tiny Tale is a real hidden gem. The quality of the level design, the amount of emotional heft in the narrative, and the sheer joy of exploration in the game make it feel like a true successor to Chibi-Robo. Even if it doesn’t quite have the scope of Nintendo’s title, it's a pleasure from beginning to end.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVIBHP37eM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in a video message that it aims to release Palworld 1.0 next year. To achieve that goal, they will focus on polishing, which means the rest of 2025 won't feature truly big updates to the early access version. Communications Director and Publishing Manager 'Bucky' explained:</p>



<p><em>We've reached a crossroads and need to decide what comes next. While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about 1.0. Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that it has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release Palworld next year in 2026. And we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game. So, what does this mean? It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year. It also means our winter update won't be as big as Feybreak was. We hope our players understand that we're taking this extra time to improve the game overall. Now, that said, it doesn't mean there will be no updates. We still do have a few surprises planned for our winter update this year. We just want to be transparent about where we're headed and the development of Palworld going forward. It is not slowing down or scaling back; quite the opposite. Version 1.0 will be a major milestone for us, and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update. Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end.</em></p>



<p>Bucky also said that PocketPair is also doing other things, such as supporting other small developers through a publishing division and even starting to research other game ideas for future projects. Of course, Palworld is still what most of the company is concentrating on, and it couldn't be any different given the incredible success achieved when the game launched in early 2024, breaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-3-million-units-in-40-hours-broke-1-million-concurrent-users-on-steam-surpassing-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record after record</a> for the first few weeks. To this day, PocketPair's survival action monster taming game is third on Steam's all-time concurrent player chart with 2.1 million players. Only Black Myth: Wukong and PUBG have done better. Overall, Palworld has surpassed 32 million players across all platforms earlier this year.</p>



<p>However, the Japanese developer also has to deal with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo lawsuit</a>, which was filed nearly a year ago for alleged patent infringement. PocketPair is fighting the lawsuit in court, but in the meantime, they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to introduce some changes to the game</a>.</p>

<p>"Segaaah!"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Sega has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and with it has reignited its rivalry with Nintendo (albeit in a cute, harmless sort of way).</p>
<p>In an effort to pay homage to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPJw4CfkhMU">Sega Genesis vs. SNES advertisement</a> from the early '90s, the new trailer highlights CrossWorlds' high-speed action, broad customisation, and cross-platform compatibility, all the while throwing <em>slight</em> shade at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer starts off with a heavily pixelated look at Mario Kart World (because no one wants to entice the wrath of Nintendo) while stating "We all know <em>that</em> kart racing game, it's great, we don't need to show it to you". A slightly positive note, you might think.</p>
<p>After showcasing Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, however, the trailer then goes back to Mario Kart World, which is represented by a grubby, struggling RV, all the while sarcastically exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, uhh, what if you wanna roam around the open world..?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like we said, it's cute, it's harmless, but it's nevertheless a fun way to look back upon Sega's heritage and reference that, yes, both Sega and Nintendo have major racing games launching in 2025.</p>
<p>A demo for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be launching on Switch this week, so be sure to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/sonic-racing-crossworlds-demo-races-onto-switch-next-week">check out all of the details</a> if you're interested. The game itself will land on Switch on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>, while the Switch 2 version is scheduled for later this year.</p>

<p>Which will you pick up?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Infograph 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51611eee1fa26/nintendo-infograph-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct</a>, the company has released a handy new infographic showcasing every major game that cropped up during the hour-long broadcast.</p>
<p>Say what you want about the Direct itself, seeing all of these games on one page highlights just how impressive the upcoming line-up of games really is. We've got the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and more. It's a lot.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Infograph 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38bcf2407ad39/nintendo-infograph-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1967619424455704975">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, questions <em>do</em> still remain, including why on earth Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/icymi-if-you-want-to-play-virtual-boy-classics-youll-need-to-buy-one-of-nintendos-accessories">isn't offering a way to play Virutal Boy games without the use of the headset</a> (or cardboard equivalent), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">why the Mario galaxy games are so darn expensive</a> on the Switch. And let's be honest, neither of these will likely be answered.</p>
<p>But if you're wondering <em>"crikey, does the Switch 2 even have games?"</em>, we think the answer is yes, it definitely does. Not all of them will be to your taste, but we feel quite satisfied with the cadence in which new experiences are being released.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

It’s no secret that <em>Palworld</em> has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release <em>Palworld</em> next year, in 2026, and we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game.”</p><p>Bucky continued, “So, what does this mean? It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year. It also means our winter update won’t be as big as [the] February [update] was. We hope our players understand that we’re taking this extra time to improve the game overall. Now, that said, it doesn’t mean there will be no updates, but we still do have a few surprises planned for our winter update this year.</p><p>“We just want to be transparent about where we’re headed and the development of <em>Palworld</em> going forward. Development of <em>Palworld</em> is not slowing down or scaling back, quite the opposite. <em>Palworld</em> 1.0 will be a major milestone for us, and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update. Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end. We’re really excited about this, and we hope our fans will be really excited about this too. We plan to share some sneak peeks about <em>Palworld</em> 1.0 in the very near future.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>After years of anticipation, Team Cherry only gave the video game industry and players two weeks notice that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was about to arrive on September 4. While a handful of indie games were moved away from that date, Rogue Factor had already staked out the same release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538">Hell is Us</a> six months earlier. Now, Hell is Us' creative director is sharing his belief that Silksong's shadow drop negatively impacted Hell is Us' sales, and he doesn't sound happy about it.</p><p>Jonathan Jacques-Belletête acknowledged that Team Cherry had the right to pick any date it wanted to during his appearance on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friends Per Second</a> podcast (via <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This Week in Video Games</a>). However, Jacques-Belletête feels that the decision to do so on such short notice was "a little callous."</p><p>"When you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like--'wow,'" said Jacques-Belletête. "As the 'GTA 6 of indie' ... to shadow drop something like this is a little callous."</p><p>According to Jacques-Belletête, discussions were held between Rogue Factor and publisher Nacon about delaying Hell is Us. But there were too many complicating factors, including the need to refund any pre-orders that had already been placed.</p><p>"We decided to keep the date, and I'm happy that we did," added Jacques-Belletête. "We're still much bigger than some of the smaller ones who would have gotten a lot more affected and who decided to change their dates. Changing the date of Hell Is Us would have been a pretty big [endeavor]."</p><p>Jacques-Belletête went on to note that he believes Silksong's release hurt Hell is Us' sales, but also acknowledged that he doesn't currently have the sales numbers available to illustrate that point.</p><p>As for Silksong, it debuted with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-had-a-massive-steam-player-count-over-its-first-weekend/1100-6534537/" data-ref-id="1100-6534537">a massive concurrent player count on Steam during its first weekend</a>. A common complaint about the game is that it's too difficult, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-a-bunch-of-mods-that-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534541/" data-ref-id="1100-6534541">mods designed to make Silksong easier</a> were released almost immediately. Team Cherry subsequently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">its own patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>.</p>

                <p>SpongeBob has gone on plenty of video game adventures, and on October 31, you can grab a physical edition of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Bundle-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FQGNGKZH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob SquarePants: Bundle</a> that collects two of SpongeBob's best games--Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated and The Cosmic Shake--into a single physical release. Preorders for the two-game collection are available at Amazon for just $35--that's a 50% price cut compared to the digital version of the bundle that's already available for $70 on the Switch eShop.</p><p>The Cosmic Shake is the better (and newer) of the two games, and it earned solid marks from critics.

"Despite a few hiccups and disappointing aspects of The Cosmic Shake design, at its core it achieves its goals," writes GameSpot reviewer James Carr.</p><p>The other game in the bundle, Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, earned similar reviews, giving nostalgic fans a massive version of the underwater town to roam around as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566184" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566184"></a><figcaption>SpongeBob SquarePants: Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566185,1300-4566186,1300-4566187" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>This new Switch physical edition bundle isn't the only way to get your SpongeBob fix.
