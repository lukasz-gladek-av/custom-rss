Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the most brilliant things about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a> was the way it dropped you into the wilderness to fend for yourself as <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/02/pokemon-legends-arceus-alpha-pokemon-how-to-catch.html">wild monsters tried to kill you</a>. It was a surprising deviation from the franchise’s typically chill vibe that complimented the game’s story about how <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22916203/pokemon-legends-arceus-dangerous-mystery/">humans once lived in constant fear of pokémon</a>. <em>Arceus</em>’ mild horror elements felt like something that might not carry over to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, but the new game’s latest trailer makes it seem like Nintendo wants to keep the scares coming.</p><p>Today, The Pokémon Company dropped another <em>Legends: Z-A </em>trailer that highlights a new(ish) pokémon and suggests some things about the game’s story. Titled “The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident,” the trailer follows as two young trainers wander into an abandoned building somewhere <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">in Lumiose City in the middle of the night</a>. Something is clearly off about the building between its strange scent, the weird noises coming from it, and the puddles of corrosive liquid that the trainers keep seeing as they check out the place. None of that is enough to convince the kids to turn back. But when the trainers venture upstairs, they’re shocked to see a man being attacked by what appears to be a gigantic pitcher plant that bounces around and spews the purple ooze that’s been splattered all over the walls.</p><p>That creature, of course, is a <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Victreebel_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Victreebel</a> that’s undergone mega evolution, a game mechanic that first appeared in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em>. According to <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Mega-Evolution-of-the-Flycatcher-Pokemon-VictreebelMega-VictreebelAppe">a press release</a>, Mega Victreebel’s new form increases the amount of sweet smelling acid it contains so much that the liquid is prone to spilling out. That detail kind of explains why Mega Victreebel resembles a bag that has been cinched at the top — it’s literally overflowing with dangerous ooze that’s meant to lure in unsuspecting pretty before it gobbles up and dissolves them. But the trailer also shows that this Mega Victreebel is just a pokémon that belongs to a construction worker who was only trying to train his partner without bothering other people.</p><p>Setting aside its first person, <em>Resident Evil</em>-inspired tone, what’s interesting about the trailer is the way it suggests that <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>might involve missions similar to “The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident” where players are tasked with investigating strange goings on around Lumiose. We already knew that the game would once again feature wild monsters capable of attacking players as well as their pokémon. But this new trailer really hammers home how much <em>Z-A </em>is going to be a game about people figuring out how to live in a city that’s meant to be hospitable to humans and pokémon alike. It makes sense that that process might involve some danger given how most pokémon have destructive powers. And that danger is probably going to make <em>Legends: Z-A </em>feel like another wild ride when it drops in October.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/763401/pokeon-legends-za-mega-victreebel]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">will arrive seven years after the first game</a>. Why? That’s what fans have been impatiently wondering for a while now. According to the developers at Team Cherry, there was no major drama or development snafus. Seven years is just how long it takes to make the Metroidvania Soulslike sequel to what some fans regard as one of the best games of the last decade.</p> <p>“I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,” cofounder Ari Gibson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a new interview</a>. “Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’”</p> <p>What began as DLC for 2017’s surprise Steam hit <em>Hollow Knight</em> eventually morphed into a full-fledged standalone game. Team Cherry officially revealed <em>Silksong</em> would become a sequel in 2019. The developers told <em>Bloomberg</em> they wanted to keep their team size small so as not to disrupt the creative flow responsible for the first game. But growing scope—bigger boss fights, multiple towns, a denser world—meant it would take even longer to finish, especially if it would exude the same level of tight controls, visual polish, and world-building mystery of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p>

 <p>When Microsoft doubled down in 2022 on the promise that <em>Silksong</em> would arrive within the year, that was apparently the actual goal. “We did genuinely believe that was the case,” cofounder William Pellen confirmed. “There was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.” The team just kept biting off more than it could chew while also calmly ignoring all of the online chatter about unhinged fans.</p> <p>“I think we’re always underestimating the amount of time and effort it’ll take us to achieve things,” Gibson told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “It’s also that problem where, because we’re having fun doing it, it’s not like, ‘It’s taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.’ It’s, ‘This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let’s perpetuate this with some new ideas.’”</p> <p>It seems to have helped that the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> has now sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry revealed. <em>Silksong</em> is already Steam’s most-wishlisted game. If it lives up to even a fraction of the hype, the team won’t be forced to release their next game any time soon, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we have information about the future of <em>Forza</em>, news about Sony and EVO, and some fresh details about that new Lego Batman game. Also: get excited about The Gorillaz coming to <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <h2>The Gorillaz are coming to <em>Fortnite</em></h2> <p>New leaks seem to indicate that the famous animated band The Gorillaz will be the next <em>Fortnite Festival</em> headlining act. This means the characters from the band will appear in-game as skins and some of their music will be added to <em>Festival</em>, too. The last few artists haven’t been very exciting, but bringing in the Gorillaz has my attention. Expect Epic to start teasing this next week or sooner, and then for the Gorillaz to arrive on August 26 when the current Bruno Mars season wraps up.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GORILLAZ x FORTNITE INFO — AUGUST 26</p> <p>• 2D &amp; Noodle are most likely Item Shop<br>• Murdoc &amp; Russel are Festival Pass (Official Look) <a href="https://t.co/SnbqIstFTZ">pic.twitter.com/SnbqIstFTZ</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1958249205195251776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>The next <em>Forza Horizon</em> game is likely set in Japan</h2> <p>There’s been a lot of rumors that the next <em>Forza Horizon</em> open-world racing game would be set in Japan and well, here’s some evidence that the speculation is probably correct. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-location-leaked-by-car-import-company-fans-believe">As reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, in a now-deleted social media post, a car importing company shared an image that claimed someone working on <em>Forza</em> came by to take scans and photos of a car made by Japanese manufacturer Kei. The post claimed this would be used in the next <em>Forza Horizon</em> game. Oops! But hey, a new <em>Forza Horizon</em> set in Japan sounds great.</p>

 <h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is making the leap to Xbox</h2> <p>During Xbox’s Gamescom stream, it was announced that <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is coming to Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass on September 17. I’m a big fan of this <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-like shoot ’em up and play it all the time on my Steam Deck, so I’m excited to play it on my Xbox and earn some achievements.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor releases Sept 17th on Xbox and coming to Game Pass <a href="https://t.co/ZQgVQeK8Is">pic.twitter.com/ZQgVQeK8Is</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1958524899758113136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>That new <em>Lego Batman</em> game will have Riddler trophies to find</h2> <p>That newly announced <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> game looks to be the <em>Arkham</em> sequel fans have wanted for years now. And adding to that feeling is the confirmation from folks who have played the game at Gamescom that there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/sbOodsqBSmk?t=472">Riddler trophies and puzzles spread around the game’s open world</a> waiting for players to find and collect them all. Good luck with that.</p> <h2>Analogue delays its fancy N64 console…again</h2> <p>Analogue’s fancy, 4K Nintendo 64 console has been delayed again. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html">On August 20, the company announced</a> that the highly anticipated retro games machine had been delayed again until Q4 2025. The $250 Analogue 3D was previously delayed in March and July. Hopefully, this new delay is the last one, and we’ll get our hands on this cool-looking console later this year.</p> <h2>Sony is selling its stake in the fighting game event EVO</h2> <p>Around four years ago, Sony spent a lot of money to buy up popular fighting game tournament EVO. It was weird! And in the years since, it’s remained a weird thing. And now, that era is ending as <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145596/sony-sells-evo-co-ownership-nodwin-gaming?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Sony announced on August 21</a> that it was selling its ownership stake to co-owner NODWIN Gaming. Sony will remain a sponsor of future EVO events.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923"><em>Elden Ring</em> is struggling to run on the Switch 2</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-the-game-announced-will-feature-multiplayer-and-solo-story-mode-2000618930">Michael Myers is back in a newly announced <em>Halloween</em> game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-layoffs-2k-games-delay-2000618914"><em>Bioshock 4</em> studio gutted by recent layoffs</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Militsioner - Official Public Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c18RAdJs5Iw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>“This actually made me Pre-Order [sic] Battlefield 6.” </strong>That sentiment is seemingly felt among a number of players as the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 gameplay reveal trailer is being hammered by the community, with many claiming they’re moving to EA’s Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two days after its reveal</a>, the Black Ops 7 trailer sits at just 42,000 likes despite having over 28 million views. That puts it at one of the lowest-liked reveal trailers in the franchise’s history. Moving to the dislikes shows even more bad news, at least on the surface. </p>



<p>Thanks to a browser extension, it shows that the Black Ops 7 gameplay trailer has 235,000 downvotes as of publishing. And it only seems to be growing in number.  For comparison purposes, the Black Ops 6 reveal trailer has just 5,452 dislikes after more than a year while the gameplay reveal is no longer available on the official Call of Duty YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Moving to the comments shows a drastically different story. Many of the top comments mention Battlefield 6, and how players are more excited or moving over to the game.</p>



<p>The previously mentioned comment about pre-ordering Battlefield 6 sits at 108,000 likes. Another comment  that says <strong>“From a COD player- thank you for making it easy to choose Bf6”</strong> has 41,000 likes.</p>

                <p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 was properly revealed, a perhaps-unsurprising reveal was the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a> would be coming to the platform. The console is more powerful than the original Switch after all, though there was still the question of how it might run given just how big Elden Ring is. Well, as it currently stands, performance might be quite bad, as a demo for the port of the game at Gamescom is reportedly running at a low frame rate. Not only that, but Bandai Namco staff running the demo apparently weren't letting people record footage of the game either.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM">Nintendo Life shared a video</a> featuring video producer Felix Sanchez in which he detailed his experience with Elden Ring on Switch 2. "It's really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible," Sanchez explained, also claiming that no gameplay could be recorded through direct capture or even over the shoulder.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Of course, you're never going to see the light of this--maybe it will just release in that state, but I can’t imagine they will do that. It was like playing Ocarina of Time. It was like 20 frames per second. Sometimes I was like, 'This has dropped [to] 15 frames per second.'"</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that Sanchez played the game in handheld mode, and during the tutorial section of the game it ran well for the most part, but it was when he arrived at the full open-world section where performance nosedived.</p><p dir="ltr">As it stands, Elden Ring doesn't currently have a Switch 2 release date, though it is supposed to be releasing this year. That does give it some time to improve upon these reported performance issues, but you'll have to wait until the game is out to see how the Switch 2 really handles it.</p>

            <p>Earlier today, Team Cherry finally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">announced a release date for its long-awaited Hollow Knight sequel Silksong</a>. After seven years, it will finally be out next month.</p>
<p>Yet contrary to what you may believe, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> hasn't been in development hell for that time. Instead, Team Cherry's developers were just having too much fun making it.</p>
<p>In fact, sales of the original game have skyrocketed from 2.8m copies to 15m copies since Silksong's announcement in 2019, giving the studio the financial freedom to take their time.</p>

<p>What was originally intended as an expansion to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> soon ballooned into its own game, with the studio announcing in February 2019 it would be a full sequel.</p>
<p>"Even at that point we were recognising that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of Hollow Knight or probably exceed it," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "And then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later."</p>
<p>"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson added. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p>
<p>That 12m rise in sales of the original Hollow Knight is extraordinary. Somehow, Team Cherry inadvertently created the ultimate hype machine: hype for the sequel led to sales for the original, which meant it could take longer to develop, which fed the hype even more due to silence, which became a meme, which meant it could take even longer.</p>
<p>"We're very lucky in that regard," said Gibson. "I don't ever really think about it that much. Maybe that's the privilege of it."</p>
<p>No strict deadline and a flood of financial income meant Team Cherry could take its time. It's in stark contrast to so many other studios at the moment hell-bent on chasing trends and generating cash in the face of rising development costs, which has inevitably resulted in the mass layoffs across the industry in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>By contrast, Team Cherry has remained lean. What's more, it's spent the past seven years enjoying development.</p>
<p>"We've been having fun," said Gibson said. "This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It's nice to make fun things.</p>
<p>"We're very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable," Gibson continued. "Not exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that's very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone's off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person's laughed, and that's enough."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"You're always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss," added co-founder William Pellen. "That stuff's so nice. It's for the sake of just completing the game that we're stopping. We could have kept going."</p>
<p>Add to that a desire for exceptional polish, and it's easy to see how development could have continued even longer.</p>
<p>"I think we're always underestimating the amount of time and effort it'll take us to achieve things," said Gibson. "It's also that problem where, because we're having fun doing it, it's not like, 'It's taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.' It's, 'This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let's perpetuate this with some new ideas.'"</p><p>"There's a level of finish that has to be met throughout the entire game," added Pellen. "All the way the systems interact, all the hidden work that pops up later on. It's multiplicative. As you add stuff, the process of tying it all back together just increases."</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Silksong will fully live up to the hype, but with its release date of 4th September it won't be long until we find out. At the least, it follows games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> as a project with a relatively small team and a huge amount of passion finding big success, where so many AAA studios and publishers have stumbled.</p>

<p>IT'S HAPPENING</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Team Cherry's "special announcement" gave us what we were all hoping for, Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch on <strong>4th September</strong>.</p>
<p>The reveal gave us a closer look at the gameplay, showcasing the "lethal acrobatic action", "vast handcrafted world", and a massive roster of enemies (200 regular enemies and 40 bosses, to be precise).</p>
<p>Let's remember that this is the biggest look we've had at the game in <em>years</em>, and 4th September is so very close! Here's a closer look at some of the trailer's stunning moments:</p>

<p>Look, we're really rather excited about the whole thing. We recently went hands-on with the game at Gamescom, and we were very impressed with what we saw. Can it really live up to the hype? We don't have long until we find out...</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-for-september.1277121/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, it's finally happened; after six years of development and lengthy silences on the part of developer Team Cherry, the&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date has been revealed at last.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's special announcement (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week" rel="nofollow">was first teased on Tuesday</a>),&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be releasing on September 4th. It's good of Team Cherry not to keep us waiting for too much longer after we've already waited for so long!</p>

<p>The game's release date was announced as part of a brand new trailer that also showed off protagonist Hornet's impressively acrobatic moveset, as well as some of the enemies and bosses you'll be facing as you bring "hope" to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s ruined kingdom du jour.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-acrobatics.jpg?itok=EB14JlPm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-acrobatics.jpg?itok=eLg2dEhQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>looks like a much more acrobatic game than the first.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, much of&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>will look familiar to you if you're a&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>fan, but the new trailer promises that you'll be able to face off against more than 200 enemies and vanquish over 40 new bosses, so it's fair to say this is almost certainly a much bigger and more expansive game than its predecessor.</p>

<p>Hornet's moves look much more acrobatic than her predecessor knight's, too; she can chain jumps, attacks, dashes, and more together for some specatacular-looking platforming that looks just as nimble and satisfying as the first game's gauntlets.</p>

<p>We also get a glimpse of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s map in the new trailer, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed if you're hoping for a massive, interconnected Metroidvania world to explore. In short,&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>is looking every bit like the game we've all hoped it would be since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">that fateful day in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong thoroughly impressed us in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and the positive reception immediately led to a desire from players for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-download-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong demo</a> to be downloadable.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to add the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date to your calendar and potentially prepare to call in sick from work or school, we’ve got the precise details you need.</p>

<p><strong>After years of waiting, Hollow Knight: Silksong finally has an official release date and will be available worldwide on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>First announced in February 2019, and even having a playable demo at E3 that year, it’s been a long six-year wait for fans waiting for the title. At times, you’d be forgiven for wondering if you’d be stuck waiting for the release until the end of time.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has delivered, though, with a release date much sooner than many may have expected, so it won’t be too much longer until the long wait comes to an end and you’re experiencing a historic moment in gaming history.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hollow-knight-silksong-s-start-times">Do we Know Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s too early to provide an exact start time for Hollow Knight: Silksong and when exactly it will be playable, but we might be able to hazard a guess.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hollow-knight-silksong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is confirmed to be a day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass, which has a fairly set schedule for releases and the majority of titles become playable at 7am PT/9am CT/10am ET/3pm BST/12am AEST.</p>



<p>That’s only an estimate, however, but bookmark this page as we’ll update the article as soon as we have an accurate start time. For now, the release date is the most important piece of information, and after years of waiting for that to be revealed, I’m sure you can cope a little while longer for start times.</p>



<p>Will Hollow Knight: Silksong live up to the hype? Let us know your expectations in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Here, you’ll meet <a title="Games > Dew" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dew">Dew</a>, the mysterious goddess who guides your journey, and interact with new NPCs that offer quests, gear upgrades, auctions, and essential services.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Admittedly, from what I've seen of newcomer developer Rebel Wolves' upcoming first game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/23/check-out-20-minutes-of-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-in-new-gameplay-overview">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, it's given off some heavy Witcher vibes. That's not completely misplaced, considering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/dawnwalker-is-the-name-of-an-upcoming-dark-fantasy-rpg-by-former-cd-projekt-red-devs">Rebel Wolves was formed by former CD Projekt Red devs</a> with experience working on The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077. Sure, there are vampires, but it's still a medieval dark fantasy where the protagonist is a gruff swordsman with one goal in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>After an hour-long hands-off preview with Dawnwalker, though, it's clear this game is much more than just The Witcher with vampires. Sitting in the room, themed to look like a 14th-century chapel, I frantically took notes of what I was watching on screen, wishing the entire time I was the one playing the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The demo begins in the valley of the Carpathian mountains, sometime during the 14th century. A plague has swept the land, weakening humanity, making them easier than ever to be overtaken by the Vrakhiri, or a race of vampires. Our protagonist, Coen, is what's called a Daywalker, and though details on what that entails are still murky after my preview, it's clear he is at least part vampire.&nbsp;</p><p>Rebel Wolves showcased this by running us through the same quest twice: once during the night, when Coen is tapped into his vampire side, and once during the day, when he can't use his vampiric abilities but can utilize magic. Though this quest ended on the same note both ways, there was an impressive amount of variation between the day and night versions.&nbsp;</p><p>Rebel Wolves began with the nighttime version of the quest.&nbsp;</p><p>Immediately, I'm impressed with the visuals. Sure, the game has been Epic's baby for demonstrating Unreal Engine 5 in recent showcases, but the art team is doing some gorgeous work with lighting. The way the full moon above illuminates the central cathedral's stained glass reminded me of the stained glass I witnessed myself at the Dom cathedral here in Cologne. Alongside the full moon high above in the sky is a red full moon, indicating Coen can tap into his vampire abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coen infiltrates a cathedral and sticks to the upper floors as, down below, a blood ritual is happening. He uses Plane Shift to walk on walls and ceilings like Spider-Man, albeit on two feet. He also utilizes Shadowstep, which allows him to teleport short distances by transforming into a moving shadow. In the cathedral, he searches nearby Frescoes painted on the ceiling, looking for a clue as to the whereabouts of St. Mihia's crypt, which houses a sword he's after.&nbsp;</p><p>After a bit more exploration, Coen fights off some enemies using his claws. It's fast, visceral, and extremely gory, with dismemberment galore. He also uses Voracious Bite to suck their blood and regain some health. Rebel Wolves says this is useful in battle but even more effective outside of combat. Rebel Wolves also uses this encounter to show off the options to switch between a far and close camera in combat (and a separate option to customize this viewpoint in exploration, too).&nbsp;</p><p>We eventually reach the crypt, and this portion of the demo ends.&nbsp;</p>

</article>
<p>In the daytime version of the quest, Coen is unable to tap into his vampiric abilities, so he must investigate things more closely. To keep it somewhat spoiler-free, instead of climbing walls and ceilings and Shadowstepping to different platforms, Coen speaks with a local monk and agrees to help them find a missing person. This leads him to an abandoned portion of an asylum, and it turns out the person he's after has become The Almshouse Monstrosity. This person is neither undead nor alive, stuck in the transition from human to vampire, and their mind is essentially gone, driven by an instinctual desire for blood.&nbsp;</p><p>In this form of combat, Coen uses a sword instead of claws, and it's here that the game looks most like The Witcher. However, Rebel Wolves is doing some interesting things here. Combat features directional blocking, like what's seen in the Kingdom Come: Deliverance series, and magic, too. After defeating this monstrosity, Coen uses the Compel Soul hex to speak with a corpse and learn what happened in this asylum. This corpse yields some useful information that eventually takes Coen to the same crypt from the conclusion of the nighttime demo, except this time, Rebel Wolves showcases what happens next. I won't spoil it here, but it's an awesome boss fight against an undead warrior, and it's clear you'll need to tap into all of Coen's abilities to come out victorious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our demo ended here, and a day later, I'm voracious for more. It just looks awesome, and a great score heightens the entire experience. Like The Witcher, the score in Dawnwalker relies heavily on a high-pitched female chorus, and it rules. I can't wait to hear more of this and see more of the vampires that run this part of the world when The Blood of the Dawnwalker launches sometime next year.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/21/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-more-than-the-witcher-with-vampires]]></content:encoded>

			<p>After six years of waiting, Hollow Knight developer <a href="http://After%20six%20years%20of%20waiting,%20Hollow%20Knight%20developer%20Team%20Cherry%20has%20announced%20a%20release%20date%20for%20Hollow%20Knight%20Silksong%20during%20Gamescom%202025.%20The%20highly%20anticipated%20metroidvania%20will%20launch%20on%20PC,%20PS5,%20PS4,%20Xbox%20One,%20Xbox%20Series%20X/S,%20Nintendo%20Switch,%20and%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20on%20September%204,%202025.https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">Team Cherry</a> has announced a release date for Hollow Knight Silksong during Gamescom 2025. The highly anticipated metroidvania will launch on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>The waiting is almost over, but almost more importantly, the anticipation and disappointment at every major videogame related event that has taken place in the last six years is actually over, and we can now sit back and relax without having to wonder if Hollow Knight Silksong will appear at The Game Awards this year, or at Summer Game Fest next year, and so on.</p>



<p>The special announcement hosted by Team Cherry today was watched live by more than a quarter of a million people, which further shows how excited fans of the first game are to see something new from Team Cherry.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the announcement didn't disappoint, with even more gameplay showing off the wide variety of bosses, enemies, and new areas you'll be able to explore in this hand-painted adventure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Every version of the PlayStation 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">is now $50 more expensive</a> in the U.S., but at least for now, a new deal at GameStop will cover the difference. The meme stock retailer announced it will start giving anyone who trades in their last-gen consoles an extra $50 in-store credit toward the purchase of a new PS5.</p> <p>This deal applies to anyone trading in an old PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch. If you really want a PS5, it’s better than nothing. The all-digital edition, the cheapest Sony offers, is now $500 starting August 21. So instead of just getting $55 toward that from trading in a PS4, you’ll get $110. An Xbox One currently trades for about $45, so just $95 total. The Switch isn’t much better. You’ll only get $60 for it before the new bonus credit, even though Nintendo recently raised the price of a new one to $340.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Offer valid through 8.23.25” is in such small print at the bottom lol</p> <p>GameStop only has your back for a few days 💀</p> <p>— Carlton (@carlton_ec08) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlton_ec08/status/1958345035302240471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Xbox Series X/S owners looking to move over to PlayStation will have it a little easier. A Series S, now sold new at $370, will still get you up to $176, while a Series X, sold for $600, will get you up to $300. I could see taking that. When it comes to the other consoles, the price difference is harder to swallow. GameStop also buries in the fine print that this <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">bonus Trump tariff credit</a> will only be active through August 23.</p> <p>Is it better than nothing? Sure! But it still lowkey sucks in the worst way. This whole thing is basically GameStop saying, “Reckless trade policy has hiked the price of a PS5, so here’s a bonus credit for these already terrible trade-in values that you’ll have to give right back to us.” GameStop’s edgelord CEO Ryan Cohen, despite being Canadian, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1908538518919323827">a big booster</a> of Trump, even as the president rolled out the current tariff regime earlier this year. His Elon Musk-lite impression included using the sale of GameStop’s Canadian operation <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/gamestop-selling-canadian-french-operations-stores-ryan-cohen-wokeness-dei/">to dunk on DEI policies</a>. He’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">using GameStop to buy billions in Bitcoin</a>.</p>

You'll need to utilise your own Mega Pokémon to take them down, and you can also bring in help from one of your allies to battle alongside you.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overall, Legends: Z-A didn’t feel like a full action game to me," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions">first hands-on impressions of Pokémon Legends Z-A's battle systems</a>, "but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but I do hope Legends: Z-A gets challenging enough to make me more intentionally dish out commands and think about switching Pokémon at just the right moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans believe they've worked out the setting of Forza Horizon 6, based on a teasing social media post from a car import company connected to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a now-deleted Instagram post, vehicle import firm Cult and Classic shared an image purporting to show a Forza Horizon staff member digitally scanning a car made by Japanese manufacturer Kei for use in the series' next game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post went on to state that the staff member had travelled to its premises in Australia to scan a series of Kei models, which are unusual to find outside of Japan. And it's because of this (as well as the post's subsequent removal) that fans now believe Japan is Forza Horizon 6's setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exciting news!" the post read. "We have Cody here, from @forzahorizonofficial, shooting cars for the next installation in the series. As there are no late-model Kei cars in America, he has flown out from the states to use our cars as the basis for their digital versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are HUGE gamers here at Cult and Classic, and it is an honor to be supporting Forza and making Kei cards accessible virtually for people who can't have them IRL."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Knoebel goes GamesCom (@Knoebelbroet) <a href="https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1958294206205858164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Japan has ranked highly among the most-requested locations for Forza Horizon 6, following previous series entries set in Australia, Mexico and the UK. Xbox boss Phil Spencer recently confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">the next Forza game would arrive in 2026</a>, and this is widely expected to be a new Forza Horizon game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the original Forza Motorsport series, Microsoft's most recent round of staff cuts in July heavily impacted developer Turn 10 Studios, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-team-is-no-more-former-developer-claims-with-remaining-turn-10-staff-left-to-support-the-horizon-side">one former employee stating that the Forza Motorsport team was "no more"</a>, though some staff remain to assist on Forza Horizon development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
