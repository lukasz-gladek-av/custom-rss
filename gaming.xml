			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levine-judas-ghost-story-games-art-no-release-date-update/">Three months after its first developer blog</a>, Ghost Story Games and Ken Levine are back to remind everyone that Judas is still around, that the studio is still working on it, and that it is still planning to be released, eventually. On that last point, no, the blog does not include a release date or an indication as to when it'll be out. In fairness, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">a trailer at The Game Awards</a> could give players all the answers they want that are not included in this blog, but we could also just as easily go another year wondering how the spiritual successor to BioShock is coming along.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-2">As far as what the blog does include,</a> we get a new piece of concept art of the game's titular character, Judas. We also hear from several members of the development team, instead of just hearing from Ken Levine, with lead narrative designer Drew Mitchell, lead artist Karen Segars, and studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff all contributing comments on the creative process behind Judas, and more specifically, the development of its main character.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>The project began with us wanting to tell stories that are less linear, that react to the player and unfold in ways that no one’s ever seen in one of Ken’s games</em>," said Mitchell. "<em>That told us a lot up front about what we’d need: namely, characters with strong, competing objectives, who each had a stake in everything the player did. Starting with that framework, we spent a lot of time thinking about those characters, their conflicts, the right setting to force them all together, and the systems underpinning it all. For a long time, there wasn’t even a set protagonist — just sort of a cipher, a blank slate.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Eventually, the story and world started to coalesce into something specific, and we needed to figure out who the player character should be. As a rule, you want to put your heroes in the last place they ever want to find themselves. So, what kind of person would really struggle to deal with all these relationships and warring interests? And I remember that was the point where Ken came up with this monologue that kicked everything off.</em>"</p>



<p>Studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff also added comments on how the game's setting evolved in its creation, and how it grew from a more practical location to what it is now. "<em></em><em>At the beginning of its journey, it was a more practical, conventional, modular starship. But over the course of its mission, due to conflict between factions of people and ideals, it's changed into what you see now. And we're working on communicating this through the environment.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Like with any city with significant history, if you start digging up the street, you would find layers of the city's past.  Older eras of street long buried, forgotten, and built over by the roads upon which you now walk.  With the Mayflower as a generational starship, we want to imbue this world with the same sense of time, history, and credibility; this is a civilization that went through eras of conflict and rebirth. And having the characters and the architecture of the world reflect those layers of the onion is a powerful mechanism for visual storytelling. This allows players to act as a sort of historian and architect as they explore the Mayflower. Through uncovering more, you’ll make increasingly informed decisions with the story and characters on your journey.</em>"</p>



<p>All of this is, ultimately, wonderful insight to how Judas has been created in the years since development began, and it's good to see Ghost Story Games communicating to players with a little more frequency than we've seen previously.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this continues, and we'll get an even better look into the game and perhaps even some gameplay soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After a week of viral clips and outrage from anime fans and AI-haters alike, Amazon has taken down the AI-generated English dub for </span><i><span>Banana Fish</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The embarrassingly bad dub of the action-packed yaoi was a first for Amazon and was labeled as an “AI Beta” in the series’ language options. Instead of hiring voice actors with all of Jeff Bezos’ fuck you money, Amazon uploaded an AI voice track that is monotone, weirdly mixed, and makes even the most exciting scenes sound like a boring text-to-speech demonstration. Anime is known for its dynamic voice performances, and this shit sounds like it barely gets above a whisper. Here’s a clip, and sorry for putting it somewhere you can hear it:</span></p> <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@animedomainx/video/7577995965458648328" data-video-id="7577995965458648328" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@animedomainx" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@animedomainx?refer=embed">@animedomainx</a>  <p>This is Back ngl 🥀 Amazon has started using Al to dub shows, and the first anime to receive an English Al dub is Banana Fish. Many voice actors are speaking out against Amazon’s decision, criticizing the use of Al and the fact that human voice actors were not compensated. Banana Fish is an action-packed crime thriller that follows a young, intelligent gang leader named Ash Lynx as he investigates a mysterious d_rug called “Banana Fish” while trying to protect a pure-hearted Japanese boy, Eiji Okumura, in the dangerous underworld of 1980s New York City Follow For Daily Anime News <a title="bananafish" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bananafish?refer=embed">#BananaFish</a></p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Anime DomainX | Anime News" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7577996058077301511?refer=embed">♬ original sound – Anime DomainX | Anime News</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>  <p><span>After days of ridicule, Amazon has </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-shows/after-widespread-criticism-for-the-use-of-ai-voice-actors-amazon-removes-ai-dub-from-anime-series-banana-fish/"><span>removed the fake English dub</span></a><span> from its streaming services. Bullying works. Hire actors. Bezos has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/"><span>billions of dollars</span></a><span>, and you’re telling me that man can’t afford to put someone in a booth?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As of this writing, the Spanish AI-generated dub is still available, but we’ll see if that lasts. The next question is, will Amazon continue to roll back this decision by releasing a proper English dub with real actors? God knows the company has the money to do it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Anime isn’t the only industry that has started relying on generative AI to add voices to creative works. Video games like </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>have AI-generated voices, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-gen-ai-arc-raiders-brendan-green-2000644914"><span>rich people are lining up to tell you</span></a><span> that replacing real voice actors with soulless droning machines is good, actually. A lot of AI apologia relies on the false notion that AI-generated content is good enough to replace human-made work, and if this is the best it has to offer, everyone will continue to rally against it.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eidos-Montreal, the studio known for developing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and supporting games like Tomb Raider and others, has had more layoffs.</p>



<p>Over the last week, a number of now former employees took to LinkedIn to announce that they were no longer with the company.</p>







<p><strong>“Hey there!”</strong> gameplay director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7398821593012989953/?originTrackingId=HOT3SE08iXRoDN1N9LEmuQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Daher wrote</a>. <strong>“Was working at Eidos, loved it and would have stayed, but times are difficult.”</strong></p>



<p>In total, at least a dozen or more people are now looking for work. This is the second known wave of job cuts at the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after 75 people were let go</a> back in March. At the time, it was said that the layoffs were done due to “mandates coming to an end”.</p>



<p>And while one would hope that the latest layoffs are the end, that doesn’t appear to be the case. In recent days, multiple sources have explained to Insider Gaming most projects at the studio have been cancelled. The focus for Eidos-Montreal right now, they say, is on the work it’s doing with Microsoft and Xbox on games like Grounded 2 and Fable. There’s also another internal project that started development in 2019 which, sources say, has no way of recouping its current costs. </p>



<p>After those projects wrap, however, <strong>“additional staff reductions are already forecasted.”</strong></p>







<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to both Eidos-Montreal and its parent company Embracer for comment. As of writing, no responses have been received. In the past, Embracer has often declined to give an official comment on subjects such as layoffs and internal development projects. </p>

Tribute Games, Marvel Cosmic Invasion sees Earth’s Mightiest Mortals team up to take on Annihilus and his Annihilation Wave. Designed to look like an old-school SNES action game with its pixel-art graphics, the game features a roster of 15 heroes. The lineup includes popular characters like Captain America, Storm, and Spider-Man, alongside more obscure heroes like Beta Ray Bill and Quasar, all rendered in a style that evokes classic ’90s video games.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 Buying Guide - Amiibo Restock, Deals On Switch 2 Gear, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upgrade-nintendo-switch-2-storage-with-steeply-discounted-samsung-512gb-microsd-express/1100-6530578/">Last Chance To Get Cyber Monday Deals On MicroSD Express Cards For Switch 2</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controllers-on-sale-for-black-friday/1100-6536412/">DualSense Limited Edition PS5 Controllers On Sale For Black Friday</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-black-friday-game-deals-available-now/1100-6535728/">Check Out Over 200 Nintendo Switch Game Deals For Black Friday</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-switch-exclusive-game-deals/1100-6536453/">Eight Nintendo Switch Exclusives Are 50% Off In Walmart's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-ps5-pro-deal-in-six-months-is-up-for-grabs-for-a-limited-time/1100-6526406/">The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-slim-bundles-and-collectors-edition-get-huge-discounts/1100-6534326/">Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/">Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>A new leak on social media for Fortnite hints at a huge collaboration with South Park. The event, if true, would have several big elements like a Rift Anomaly and multiple mech skins.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 of Fortnite has been off to a great start for fans. Not only did players get&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kill Bill collaboration</a>, but skins for Back to the Future and a new map. With the live-service title collabing with basically every IP out there, there’s one vulgar one that would feel right at home: South Park. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumors of a collab</a> have been here and there, but one reliable Twitter user dropped a huge leak as to what South Park will be like in Fortnite.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SOUTH PARK x FORTNITE IS A BIG COLLAB</p><p>• MULTIPLE SKINS AS MECHS<br>• Rift Anomaly: "Everyone Kills Kenny"  <br>• At least 1 Boss on the map<br>• Stick of Truth Mythic<br>• Respawn Token/Medallion<br>• Unknown Consumable<br>&amp; more.. <a href="https://t.co/veNGth1U9k">pic.twitter.com/veNGth1U9k</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, a well-known leaker in the Fortnite community. They’ve gotten many details from past seasons correct and are generally accurate. This time, the leak pertains to South Park, as it is seemingly making its way into Fortnite. While no date was given as to when, information regarding the collab has dropped.</p>



<p>As it seems, the Fortnite x South Park collab will feature skins for the mechs and a few collectibles. However, the biggest ones are that a Boss will spawn on the map relating to the adult-animated series. Furthermore, a Rift Anomaly, aptly titled “Everyone Kills Kenny,” will be part of it, though no details on how it will play out were stated.</p>



<p>Given the recent popularity of South Park, it’s no surprise to see it collaborate with Fortnite. It wouldn’t be South Park’s first foray into gaming, as the show has garnered two RPGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-park-snow-day-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other tie-in games</a>. In fact, South Park: The Stick of Truth was a hit with critics and fans, being a near-ideal translation from its TV counterpart. While Fortnite’s version may be toned down for the player base, it’s sure to hit the same marks it did in 1997.</p>

<p>This new patch brings all of the tweaks and additions made to other versions of the game (which we reckon is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">really very good</a>, actually) to Switch 1 and 2, so there's total parity across all versions.</p>
<p>That means the Switch releases have received the CPU Ranked Match mode, the new "Advance Win" feature — which allows you to call time on matches with huge leads (as well as some anti-cheat measures for online) — and a bunch of other tweaks and fixes to boot.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wphruq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The game's executive producer (and Level-5 CEO, lest we forget), Akihiro Hino, dropped the full deets <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1995815684304150948?s=20">on social media</a>, although we are still awaiting some more detailed patch notes. Here's the tweet, plus the machine translation below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest version of Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Victory Road has been updated. The versions are 1.4.0 and 1.4.1. Distribution will begin on each platform at various times. It will be after 9 PM for all platforms. The time may be subject to change.<br>
・Advance Win, Advance Time<br>
・First-time route unlock battle: Kizuna Star x5<br>
・AI ranked match<br>
And so on, including bug fixes, many new features will be implemented across platforms including Switch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this latest update, alongside 1.3's added ranked level cap and bug fixes, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is certainly in good shape, and looking and playing every bit the soccer star that it is!</p>
<p>The game launched back in the middle of November, and Ethan called it "the franchise’s most premium experience yet" in our recent review:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ghost Story Games, the studio founded by BioShock creator Ken Levine, has released a new short teaser for its upcoming FPS Judas. This little teaser shows different environments of The Mayflower, the colony ship that Judas, the main character, lives on. The Mayflower is an environment filled with decades of changes, which Judas has to navigate along with the different relationships which she finds difficult to do.</p>
<p><iframe title="Judas Environment Themes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O-29-fOEE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the new Judas dev log, the team said, <em>“We put her in a science fiction world, a colony ship filled with robots — a futuristic setting that makes someone like her extremely powerful. But it’s also a world where personal success hinges on how well you can conform to the rules, because dissent would lead to the failure of the mission. That makes her an outlaw, a pariah — a Judas. That tension at the heart of the character came to inform everything about the game, which we stopped thinking of as an FPS and started calling a “Judas Simulator.” Everything comes back to that core idea of you interacting with the world as Judas.”</em></p>
<p>The Mayflower is split into different sections from VIP Pilgrim Quarters, Regular Pilgrim Dorms, and Violator Quarters with each having its own distinct style. These styles show the divides within a society where the citizens have devolved into a bitter battle of constantly spying on one another and dobbing one another in for even the slightest offences. It’s machines, not people who are in control of business, art, government, and they’re trying to turn the humans into robotic model citizens.</p>

<p>Judas does not have a release date yet, but it is expected for PC, Xbox Series XS, and PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> season five’s finale episode, which is also the series finale, will go live on Netflix on New Year’s Eve. To celebrate that, Lego and Netflix have teamed up with the series creators to create a $300 set that I’m not sure really hits the mark. And I’m a big <em>Stranger Things</em> fan and Lego sicko.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-creel-house-lego-set">Lego and Netflix revealed a new elaborate <em>Stranger Things</em>-themed set</a> that is based on the <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Creel_House">Creel House first seen in season four</a>. This is the place where a young Henry Creel lived and where some horrific shit went down. It also ended up being the home base for season four’s big bad monster man, Vecna. And while that does mean the Creel House is a very important piece of Stranger Things lore, I’m not excited to spend $300 on what mostly looks like a Lego haunted house set.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/stranger-things-the-creel-house-11370">The Creel House Lego set contains 2,593 pieces and 13 minifigs</a>: Eleven, Will, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Steve, Nancy, Robin, Jonathan, Max, Holly, Mr. Whatsit, and Vecna himself. It also includes two vehicle builds. As you might expect, it contains a lot of Easter eggs referencing moments from every season of the popular Netflix series. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit about this set is that it can be split in a way that reveals the “interdimensional horror” below, with Lego and Netflix calling it the “first-ever transforming LEGO house.”</p>

 <p>“We grew up obsessed with the LEGO brand, so seeing <i>Stranger Things</i> rebuilt in bricks is honestly surreal,” explained <em>Stranger Things</em> creators Ross and Matt Duffer. “With the show heading into its final chapter — and hitting the 10-year mark — bringing the Creel House to life this way feels like the perfect celebration of the world and the fans who made all of this possible.”</p>

 <p>Personally, I’d have been much more interested in a Lego diorama recreating Hawkins or a few smaller sets depicting iconic locations and moments from the show that connect into a nice display piece. Something that feels instantly recognizable as <em>Stranger Things.</em> But at least for $300, the house looks detailed, splits apart, and contains a ton of figs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658">I’ll be spending dumb amounts of money on a different big Lego set based on a popular show soon, so I’ll be passing on this house set</a>.</p> <p>The Creel House set will be available to buy on New Year’s Day, about 24 hours after the finale airs. Makes me wonder if there are some interesting spoilers hidden in the set. <em>Stranger Things</em> <em>Vol. 1</em> is out now on Netflix. <em>Vol 2.</em> arrives on December 25. And the finale airs on New Year’s Eve.</p>

      <p>Anime fans rarely unilaterally agree on anything. However, fans on Twitter were all outraged by the unveiling of the atrocious Prime Video's AI Beta. The product is a mess of generative AI that dubs anime with the stunted cadence of a run-of-the-mill text-to-speech program, and is somehow a product from a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAU87ypjydpiKl3SoY-9JU2L1BHhtZYNziutw31b28xk0rcQNgJyP2mHZvKTBKTnnLGmYx3DTUnF17fKuth6R9etLdLC4QOgg36WDoVk2w1P-BwZ2QmywyZaI41GZ-963LLq7YAL0_AnqTrNeXYlyVZUUlWmR3vhSA5k2Z0Wfcw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>$2.5 trillion company</u></a>.</p><p>Over Thanksgiving weekend, anime fans noticed that Prime Video quietly released new language tracks for <em>Banana Fish</em> and <em>No Game No Life</em>—two years-old anime that might not be uber popular in mainstream circles but are fondly remembered as formative series. <em>Banana Fish</em> in particular is known among fans for its explicit queer themes, having been based on a landmark shojo manga that deeply influenced how homosexuality is depicted in the genre. Getting an English dub for such a series <em>should</em> be like getting an early Christmas present. But that joy was misplaced: both shows were given an <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-anime-ai-dub-banana-fish-no-game-no-life-2000693962?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI Beta English dub track</u></a> that sucked worse than the <a href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1994583024802189814?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>most archaic dubs vs. subs detractor</u></a> could ever imagine.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon's AI English Dub for Banana Fish is hilariously bad at times.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BANANAFISH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#BANANAFISH</a> <a href="https://t.co/CtiE47W4yh?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/CtiE47W4yh</a></p>— Otaku Spirit (@OtakuSpirited) <a href="https://twitter.com/OtakuSpirited/status/1994598770202611749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote>

Their solution was the same as the refrain of every tech company nowadays: AI. Or, more specifically, "AI-aided dubbing on licensed movies and series that would not have been dubbed otherwise." The program was released on March 5 in English and Latin American Spanish for 12 licensed movies and series, including foreign works such as José Pozo's 2003 animated film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cid:_The_Legend?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>El Cid: La Leyenda</u></em></a>, Martín Musarra's 2016 drama <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6264558/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Mi Mamá Lora</u></em></a>, and Erik Bloomquist's mystery film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7282278/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Long Lost</u></em></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>By the way, <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@amazon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@PrimeVideo</a> pay MAYBE $125-$150 / hour to English voice actors, even through SAG-AFTRA Union rates.

</figure><p>As a way to combat this distressing trend, anime fans warned those among us prone to hate watching not even to give Prime Video the satisfaction of an uptick in viewers and instead post that they <a href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1994561238551204005?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>wouldn't be renewing their paid Prime memberships</u></a>.

</figure><p>To illustrate how much of a non-issue an official production of an English dub for <em>Banana Fish</em>—something not uncommon with anime, especially if they're newly licensed on a new streaming platform—would've run Prime Video roughly $125-$150 an hour per session, even through SAG-AFTRA Union rates. Basically, this is peanuts compared to what the show has already burned through on content mill-brained titles like <a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games/"><em><u>Beast Games</u></em></a>. But, like everything fueling the AI bubble, companies still compete to out unga bunga each other to make even better ways to boil the ocean to make shit no one wants. Prime Video didn't even opt for the tried and true method of asking for forgiveness instead of permission; Instead, they are apparently playing this nine-month initiative as an oopsie that it hopes will blow over while people flock to Cyber Monday deals. Time will tell if that cowardly gambit pays off, but history shows it has worked for other streamers, and we shouldn't let it continue.</p><p>Back in 2023, Netflix caught ire for listing AI as a creator in the credits for its WIT Studio anime, <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-ai-anime-wit-studio-dog-and-boy-spy-family-1850062043?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dog and Boy</u></em></a>. In a post from Netflix Japan (which Vice translated), the account characterized the whole deal as "As an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts!” As <em>Kotaku</em> noted, a human creative likely had to handhold the AI to spit out whatever that film, which'll return to obscurity once you've finished this sentence.

</figure><p>All this to say, we can't just let companies like Prime Video get away with the wanton use of AI, only to sweep it under the rug, like pretending a mosquito bite never happened if you ignore the itch long enough. The only way these perpetual AI rake steps can have their legs cut out from under them is if fans show they care by being loud every time that artless slop rears its head. Let them sit in agony for their self-inflicted wound. Bullying works, folks.

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Red Dead Redemption: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - The Update That This Epic Deserved]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>1370902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>The first time I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> was, of course, the day it launched. 2010 really doesn't seem all that long ago at all, but there was a level of expectation and excitement to those opening moments in Rockstar's utterly wild West that I <em>do</em> feel I haven't experienced in a very long time indeed.</p>
<p>It was an excitement that had me on my phone to an equally exuberant friend (we'd been to buy our copies together earlier that day, like something out of a Dickens novel), as we both gawped in amazement at this incredible recreation of a lost world. Do games still drop jaws in the same way that a big Rockstar joint used to back in the day?</p>
<p>As the camera settled on John Marston aboard the game's opening train ride, as we started to get a gauge on just how no-holds-barred and authentic this particular cowboy adventure was gonna be, there was an air of something special, of a game that might just be everything we'd wanted and more besides. And it was!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/red-dead-redemption">I reviewed Red Dead Redemption on Switch</a> for its 2023 release, so check that out for a full run-through of the finer details of the game itself. However, I <em>'only'</em> gave it an 8/10, which may seem odd given all the gilding of its lily I've just done above this very paragraph. But a lack of multiplayer, alongside a lack of polish overall, meant it had to go down as a barebones port. Still amazing in its narrative and gameplay, but in need of TLC. It was eminently playable, and already looked nice, though, so you were in safe (if unspectacular) hands on Switch.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:154041 @ 1764712836 -->
<p>This Switch 2 update, on paper, gives us the basics and no more, too. Oh, you've given it more resolution, have you? Increased the frame rate? Well done. But wait. We've now got mouse controls for fine-aiming, and they feel really good. Also, and as expected as resolution or frame rate increases are nowadays, my goodness, it really does look and feel very nice indeed. Have I ever played this game at 60fps before? I'm beginning to wonder, because I'm sure it's never played this nicely.</p>
<p>Remember the journey into Mexico, that magical bit with the music, the showstopping part? It's all the more magical when you can see the very dust in the air, the shimmering heat haze in the distance now as clear as day thanks to pristine visuals. HDR is really helping to make things pop in comparison to the older port, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Yes, there's still no multiplayer, but it now feels as though the game is being presented on a Nintendo console in a manner befitting such an epic slice of gaming history. With slick controls, DLSS, HDR, volumetric effects, options to personalise mouse mode, 60fps that felt flawless, and a resolution bump that's got it looking super sharp, this is a gem that <em>still</em> feels modern, immediate, and relentlessly replayable on Switch 2. Now that's rootin' tootin', partners!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1370899</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Santa Ragione's horror game, Horses, <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/">getting banned on Steam with only vague reasons to back up its ban</a> was an additional tally on the year for Valve getting mixed up in controversy <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">regarding what it allows and what it doesn't allow on Steam</a>. Epic Games Store, seemingly, felt out of the loop, so it decided to join the fray by also disallowing Horses to release on its digital storefront, even though it was previously slated to arrive alongside launches at <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?hmb_source=search_bar">Humble</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> today, December 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The difference, however, is typical of the difference between Epic Games Store and Steam. Whatever Steam does, the Epic Games Store does worse. When Steam banned Horses, it did so based on an early, unfinished version of the game, and kept its exact reasoning and policies around why it was banned vague enough, preventing Santa Ragione from refuting direct issues Valve seemingly had with the game.</p>



<p>Epic Games, however, banned Horses approximately 24 hours before it was set to launch on the EGS. Per <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17">Santa Ragione's website for Horses</a>, Epic told the Italian indie developer that it is "<em>Unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies.</em>"</p>







<p>The email continued, "<em></em><em>The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which 'contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.' The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.</em> <em>This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology).</em>"</p>



<p>But prior to this email, Horses was set to be available on the EGS and had been approved for release on the store. So what changed? That's the million-dollar question, it would seem, especially because elements that Epic is claiming are in the game simply aren't there, according to Santa Ragione.</p>



<p>"<em>The game does NOT contain explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior," </em>the studio claims in a statement<em>. "All nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation. There is never any visible sexual act involving genitalia and all animations are stylized and unrealistic. Additionally, in the three hours of gameplay contained in the game, there are only four brief and censored sexual sequences, with two of them happening mainly off camera</em>...<em>the content presented does not in any way promote abuse (including animal abuse). The game is a strong critique of violence and abuse in general.</em>"</p>



<p>Santa Ragione also pointed out that when it filled out the IARC Questionnaire as part of the process to get approved for release on the EGS in the first place, it received a PEGI 18 and M for Mature rating, not an AO rating.</p>



<p>Even with these reminders, and Santa Ragione begging its contact at Epic Games Store to consider the fact that builds of this game had been approved multiple times, with a final achievement build getting approved well over two weeks ahead of launch. Santa Ragione received no reply from its contact, instead getting an automated message that its appeal had been denied. Epic also failed to point to a specific instance of content within Horses it took issue with, so even if Santa Ragione wanted to make changes to release on EGS, it doesn't know where Epic believes the problem lies.</p>



<p>The whole way this story has evolved is extremely unfortunate, because here is an indie developer whose work revolves around trying to elevate the kinds of stories we can tell in video games, the subject matter tackled, and how more serious issues are tackled, that will likely now be shuttered because it won't be able to recoup development costs for its latest, and now potentially last, release. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, earlier this year, Steam allowed a game <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">that directly promoted sexual abuse to appear on its store, and had to be told to remove it</a>, only doing so in select regions. It was the developers themselves who eventually took it down entirely.</p>



<p>One of these games is a commentary and critique on abuse, the other contained explicit abuse and sexual violence for entertainment. It's frankly disturbing that the latter was able to make it onto Steam, while the former isn't given a place on the store at all.</p>

                <p>Veteran games executive and former Nexon CEO, Owen Mahoney, believes the video game industry is on the cusp of a massive transformation--and that AI is at the center of it. He argues that AI is already integrated into many aspects of game development, from asset production to testing tools, and that its impact will only intensify.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-man-who-signed-arc-raiders-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Mahoney explains that the AAA sector is facing what he bluntly calls an "end-of-days" moment. Costs are skyrocketing, development cycles are slowing, and publishers are becoming increasingly risk-averse, adding that the industry often misunderstands where value truly comes from.</p><p>Responding to examples of failed studios with prestigious founders, Mahoney says, "The examples that you just gave were, 'We bought this company because five years ago they made some game. So, therefore they're good.' It doesn’t work that way at all," and insists that the "game companies are really just collections of people." He believes that success depends on understanding their motivation and creative drive, not past hits.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_KdS6TNHL8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W_KdS6TNHL8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mahoney contrasts Embark's success with the broader structural problems holding AAA development back. He describes the impossible situation faced by public-company CEOs.</p><p>"You're running a $23 billion company. And you have to make a decision, in a very short period of time, to greenlight a project ... if that new project doesn't do well, you're going to be explaining to your board why you burnt $300 million in company cash," he said.</p><p>He continues that one failure is survivable, but "if you do it again, they're going to be calling openly for your head, and by the third time you'll have an activist investor." Mahoney thinks this kind of pressure makes executives fund only familiar ideas, worsening the cycle. "The AAA industry is structurally at its end," he adds.</p><p>Despite this bleak diagnosis, Mahoney is optimistic about what AI could unlock. He acknowledges that AI has "an unbelievable ability to create a lot of slop, but so does Photoshop." He even argues that audiences will continue "rejecting slop and bad product and only demanding good product."</p><p>More importantly, he sees AI as a force that will empower smaller teams, shorten development timelines, and introduce entirely new forms of play, just as the internet once did. "I continue to believe that the industry will probably triple in the next five to seven years. Just like every major wave [of technology] has had a major positive impact on the video games industry. The nature of the medium itself is changing, and that’s very, very good for us."</p>

		<p>Styx: Blades of Greed is going to be released on February 19th 2026, Nacon has confirmed with the game coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. Nacon and Cyanide Studio were originally aiming for a 2025 release date, but the development team needs a few more months to polish the Styx: Blades of Greed experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pou-Wox_h1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the fourth game Styx has appeared in, making his debut in Of Orcs and Men which has led to a now trilogy of games starring the goblin assassin. In this new adventure, Styx is after the new mystical powers provided by quartz, which give him abilities like mind control. These abilities will be used alongside Styx’s shadowy skills and various gadgets to help in his mission to get the quartz.</p>

<p>In our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed, Stefan said, <em>“It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</em></p>

            <guid>1370845</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Postmark Games has launched a new Kickstarter campaign. The small indie studio, known for small print-at-home tabletop games, has launched the campaign for <em>52 Duels</em>, a card combat game that uses a standard deck of playing cards.</p>

<h2>The <em>52 Duels</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postmarkgames/52-duels-a-fight-with-playing-cards-for-1-or-2-players/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>52 Duels</em> is a two-player competitive dueling game. Each player picks one of several heroes. From there, you take turns launching attacks, blocking damage, using items, and levelling up your hero's unique skills. If you can bring your opponent's deck down to nothing, you win.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/52-duels-hero-sheet-screenshot.jpg?itok=7Axn-UD6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/52-duels-hero-sheet-screenshot.jpg?itok=WlO1hEd4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the campaign states, 52 Duels aims to offer a card game ebb and flow similar to high-profile TCGs in the industry like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-unlimited-review-trading-card-gamings-new-hope" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em></a>, but with less of a financial and mental investment. The game's rules are tracked on a single sheet of paper. No cutting or assembly required. And all you need to play are two standard 52-card poker decks.</p>

<p>This economical approach is consistent with Postmark Games' body of work. <em>52 Duels</em> is clearly connected to their last project, <em>52 Realms</em>, which brings the thrill of an OSR-esque dungeon crawl with just a deck of cards, as well as printable microgames like <em>Aquamarine</em>, <em>Voyages</em>, and <em>Waypoints</em>.</p>

<p>There is only one pledge level available for the <em>52 Duels</em> Kickstarter. For just $7, you get PDFs and PNGs of the game's rules and four playable heroes, in both color and low-ink versions, in A4 and Letter formats. In addition, the game will receive long-term support from the developers, including new playable heroes, which will be added to your pledge at no additional cost.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>52 Duels</em> Kickstarter campaign has been a great success. It has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$5,916, which is more than four times its initial funding goal of $1,321. The campaign ends on December 14.</span></span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-agrees-to-pause-light-of-motiram-promotion-while-horizon-clone-lawsuit-continues/</link>
            <guid>1370842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tencent and Sony have agreed to a later hearing date for the Horizon clone lawsuit if Light of Motiram pauses its promotion and public testing. </p>



<p>Sony has been fighting Tencent in court for allegedly ripping off elements from PlayStation’s Horizon series for their upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Tencent has filed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a> this case, whereas Sony has filed for an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizons-aloy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">injunction</a>. Both entities have now agreed on delaying these hearings, however, with some conditions. </p>











<p>According to a new order filed yesterday by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, there are some new developments in Sony and Tencent’s Horizon clone lawsuit. It seems that both entities have &nbsp;“engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute.” These discussions have led to Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent Entities agreeing to extend the briefing schedule and to a later requested hearing date; however, these come with some conditions. </p>



<p>Sony and Tencent have agreed on four conditions to extend the hearing: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, the extension “will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction.” </li>



<li>Secondly, there can be “no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.” </li>



<li>Thirdly, the release date of Light of Motiram cannot be “moved up to before Q4 2027.”</li>



<li>Lastly, Tencent Entities “will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.”</li>
</ul>







<p>Due to the new extension, Tencent’s deadline to file its response to Sony’s preliminary injunction is now December 17, 2025, instead of December 3. Sony must file its Reply in Support by January 2, 2026. Both entities will also request that Judge Jacqueline Corley hear the injunction and the motion to dismiss simultaneously on January 29, 2026, rather than on January 15. </p>



<p>In other news, Tencent’s last response to the lawsuit was “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fame does not create a trademark</a>.” What are your thoughts on Tencent pausing Light of Motiram’s promotion?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, we reported that disturbing horror game Horses had been banned from Steam, with developer Santa Ragione claiming that Valve refused to provide a clear reason for the ban or discuss it further with the studio. Now, at the last possible minute before the game was set to release widely across other PC store fronts, Epic Games Store has also banned Horses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news was shared with us by Santa Ragione, who passed on a press release stating that Epic informed them 24 hours before the game's release that it would not be distributing Horses, despite the studio's build being approved for release weeks earlier. Per the developer, no specifics on what content was at issue were provided, "only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines." The studio has shared the text of the email sent to them from Epic banning the game, which an Epic Games Store representative has confirmed is accurate. It is as follows:</p><blockquote>We are unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies. The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which “contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.” The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology). You have some options on how to move forward: 1. You can make updates to your product to ensure compliance and resubmit it for review. 2.

Notably, the studio has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6zktxf4q222" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated on social media</a> that its own IARC Questionnaire submission came back with an "M" for "Mature" rating rather than "AO". It is unclear what caused the discrepancy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Santa Ragione explains the situation:</p><blockquote>Epic's decision comes after the overwhelming support Santa Ragione received last week upon the disclosure of Steam's ban, including the public announcement by Epic's and Steam's competitor GOG that they would promote and support the game. We do not know what triggered Epic's sudden decision. Following the announcement of Steam's ban, Horses became highly visible online, with strong support and a small but vocal opposition. It is difficult not to wonder whether this visibility played a greater role in Epic's choice than any newly discovered issue with the game itself.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN asked Epic Games for comment, and received the following statement from an Epic Games spokesperson: "We set clear <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidelines</a> for the content that can be distributed on the Epic Games Store and found violations of those guidelines during our extensive review."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article's publication, Horses is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still listed as "Coming Soon"</a> on the Epic Games Store.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses was previously revealed several years ago, and has made appearances in showcases like The Indie Horror Showcase and Day of the Devs. It's gained some attention for its deeply unsettling premise: a young man travels to a remote horse farm to work for several weeks over the summer, only to find the farmer's "horses" are actually enslaved, naked humans with horse masks affixed to their heads. Horses, says Santa Ragione, is meant to be upsetting: it's at least partly a commentary on what sorts of morally horrifying things people will accept or even participate in without pushback, a subject we found was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">executed artfully, if upsettingly, in our 7/10 review of the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, the game has been banned from now both Steam and Epic. Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">we reported</a> that developer Santa Ragione said it was rejected from Steam after the team submitted an unfinished but playable build of the game in order to create a store page, an unusual request that Valve said was necessary. Valve then rejected Horses, generally citing its Steam Onboarding Documentation, as well as the sentence, "Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Santa Ragione has since guessed this was in relation to a scene in the game at the time that depicted a fully clothed child "riding" one of the horses on their shoulders. However, the studio says it has since changed that scene to involve an adult instead of a child, and that all characters in the game are clearly adults in their 20s and up, a fact that has remained true in the final version of the game that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">IGN reviewed</a>, ironically, on the Epic Games Store. Santa Ragione says it was not given the opportunity to resubmit a build to be reconsidered by Valve, and remains unsure if this scene was even what triggered the ban in the first place. The studio claims that without being able to reach Steam's much larger audience, it is likely it will have to shut down following the launch of Horses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Valve issued a statement claiming it "gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines" and that its internal content review team discussed a re-review "extensively" but decided against it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is now available on itch.io, GOG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-pc-game-storefront-gog-gets-behind-horses-after-valve-steam-ban-players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them">(which publicly expressed support for the game last week</a>), and Humble (which Santa Ragione says confirmed to the studio it would be available).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Horses Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review</link>
            <guid>1370830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it be games, films, paintings, or any other form of creative endeavor, art has long been a vehicle for transgression and subversion, providing curious observers an avenue to ruminate on uncomfortable, often taboo aspects of society. Take David Lynch’s surreal horror epic Lost Highway, or Half Mermaid’s mesmerising puzzle mystery <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortality-review"><u>Immortality</u></a> – their uncompromising and dark ambience leaves you changed, and often with more questions than answers. Horses, the latest game from developer Santa Ragione, uses the medium to tell its own morally challenging story, asking you to complete increasingly distressing tasks as a naive farmhand. Guaranteed to make you uncomfortable, Horses is an affecting first-person horror game that, despite a few pacing and signposting issues, tells a story that is sure to stick with you, whether you want it to or not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get too deep, it’s worth mentioning that Santa Ragione does provide a lengthy content warning before you begin playing due to its heavy subject matter. It details the themes you’ll encounter, which include gory imagery, psychological abuse, and suicide. That warning goes on to explain that you will also likely take part in activities that are oppositional to your own moral beliefs. How you feel about what Horses asks of you is ultimately very personal. Still, I was pleased to see the developers clearly outline what’s ahead for those who may struggle with certain moments, as I did — you should take this warning seriously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You step into the boots of Anselmo, a troubled 20-year-old who's been shipped away from college to work on a rural farm for two weeks at the behest of his parents. It becomes immediately apparent that something is wrong here, though, as you meet the titular horses, who are in fact naked humans with horse masks permanently affixed on their heads. From this point forward, almost every action you complete, from simple farming tasks to tormenting veterinarian work, is intentionally intended to make you feel conflicted as Horses forces you to participate in the farmer’s sick power fantasy. Over approximately three hours, I was compelled and constantly curious, but still found myself struggling to push through the haunting world Santa Ragione has conjured, with its grey moral code and disturbing paraphernalia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is, in effect, an interactive silent film, with unsettling lines of dialogue delivered through old-timey title cards amongst a smattering of live-action and 3D animated sequences with limited first-person interactions between them. Every scene plays out in black and white, and you’ll be held captive staring at the farmer’s mouth as it enunciates monologues through vile grins, spliced with real-world footage of vegetables being watered (as well as other, far more troubling visuals I wouldn’t want to spoil here). A minimal soundscape adds to the off-putting atmosphere, buffeted by the constant whirring of film that taunts you at all times, ensuring you feel isolated as you endure the weeks of work. This blend of audiovisual torment is unnerving from the start, and only escalates as you catapult closer to the striking finale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the dawn of each day, you’re provided a list of tasks to complete, like feeding the dog, chopping firewood, and cleaning the stables of the horses. The jobs are seldom as simple as they seem on paper, and often lead to confronting scenes that gradually illuminate the farmer's goals, and how the horses came to be his “property.” Your inventory is limited, and you can only handle two items at a time. As such, you’ll often find yourself running back and forth across the small map, between pens, the tool shed, and the house. As much as it is an open space, the threatening elements within it are constantly shifting and smartly toying with your expectations. NPCs like the farmer’s dog, Fido – another subjugated human in a mask – can and will move around the space, complicating your jobs, and often giving you a fright. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avoiding too many specifics, at one point I was responsible for finding horses that had gotten loose and returning them to their cramped stall unharmed. The search eventually led me out the front gates, where I witnessed a confronting interaction between a horse outside the gates and one still trapped inside. Such unusual moments ramp up in intensity over the course of Horses' runtime, effectively reinforcing the starkness of the world around their nightmarish, hay-filled isolation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the summer, you’ll meet a handful of curiously animated locals who are complicit with the farmer's actions, including a veterinarian, a wealthy businessman, his daughter, and a knowing priest. While there isn’t a ton of dialogue to cycle through in these short interactions, the unnerving writing and sinister characterisation of each citizen increased my sense of dread as it became clear that your freedom, in life or on the farm, isn’t a guarantee. As the inevitability of my new reality came into focus and the trepidation set in, I found myself questioning the farmers' treatment not just of the ‘animals’ or the outsiders, but of me. What misstep could I make that would land me in his prison? This is the central qualm you’ll ponder during and after your time with Horses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The horror doesn’t end with the working day, of course, and occasionally, when the sun sets, Anselmo slips into a dreamlike state where reality bleeds into their imagination. In these moments, the spectre of the farmer and his sexual and religious trauma manifests through dark allegories that you experience in a raw, challenging, and uncensored format. Instead of relying on text dumps, Horses’ penchant for sharp dialogue and symbolic iconography gives the player room to unpack its singular, heavy story.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite indie horror games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame, then, that with such a strong concept, there are a handful of comparatively mundane signposting issues throughout that can muddle the pacing, leaving you to pixel hunt for the right piece of equipment or overthink simple puzzles when you could have been contemplating one of Horses’ many jarring visual metaphors. For example, one day I simply needed to feed the horses – but despite meeting the basic requirements, nothing changed, and I was unable to prompt the farmer to provide further information. With no clear next step, I searched the area until I happened to find a specific item I didn’t know I needed to progress. In a game that feels so intentional and curated, such moments kill the ambience, and it feels awkward to wander around aimlessly in this psychologically punishing environment, especially when you’ve been imbued with the impetus to solve its mysteries. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like a pile of sugar cubes, Horses often has you in the palm of its hand, but unlike other, more cohesively arresting horror games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mouthwashing-review"><u>Mouthwashing</u></a> or No, I’m Not A Human, Santa Ragione’s attempt struggles to keep you there. The low-stakes gameplay feels like the culprit here, as there’s not much to chew on if you’re not gripped by the unfolding story and its characters. A short runtime only magnifies these limitations, messing with the cadence of an otherwise well-orchestrated experience. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Horses is a chilling, nerve-shredding short story that propels you through a series of increasingly heinous farm tasks. Sharp writing of morally repugnant characters creates a harrowing atmosphere, which is frustratingly diminished by repetitive activities and unclear signposting that sometimes pull you out of its silent film-like world. Even so, developer Santa Ragione’s admirably bracing vision does well to harness what can make the interactivity of video games so affecting, ensuring you’ll have plenty to think about as the credits roll.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-revamped-police-chase-system-was-inspired-by-pac-man</link>
            <guid>1370827</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hallmarks of Cyberpunk 2077, particularly after its Phantom Liberty update, is its dynamic police chases. In these, a player <em>committing crimes</em> might find themselves quick surrounded by cops and, a few crimes later, the extra spicy MaxTac. But what you might not have caught onto is that when trying to avoid this massive swarm of cops, you're essentially playing a really, really sophisticated version of a very, very old arcade game: Pac-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Industry Conference in Poznań, Wielkopolska, I attended a talk by CD Projekt senior AI programmer Maciej Celmer entitled "Heat, MaxTac, and Blockades: Police System, in Cyberpunk 2077 and more." In the talk, Celmer went into a lot of interesting detail about how exactly Cyberpunk 2077's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-details-cyberpunk-2077s-revamped-police-system-coming-alongside-phantom-liberty">police chase system was revamped</a> following criticism from players that at launch, the system was way too forgiving and unengaging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new system, implemented in 2023, was far more dynamic and popular with players. And according to Celmer, it had an unusual inspiration: Pac-Man.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Remember the game of Pac-Man, and the fact that every ghost had a different approach on how to catch the player?" Celmer said during his talk. "We did a similar thing in our car chases. For instance, one of them can try to reach the player on the shortest possible path, while the other can try to flank him or intercept on the intersection. There are seven different strategies that we applied to our cars with that part of the chase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to CD Projekt following the talk to get a little more detail on what Celmer meant. Over email, he confirmed that Pac-Man was one of "many" inspirations for the police chase update, "especially for the designers who came up with the idea. We wanted to surround the player with chasing vehicles but, at the same time, always try to leave at least one 'road to freedom' — basically, a way to escape. However, the situation in Night City, especially during a chase, can be very dynamic, so 'try' is definitely the right word here."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Celmer broke down the aforementioned seven "strategies" that police cars would take in a chase for us too. Each strategy combined a mix of logic for where the vehicle would spawn with its behavior after spawning, and which strategy was used was dependent on the heat level, the state of the police system (relaxed, alerted, or combat) and other factors. From there, cars could also perform different maneuvers depending on the situation, such as ramming, shooting, blocking, overtaking, or aligning with the chased car. The seven strategies were, in Celmer's words:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Drive towards the player — Move directly toward the player in a straight line. Used in the Alerted state.</li><li>Drive away from the player — Move directly away from the player. Used in the Alerted state.</li><li>Patrol the quadrant — Patrol the area around the player.</li><li>Intersection trap — Try to flank the player at the next intersection.</li><li>Get to the player from anywhere — The aggressive one.</li><li>Search for the player — Perform an initial search around the crime scene. Used in the Alerted state.</li><li>Search from anywhere — A fallback strategy used when we can’t find a suitable spawn point for strategy 6, so the car simply spawns anywhere and begins searching for the player.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The result was, if you look at Cyberpunk 2077's roads from the top down, something like a game of Pac-Man where the ghosts are the police cars chasing the player. In Pac-Man, each ghost has its own strategy it will typically perform, such as Pinky trying to ambush the player or Blinky chasing him directly. "We simply wanted to do something a bit different from other games with similar systems," Celmer said. "The combination of a classic game AI design inspired by Pac-Man seemed like a great fit for implementing police chases in Cyberpunk 2077."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077's turnaround is one of the most dramatic in video game history. After its disastrous launch in December 2020, CD Projekt continued to update the game, and now, as it nears its fifth birthday, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-has-now-sold-35-million-copies-currently-cd-projekts-main-source-of-revenue-5-years-after-launch">it's sitting on an incredible 35 million copies sold</a>. Indeed, Cyberpunk 2077 is currently CD Projekt's main source of revenue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial briefing, CD Projekt said it was “laying the foundations” for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2">Cyberpunk 2</a>, outlining plans to scale up its development teams in Boston, Warsaw, and Vancouver and through to the end of 2027. 135 people were working on Cyberpunk 2 as of October 31, 2025, up from 116 at the end of July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At GIC Poland, I also chatted with the director of Valor Mortis about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-connects-soulslike-players-is-that-they-are-all-struggling-valor-mortis-dev-says-it-wont-have-tens-of-difficulty-options-so-players-can-have-similar-experiences">difficulty options in Soulslike games</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valor-mortis-dev-dares-fans-to-question-the-games-soulslike-credentials-if-you-are-not-sure-about-it-challenge-us">whether Valor Mortis should count as a Soulslike</a>.

<p>By Valve’s admission, its upcoming Steam Machine desktop isn’t swinging for the fences with its graphical performance. The specs promise decent 1080p-to-1440p performance in most games, with 4K occasionally reachable with assistance from FSR upscaling—about what you’d expect from a box with a modern midrange graphics card in it.</p>
<p>But there’s one spec that has caused some concern among Ars staffers and others with their eyes on the Steam Machine: The GPU comes with just 8GB of dedicated graphics RAM, an amount that is steadily becoming more of a bottleneck for midrange GPUs like AMD’s Radeon RX 7060 and 9060, or Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 or 5060.</p>
<p>In our reviews of these GPUs, we’ve already run into some games where the RAM ceiling limits performance in Windows, especially at 1440p. But we’ve been doing more extensive testing of various GPUs with SteamOS, and we can confirm that in current betas, 8GB GPUs struggle even more on SteamOS than they do running the same games at the same settings in Windows 11.</p>
<p>The good news is that Valve is working on solutions, and having a stable platform like the Steam Machine to aim for should help improve things for other hardware with similar configurations. The bad news is there’s plenty of work left to do.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>

<p>We’ve tested an array of dedicated and integrated Radeon GPUs under SteamOS and Windows, and we’ll share more extensive results in another article soon (along with broader SteamOS-vs-Windows observations). But for our purposes here, the two GPUs that highlight the issues most effectively are the 8GB Radeon RX 7600 and the 16GB Radeon RX 7600 XT.</p>
<p>These dedicated GPUs have the benefit of being nearly identical to what Valve plans to ship in the Steam Machine—32 compute units (CUs) instead of Valve’s 28, but the same RDNA3 architecture. They’re also, most importantly for our purposes, pretty similar to each other—the same physical GPU die, just with slightly higher clock speeds and more RAM for the 7600 XT than for the regular 7600.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

<p>This makes it especially easy to identify the performance issues caused by RAM limits—any time the 7600 XT is more than 5 or 10 percent faster than the regular 7600, it means that the game is probably hitting that 8GB ceiling.</p>





<p>Some of the games in our suite, like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em> and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with the ray-tracing effects turned off, perform similarly on both GPUs. But the gap widens for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em> at 1440p with ray-tracing on, and for other ray-traced games like <em>Returnal</em> and&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, the problems even extend to 1080p. Even&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, hardly the newest entry in the franchise, shows signs of a larger gap between the 7600 and 7600 XT under SteamOS than exists in Windows 11.</p>
<p>If you look at the game-by-game results, you’ll see that SteamOS often trails behind Windows 11 running on the same dedicated GPU hardware, something we’ve also observed on the other dedicated GPUs we’ve tested. This is basically the inverse of what we (and others) have found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">when testing SteamOS and Windows on handhelds</a>. Add to that the additional problems that SteamOS has with GPUs that have 8GB of VRAM, and it’s clear that Valve has some work to do on the software side before the Steam Machine launches.</p>
<h2>Valve is working on it</h2>
<p>We spoke with Valve software developer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who leads much of the company’s work on SteamOS and the Proton translation layer, about our findings and what they meant for the Steam Machine.</p>
<p>“VRAM management is a topic we have been focusing on, and some of that work is still being done, so the general idea around what you’re describing doesn’t surprise me too much,” Griffais told Ars. “There were some shortcomings there that we’re making progress on. The typical symptom that we’d expect is that once you run out of VRAM, subsequent allocations from the game will spill over to system memory, at which point a drastic performance drop would be observed since the game would partially be rendering to/from system memory across the PCIe bus.”</p>

<p>That description definitely squares with some of what we saw, particularly in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em> and&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em> under some settings—not just a subtle reduction in performance as in&nbsp;<em>Forza</em> or&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, but flipbook-y performance that makes games that are playable in Windows unplayable on SteamOS at the same settings.</p>
<p>Griffais wasn’t specific about the fixes planned to address these problems, or about the timeline for rolling them out. But this performance gap is something the company is actively working to address.</p>
<p>“We have some work around improving video memory management that’s about to get merged into SteamOS main [a testing branch of SteamOS, separate from the Steam Deck’s stable channel] that should improve things there,” Griffais told Ars.</p>
<p>Up until now, memory management simply hasn’t been an issue for SteamOS, at least not for hardware like the Steam Deck and the Legion Go S that Valve is officially supporting. That’s partly because these systems’ slower integrated GPUs will usually bottleneck performance way before a lack of video RAM will. But one benefit of integrated GPUs is that, because they use your system’s main RAM rather than their own dedicated pool of high-speed memory, they can use essentially as much of your system RAM as they need to. Framework uses it as a selling point for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/review-framework-desktop-is-a-mash-up-of-a-regular-desktop-pc-and-the-mac-studio/">its Framework Desktop</a>—its Radeon RX 8050S and 8060S GPUs are in the same general performance class as the RX 7600, but can access <a href="https://frame.work/desktop?tab=machine-learning">between 24GB and 96GB</a> of the PC’s pool of system RAM.</p>
<p>In short, the Steam Machine will be Valve’s first officially supported hardware that actually needs to <em>care</em> about a fixed allotment of video memory. The Steam Machine’s 8GB of VRAM is still going to be a performance limiter for some games, but hopefully Valve’s SteamOS and Proton patches can at least help 8GB GPUs work as well in SteamOS as they do in Windows.</p>
