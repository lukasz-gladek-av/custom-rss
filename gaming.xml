              <p data-start="75" data-end="854">Upgrade your gaming experience by investing in quality audio. If you’ve been relying on the standard speakers built into your television, you’re in for a dramatic improvement. Transitioning from basic TV sound to a dedicated over-the-ear gaming headset is like discovering you’ve needed glasses your entire life, only to finally put them on and see clearly. Suddenly, subtle details come alive. The soft scuffle of enemy footsteps, the direction of distant gunfire, or the echo of movement in a cavernous environment. With proper spatial audio, you gain the ability to pinpoint opponents with sound alone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5800/">Fortunately, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X multi-platform gaming headset is now available at a 30% discount, dropping its price from $150 to just $105 ahead of Black Friday.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5800/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="856" data-end="1431">What Makes the Arctis Nova 5X Stand Out</h2>
<p data-start="856" data-end="1431">Though the Arctis Nova 5X is built with Xbox consoles in mind—both in terms of design and technical optimization—it’s a flexible headset that works across a wide range of systems. It’s compatible with Xbox Series X and Series S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. It also supports VR devices and mobile platforms, making it a versatile audio solution for varied gaming environments. The fit is designed for lasting comfort, featuring an adjustable steel headband paired with memory-foam ear cushions that keep you cool and comfortable during long play sessions.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="2027">The headset’s magnetic drivers deliver an exceptionally detailed sound profile. You’ll hear crisp highs, accurate mids, and rich low frequencies that bring game worlds to life. The Arctis Nova 5X also supports 360° spatial audio, allowing you to get the most out of the next-gen audio systems built into your console and hear sound coming from all directions. The sound levels are customizable. You can choose between over 100 Xbox presets in the Arctis Nova 5 companion app on your smartphone.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="2027">Wireless connectivity is fast and dependable. The headset connects over a portable USB-C dongle, ensuring a lag-free, lossless audio experience. A USB-C to USB-A cable is also included, giving you flexibility when you need to plug in.</p>


<p data-start="2029" data-end="2392">Battery life is another standout here. The Arctis Nova 5X delivers up to 60 hours of use on a single charge, meaning you can game for days without plugging in. When you do need power in a pinch, USB-C Fast Charge support gives you six hours of playtime after just 15 minutes of charging—perfect for those moments when you’re eager to jump back into the action.</p>
<p data-start="2394" data-end="2904">The headset’s dual-audio capabilities allow you to stay connected beyond your console. By linking your mobile device simultaneously, you can take phone calls during a gaming session, listen to podcasts while grinding through hunts in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, or coordinate strategies with friends over Discord while battling opponents in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. And if you’re only interested in game audio and not chatting, the retractable microphone tucks away neatly, keeping the headset’s profile clean and unobtrusive.</p>
<p data-start="2906" data-end="3081"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5800/">For a limited time, you can take advantage of a 30% discount on the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X, bringing this quality gaming headset down to an appealing price of just $105.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modders celebrate <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-new-update-next-gen-patch-stop-bethesda-mods-1851473401">10 years of improving <em>Fallout 4</em></a> with their own anniversary collection, Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt earns a big defender, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334">very good Analogue 3D</a> (I’ve tested it but still need to publish my full review) is finally getting a Bluetooth N64 controller that actually looks cool. Welcome to the latest edition of <em>Morning Checkpoint</em>, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s Black Friday season which means I’m about to stock up on extra controllers to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. It’s not great that modern game pads cost more than ever and wear out twice as fast.</p> <h2>Modders have put together their own <em>Fallout 4</em> Anniversary Collection</h2> <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15406">The package includes</a> a curated round-up of all of the community’s favorite free fan-made add-ons for Bethesda’s decade-old RPG. But the <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Collection</em> is more than that. “It’s a thank-you to the creators who’ve kept <em>Fallout 4</em> evolving long after launch, and a gift to players returning to the Wasteland with fresh eyes,” wrote Nexus user ModularCocoon. “Whether this is your first playthrough in years or your fifteenth settlement build this month, this is the Commonwealth at its most refined: a snapshot of what ten years of modding can achieve.”</p>

 <p>That’s in contrast to the official update from Bethesda which recently messed a bunch of things up and drove the game down to its lowest user rating ever on Steam with “overwhelming negative” reviews. “Game has been out for a decade and received two recent updates,” one player wrote. “I still get a black screen on startup and have to track down an ini file to make it work.” Bethesda is <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-patch-anniversary-edition-hot-fix-bethesda-2000643952">trying to fix it</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> devs promise to fix the new motion blur issue</h2> <p>The 2023 release recently received its new, free <em>Valley of Memory</em> DLC expanding on Basim’s adventure with new content and new parkour options. But it also got rid of the ability to toggle motion blur off, in addition to tuning up the effect way beyond what fans were used to. It’s been making players dizzy and making the game look bad. Ubisoft promised it’s <a href="https://x.com/AccessTheAnimus/status/1991544515702784466">prioritizing a fix</a> to add the settings toggle back in ASAP.</p>

 <h2>One Geralt compliments another</h2> <p>Doug Cockle, who voices Geralt in the <em>Witcher</em> video games, says Liam Hemsworth, who now plays him in Netflix’s&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em> series, is doing a fine job, despite season 4’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-season-4-reviews-liam-hemsworth-2000640506">abominable reception and ratings</a>.</p> <p>“I loved Henry. He was a fantastic Witcher, Geralt, specifically, so I was sad to see him go, but I have watched the newest season, and I think Liam holds up pretty well,” Cockle <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/geralts-game-actor-says-he-was-sad-to-see-henry-cavill-go-but-that-liam-hemsworth-holds-up-pretty-well-in-the-witcher-season-4-hes-made-it-his-own-character/">told <em>GamesRadar</em></a>. “He’s different. He’s made it his own character, and that’s what he should have done as an actor, and I think he’s done a fantastic job. So I’m looking forward to seeing Season Five eventually, and seeing where it goes.”</p>

 <h2>This is the N64-style gamepad the Analogue 3D should have shipped with</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller for Analogue 3D (Grey) up for preorder on 8BitDo ($44.99) <a href="https://t.co/Jd9OH3869E">https://t.co/Jd9OH3869E</a> <a href="https://t.co/P8Si5rhRsQ">pic.twitter.com/P8Si5rhRsQ</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1991538298934747585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>8bitdo<a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-64-bluetooth-controller"> just revealed</a> a gray variant of its Bluetooth controller for its new retro console that plays Nintendo 64 games. It’s $45 and looks great compared to the all-black base model, but it’s not shipping until the end of January 2026. Hopefully, it has a better thumbstick than the current Analogue 3D controllers as well.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur</em> could get an <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair drop</h2> <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> designer Gavin Verhey said he’s into the idea of a collaboration with the surprise turn-based RPG hit of 2025. “My general theory recently is that gaming brands are just really good collaborations for <em>Magic</em>,” he <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/magic-the-gathering/lead-magic-the-gathering-dev-is-hoping-for-a-clair-obscur-expedition-33-collab-3282548/">told <em>Dexerto</em></a>. “When you bring someone new in with a gaming collaboration, they’re already gamers. You don’t have to explain what hit points are, what an objective is, or what mana is. They just get it.”</p>

 <p>He added, “I mean, it’s the talk of the town this year right? <em>Expedition 33</em> would be really fun to get to do…who knows if it’ll happen or if they’re even up for that kind of thing, right?”</p> <h2><em>Silent Hill 2</em> sneaks onto Xbox Series X/S</h2> <p>The remake port was quietly shadow-dropped this week with a big 50 percent off discount. Any Xbox fans who haven’t already played it on another platform can grab it for just $35, which is almost as good as having it on Game Pass (or even better for those who prefer to own). Konami <a href="https://t.co/DAImTnGEDc">recently teased</a> that it’s planning more<em> Silent Hill</em> games in addition to the recently released <em>Silent Hill f</em> and an in-development remake of <em>Silent Hill 1</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-november-2025-reanimal-trailer-free-demo-2000645835">Xbox’s surprise showcase yesterday had some neat surprises, including <em>Echo Generations 2</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-game-reddit-steam-reviews-2000645900"><em>Where Winds Meet</em> is Steam’s latest big free-to-play MMO and it’s full of weird stuff</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/expedition-33-verso-actor-ben-starr-speech-awards-layoffs-2000645930"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> swept the Golden Joystick awards and actor Ben Starr had a message for the industry</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

<figure></figure>



<p>Ubisoft was working on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise, but Ubisoft decided to cancel it before it was ever announced.</p>

<p>Herman was hired in 2017 by Ubisoft, along two other AdHoc cofounders Pierre Shorette and Dennis Lenart, and moved to work in Ubisoft’s San Francisco office. Upon arrival, they were put on the new Splinter Cell project.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Wartorn. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>In what may sound obvious at this point, Electronic Arts (EA) has found itself a hit with Battlefield 6. In the latest United States (US) sales report from Circana, Battlefield 6 has it a major sales record for the franchise.</p>



<p>According to the data provided, Battlefield 6 is the best-selling game in series history. It’s sales alone in October not only made it the best-selling game of both the month and year, but also saw it surpass the lifetime sales of Battlefield 1. Up until this year, Battlefield 1 had been the highest-selling game every for Battlefield.</p>



<p>But that’s not all.</p>

<h3>Hytale Is Back After Being Reacquired By Hypixel Studios</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hypixel Studios is back, and they have brought an old friend along with it. On Monday, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that they had reacquired the rights to sandbox game Hytale from Riot Games.</p>



<p>The news comes roughly five months since it was announced that the game was&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being shut down</a>.</p>

<h3>Concord Has Effectively Been Shut Down By Sony For A Second Time</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>Concord has gone down in infamy as an all-time Sony and PlayStation blunder. It’s also understandable that the company wants to sweep the game’s existence under the rug, which is why Sony has presumably and swiftly issued DMCAs notices to gameplay videos of a fan-inspired Concord reboot, causing access to the game to be halted.</p>



<p>Now, a community effort to resurrect the game has been met with strong action.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The long road to Star Citizen’s full release looks to be continuing, as it’s been 13 years since the game was announced. We’ve checked back in from time to time, and the latest update is that Star Citizen is still in alpha, and it’s swiftly closing in on $900 million of crowd-funded money.</p>



<p>Say what you want, yes, but&nbsp;Star Citizen&nbsp;actually looks like a quality game. On the other hand, it probably should do when it’s had the development time that many multi-game franchises get and enough money to fund several Hollywood-level movies. Cloud Imperium Games’ Star Citizen could end up being one of the most fascinating games of our time.</p>

<h3>Resident Evil Requiem Producer Addresses Leon Kennedy Rumors</h3>

<p>It should be noted that Kumazawa’s responses were translated via an interpreter. While we don’t discredit the translator, there’s always the possibility that something was lost in translation. But when asked about the future of Leon Kennedy and the rumors that he might be in Resident Evil Requiem, Kumazawa had a simple response…</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-set-b1a/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket-next-set-release-details%E2%80%94new-set-b1a-explained.1360960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Even though the developers seem to be listening, Pokémon TCG Pocket content is still coming thick and fast. Set B1a will be here before you know it, so you should know its potential release details and what to expect from it.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-b1-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Rising</a> was the culmination of one year of Pokémon TCG Pocket. B1 brought us full circle and did so with a huge collection of cards that will take weeks to collect. Creatures Inc. and DeNA have been easing up slightly on the new sets—with Deluxe Pack ex proving to be a rest point for some.</p>







<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is going to drop Set B1a in the future, and it might be wise to have Hourglasses ready.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-set">When Is The Next Pokémon TCG Pocket Set?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Probably won’t be a big one. Credit to the Pokémon company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to various sources, Pokémon TCG Pocket Set B1a isn’t arriving until December 17.</strong></p>



<p>If this is correct, this means we aren’t getting a new Pokémon TCG Pocket set in November 2025. This would mirror what happened in Pocket’s first year. Genetic Apex was the debut set for the game, and Set 1a didn’t arrive until toward the end of December 2024—giving everyone two months to try and complete the collection.</p>







<p>Leaks suggest the plan is the same for Pokémon TCG Pocket in 2025. Mega Rising will carry over into December 2025, presumably due to the size of the set (over 300 new cards is a lot).</p>



<p>Then, a new, as yet unnamed, set will drop at the end of December 2025, giving everyone some festive cheer.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-can-we-expect-from-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1a">What Can We Expect From Pokémon TCG Pocket B1a?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket B1a is likely to be a mini-set featuring a much smaller assortment of cards.</strong></p>



<p>Because it’s so far away, we haven’t seen or heard any B1a leaks. Conversely, it’s common sense that the next set will follow in the footsteps of other sets that end with an “a” or a “b.” Genetic Apex was followed up by Mythical Island, which only added 86 cards.</p>



<p>Triumphant Light (A2a) included 96 cards, and Shining Revelry (A2b) had 112 cards, for example. While each new set is growing bigger—thanks to Shinies and other special designs—B1a will probably have between 100-120 new cards—including Rares.</p>

Kennedy will be back for Requiem, revisiting the city where he spent a fateful first day as a rookie police officer back in Resident Evil 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, to date, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">Capcom has refused to discuss whether fans will reconnect with any familiar faces in Requiem</a>, choosing instead to focus its marketing efforts on new protagonist Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Well-Played</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa has finally confirmed that "yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth stating that Kumazawa is responding here to a question which asked specifically whether other Outbreak characters, as well as Alyssa, will show up in Requiem. But Kumazawa does then go on to mention characters "involved in the Raccoon City incident" generally will appear. Here's the full quote:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it," Kumazawa teased. "We can’t promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate around whether other characters — and specifically Leon — are in Requiem has dominated discussion of the game to date, though Capcom seems happy to keep the speculation going. While focusing on Grace Ashcroft in trailers and early gameplay previews, the publisher has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">never explicitly stated that she is the sole playable character</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview published online this week, Kumazawa branded a specific fan image of Leon with an eyepatch as "fake news," and suggested it was the work of AI. But again, the producer stopped short of simply saying Leon isn't in the game — which, at this point, you'd think developers would simply state in order to manage expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. There's still plenty of time for more reveals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Most retailers spend November teasing limited-time offers, but the reality is that the deepest discounts rarely show up until about a week before what I like to call “Black Friday proper.” Early deals can be tempting, but they often don’t beat the prices that land closer to the main event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having tracked PlayStation sales for six years, one thing is clear: once a PlayStation deal hits, it usually stays put for the duration of the sale. That means the prices you see now for consoles, controllers, and games are very likely the ones you’ll see through to December. If you’ve been holding out for a good deal, there’s no need to wait any longer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These offers are solid, reliable, and unlikely to get any better. Go ahead and grab the what you’ve had your eye on, there’s no risk of Black Friday regret, only the satisfaction of scoring exactly what you wanted at a price that finally makes sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <p>
Seasons of Solitude is a soulful balance of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> and turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> about an exiled prehistoric tribesman who is trying not to trash his own habitat. It's the work of Estonian developers Ninjarithm Studio, and is based on Estonian myths.</p>
<p>There's a demo on Steam, which I've spent barely any time with, but this seems Interesting - Interesting enough that I wanted to get a write-up in front of you before the weekend. Please disregard the rapid-fire editing of the trailer below: it works as an overview of the mechanics, but doesn't really convey the sleepy pensiveness of the actual game.

<p>
The first thing that intrigues me is the hex-based world, which alters constantly underfoot both of its own accord and in response to your actions. Big shifts include the changing of the seasons, with food being harder to find in the darker months. Smaller ones include bee swarms blocking access to fruit, or larger animals eating your crops.</p><p>You can trap or drive those animals off, but if you do that, you'll stress out the ecosystem, causing ripple effects elsewhere. You'll want to build shelters and devise tools such as stone spades, but you also need to cultivate and repair tiles to support the vitality of the whole map. The basic controls are simple: you spend limited points to move around and carry out tile-specific actions, then hold F to end the turn and advance the year.
</p>
<p>
The second thing that intrigues me is that you're not alone. Or rather, you're alone with your thoughts in a more literal sense. The Exile has an Echo, a wraithlike manifestation of their needs and urges, who acts as a second playable character - presumably, this is the key bit they've derived from Estonian myth. You've got to keep the two incarnations of yourself apart, because if they're both in the same green-bordered area it multiplies your ecological footprint. But you also need to use them in tandem, because if they perform the same actions on separate tiles of the same kind, you'll get bonuses. Possibly there's a moral here.
</p>
<p>
I like the visuals, which combine sunny vegetal shades with lots of deft little movements, like wind in the boughs or water springing up as tiles transform. I'm finding the tutorial a bit confusing as regards details like the distinction between tiles and larger regions, but it doesn't feel like anything I can't figure out. There's no release date yet. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3312670/Seasons_of_Solitude/">Find the demo on Steam.</a> If you dig it, you will probably also dig <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/folk-emerging-is-a-fascinating-4x-strategy-game-about-prehistoric-nomads-that-ends-where-civilization-begins">Folk Emerging</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-14-port-docking-station-gets-a-black-friday-price-tag-despite-being-a-new-release-but-only-a-few-units-exist.1360906/</guid>

              <p>Most of us rely on multiple devices to get through the day. These are great to stay productive, but things can often get a little messy on the connectivity side. Before you know, you’re dealing with a whole bunch of cables and adapters on your desk; not a good sight.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make your workstation cleaner and more efficient, investing in a docking station can be a smart choice. These tiny but mighty devices serve as a connectivity hub, letting you add multiple external peripherals at the same time, plus charge your essentials as well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5535/">Today is a great time to pick a top-rated option, as Amazon’s early Black Friday sale has dropped the price of the 14-port Anker Prime Docking Station by 30%.</a> It’s now available for just $210, after a whopping $90 discount. The deal applies to the gray color option and is open to all shoppers. The black version is going for $272 (down from $340), but the discount is exclusive to Prime members on that one. Note that most early deals wrap up before the event, which means this one is only around for a limited time. It’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for Multiple Essentials</h2>
<p>Anker has packed this docking station with 14 ports in total. You’re getting a 140W 10Gbps USB-C upstream port, two 100W 10Gbps USB-C ports, one 100W 5Gbps USB-C port, two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, two 5Gbps USB-A ports, one 480Mbps USB-A port, a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, a headphone and mic combo jack, and SD and TF card slots. That’s enough to add all your essentials without feeling limited. Think mouse, keyboard, laptop, external monitors, headphones, external storage, and more.</p>
<p>The three USB-C ports at the front support both charging and data transfer. You can juice your laptop up with up to 140W via the upstream port, and use the rest to charge other devices. The full 140W power can be achieved when you only have the laptop connected at the front. The two HDMI and DisplayPort let you add up to three external monitors to your setup simultaneously, including one in 8K.</p>



<p><strong>The station is compatible with both macOS 13.5 or later and Windows 10/11</strong>, but you will need to install the latest DisplayLink driver if you want to add more screens to the setup. It’s not that complicated, as all that you need to do is head over to the Anker website, find the DisplayLink installer that matches your system, and proceed with the download. Just make sure to uninstall any older versions of the driver already on your system, and then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. macOS users will also need to enable screen recording and allow the driver to launch automatically after login to proceed.</p>
<p>The process shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and once it’s done, you can enjoy multitasking on a bigger setup. Take video calls on one screen and present using the other. Or work on your main display, while having reference material and relevant documents open on the others! The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>There’s also a smart display on the front, just above the USB-C ports. It provides real-time updates on charging power, display performance, and other settings. Anker has even included a built-in fan paired with ActiveShield 3.0 to keep things cool as the docking station works. The box comes with the docking station itself, USB-C to USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 cable for upstream port (3.3 ft, 10 Gbps), 6ft AC power cord, safety sheet with user manual, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>Get your orders in fast, before Amazon decides to shoot the price back up to the not-so-friendly $300.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s new California Resistance update is out now, adding a range of new things for players to experience, including a brand-new map, Eastwood. The map is hiding a Breaking Bad Easter Egg, players have discovered, and it's one of the best-known Breaking Bad references from the show.</p><p>One of the buildings on the new Eastwood map has a pizza on the roof of its garage--this is pretty clearly a reference to the show's 2010 Season 3, Episode 2 episode, "Caballo sin Nombre." In this episode, Walter (Bryan Cranston) tosses an entire pizza onto the roof in a fit of rage. Now, you can see that pizza in Battlefield 6, or something like it.</p><p>This scene became an internet meme, and other games, like High on Life, have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/10bxubi/the_house_in_high_on_life_has_an_unsliced_pizza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">referenced it as well.</a></p><p>There is some fantastic lore surrounding the pizza-throwing scene in Breaking Bad. Writer Peter Gould <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4VO7HxpkaE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recalled</a> how difficult he imagined the scene was to film, as Cranston was asked to throw the pizza box, have the pizza separate, and then have the pizza land in the right spot for the shot.</p><p>As it turned out, Cranston nailed it on the first take, something that Gould said was extremely unlikely. Series creator Vince Gilligan commented on it as well. "It was just one of those perfect moments where it looked like it was too perfect to be real, but in fact it was," he said.</p><p>Given the popularity of the scene, and because it was filmed on location at a local Albuquerque resident's home, fans of the show flocked to the location and tried the feat out for themselves. This upset the locals, and Gilligan himself had to <a href="https://time.com/3740595/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-pizza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">issue a statement to fans asking them to please not do that.</a> The house went up for sale earlier this year, asking just under $4 million, <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/unique-homes/breaking-bad-house-sale-walter-white/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a huge premium of 10X its estimated value.</a> The house has not sold yet, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3828-Piermont-Dr-NE-Albuquerque-NM-87111/6776276_zpid/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Zillow records.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg6dxhJbq78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="123">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bg6dxhJbq78?start=123" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For Gilligan's new Albuquerque-set show, Pluribus, his team <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/pluribus-vince-gilligan-rhea-seehorn-1236414569/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">built an entire cul-de-sac of houses</a> to help avoid another similar tourist attraction situation for people hoping to visit where the main character lives.</p><p>As for Battlefield 6, the new California Resistance update for Season 1 adds the Eastwood map and the Sabotage mode. There are also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-california-resistance-event-pass-all-free-and-paid-rewards-to-unlock/2900-7264/" data-ref-id="2900-7264">new rewards to unlock in the event pass, including free and paid DLC. </a></p><p>New US sales data from Circana showed that Battlefield 6 was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 1 best-selling game for October and for 2025 so far</a>. The game's first-month sales <a href="https://google.com/search?q=battlefield+6+sales+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=battlefield+6+sales+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYQDIGCAQQRRhAMgYIBRBFGEDSAQg4OTgzajBqNKgCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed similar first-month sales for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. </a></p>

But the new protagonist will come across other returning characters from the franchise, too, according to producer Masato Kumazawa. However, the developer wants to manage expectations, as rumors mount about Resident Evil 2 and 4 protagonist Leon Kennedy appearing in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/" rel="nofollow ">Well Played</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>), Kumazawa was asked about more Resident Evil Outbreak characters popping up in Requiem. "I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don't over-expect or hype it," the producer said. "We can't promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Leon starred alongside Claire Redfield in Resident Evil 2, which was set in Raccoon City. So he definitely fits the criteria teased by Kumazawa. On the flip side, Capcom explained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-games/1100-6532769/">why Leon was a "bad match" for Resident Evil Requiem</a> earlier this year. The caveat and wiggle room here for Capcom is that Leon was discussed as the protagonist in this light, meaning that he could still show up as an NPC. That said, Kumuzawa is clearly trying to temper expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Kumuzawa opened up about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-abandoned-multiplayer-vision-because-it-wasnt-scary-enough/1100-6536283/">Resident Evil Requiem originally being developed as an online open-world multiplayer game</a>. While this version "was fun to play," Kumuzawa admitted it "wasn't scary enough."</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-may-be-the-most-extreme-in-the-series-says-director/1100-6534329/">Resident Evil will be "an incredible rollercoaster" for players</a>. The survival-horror game is set to launch February 27 on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-scares-its-way-onto-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6534701/">and Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The 2024 remake of Silent Hill 2 is now available on Xbox Series X/S. If that wasn’t a surprise enough, Xbox owners can purchase the game at a special launch discount of up to 50 percent off the standard platform pricing.</p><p>It had been rumored that Silent Hill 2, which launched for PlayStation 5 and PC in October 2024, was heading to Xbox after fans spotted an ESRB rating for this version last month. Konami gave no advance announcement of this edition, and only officially revealed its existence hours after the game stealthily launched on the Australian Xbox Store yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>The standard edition of Silent Hill 2 normally retails at $69.99, but the launch discount drops this price to $34.99. The $79.99 Deluxe Edition is currently on sale for $39.99.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aFrvEu2Ku8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aFrvEu2Ku8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Developed by Bloober Team, the remake of Silent Hill 2 has received heaps of praise, including scoring an 8.75 out of 10 from us at <em>Game Informer</em>. Reviewer Kye Hilliard wrote in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/silent-hill-2/engrossing-and-unsettling">his review</a> that,</p><p>“Bloober’s take on Silent Hill 2 is engrossing, even if words I would usually use to compliment other games like “fun” simply don’t apply here. I experienced the original game shortly after its first release, but I was still eager to see where the story was going and what new ways I would dive into the psyche of James and the others he met in Silent Hill. Despite the difficult revelations Silent Hill 2 unveils along the way and how uncomfortable the experience made me (by design) I was eager to immediately start the journey again after seeing the credits.”</p><p>To read more about Silent Hill 2, check out this news about its upcoming live-action film adaptation, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/27/check-out-the-official-teaser-trailer-for-silent-hill-2-movie-adaptation-return-to"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a>. &nbsp;Konami recently announced that Bloober Team is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/12/konami-teases-a-remake-of-the-original-silent-hill">remaking the first Silent Hill game</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Anyone else have a flurry of snow this morning? It disappeared quickly, but it’s been right chilly this week, so I’ve had an extra layer to keep me cosy while playing games. And this week I’ve been juggling a bunch of games. There’s been more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> to eventually wrap up our review, there was an impromptu run-through of the still excellent Metroid Prime Remastered ahead of the new sequel, I had a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">Nioh 3</a> to deliver for today, and I reviewed the rather enjoyable bullet heaven, tower defence mash-up of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/monsters-are-coming-rock-and-road-review/">Monsters Are Coming! Rock and Road</a>.</p>

<p>Turning to the rest of us, <strong>Aran</strong> wrapped up his review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/17/umami-review/">Umami</a>, the intriguing 3D food puzzle game, and then made a start on Xenopurge for review, and Wuchang Fallen Feathers for pleasure. He’s already beaten the first non-optional boss and is feeling like he’s making some good progress at hitting things with a big sword.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> was lucky enough to get Ghost of Yotei for his birthday –&nbsp;happy birthday! – so he’s been playing that. “It’s very good!” he says. “At the moment, a few hours in, I slightly prefer it to the original.</p>


<p>Making it two ghosts in Yotei is <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s played that alongside Metal Gear Solid Delta’s Fox Hunt multiplayer and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. “Despite its limited offering, I’m having great fun with Fox Hunt, which crams the thrills of a battle royale/extraction shooter in a short-fire rounds, though Konami’s silence regarding future content is concerning in an age where publishers are quick to slap roadmaps all over their live service titles. Meanwhile, Black Ops 7 has been a mixed bag. It certainly lives up to Activision’s marketing as being the biggest COD to date, though I’m yet to gel with any of the game modes despite the gunplay being top tier.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had Sweet Surrender in for review, now that he’s returned home, and has two massive open world games on the go in the form of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, as well as some of the poker roguelite Balatro.</p>

<p><strong>Tuff</strong> is close to wrapping up our review of the breakout extraction shooter hit ARC Raiders, and <strong>Miguel’s</strong> been playing a bit of that too, but he’s mainly been playing lots of Wuthering Waves, “because their latest update added a new explorable cyberpunk city with a capybara mascot which is all very targeted at me specifically.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Dom</strong>, who’s been a busy bee with real life, but snuck in a bit of throwback gaming to a decade ago by playing Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on Switch 2. It’s still good!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a>, we got new looks at 16 games. Some of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/godfall-developer-counterplay-games-debuts-armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">were new announcements and reveals</a>, others were first looks at gameplay. The trailer we saw for The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu falls in the latter camp, with our first real look at gameplay for the upcoming four-player online co-op game from ACE Team and Nacon.</p>



<p>First announced <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/nacon-and-ace-team-announce-co-op-horror-game-the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc">back in March 2025</a>, it was initially set to arrive sometime before the end of this year. Then, in August, <a href="https://x.com/PlayTheMound/status/1956353464801321128">Nacon and ACE Team delayed its launch to 2026</a>. Now, have a more defined release window, with the studios announcing that it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S at some point in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu puts you into the shoes of one of four players, all stuck on an island, trying to survive a cursed jungle that will warp their reality, making it difficult to tell the difference between allies and enemies.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Not only are you dealing with mind-bending phenomena, you're dealing with an older class of weapons that cause their own anxieties simply due to the fact that if you miss your first shot, you might not get the chance to reload a second with these old-school rifles.</p>



<p>This trailer, short as it is, was our first proper look at gameplay, while still emphasizing the dark atmosphere and tone the game is going for. It'll be interesting to see how ACE Team and Nacon lean into its 16th-century setting and its Lovecraftian inspirations. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-2-will-be-a-multiplatform-release-launching-on-various-consoles-developer-confirms.1360852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Development of Stellar Blade 2 is ramping up, and new details on the second entry in the series have been revealed today by a new job listing.</p>



<p>As spotted by Genki on X, a new job listing found on developer <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=318&amp;page=1&amp;code=news">Shift Up's official website</a> confirms that their upcoming game will be a multiplatform game, aiming to release on various consoles and PC. This represents a significant change from the original Stellar Blade, as the game is currently available only on PlayStation 5 and PC, although Shift Up confirmed earlier this year that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">it was exploring a release on other platforms, including the Nintendo Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>Unfortunately, the job listing provides little additional information about Stellar Blade 2. According to the job listing, the game will <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"inherit the stylish action and narrative-driven world of its predecessor, while delivering an evolved action gameplay experience,"</em> which is exactly what Shift Up said back in September when it confirmed that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-sequel-development/">the game entered active development.</a></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up announced the start of large scale recruitment for the development of the Stellar Blade sequel!</p><p>New job listings suggest console and PC multiplatform development using Unreal Engine 5!</p><p>“The next installment of ‘Stella Blade’, currently under development at Shift Up, is… <a href="https://t.co/fcQZedfvKx">pic.twitter.com/fcQZedfvKx</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1991891947116798013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Stellar Blade 2 entering active development a little over a year after the series debuted on PlayStation 5 is hardly surprising. Although the game was the first console and PC game developed by the Korean game development studio, it immediately captured the attention of players worldwide with its recognizable main character, solid action-gameplay and great soundtrack, so much so that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-fastest-selling-korean-game-steam/">became the fastest selling Korean game on Steam</a>, driving nearly 60% of Shift Up's revenue in the second quarter of the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>Though an excellent action game, Stellar Blade is not without issues, as the narrative elements, while acceptable for an action game, weren't particularly remarkable, and never explored in depth the game's universe. Hopefully, Shift Up will tighten them up for the sequel to deliver an even more memorable experience.</p>

            <p>Krafton have revealed PUBG spin-off Black Budget, just in time for alpha testing of the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> to kick off next month. As you might expect given the genre, this latest work from PUBG Studios is all about getting out of the bad vibe zone in good time, after shooting some baddies in said zone. Oh, sorry, <strong>tactically</strong> shooting some baddies in the bad vibe zone.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"You are a Contractor, a hardened veteran hired for a classified operation on an island at the edge of the world," reads the Steam synopsis. "Your mission is to recover top-secret technology from an abandoned research facility. But there’s a catch: the island is trapped in a time loop, consumed by a supernatural phenomenon known as the Anomaly. Extract artifacts, research your findings, and uncover the truth behind the black-budget initiative, SAPIENS."</p>
<p>Damn, don't you just hate it when you, a jobbing tradesperson with a gun, get sent on a super secret tech-nabbing mission and the lab turns out to be on time warp island. Plus, you might get eaten by a thing that couldn't be bothered to flip beyond page one of the big book of sci-fi thing names when picking its moniker. In all seriousness, the Steam page's shots of fighting among swirling purple evilness look pretty fun.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Krafton promise that the world "grows more unpredictable with every loop", with each trip out lasting about 30 minutes, with the Anomaly gradually shrinking the map much like classic PUBG's battle royales. Between trips to Anomalyville, you'll do the usual extraction shooter thing of huddling in an upgradeable base and tinkering with your gear so the purple stuff won't get you next time.</p><p>You'll be able to get a taste of all of that in PC-only closed alpha tests which are set to run between December 12th and 14th, then December 19th to 21st. Both session will be open to folks in North America, Europe, and Asia. You can request access to take part on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4077740/PUBG_Black_Budget/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>If you do, tell the Anomaly I said hello and that it's picked a nice shade of violet. Maybe it'll pause in confusion long enough to buy you the few more seconds you need to hop back into the safety of your ammo-filled digs.</p>

              <p>As “pedophile hellscape”&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> finally adds <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/roblox-introduces-age-based-chat-to-enhance-user-safety-gaming-parent-controls-robloxs-facial-checks-adult-minor-teen-chatting-chatbox-safe">a rudimentary measure</a> to try to prevent children from being exploited via its network of games and chatrooms used by 151 million people, the company’s CEO <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">spoke to the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em></a> podcast Hard Fork about child safety. And it didn’t go great. It&nbsp;<em>really</em> didn’t go great.</p> <p><em>Roblox</em> is coming under increasing scrutiny after decades of failing to implement even the most basic of protective measures to keep its pre-teen players away from the networks of pedophiles who use the game to find victims. Described last year as <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">“a pedophile hellscape for kids”</a> by Hindenburg Research<a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">,</a> the game quickly introduced a <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">new assortment of measures</a>&nbsp;last October that did next to nothing, leading this year to a great deal of legal interest. Three months back, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-brainrot-grow-a-garden-hellscape-2000618002">the state of Louisiana announced its intentions to sue&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em></a> for the dangers it was allowing, joined since by Kentucky and Texas. These actions come alongside <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/roblox-announces-new-safety-measure-amid-spate-lawsuits/story?id=127626071">35 other ongoing lawsuits</a>, including one from only yesterday <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/investigations/cuyahoga-county-family-sues-roblox-says-online-gaming-app-led-to-sexual-exploitation-of-13-year-old-boy">by a family in Cuyaho County</a> following <i>Roblox</i>‘s alleged use in the tragic and too common abuse of their 13-year-old son.</p>

 <p>On Wednesday of this week, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat"><em>Roblox</em> announced</a> it was beginning to roll out a new method of checking player ages before they could access chat, this time using facial recognition to try to restrict players to only talking to others in their age range. Such facial ID checks have become commonplace in the UK following the disastrously poor UK Online Safety Act, by which porn sites and other age-restricted outlets are required to verify users’ ages. This has led to sites like X, Bluesky and Discord also requiring British users to prove their age, usually by showing their face on camera in a measure that entirely thwarts all seven people who haven’t heard of a VPN.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646197" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646197"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646197">© Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>Regarding this rollout, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>‘ Casey Newton spoke to&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> co-founder and CEO David Baszucki about the new plans</a>, and whether they can really help. It doesn’t begin well. When asked about the “scope of the problem” of predators in the application, Baszucki came in shoulders first saying, “We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well.” Ah, the good ol’ opportunities available when your company’s product is rife with pedophilia. He continued, outlining how wonderful it is that young people can build and communicate together, how they have “150 million daily actives, 11 billion hours a month, like what is the best way to keep pushing this forward.” It is the most astonishingly tone-deaf response.</p>

 <p>Newton attempts to get some sensible answers from Baszucki about how the ID checks will work, and why they won’t be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">as easily evaded as so many others</a>, and amidst Baszucki’s corporate waffle he’s told that <em>Roblox</em> is apparently always looking out for “weird signals” and will ask for further age verification should these appear, although he didn’t explain what those signals might be, nor what these further checks would be. But then Newton goes on to ask the painfully necessary question: why has it taken 19 years to even <em>try</em> to stop adults from being able to speak to children?</p>

 <p>Baszucki responds by talking about the evolution of <em>Roblox</em>‘s text filtering tech for inappropriate language and personally identifying information over the last two decades, and how it’s always improving, which is great but clearly not relevant to the question. Newton is having none of it, responding, “Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. When I read these lawsuits and these investigations into the company, it does not seem like predators are having that hard of a time getting around your filters…So I’m curious what’s made you so confident that things are working?” Baszucki’s response is incoherent.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“I don’t want to comment on it. We do see the chat logs of those. And we can see interesting and, many times, ways of people trying to—I’d say, many times people who are fairly sophisticated, and I’m not going to say all of them, many times kids who are over 13, who actually in any other app are not running in a filtered situation, unfortunately, figuring out how to jump to some other platform where they can communicate unfiltered, where they can share images, all of it. It’s one of the primary things we’re doing is trying to keep people on our platform. It’s an interesting industry situation. I would say, we’re not waiting for the rest of the industry. We’re like, we’re always trying to stay ahead of it. On the California age-appropriate design code, for example, we’re like, we are already doing all of that stuff. And the same thing with age estimation: We’re not doing this because of any laws that are coming, we think it’s the right thing to do.”</p></blockquote> <p>Newton very impressively keeps his cool, and rather than pointing out that this answer had nothing to do with the situation, nor indeed how unbelievable it is that the CEO of the company would say “I don’t want to comment on it” when asked why he’s confident in age tech that clearly doesn’t work, he instead points out that the lawsuits are demonstrating that “<em>Roblox</em> is kind of, you know, where predators go to find kids.”</p>

 <p>Things become increasingly tense, as Baszucki tries to claim this is a misrepresentation, and when pressed on whether he truly doesn’t believe&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> has a predator problem replies, “I think we’re doing an incredible job at innovating relative to the number of people on our platform and the hours, in really leaning in to the future of how this is going to work.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000646198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646198"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646198">© Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>What becomes so grimly apparent is that even now, even after a year of extraordinary scrutiny and legal pressure, Baszucki still doesn’t have a grip on the situation at all. To be so ill-prepared for such obvious questions, to have no coherent responses for why the new tech will be effective, and to go so out of his way to appear so uninterested in the subject, is astonishing. As he’s pressed further on the ease with which predators can suggest children speak to them on another platform, Baszucki eventually unravels into literal gibberish:</p> <blockquote><p>“I would actually say that is a very simple red flag. Like, that sounds like text filter many prior generations. So I would say the techniques are much more sophisticated than that. We’re constantly getting better than that and sometimes it’s adversarial. Like, we’re getting into, you know, if we cryptographically were going to try to have an exchange of how to share your Snap handle or whatever handle. We see some of that starting, like things we’ll have to essentially prevent in the future.”</p></blockquote> <p>The CEO seems to believe that the scale of&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> is somehow an excuse to justify its problems, repeatedly coming back to its 150 million users and 11 billion hours a month, as if this explains it all away. But more problematically, as Newton points out that the company wants those numbers to grow, Baszucki immediately switches back to talking about what an amazing financial opportunity this is. Given&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/roblox-150-million-users-into-ad-dollars/"><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>is really struggling to turn those users into money</a>, it reads like he’s only speaking to investors and analysts who are increasingly concerned about&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>‘s lack of profits. So many responses begin with an infuriatingly irrelevant attempt to avoid the question, and then end with words like “And you could imagine&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> at 20-X this scale, having 50 percent of the gaming market space all in a single place.” It’s so crass!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646195"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646195">© The New York Times / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But not nearly as crass as Baszucki’s response to a question over <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">the Hindenburg Research report into the scale of the issue with pedophiles</a>. Hindenburg was an activist short-selling research firm that would investigate companies for fraud, malfeasance and indeed rampant use by predators, until <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/gratitude/">its creator chose to disband the group in January this year</a>. At the time of the report, Baszucki said that it was wrong to claim that&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> had reduced its spend on trust and safety, so Newton asked for specifics.</p> <p>“Fun,” says Baszucki, a man who appears pathologically incapable of reading the room. “Let’s keep going down this. And so, first off, Hindenburg is not longer in existence, correct? So, you should report on that. They went out of business for some reason…” He then demanded to know if Newton had researched the answer for himself, before saying that it’s because they’ve moved so much of the safety regulation onto AI, all while sounding absolutely furious that he was being asked. He then demands that Newton agree that if AI is more effective, it’s better to use it, and when Newton does, Baszucki starts to behave incredibly immaturely. “Good, so you’re aligning with what we did. High-five.” Then when Newton tries to ask a question, he interrupts to say, “Thank you for supporting our <em>Roblox</em> decision matrix<em>.”&nbsp;</em>Then interrupts yet again to say, “I’m so glad you guys are aligned with the way we run&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>. High-five.” Think he’s done? Nope. Yet again he interrupts the question with, “Is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we’re doing and you’re here to stealthily support it?”</p>

 <p>And he doesn’t stop. When co-host Kevin Roose tried to get things back on the rails, Baszucki kept going with the same pathetic line. Challenged on how AI has proved very ineffective for social media companies, he just carries on saying it. The only thing that stopped this tantrum was allowing the CEO to talk about Polymarket, a cryptoscam-based prediction market, letting people place bets on things as ridiculous as awards ceremonies and future weather patterns. Some believe it’s becoming a useful way to predict markets, and that group includes Baszucki who is…and I cannot believe I’m typing this…looking to put it into <em>Roblox</em> so children can gamble.</p> <p>He wants to find a way to do this that’s “legal” and “educational,” at which point the podcast hosts begin openly mocking the stupidity. And then, thank god, they run out of time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="719">In recent years, handheld gaming PCs have become increasingly popular, with devices like the Steam Deck leading the charge. Following its success, models such as the Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally have also gained attention. These portable systems offer the ability to play PC games on the go without the bulk of a laptop. However, despite their appeal, handheld gaming PCs remain focused primarily on gaming, and lacking the versatility needed for everyday tasks. If you’re after a device that can handle both gaming and traditional computer tasks, a gaming laptop is still a better option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Right now, Amazon is offering a great deal on the Alienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop, dropping its price from $1,250 to $900, a savings of $350.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="719">Optimized for Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="721" data-end="1309">The Alienware 16 Aurora is a solid gaming laptop at this discounted price point. It features a 16-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, delivering QHD resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. Its 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare coating make it usable even in harsh lighting conditions, like if the sun is peaking through into the room midday. The screen’s refresh rate peaks at 120Hz, which is great for fast-paced or competitive games. Additionally, the laptop supports. The slim bezels around the display offer more screen space while keeping the overall laptop size manageable.</p>
<p data-start="1311" data-end="1573">As for the keyboard, the Alienware 16 Aurora comes with a full-size layout, including a number pad, which is becoming less common in modern laptops.</p>
<p data-start="1575" data-end="1963">Inside, the Alienware 16 Aurora is powered by an Intel Core 7 240H processor and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 laptop GPU, paired with 16GB of RAM and a 1TBGB PCIe Gen4 SSD. It has two upgradable PCIe Gen 4 SSD slots and two upgradable DDR SO-DIMM memory slots if you want to push the current memory and storage even further. While it might not run every AAA game on ultra settings, it’s a strong performer for the price. Indie titles will run effortlessly, and most larger games should perform well at medium settings, balancing quality and performance.</p>


<p data-start="1965" data-end="2197">Looking along the side of the laptop, we have an array of useful ports. It contains two USB-C ports capable of data transfer, device charging, and can be used to display onto an additional monitor. On that same note, an HDMI 2.1 port is found on the backside as well. There’s also two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports as well as a global headset jack so you can connect a microphone, headphones, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p data-start="2199" data-end="2434" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">At just $900, the Alienware 16 Aurora offers a solid mix of gaming performance and everyday usability. It provides more flexibility than a handheld gaming device, all while maintaining a price that’s hard to beat ahead of Black Friday weekend.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/"> If you want to push your graphical capability even further, a model is offered with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 for a $300 discount. T</a>hat one normally goes for for $1,400, but has come down to just $1,100 in this early Black Friday deal.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders allows you to customize special skins and sell them for in-game currency. One skin has taken it too far, and the already-infamous bikini skin has been rendered unavailable on the Kirby Air Riders Machine Market.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to take a step back and realise what you’re saying and typing. But it’s all true: A controversial customizable bikini skin is no longer obtainable in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-1-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>. The humorous but risqué&nbsp;outfit can no longer be bought, and it’s probably a warning to all players that you need to tread carefully with any sus designs.</p>







<h2 id="h-kirby-air-riders-bikini-skin-is-now-unavailable">Kirby Air Riders Bikini Skin Is Now Unavailable</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Family-friendly entertainment, right? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within 24 hours of the game coming out, users were making eye-opening skins and selling them on the game’s Machine Market. Everything is bought and traded using the game’s currency.</p>



<p>One particular skin went viral very quickly: A design showing Chef Kawasaki wearing a micro-bikini. If you didn’t know, Chef Kawasaki is a regular character in the Kirby universe, and their default getup is usually just some kind of cooking apron.</p>







<p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>: “Chef Kawasaki&nbsp;wearing a micro&nbsp;bikini has been a running&nbsp;joke&nbsp;among&nbsp;a&nbsp;portion&nbsp;of&nbsp;Japanese Kirby fans for quite a few years.&nbsp;The&nbsp;headcanon&nbsp;seems to have resulted from fans looking at Chef Kawasaki’s standard attire –&nbsp;naked&nbsp;save for a single&nbsp;apron&nbsp;– and thinking, ‘Isn’t that kind of lewd?'”</p>



<p>So, once you give players the appropriate tools, they are sure to create inappropriate outfits. Kirby Air Riders’ technology finally allowed the Chef Kawasaki&nbsp;bikini look to happen.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you rinsed your eyes yet? Well, it only took hours for the design to be removed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was fun while it lasted, but this dual-wields as both an action and a warning to Kirby Air Riders players: Think twice before putting Chef Kawasaki—or anyone, for that matter—in a micro-bikini and selling it on the Machine Market.</p>



<p>Have you seen any other bizarre or hilarious outfits in the Kirby Air Riders Machine Market? Feel free to share them through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The name “Disney” has been showing up in quite a lot of gaming-related headlines as of late. As part of its arms race with Netflix, the conglomerate <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-plus-exploring-game-like-features-1236616248/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced plans</a> to add AI-powered user-generated content and “game-like features” to Disney+. Last year, it acquired a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games, adding yet another cash cow to its portfolio. That deal paved the way for Disneyland Game Rush, a Fortnite island released earlier this month to celebrate the theme park’s 70th birthday that features <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-disneyland-game-rush-is-an-incredibly-authentic-first-step-into-fortnite-for-disney-parks">well-received minigames</a> based on Space Mountain, Haunted Mansion, and other iconic rides.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These developments are more than a little surprising, not least because it’s been close to a decade since Disney pulled the plug on its own, in-house gaming initiatives. Disney Interactive Studios, lovingly remembered for its work with Square on Kingdom Hearts and that 1989 NES DuckTales platformer that inspired the bounce mechanic in Shovel Knight, closed down in 2016 following the cancellation of its flagship project, Disney Infinity. Asked why, Bob Iger – who was then nearing the end of his first stint as CEO – <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/gaming/how-disney-conquered-the-game-industry-by-giving-up-on-video-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told shareholders</a> that while the company was great at making movies and building theme parks, they weren’t nearly as skilled at designing games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others would beg to differ. While it’s true that Disney has never managed to compete with Nintendo, Ubisoft, or Electronic Arts, its influence on games as a medium might well be greater than all of these three companies combined. To understand how the company was able to leave a mark on the one part of the entertainment industry it couldn’t conquer, you need to go where Fortnite has gone: to Disneyland.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/disneyland-game-rush-screenshot-1763557173743.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Disneyland Game Rush replicates elements of the famous theme park in Fortnite.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When Don Carson quit his job as a senior designer at Walt Disney Imagineering – the research and development group in charge of creating new rides for Disney’s theme parks – he filled up some of his spare time playing video games. To his surprise, his new hobby heavily reminded him of his old job, so heavily that he felt compelled to write a long and – in due time – widely-read <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/environmental-storytelling-creating-immersive-3d-worlds-using-lessons-learned-from-the-theme-park-industry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article for Game Developer</a> (formerly Gamasutra) about what people working in one industry could learn from those working in the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Carson’s article was originally published in 2000, when 3D games like Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake III Arena were all the rage and the industry found itself on the cusp of a revolution. “The ability to create virtual worlds is relatively new to us,” reads one particularly nostalgic line. “With the growing popularity of multiplayer games and the promise of higher band widths, I relish the day I can meet friends and explore these worlds together.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its age, the article’s central argument – that gaming and themed entertainment “are not that far apart” – still rings true today, perhaps even more so than it did 25 years ago. Sure enough, the two have more in common than you’d think. Both can be described as immersive experiences where people move through a carefully constructed space that responds to their presence. More importantly, both are born from the same design philosophy – one Carson boils down to the following question: “How do I draw my audience into my imagined world and make them want to stay?” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How do I draw my audience into my imagined world and make them want to stay?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All too often, the answers point to the original Disneyland. Prior to its opening in 1955, most theme parks were disappointingly light on theming. As one the world’s leading providers of escapism, Walt Disney did not merely want to distract guests with thrills and frights – he wanted to transport them to a different reality. To sell this fantasy, Disneyland turned its ride vehicles into boats, spaceships, and teacups, covered up tracks and scaffolding, and made sure that each of its major attractions told a story that incorporated the rider. When you get on the Cyclone at Coney Island, you are you, riding the Cyclone at Coney Island. Not so in Disneyland. On the Jungle Cruise, you’re a tourist exploring the tropics. On Peter Pan’s Flight, you’re placed in the shoes of its titular character, soaring over London and Neverland. The list goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games have traveled down a similar road, enhancing raw experience with increasingly immersive theming. While some of the first-ever arcade games – think Pong and Pacman – took place in geometric voids, subsequent titles mapped their gameplay loops onto more clearly defined locations and situations, from Donkey Kong’s construction site to the roads and rivers of Frogger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This transition repeated itself when gaming veered into the third dimension. While large parts of Super Mario 64 played out in liminal spaces, levels in Super Mario Sunshine – released 6 years later, in 2002 – are all part of a single, interconnected, fully realized setting: Delfino Island. Echoing Disneyland’s ride design (Tokyo Disneyland, featuring many of the same attractions found in LA, opened in 1983,) Sunshine not only fleshes out the environments, but also serves up a more ambitious narrative. No more saving Princess Peach from Bowser because game. This time, Mario is going vacation, is framed for a crime, and has to clear his name to earn back his freedom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/er-1716302309226.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Elden Ring's Erdtree acts as a "weenie," a sort of architectural lure concepted by Walt Disney for his parks.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disneyland’s influence on games is most evident when it comes to level design. To help guests find their way around the park – and encourage exploration on their own terms – Walt Disney envisioned a hub-and-spoke layout, with various lands connected to a central vocal point: Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. As mentioned in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0mKCWboi6Q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Developers Conference (GDC) talk</a> from 2022 – which covers the same ground as Carson’s article – Uncle Walt famously referred to the castle and other tall structures scattered throughout the park as “weenies,” because they lured guests from one area to another in the same way that he himself used hot dog wieners to lure his poodle around the house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re familiar with Mark Brown’s popular YouTube channel Game Maker’s Toolkit, you may know that weenies have <a href="https://gmtk.substack.com/p/the-world-design-of-banjo-kazooie" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked their way into the language of video game design</a> as well. They’re especially common in the open-world genre, where they help players orient themselves and guide them towards worthwhile content scattered throughout the sprawling sandbox environment. In this sense, structures like the Erdtree and Minor Erdtrees in Elden Ring function as the digital equivalent of Mount Kilimanjaro in Animal Kingdom or Spaceship Earth in EPCOT. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are filled with various types of weenies, from shrines and Sheikah Towers to the Divine Beasts and – of course – Hyrule Castle itself. One game that particularly resembles Disneyland in outline is 2018’s God of War, where Midgard’s centrally located <a href="https://mapgenie.io/god-of-war-2018/maps/midgard" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake of Nine</a> (complete with a Jörmungandr-weenie) opens up into several branching paths, some leading to other realms.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Walt Disney envisioned a hub-and-spoke layout, with various lands connected to a central vocal point. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These similarities do not imply that developing a game is functionally identical to designing a ride or an entire theme park. On the contrary, each industry works under unique constraints and pressures. Ideas for new attractions have to consider things like safety and carrying capacity. Short ride times, large vehicles, and efficient loading areas keep wait times low and guest experience positive. Another important distinction concerns user experience. While games can be enjoyed in isolation, theme park rides are made for large groups. Unlike with games, where no two play-throughs are exactly alike, most attractions offer a near-identical experience to every rider, every time they ride. Customization and personalization, standard features in games, are largely unattainable in attractions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while some of the details are different, the big picture is anything but. Whether you work at Universal Studios or Sony Santa Monica, your day-to-day job will see you navigating the same challenge: meeting economic and logistical demands without compromising the immersive quality of the final product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rarely does this balancing act succeed without something breaking. When Disneyland opened, it quickly became clear that the quaint, narrow streets of its opening area – a traditional American town loosely based on Walt Disney’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SDSYoEgkN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">birthplace</a> of Marceline, Missouri – had to be widened in order to accommodate the large summertime crowds: an imperative that completely went against Disney’s original vision. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Likewise, Carson – who after his Imagineering days ended up going into game development himself – recalls a time when he’d sunk weeks into programming realistic-looking flames for an Indiana Jones-style game, only for his colleagues to ramp up their flickering animations to unrealistic speeds. “When I complained,” he writes, “the programmer proudly argued (…) that ‘gamers’ should appreciate the visual effect of a high frame rate over the realism of my environments.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/godofwarloadingscreen-1763557674611.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The use of sliding through gaps to disguise loading screens echoes the efforts made by Disney to camouflage the mechanisms that lift and move its magical rides.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the video game industry’s indebtedness to Disneyland’s theme park design was already evident during the arcade era, this relationship has only deepened over time. Already in the late ‘90s, Carson observed that “we can visit and explore worlds on our computer screens that are increasingly dramatic and realistic” – so dramatic and realistic that he had on more than one occasion “been blown to bits because I dared hesitate to admire a beautiful piece of virtual architecture.” Just as Disneyland made it all but necessary for theme parks to conceal the machinery of their own attractions behind mock-up space stations and plywood mountains, so too did the gaming industry arrive at a point where we expect developers to cover up the artificiality of their games by means of organic level design, invisible walls, and hidden loading screens. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games also bear a closer resemblance to theme park rides in that playing them has become an increasingly social experience. That moment Carson dreamt about, when you could meet friends and explore digital worlds as you would the real one, didn’t take long to arrive. Within just a few years, online play – from browser games like Habbo Hotel to multi-player shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield – had become the backbone of the industry, paving the way for our current live service era. At present, even purely single-player experiences are plugged into <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/elden-ring-fromsoftware-youtube-community.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">globe-spanning networks</a> thanks to vibrant fan communities on Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after decades of theme parks influencing games, the relationship appears to be reversing. While the gaming industry continues to boom, the world of themed entertainment is <a href="https://licensinginternational.org/news/theme-parks-focus-on-brands-as-attendance-spending-declines/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently struggling</a> due to mounting costs and decreased attendance. To stay with the times, ride designers are increasingly working with and learning from game developers. From Los Angeles and Florida to Paris and Tokyo, more and more theme parks are adding digital, interactive, AI-assisted elements to their attractions, blending the distinction between rides and games. Smuggler’s Run, the Millenium Falcon simulator at Disney’s Galaxy’s Edge park, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-unreal-engine-is-changing-star-wars-theme-parks-and-the-future-of-movies">is built in Unreal Engine and its next iteration will feature branching pathways to allow player choice</a>. Then there’s the various Mario Kart attractions at Super Nintendo World, where riders wear augmented reality headgear that project virtual elements onto the physical ride itself, or Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure at Disney California Adventure, which uses motion tracking technology to allow riders to shoot their own webs. Before long, we might just see Fortnite show up inside Disneyland, rather than the other way around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players got their first glimpse at something never seen in the game before: nipples. Specifically, Homer Simpsons' nipples. And big ones too, at that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, an upcoming Fortnite model will feature a giant-sized version of Homer wearing just his underpants, with everything else (including his nipples) on show. Why is this such a big deal to Fortnite's faithful? Well, it's because the game has refused to depict any kind of areola previously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While never publicly stated, Fortnite developer Epic Games has seemingly mandated that its battle royale should be nipple-less. The apparent rule was first <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/g7l286/what_happened_to_his_nipples/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> among fans all the way back in 2019, when the game's high-profile Travis Scott concert (and his purchasable in-game skin) both showed the rapper with a smooth, nip-free chest.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/21/g6hmwfrxiaasi2z-1763730828221.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Homer Simpsons' nipples.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, numerous Fortnite-original characters and a whole parade of other famous figures have appeared in the game shirtless, but also nipple-less. A non-exhaustive list includes God of War's Kratos, Avatar: The Last Airbender's Aang, WWE's John Cena, Dragonball Z's Goku, and Marvel superheroes such as Drax and The Hulk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has often asked Epic Games if it would like to comment on the lack of nipples in Fortnite, but has never received an official, on-the-record response. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, we've noted that Fortnite's nipple-free decree also extends to Fortnite's third-party modes. Earlier this year, Philips launched Body Royale, a promotional mode designed to highlight its latest OneBlade shaver. On Philips' website, photos for the product depict its use across all types of body hair, by male models who definitely have nipples in real life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But within Fortnite, in Body Royale, the action plays out against the backdrop of an in-game model who is distinctly nipple-less. Did Philips have to remove the nipples at Epic Games' request, in order to get this experience in the game? (Philips has also not responded to IGN's requests for comment.)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/21/image-1763730876933.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Philips OneBlade's promotional Fortnite mode, Body Royale.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Homer Simpson looks set to change all of that. But why? Is there something about Homer's design that allows his nipples — nothing more than a pair of black dots — on his animated body? It seems unlikely — other cel-shaded characters have still been nipple-less before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does The Simpsons come with its own set of brand rules that require nipples and supercede Epic Games' own? Or perhaps there's something specific here about the fact that nearly-naked Homer's in-game appearance has to match up with the same design shown in The Simpsons' accompanying Fortnite crossover Disney+ shorts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alternatively, fans say, this could all point to something of a wider policy change within Epic Games. As Fortnite shifts to its new Chapter Seven era and collaborates with Quentin Tarantino, perhaps now is the time to ease this particular restriction. After nipples, what's next? If Epic Games ever acknowledges this, we'll let you know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<h2><strong>Rockstar's rationale for delaying GTA 6</strong></h2><p>In early November, Rockstar announced that GTA 6 was being delayed by 5 months and 24 days, from May 26 to November 19. But why did Rockstar make the decision to delay the game once again? The company said it came down to quality. "These extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," the studio said.</p><p>"We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait," the team added.</p><p>Rockstar is owned by Take-Two, and the company's CEO Strauss Zelnick said Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">"seeking perfection"</a> with GTA 6--and that takes time.</p><p>"When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened."</p><p>Zelnick said the company feels "really good" about the new November 2026 release date, and many have focused on this quote because it's exactly what Zelnick said--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">down to the same "really good" line</a>--when GTA 6 was pushed from Fall 2025 to May 2026.</p><p>For Zelnick, part of the reason he still feels "really good" about GTA 6's November 2026 release date is because it falls within the same fiscal year for Take-Two, thus allowing Take-Two to maintain its fiscal projections and keep investors satisfied. He's also excited by the fact that GTA 6 will release during the holiday season. "It happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 launching during the busy holiday shopping season may be a boon for the game's sales, but Zelnick said previously that the game's release date within the calendar year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">doesn't matter much </a>because of the incredible amount of pent-up demand for it. In short, Zelnick believes people will buy GTA 6 no matter when it's released, and no one is questioning that logic.</p><h2><strong>"Seeking perfection"</strong></h2><p>One of the lines that Zelnick has repeated over and over is how Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-aiming-for-perfection-take-two-says/1100-6520948/" data-ref-id="1100-6520948">"seeking perfection"</a> with GTA 6, and this can be a slow process. "When we feel we've optimized creatively, that's the time to release," he said.</p><p>"There's inherent tension, potentially, between getting something to market and creating perfection," Zelnick added. "But this company errs on the side of perfection."</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2POQ_toFtgc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, Zelnick said, "What Rockstar Games puts into all of their titles is a desire for creative perfection, which is why it takes a long time and why it's complex. We don't claim success until it occurs."</p><p>Zelnick's comments may make your eyes roll due to the corporate speak, but the executive is speaking from a position of strength--after all, GTA 5 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 220 million copies</a> and is among the best-selling games ever. Another Rockstar franchise overseen by Zelnick, Red Dead Redemption, is a sales juggernaut as well, with the sequel alone selling some 79 million copies.</p><h2><strong>GTA 6 was not delayed due to Rockstar union controversy</strong></h2><p>Rockstar recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">fired 30-40 workers</a> in Scotland and Canada for what it called "gross misconduct" reportedly related to leaking secrets, not for trying to form a union. A UK union pushed back, saying Rockstar is blatantly and ruthlessly trying to block a union.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">More than 200 Rockstar workers</a> signed a letter demanding that the fired staffers be reinstated. UK lawmakers have <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-6-developers-continue-protesting-and-speak-on-scandal/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">raised concerns about the Rockstar situation</a> in proceedings recently. While this is all going on, reporter Jason Schreier of Bloomberg said these events are unrelated to GTA 6's latest delay to November 2026.</p><p>"This delay was not due to the firings... While the fallout from those firings could certainly have a long-term impact on the project and lead to more missed deadlines in the future--due to those vacant roles, protracted legal battles, morale loss, etc.--the game did not slip 6 months because 34 people were fired a week ago," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1oqjoiz/jason_schreier_confirms_that_todays_gta_6_delay/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he wrote.</a></p><h2>Rockstar rarely launches games on time</h2><p>Rockstar has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">long history of announcing release dates and then missing them</a>, so it was no surprise that GTA 6 was the latest example of this trend.</p><p>The majority of Rockstar's biggest games over the past decade-plus have all been delayed beyond their originally announced release windows, including Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption, Grand Theft Auto V, and Red Dead Redemption II. In all of these cases, Rockstar maintained that the decision to delay came down to choosing to focus on quality instead of rushing to market, and Rockstar has said the same thing about GTA 6 for each of its two delays so far.</p><p>Here is a brief history of Rockstar's delays for its big games:</p><ul><li><strong>GTA 4</strong> -- Was set to launch in October 2007 before being delayed to April 2008.</li><li><strong>GTA: Chinatown Wars</strong> -- Was set to release before the end of January 2009 before moving to April 2009.</li><li><strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong> -- Was lined up to release at the end of April 2010 before shifting to May 2010.</li><li><strong>GTA 5</strong> -- Was originally scheduled for Spring 2013 before being delayed to September 2013.</li><li><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> -- Was supposed to launch in 2017 before moving to Spring 2018 and then again to Fall 2018.</li><li><strong>GTA 5's PS5/Xbox Series X|S ports</strong> -- These new versions of GTA 5 were lined up to launch in November 2021 before being delayed to March 2022.</li></ul><h2><strong>How big will GTA 6's release be?</strong></h2><p>Everyone assumes GTA 6 will be a gigantic success upon release. One analyst has predicted the game will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and drive more than $3 billion in revenue in its first year</a>. Back in 2013, GTA 5 needed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-v-sales-reach-1-billion-in-three-days/1100-6414762/" data-ref-id="1100-6414762">just three days to clear $1 billion in revenue</a>, and the game only grew from there.</p><p>While GTA 6 is expected to be a huge hit, people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">"naive"</a> to think one big release like this will help the video game industry overall rebound from its core issues today, according to one analyst.</p><p>Joost van Dreunen <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-how-does-this-impact-the-rest-of-the-industry" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN </a>that people should not look to GTA 6 to help address the wider, more systemic issues impacting the video game business. Van Dreunen concurs that GTA 6 will be a massive launch, but said people are overly optimistic if they think GTA 6 is a magic bullet.</p><p>"After the high comes the hangover," he said. "I realize that many in the industry are looking forward to this undoubtedly pivotal moment. There's even a somewhat naive expectation that this one release will reverse the industry's current direction. It won't."</p><p>When GTA 6 comes out, gamers and investors alike will "enjoy their respective highs," but the painful comedown may come next.</p><p>"I expect a period of sobriety to follow. In the absence of any similar releases in the near future especially investors are likely to redeploy their capital elsewhere, thereby lowering the industry's overall valuation," he said.</p><p>The video game industry has faced cuts and setbacks in recent years, including a spate of mass layoffs, price increases, and numerous game cancellations.</p><p>People like former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">saying time and again that the AAA scene is unsustainable.</a> In 2012, Assassin's Creed III director Alex Hutchinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pursuit-of-aaa-is-a-cancerous-growth-ac3-dev/1100-6365381/" data-ref-id="1100-6365381">the pursuit of AAA games represents a "cancerous growth." </a>Because of this, Hutchinson said he expects AAA games to die out. "I think that will leave the AAA blockbusters as nothing more than the last of the dinosaurs," he said.</p><h2><strong>What do we know about GTA 6?</strong></h2><p>Back in early 2022, Rockstar gave the first official statement about GTA 6, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-development-is-well-underway-rockstar-confirms/1100-6500325/" data-ref-id="1100-6500325">work was "well underway" on the game.</a> "With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to significantly move beyond what we have previously delivered--and we are pleased to confirm that active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well underway," the developer said at the time.</p><p>The first trailer for GTA 6 came in December 2023, following a leak. The spectacular trailer, which used Tom Petty's "Love Is A Long Road," introduced fans to the game's setting of Vice City (the same setting as 2002's GTA: Vice City) and the wider state of Leonida, a stand-in for Florida. The trailer also provided the first look at the game's main characters, the lovers Jason and Lucia.</p><p>A second trailer was released in May 2025 to coincide with the delay from Fall 2025. This trailer impressed fans, too, showing off the game's vibrant world full of colorful characters. A <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website for GTA 6 went live</a> at this time, too, providing a ton of information on the game's characters and setting.</p><p>Everyone is waiting for a third trailer, but as of yet, Rockstar has not released one or provided any word on when it could come. Beyond the game itself, a major discussion point around GTA 6 has been what its price will be. There has been ongoing chatter and debate about if Rockstar and Take-Two will follow Nintendo's Mario Kart World playbook and raise the price to $80, or possibly more. That remains to be seen, and there are some who believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">a higher price point might not actually be a good thing. </a></p><p>As always, keep checking back with GameSpot for more on GTA 6.</p>
