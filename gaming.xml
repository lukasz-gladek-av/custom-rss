<p>The true testament to an ARPG’s longevity is always in the endgame. While the campaign is an excellent appetizer, it’s often only meant to introduce the world, mechanics, and gameplay to new players. Once you complete the story mode, the game opens up. Thankfully, you don’t have to fret because Path of Exile 2 endgame activities offer hundreds of hours of playtime. It’s a lot to take in!</p>



<h2 id="h-exploring-the-endgame-in-path-of-exile-2">Exploring the Endgame in Path of Exile 2</h2>



<p>Once you finish the multi-act campaign in Path of Exile 2, the game opens up with various endgame activities. You can explore unique biomes, uncover robust crafting mechanics, challenge optional bosses, and run mysterious dungeons with varying difficulty levels, challenges, and rewards. </p>

<p>The game’s endgame includes Trial of the Sekhemas, The Trial of Chaos, Breach, Expedition, Ritual, Delirium, and the Pinnacle Threats.</p>



<h3 id="h-trial-of-the-sekhemas">Trial of the Sekhemas</h3>



<p>If you intend to evolve your class with one of the many available Ascendencies, you must run The Trial of Sekhemas—a challenging gauntlet that tests your resolve. It features rogue-like mechanics, with every room posing a unique trial, and every floor offers a potent boss fight at the end. The rewards will help you push to new heights, though.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-trial-of-chaos">The Trial of Chaos</h3>



<p>Throughout the Vaal Jungle, you’ll uncover the Temple of Chaos, another test that allows you to unlock class Ascendencies. To gain access, you require a token from the Trialmaster. From there, every room within the ordeal poses a hazard to your health, and you can go double or nothing on rewards.</p>



<h3 id="h-breach">Breach</h3>



<p>An endgame Breach is a portal from another dimension in which demons and monsters await. Upon entering a Breach, you will bridge the worlds and enter the opposing realm, slaying demons to keep the Breach open while unlocking XP and rewards for killing mobs.</p>



<h3 id="h-expedition">Expedition</h3>



<p>Expeditions task you with uncovering rare artifacts dug up using explosives. But the site isn’t clear of enemies, which means you’ll utilize your class abilities to punish corpses and put down monsters before reclaiming artifacts from the area. The more you uncover, the more mobs you draw to the dig site. </p>







<h3 id="h-ritual">Ritual</h3>



<p>Scattered across Wraeclast, you’ll discover Ritual Altars built by the King in the Mists. These altars require a tribute in the form of monster kills, which feed the ritual site and resurrect the King in the Mists’ dark forces. You’ll squash everything in sight for mighty rewards.</p>



<h3 id="h-delirium">Delirium</h3>



<p>Endgame maps in Path of Exile 2 may occasionally succumb to Delirium, in which a mysterious entity reworks the zone, creating a nightmarish landscape. The longer you remain in the Delirium, the greater the rewards, but the more powerful the enemies you face with every passing minute.</p>



<h3 id="h-pinnacle-threats">Pinnacle Threats</h3>



<p>As you explore the various areas in PoE2, you’ll encounter a Fortress of flame and ash, with a maze full of mystery, danger, and potential rewards. If you’re willing to venture into Pinnacle Threats, you’ll be rewarded for your efforts, but the challenge is not without perils that could end your adventure.</p>

<p>As if things couldn’t get more interesting for Ubisoft, the company now finds itself with a lawsuit on its hands. Unions at Ubisoft Barcelona have sued the French publisher over its recent return to office mandates.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-ubisoft-barcelona-unions-file-lawsuit-against-return-to-office-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> (GIBiz), the unions — for both AAA and mobile teams —  are demanding Ubisoft ensure protections for remote work and walk back the recent policy changes. </p>







<p>The changes that were announced back in September mandated that all Ubisoft employees work in office <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-mandating-3-days-in-office-for-all-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least three days per week</a>. At the time, Ubisoft said these changes were being done to “enhance creativity and teamwork”. Under the old remote work policy, employees were able to chose up to 60% of days to be worked remotely. On top of that, there were also fully-remote workers on staff. The new mandate was to be followed by all employees, even t hose with prior full-time remote agreements.</p>



<p>According to the unions via GIBiz, the change by Ubisoft was done “suddenly and without transparency”. It would also “create logistical problems as offices aren’t prepared to accommodate all remote workers at once.”</p>



<p>It was added that both parties were ready for negotiations. However, Ubisoft management hadn’t submitted a proposal before the lawsuit was filed on October 14.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has yet to comment on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft being sued by union employees over their return to office mandate? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

                <p>Deep Rock Galactic is getting a roguelite spin-off called Rogue Core, planned for early-access release in 2025. Watch the pre-alpha gameplay teaser below.</p><p>Rogue Core is based on the same structure as Deep Rock Galactic. It still takes place on the hostile but resource-rich planet of Hoxxes IV. You can still play with up to four players in co-op. You still play as gun-toting dwarves delving into the deep places of the earth. However, instead of working miners, you'll play as the more militaristic Reclaimers, sent to investigate the abandoned deep mines close to the planet's core.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core - Pre-Alpha Gameplay Teaser</p>
      </div>
<p>These deep mines were excavating Expenite, a rare mineral found only close to Hoxxes IV's heart. Unlike Deep Rock Galactic, you won't start a run fully equipped. Instead you'll use Expenite to upgrade your Reclaimer's weapons and equipment. If you are playing with friends, this becomes a "draft" where all players pick from the same set of options. What one player takes will be blocked off from another, so you'll have to strategize with your crew to maximize each upgrade's impact. You can also loot improvements from special rooms or by completing difficult challenges. In the final game there will be five (or more classes), but only two have been announced: the sword-toting Slicer and the drone-handling Falconeer. Rogue Core will also feature permanent progress between runs and spaceship hub called the RV-09 Ramrod.</p><p>As for the game's environment, the trailer shows off deep-sea floors with shifting stone walls, abandoned caverns flush with mining equipment, and the hostile, barren rock of the core itself. The closer you get to the center of the planet, and finishing your run, the more the game's biomes will resemble the hostility of the core. Rogue Core has new and returning enemies, including boss battles.</p><p>According to a blog post and developer Q&amp;A on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2605790/view/4482865501645572470" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Rogue Core started as an expansion to the base game, but it developed its own identity. Developer Ghost Ship Games also wished to put Rogue Core in early access, which it couldn't do if it were DLC. The game is currently in pre-alpha and Ghost Ship plans to release it in early access sometime in 2025.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Chapter 6 is less than a week away, and the leaks have begun. 
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, a Godzilla collaboration was teased by multiple reliable Fortnite leakers, including <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859974115387711651">ShiinaBR</a>, which fitted with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-map-features-japanese-theme-leaks-suggest">repeated leaks that the game's sixth Island map would feature a Japanese theme</a>.  
</p>
<p>
Now, purported artwork for Fortnite's Chapter 6 battle pass has popped up online - and Godzilla is included. The artwork appears to confirm Fortnite's upcoming Japanese theming, and also includes Baymax from Disney and Marvel's Big Hero 6.

<p>
It seems likely we're seeing the skins set to become available in the Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass, which also include samurai sword-toting warriors and another cat person.
</p>
<p>
Other recent leaks suggest upcoming collaborations with Demon Slayer and Disney's Avatar are also due to arrive in Fortnite soon. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's all-new Chapter 6 is set to kick off this weekend, following a finale concert event for the game's current Chapter 2 Remix that's set to feature Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Juice WRLD and Ice Spice. The event will debut music from self-proclaimed Fortnite fan Juice WRLD, set to be included on the late star's new posthumously-released album. Anyone loading into Fortnite over the next few days will also be granted a Juice WRLD skin and other items free.
</p><p>
Still, all of that feels like it's been overshadowed slightly by the announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG - the return of the game's fan-favourite original map as a new permanent mode</a>. That arrives a week after Chapter 6's debut this weekend, next Friday 6th December.
</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">Fortnite developer Epic Games revealed another battle pass would be offered for Fortnite OG</a>, meaning the game will now feature four available at any one time for the game's main battle royale, OG, music and Lego modes. All of these will now be wrapped into the Fortnite Crew subscription, however, which will retain it's current pricetag.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whatever the reason, it helped Scott pick him over more established stars like Timothée Chalamet and Miles Teller. Since the feature explains how Paramount co-presidents of film Daria Cercek and Michael Ireland watched Mescal star as Stanley Kowalski in the 2022 revival of <em>A Streetcar Named Desire </em>in London before making their decision, that means Scott chose Mescal after Chalamet won a brutal knife fight as Paul Atreides in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-valya-harkonnen-the-voice-1851706532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-valya-harkonnen-the-voice-1851706532"><em>Dune</em></a></span> and Teller competed in a shirtless football game as Lt. Bradley ‘Rooster’ Bradshaw in <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>.</p><p>“Any studio would always prefer to have a known star,” <em>Gladiator II </em>producer Doug Wick says. However, he also later admitted, “no other actor came close.”</p><p>Mescal proved to be a fit for the physically demanding role which involved dealing with “borderline heat stroke from time to time” according to the star, who worked under sweltering conditions in Morocco and Malta where the film was shot. Risking his health paid off, as <em>Gladiator II’</em>s<em>&nbsp;</em>$106 million <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/11/24/wicked-gladiator-ii-box-office-record-numbers/76554624007/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/11/24/wicked-gladiator-ii-box-office-record-numbers/76554624007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening weekend box office</a></span> should be enough for any studio to greenlight a second sequel.

<p>PlayStation is set to release black variants of three premium accessories: the DualSense Edge, the Pulse Elite, and the Pulse Explore, according to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ces-accessoires-ps5-sortiront-bientot-dans-un-tout-nouveau-coloris-59696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>.</p>



<p>At the moment, these accessories are only available in standard white, with the exception of the DualSense Edge, which has received a 30th anniversary version.</p>



<p>As well as revealing that Sony is working on these new variants, billbil-kun went further, revealing the price of each of the products:</p>



<ul>
<li>DualSense Edge wireless controller – Black: €239.99 / £209.99 / US$199.99.</li>



<li>Pulse Elite wireless headphones – Black: €149.99 / £129.99 / US$149.99.</li>



<li>Pulse Explore wireless headphones – Black: €219.99 / £199.99  / US$199.99.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-the-announcement-may-happen">When the announcement may happen?</h2>



<p>PlayStation’s 30th anniversary will be on December 3rd, so there’s no better time to announce these new versions.</p>



<p>If they follow the pattern, the announcement should be made on the PS Blog followed by posts on social media.</p>



<p>Of course, fans aren’t waiting for an announcement of new accessory colors. The community has long been demanding an event with the next PS5 exclusives. With The Game Awards approaching, maybe PlayStation will surprise everyone there.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/troy-baker-to-return-in-naughty-dogs-new-untitled-game-neil-druckmann-at-helm/</link>

			<p>Troy Baker is a staple voice actor in the gaming sphere, and it's no surprise that he'll be making a return to Naughty Dog's new untitled game. For this title, Neil Druckmann will be at the helm, the mind behind The Last of Us and Uncharted. At the moment, there is no real information about the project, but <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GQ has confirmed</a> that Troy Baker has signed on to appear in the title in some capacity. It's not stated whether he'll be playing a big or small role, but it's positive that his voice will be recognized by many who dig into the upcoming project.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog has had a little bit of a difficult time, as they decided to cancel The Last of Us Online in December last year. This was an attempt to create a live service version of the beloved franchise, especially after the first season of the TV show did so well. The Last of Us did have multiplayer game modes before, where you could face off against other factions in combat. While they were trying to make The Last of Us Online, they said that they had to pull it as the studio would have had to funnel all of its resources into post-launch content for many years to come. By doing this, it would have heavily impacted any single-player games that they would be producing.</p>
<p>When The Last of Us Online was shut down, Naughty Dog confirmed that there was an ambitious single-player game in the works, but there have been no details released about the game since that announcement.</p>
<p>While there are minimal details about the upcoming Naughty Dog project, Druckmann has stated that he wants to breakaway from being known as the studio behind The Last of Us, and wants recognition for other projects. "I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us Studio forever," said Druckmann in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-as-it-works-on-multiple-single-player-projects-neil-druckmann-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with IGN</a> in June.</p>
<p>Whether we will see any details emerge about this project in the near future remains to be seen. However, you'll be able to spot Troy Baker on the screen again soon as he is set to play Indiana Jones in MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you want to read our thoughts on that upcoming title, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/">the preview I did here</a>.</p>

Many are the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> games that involve you going down. Down is where much of the Badness in the world is traditionally located, after all, whether you're talking about geology or psychology or theology. White Knuckle reverses the flow. You are already Down; by extrapolation, you must now go Up.</p>
<p>Possibly, you are Down because you are a manifestation of the aforementioned Badness. Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes. It doesn't really matter, because you don't have a choice. There is a wall of unspeakable flesh coming up the tunnel behind you. To avoid becoming part of it, you must climb.

"White Knuckle is a first person speed climbing game," explains the Steam page. "Ascend through the guts of SUB-STRUCTURE 17 using precision movement mechanics. Sharp reflexes and resource management will take you to the highest peaks under ten thousand meters of concrete and decay."</p><p>The game's industrial catacomb environment features several distinct areas, including "the deep dry storage of the Silos", "the putrid sewers of the Pipeworks", and "the haunted piers of Habitation". All seem to mostly consist of giddy climbing puzzles, with each of your character's hands mapped to its own button or trigger, but there's also the opportunity to pit rusty drills and makeshift spears against creatures that probably shouldn't be examined closely.
</p>
<p>
If you find this appealing, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3195790/White_Knuckle/">a demo on Steam</a>.  Developers Dark Machine games have been thrilled by the response to the demo. "We didn't expect this," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3195790/view/4464849915256766687?l=english">reads a post from earlier in the month</a>. "I didn't expect this. It was a game that the three of us were working on in our evenings and weekends in our free time after work for fun, and thought that maybe a few people would enjoy for thirty minutes before moving on, but that is not what has happened and I'm still processing it all. It's been a whirlwind, in the best possible way."</p>
<p>D'aww, that's downright wholesome for a game about crawling out of giant metal intestine. The full game doesn't have a release date yet.

He lost his advisory role at the game studio he co-founded, was cut loose from various sponsorships, and was eventually demonetized on YouTube. The platform did not respond to a request for comment about whether that decision would ever be reversed in the future. </p><p>In his first YouTube livestream back after acknowledging the allegations, Beahm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-youtube-livestream-twitch-ban-sexting-1851642418?_gl=1*9q0xun*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjU1MTA0MS4xLjEuMTczMjU1NDM3Mi42MC4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-youtube-livestream-twitch-ban-sexting-1851642418?_gl=1*9q0xun*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjU1MTA0MS4xLjEuMTczMjU1NDM3Mi42MC4wLjA.">ranted about how everything</a></span> that had befallen him was part of a conspiracy by his enemies to defame his reputation and undermine his success. “Rumble is in a new era, and I’m laser-focused on expanding into two categories: gaming and crypto,”  Pavlovski said on Monday. “Dr Disrespect will give a much-needed injection into our gaming category.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/sony-is-reportedly-working-on-a-ps5-portable/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch">Bloomberg reports</a> that Sony is "in the early stages" of work on a fully portable console that can play PlayStation 5 software. The device is still "likely years away from launch," according to "people familiar with its development" that spoke to Bloomberg anonymously.</p>
<p>The report comes less than a year after the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">the PlayStation Portal</a>, a Sony portable device designed to stream PS5 games running on a console on the same local network. Recently, Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">updated the Portal firmware</a> to let PlayStation Plus subscribers also stream PS5 games from Sony's centralized servers at up to 1080p and 60 fps.</p>
<p>Sony's reported PS5 portable plans also come after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">months of rumors</a> that Microsoft has also been working on a new Xbox console with a portable form factor. In June, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer added fuel to those rumors by directly saying, "I think we should have a handheld, too... I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck... I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p>
<p>Nintendo's follow-up to the Switch, which will be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">formally announced in the next few months</a>, is also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/controller-maker-says-switch-2-will-be-backward-compatible-with-all-switch-games/">widely expected</a> to mimic the hybrid portable/console design of Nintendo's last console.</p>
<p>Sony first dipped its toes in the portable gaming arena with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/02/4619-2/">2005's PlayStation Portable</a>, which is still the only major handheld console to make use of optical discs (in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/05/4916-2/">Sony's own proprietary UMD format</a>). Sony followed that up with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/a-new-standard-in-design-in-depth-with-the-playstation-vita/">2012's PlayStation Vita</a>, a well-loved console that brought a full analog stick and a larger high-resolution screen to the portable console space. But both efforts struggled to find much market success compared to the sales juggernauts of Nintendo's cheaper <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/a-fond-farewell-to-the-weird-and-wonderful-nintendo-ds/">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/the-end-of-the-3ds-marks-an-inflection-point-for-portable-gaming/">3DS</a> hardware lines.</p>

                <p>The Xbox Avatar Editor, first introduced during the Xbox One era, will shut down on January 9, 2025, Microsoft has announced. However, Xbox 360 Avatars will stick around.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft announced the news via a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/xbox-avatar-editor-app-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support page</a>, stating players will no longer be able to use or access the Xbox Avatar Editor come the beginning of next year. Those who made any purchases for their avatar in the last year (since November 1, 2023), will automatically be refunded for those purchases. Those who use their avatar for their Xbox Gamerpic will continue to be able to do so, but will be unable to update it via the Xbox Avatar Editor come January 9.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the reason behind the shutdown, Microsoft said it is due to "low engagement" and the company's "shift in focus to delivering other player experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">The good news is that Xbox 360 Avatars (or Xbox Original Avatars, as they are officially called now) will still be accessible. These avatars were first introduced in 2008 for the Xbox 360 before being carried forward to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S and are actually used for some Xbox 360 games--mostly Xbox Live Arcade titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/1-vs-100-2009/" data-ref-id="5000-38067">1 vs.100</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-kingdom-for-keflings/" data-ref-id="5000-35399">A Kingdom for Keflings</a>, or the marketing-stunt-turned-video-game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doritos-crash-course/" data-ref-id="5000-91756">Doritos Crash Course</a>. They can also still be used as Gamerpics and customized via the Xbox Original Avatars app on consoles and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Xbox 360 Avatars found some popularity due to their Nintendo Mii-like appearance, the modern iteration of avatars added for Xbox One never seemed to find its footing, and has long been an afterthought. Microsoft emphasized on its support page that despite Xbox Avatars getting the axe, players can still personalize and customize their Xbox experience in other ways, like with dynamic backgrounds, custom Gamerpics, and more.</p>

That's a very decent price for a monitor that would be ideal for a workhorse device, so if you've been looking to create a multi-monitor setup at home that won't cost an arm and a leg, this is an affordable option. The catch here is that the deal will be open first to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-27-inch-acer-monitor-for-109-during-black-friday%2F1100-6528010%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart+ subscribers</a> starting 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on November 25, and if it doesn't sell out, the special will be available to the general public starting at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404848" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404848"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg"></figure><p>Given that this monitor typically sells for around $160, we're not expecting the stock to be around for long, as Walmart offered something similar last year and it sold out very quickly.

There's also a free-trial-period option available if you just want to hop in for a quick bargain, but the overall membership is pretty good. It gets you exclusive early access to deals like this, free shipping, a Paramount+ subscription, and several more perks that make it worthwhile.</p><p>For this curved monitor, you're getting a good all-rounder at this price. It has a 180Hz refresh rate, up to 250 Nits of brightness, and a 1080p resolution. This makes it ideal for run-of-the-mill work, or if you're looking to set up a PC gaming space for a younger family member, it's a solid monitor to play games like Fortnite or Valorant on.</p><p>Alternatively, you can get some big discounts on high-end ultrawide monitors for Black Friday. You won't need a multi-monitor setup with one of these, as they're big enough to easily display web browsers and apps simultaneously, and one of the standout deals here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP6HW894?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G9</a> 49-inch monitor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sensory-deprivation-tanks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It probably won’t shock you to learn I’m not really a “chilling out” kind of guy–I’m known among my unusually high number of massage therapist friends for, when injury has forced me to avail myself of their services, being unable to enjoy it because I feel bad that they’re working when I’m not. But over the weekend I did a sensory deprivation tank, and it’s pretty OK?</p><p>I’ve actually done<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_tank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> these tanks</a> a couple times before, when I first got sober back in <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019</a>. Back then, I was troubled to discover that the day is full of hours after 5pm, which were distressingly hard to fill without drinking. I responded to this situation by being willing to do basically anything that came my way until it was late enough to go to bed. One day, I caught <em>The Simpsons</em> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0781978/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> about sensory deprivation tanks, and I thought “are those a real thing?” I looked them up and not only were they, but there was a place that did them near my house. Since it met the criteria of being something that wasn’t drinking, I did it.</p><p>It was a neat little diversion that was a bit too expensive to do often, and I didn’t think about it again until last week. Things haven’t been that great for me lately between the election, the unexpected death of a close friend, and the general stress of my life. While sitting around being crunched by the terrible vice of my own brain, I remembered that, way back when, the tank place had sold me a promotional pack of sessions, one of which I hadn’t used. I was shocked to learn that the straggler hadn’t expired, so I booked an appointment.</p><p>On Sunday morning I biked over to the nicely-appointed spa-like place near my neighborhood, dealt with the anxiety of having to remove my shoes in public, and entered what is basically a very large bathroom with a giant plastic pod in the middle. You shower before you use the tank, which is full of skin temperature water and enough <a href="https://floatworks.com/journal/why-floatation-tanks-use-epsom-salts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epsom salt</a> to make it basically impossible to sink. You close the lid and are in a sealed off chamber; you can leave the lights on or play music, but you can also turn them off and be immersed in complete darkness.</p><p>It isn’t like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSmt7iElrNk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Simpsons</em></a>; there’s nothing inherently psychedelic about it, like Lisa’s experience in the episode. But it’s also not terribly dissimilar from Homer’s experience either; this time around, I actually found it hard to manage a position where I could lie still and not go drifting around banging into all the walls. People who are <em>into it</em> tout all kinds of <a href="https://uptownfloat.com/floating-for-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creative</a> and <a href="https://saltfloatstudio.com.au/i-had-a-spiritual-experience-inside-a-sensory-deprivation-pod-heres-why-they-are-so-healing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiritual</a> benefits, but I am way too uptight and literal for that. Instead, it was nice to have a space to relax where no one could see me and thus judge me for doing it (This is how my brain works! It’s terrible in here!), and it was nice to bob around in the dark with nothing to do, experiencing how my sense of space changed without any physical or visual reference points. I was worried I would think about how bad everything is and just cry the whole time (which would bring the added complication of, you should very much not get the tank water in your eyes!), but it actually felt good to let a couple bouts of intense grief wash over me and then let them fade again.</p><p>The most useful part for me was actually kind of a silly one: at various points, I started wondering how long it had been and preparing myself to be startled by the session abruptly ending, or I panicked that it had been <em>too</em> long and, like <em>The Simpsons</em>, something had gone wrong or they’d forgotten about me. Obviously, I knew neither of these things were true (the pod is on a timer, and a voice recording and lights gently let you know when it’s over), and as I reminded myself of this fact, I realized how long it had been since I felt like something in my life was someone else’s responsibility. It felt really nice to tell myself “someone else is worrying about the time, so you don’t have to,” and it made me aware of how much I feel like I’m carrying on my shoulders. While putting some of that down is a taller task than just deciding to do so, it was a reminder that the vigilance and responsibility I bring to a lot of things isn’t always as necessary as my brain likes to tell me it is.</p><p>At the end of the hour, the lights go back on, and you open the tank and take another shower to wash all the salt off. The place I went has a whole lounge with tea and stuff where you can hang out after, but that would require chilling out within the eyeline of other people, so I didn’t do that. Instead, I went about the rest of my day not feeling profoundly transformed or anything, but definitely feeling a little more chill than I had before I went.</p><p>One of the most shocking things I learned in early sobriety was that there is just <em>so much </em>going on in the world outside of the bars and liquor stores that defined my life for so long; even though I don’t drink anymore, I can still get a bit trapped in my grooves if I’m not careful. So while I don’t ever imagine sensory deprivation tanks will become a regular feature of my life, going back to one was a good reminder that there’s a whole big world outside of me and my habits and the stories I tell myself about my life. I wouldn’t say you <em>have</em> to check one out or anything, but if the opportunity ever comes along, it’s kinda neat!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-league-of-legends-seasons-next-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has revealed a major change to the way&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>seasons will work in the new year, with each season now revolving around a "unique theme" that will dictate its narrative, champion focus, and gameplay updates.</p>

<p>As revealed on Riot's <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/dev-2025-season-one-gameplay-preview/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, the studio is calling the next season in January "Season One", indicating a pretty major reboot for the long-running MOBA.</p>

<p>This first season will revolve around a Noxian invasion, which feels pretty appropriate given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed" rel="nofollow">arrival of Noxian general Ambessa</a> in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>. It'll result in some pretty important gameplay changes, including a visual change for Summoner's Rift, new item upgrades, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-season-one-january-noxus-map.jpg?itok=vhruUGtg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-season-one-january-noxus-map.jpg?itok=O5AzVJr3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>Season One will bring map changes, new gameplay elements, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>A brand new Epic Monster along the lines of Baron Nashor or the Rift Herald will also be introduced as part of this Season. Atakhan spawns at 20 minutes into the game, and he can either appear at the top or bottom of the map depending on who's got more damage and kills at 14 minutes.</p>

<p>If the kill count is high, Atakhan will become Ruinous Atakhan, and taking him down will grant extra buffs from other slain Epic Monsters. He'll also leave a field of the new Blood Rose plants around him, which grant extra XP and an Adaptive Force buff to your whole team.</p>

<p>The gold rewards from First Blood and First Turret will also be replaced by a new Feats of Strength system, which sees your team granted a tier 2 boot buff if you score First Blood, First Tower, or First Three Epic Jungle Monsters bonuses.</p>

<p>Other big changes in this Season will include new runes, a new Teleport mechanic that sees players physically rocketing across the map instead of simply blinking in and out of existence, and respawning Nexus Turrets to help you recover a game that's going south.</p>




<p>A new game mode, <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/dev-introducing-swiftplay/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Swiftplay</a>, is also being introduced. It's designed to replace Quickplay in certain regions, and it's effectively a combination of classic quickplay and ARAM; it's designed to be a faster-paced experience that doesn't lose any of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' traditional strategic appeal.</p>

<p>Not only that, but to celebrate the second season of&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow">won't be the final show</a> based on&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>), the Machine Herald Viktor is <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/tldw-season-1-reveal-gameplay-preview-more/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">getting a visual and gameplay update</a>.</p>

<p>His update is intended to retain the gameplay Viktor mains know and love, but with a new eldritch, ethereal visual style, as well as an updated ultimate that gets larger with each kill.</p>

<p>There are tons of other changes heading to&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>as part of Season One. You can check them all out over on Riot's <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news portal</a>, which has plenty of information regarding each change that's being implemented.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-classes-are-available-in-path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While the full release of Path of Exile 2 will feature a total of 12 playable classes with 36 Ascendancies to choose from, the Early Access launch on December 6 will not. It will include access to six playable classes—a mere handful of the potential. By the time we’re done with EA, we’ll all have mastered these six classes. Here’s what you can play as!</p>



<h2 id="h-six-path-of-exile-2-early-access-classes">Six Path of Exile 2 Early Access Classes</h2>



<p>On Early Access launch, we’ll receive a nice variety of classes, from your Strength-based Warrior to the Intelligence-favoring Witch, along with the Monk and Mercenary, which should offer unique playstyles. But most players will likely opt for Ranger or Witch on their first playthrough. Both classes are staples of the franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong>
<ul>
<li>Titan</li>



<li>Warbringer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stormweaver</li>



<li>Chronomancer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Ranger</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deadeye</li>



<li>Pathfinder</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong>
<ul>
<li>Invoker</li>



<li>Acolute of Chayula</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Mercenary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Witchhunter</li>



<li>Gemling Legionnaire</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blood Mage</li>



<li>Infernalist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>So, six classes, each with two Ascendancies to test out. You can easily spend a few hundred hours playing through the most basic class builds across each playable class. Then, you can turn around and mess about with your very own build, mixing and matching skills and passives to create a workable prototype before full release!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-class-to-play-first-in-path-of-exile-2">What Class to Play First in Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Path of Exile 2 is a massive ARPG offering countless viable build and playstyle paths, with every class in the game capable of pushing end-game content. As such, you should choose to play whichever class speaks to you, whether you want a high-damage glass cannon or a tank worthy of defeating any of the optional bosses in the game.</p>



<p>But if you’d like a recommendation, then we suggest you play as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Witch</li>



<li>Mercenary</li>



<li>Ranger</li>
</ul>



<p>Witch is always a fan-favorite, Mercenary is new to the sequel and shows a lot of promise, and Ranger, while initially weak, winds up as a powerful and hard-hitting solo class that’s easy to manage from the jump.</p>



<p>Hop into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> to tell us which class you intend to play! Maybe—just maybe—you’ll find someone to party up with for the game’s six-player co-op!</p>
