			<p>A Nickelodeon dungeons and dragons style mash up sounds very good on paper, drawing on characters from across their many different IP to take up various roles from a tabletop fantasy RPG. That’s what Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny does that well, as Timmy from Fairly Oddparents transforms into a wizard and SpongeBob becomes a knight, but outside of the cartoon mashup, this is quite a basic game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPHWEJK_7U0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny, Timmy wishes to be transported into the world of one of his favourite games. However, the wish goes wrong and pulls in characters from other shows, as well as dungeons based upon various Nickelodeon shows such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, and enemies inspired by the shows to boot. Battling through the world renders this as an isometric action RPG, and while you’re probably not expecting genre-beating graphics, what’s odd is that character models look desaturated. Katara looks deathly pale and far from her normal skin tone. This desaturations is mostly noticeable on characters with the levels themselves looking better with more vibrant colours.</p>


<p>Between levels you end up in a hub called The Tangle, filled with shops and side missions. It is also here where you can switch between characters to try out which playstyle is best for you. As mentioned, Timmy is a wizard with range attacks, while SpongeBob is a knight so gets closer in. Other characters fall into the rogue, barbarian and healer roles, which works for multiplayer. In single player, picking one character is better after a little experimentation. I ended up sticking with Timmy due to his range and ability to target multiple enemies.</p>


<p>Each character has special abilities to use too to deal with more powerful enemies and groups of them, but the majority of the time you will be using the same basic attacks which can get repetitive, even if you do switch characters. The game throws weapons, armour, talismans, and consumables at you, so there is always better gear. These can be found in chests, from completing challenges, buying them from the shop, and defeating bosses.</p>
<p>Levels themselves are pretty linear though a few do have some winding paths and one has you working out which portals to use to move forward. These variations are far between, with the majority of levels looking fine and different across worlds, but being samey in playstyle makes things a bit uninteresting. You can tell effort has gone into crafting levels that use the Nickelodeon shows as inspiration, but more could be done.</p>

<p>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny’s story is fine and does draw on humour from the various shows it uses, but do not expect anything with depth. This is definitely aimed at a younger audience, so things are easy to follow. It is all voice acted and it is decent, though it could be stronger. There are some performance issues present in the game too, playing the Switch 1 version of the game on Switch 2. Some cutscenes just glitched with frames jumping back and forth, overlaying on each other in a way that hurt to watch. There were also a few times where characters would get stuck while moving around levels.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny does have entertainment value to it, especially for a younger audience, but those looking for a nostalgic trip revisiting Nickelodeon characters might be a bit disappointed due to how basic the gameplay and levels are. There are also technical hitches that need to be addressed.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-is-a-profitable-business-that%E2%80%99s-also-good-for-creators-says-xbox-president.1314448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Questions surrounding the profitability of Xbox Game Pass have existed for as long as Microsoft's gaming subscription service has been on the market. Ever since the launch of June 1, 2017, and increasingly more so over the years as Microsoft improved the subscription's value through various acquisitions such as Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, the widespread consensus was that it was 'too good to be true': an amazing deal for gamers, sure, but how long would even Microsoft, one of the most valuable companies on the planet, be able to sustain it?</p>



<p>Xbox executives such as Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-isnt-burning-cash-says-spencer-its-very-sustainable-and-continues-to-grow/">have repeatedly assured fans of the profitability of Xbox Game Pass</a>, and now Xbox president Sarah Bond has done the same once again in a <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2049598.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGS 2025 interview with Japanese website Game Watch</a>:</p>



<p><em>Last fiscal year, Xbox Game Pass sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a record high of $5 billion</a>. It's a profitable business, and as more creators join Xbox Game Pass, payments to creators increase, so we think it's a good business for creators.</em></p>



<p>However, in light of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's shocking news that the subscription service would now cost $29.99 on its Ultimate tier</a> (with hikes for the other tiers, too), fans have criticized Bond's statement. If it was already profitable and a good business for everyone, why did it have to be subjected to such a massive (+50%) price increase? </p>



<p>Granted, Bond conducted the interview a few days before this announcement, but as president of Xbox, it stands to reason she was absolutely aware of the incoming news. Taking her statement as accurate, the only plausible explanation is that it was not nearly as profitable as Microsoft would want, especially as it starts demanding more from the Xbox division after spending $75.4 billion on Activision Blizzard and $7.5 billion on ZeniMax Media/Bethesda Softworks to bolster the Xbox Game Pass lineup.</p>



<p>Even with all those big games on the subscription services, like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Diablo, and Call of Duty, the subscription service hasn't grown as much as Microsoft wanted (or like some analysts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Michael Pachter</a>, had estimated). If it can't have more subscribers, Microsoft seems to have decided it will now get more money out of those existing subscribers - only, it remains to be seen how many will remain at $29.99 monthly. Shortly after the announcement, too many requests <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overwhelmed the web page where Xbox Game Pass subscriptions are canceled</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s MMORPG update season, and Metin2, Gameforge’s long-running free-to-play entry in the genre, looks set to receive its latest update next month, with the Tyranny of Aamon arriving this November. In the run-up to its release, though, the game will be running a month-long pre-event phase to get players prepped and ready for the host of new features this new update will bring.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metin2: Tyranny of Aamon - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IR0akUawX4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer, may just be the most teasing of teaser trailers I’ve seen for a while, and other than some moody visuals and a disturbing laugh, there’s not all that much to go on. There definitely will be a dark new region, weeks of in-game events, Twitch Drops, and exclusive giveaways — including gaming PCs worth €2,400 so that seems well worth checking out.</p>
<p>The free expansion will introduce the mysterious Moonshadow Vale — a new region filled with dangerous dungeons, powerful bosses, and unique gear to craft.</p>
<p>Ahead of the release, players can take part in a month-long pre-event phase starting October 8, 2025, featuring exclusive missions, community activities, Twitch Drops, and massive prize raffles with rewards ranging from valuable in-game items to premium merchandise — and even two state-of-the-art gaming PCs valued at €2,400 each. Visit the Tyranny of Aamon promo page for more information.</p>

<p>“For almost two decades, Metin2 has inspired millions of players worldwide. With Tyranny of Aamon, we are opening a new chapter that challenges long-standing veterans while also making it easier for new players to join. This update exemplifies our philosophy of continuously evolving established games while also introducing fresh challenges along with new content,” said Patrick Mathieu, Senior Product Manager at Gameforge.</p>
<p>Highlights of Tyranny of Aamon will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moonshadow Vale as a new zone – A mysterious landscape full of dangers and diverse quests.</li>
<li>Dark dungeons &amp; fearsome foes – The sinister Aamon serves as the central antagonist, but many other dangerous creatures lurk within the new dungeons.</li>
<li>New items – Weapons, boots, and other valuable rewards await victorious heroes.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Nobody really wants to see games delayed, especially when you’re looking forward to them, but equally, no one wants to play something that isn’t quite at its best. The development team for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, have made that difficult decision, though seemingly not to spend more time tweaking and improving (though I’m sure they are) but rather to avoid the holidy release melee that we’re currently in the midst of. Moonlight 2: The Endless Vault’s new release date will be November 19th, where it will launch into Early Access on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Behind the Counter Ep.3 - The Art of Moonlighter 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3GCa-ZiTv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is coming from Digital Sun and 11-Bit Games, and is the direct sequel to the original Moonlighter, a game that mixed some lovely shopkeeping mechanics by day with a little moonlighting as a hero spelunking through dungeons at night. It stands as one of the absolute best indie games of recent years, so we can totally forgive the team for holding onto the sequel for just a little longer, particularly so it can breathe a little easier with fewer big releases around it.</p>
<p>The team at Digital Sun released a statement, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While our original plan was set for October 23, the month has filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us. And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we’ve decided to&nbsp;<strong>move our release to November 19</strong>.</p>

<p>While we understand extending the wait isn’t the best news, we have a small treat for you! We plan to run Closed Playtests on Steam and via the Microsoft Store, allowing you to test some of the changes we have implemented in the game based on your feedback.&nbsp; You can expect more details on that very soon!</p>

<p>We truly appreciate your patience and understanding. Consider it a little extra time to sharpen your swords, restock your shelves, and prepare for the adventures ahead.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Publisher 11-Bit Studios may have contributed in some part to the delay themselves, with the console release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2</a> recently hitting shelves, and proving to be the perfect timesink while players wait for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault to arrive.</p>

		<p>There are few larger time sinks than an MMO. That’s eased somewhat by being able to play on your mobile and your PC, and Netmarble will be hoping to steal plenty of players’ time with Raven2, their latest cross-platform MMO, when it launches later this month on the 22nd of October.</p>
<p><iframe title="[RAVEN2] RELEASE DATE TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqoymgYC96M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, what’s Raven2 all about? This medieval fantasy looks to have some seriously slick hack and slash action, with the speed tuned to just the right side of frantic, and players will be able to choose from eight different classes, each of which offer unique playstyles and customisation. One of the most interesting things though has to be the massive, unified battlefields, and though we’ll have to see how those play out, the trailer gives an interesting impression of how players will either work together or against each other as they attempt to hack their way to glory.</p>
<p>The global version of Raven2 will support 150 countries and 16 languages, including English, Thai, German, French, Indonesian, Malay, and more. Its service will be divided into three major regions: North America, Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania, and Europe. Each region will host 2 Worlds, each containing 12 servers, enabling players to freely select any server within their region.</p>
<p>To honor the launch, Raven2 has prepared a special launch event. Players can earn Crystals by leveling up, and the top 100 players per server will compete for one million Crystals. Additionally, a special tax fund of one million Crystals will be pre-deposited in each server’s Market, and players can claim it by participating in guild activity. The full version of “Dev’s Message” video is available on Raven2’s official YouTube, Facebook, Discord, and on the Epic Games YouTube channel, giving players a closer look at what to expect at launch.</p>


<p>Players can pre-register on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=raven2&amp;c=apps&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raven2/id6448719154">App Store</a>, or wishlist the game on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/raven2-2c3f27">Epic Games Store</a>. Pre-registered players will receive exclusive rewards including a heroic grade Holy Garment and a special package at the game’s official launch.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine, Raven2 definitely looks the part, brining with it a vast universe set in a dark fantasy realm where players become a member of the Special Corps bearing the “Cursed Stigma.” As you investigate strange and perilous phenomena unfolding across the world, you’ll embark on a journey to vanquish demons and uncover the secrets behind the world’s fate. If this all sounds good to you, make sure you register ahead of the game’s launch on the 22nd of October.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/02/marvel-rivals-season-4-5-will-be-out-next-week-bringing-daredevil-and-cross-progression-with-it/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Marvel Rivals has managed to maintain a good amount of momentum through its first year, and that’s set to continue with Netease announcing that Season 4.5: Heart of the Dragon, the midway point for the mainline season, will release next Friday, October 10th. The headline additions are always characters, and this time is no different, bringing the iconic Daredevil to the roster, alongside the Man With No Fear’s melee combat-heavy moveset.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daredevil: The Man Without Fear | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV8lE08wGoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is definitely a slightly different take on the character than the Matt Murdock we’ve seen embodied by Charlie Cox on Netflix and Disney, with the Marvel Rivals’ version sounding much gruffer and tougher. Visually, his armourset has clear Eastern influence, with Samurai-esque pauldrons on each shoulder, though I’d expect his more traditional look to pop up as part of the Season Pass.</p>
<p>Daredevil fits into the Duelist class, and his radar sense makes all evil visible; nothing escapes his “sight.” In combat, he can pick a priority target based on the situation, use his agility to close the gap, and unleash rapid attacks with his Billy Clubs. When facing tough opponents, Daredevil taps into The Beast’s power, amplifying his martial arts for even more deadly strikes! Activate his Ultimate Ability, and Daredevil fully unleashes The Beast. Any enemy who dares look at him will be gripped by fear, awaiting his cold justice!</p>
<p>If you have Disney+, you can also unlock a complimentary Disney+ inspired Daredevil costume, offered exclusively for a limited time from October 10, 2025 to January 8, 2026. You can learn more about this at <a href="http://disneyplus.com/perks">disneyplus.com/perks</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside Daredevil, the biggest change to the game is the much-needed addition of cross-progression. That means that no matter where you play, you can carry on working on the same characters and season pass. That said, it’s only going to be open to a small number of players through 4.5 as this feature is tested, with the expectation that cross-progression will unlock for all players alongside Season 5.0. Rank and leaderboard progression will stay separate for each platform, which I suppose will ease any questions of those keyboard and mouse players butting up against console controllers.</p>

<p>Finally, this update also brings another round of Team-Up Ability adjustments such as removing Ragnarok Rebirth (Hela – Thor) and taking Namor out of Gamma Charge (Hulk – Namor/Black Panther). Two brand-new Team-Up Abilities are coming: Bestial Hunt (Daredevil – The Punisher) and Deep Wrath (Hela – Namor). Next, there will be a special Halloween event and themed costumes so players can celebrate this mysterious and lively season together, and there’s also a mystery new mode coming, which we’ll have to wait until the 17th of October to find out more about.</p>

<p>An all-star line up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 this year, and earlier today, it got a demo on Steam.</p>
<p>It allows players to jump into the beat 'em up action with multiple iconic heroes and try out this new title before its official launch. That's not all, though, as there's apparently been a datamine, seemingly revealing – <strong>spoiler alert</strong> – Iron Man and Phoenix as playable characters. There also seems to be possible DLC planned.</p>

<p>These characters would reportedly be the final two playable characters for the main roster. When this news is shared officially, we'll let you know. These characters would join a cast already made up of heroes such as She-Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Venom, Phyla-Vell, Spider-Man, Storm, Wolverine, Nova, and Captain America.</p>
<p>There's no mention of this demo releasing on other platforms, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-just-made-it-easier-than-ever-to-stop-putting-up-with-microsoft.1314361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft, which remains <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a BDS priority target</a> after barring Israel from deploying <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/26/why-has-microsoft-cut-israel-off-from-some-of-its-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some – but not all – of its products</a> in service of Palestinian mass surveillance, and which has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/microsoft-fires-four-workers-on-site-protests-over-companys-ties-israel-2025-08-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired and reported to police</a> multiple employees protesting its involvement in the genocide, stepped in it again today. If it feels like it’s only been a few months since the last time Xbox was at the vanguard of Microsoft’s ceaseless woes, that’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because it has</a>. Mass layoffs and studio closures, turns out, did not sufficiently satiate Microsoft’s almighty Line – which remains buoyed, increasingly <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-bubble-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">precariously</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/29/vibe-working-microsoft-agent-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the AI bubble</a>. So now the company is trying a good old-fashioned price hike. Many Game Pass customers have had enough.</p><p>Today Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a series of confusing changes to Game Pass, principal among them a 50-percent price increase to Game Pass Ultimate that brings it up to $30 per month, or $360 per year. The company is trying to justify the bump with a plethora of new games, as well as a <em>Fortnite </em>Crew membership that includes battle pass access and V-Bucks. PC Game Pass, meanwhile, is also going up in price, from $12 to $16.50, but otherwise remaining the same.&nbsp;</p><p>But that’s not all! Other tiers are getting renamed: Game Pass Core is now Game Pass Essential, while Game Pass Standard is now Game Pass Premium – because surely no one will struggle to discern the difference between something that is essential (a colloquial synonym for best), premium (a colloquial synonym for best), and ultimate (a colloquial synonym for best). Essential and Premium are also adding new games, and while the latter will gain Xbox-published games within a year of release, only Ultimate includes day-one releases.</p><p>This announcement has gone over spectacularly, in the sense that a house fire could be described as such so long as you are not the one inside the house. Mat Piscatella, senior director at analytics firm Circana, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m25bghhcpc2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> that as of Q3 2025 a whopping 58 percent of those who’ve unsubscribed from Game Pass have cited budgetary concerns, and today so many leaped to cancel that they <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m25h7cyrah2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overloaded the website</a>. This is not surprising: Beyond simple sticker shock, more granular math doesn’t really work out in your favor unless you’re a power user.</p><p>"$30 is a redline," accessibility-focused creator and consultant Steve Saylor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stevesaylor.net/post/3m25bo6o3ac2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Bluesky</a>. "There was a time where you could play 2-3 games a year and Game Pass would pay for itself. Now it's 5 games priced at $70 a game."</p><p>"From a moral standpoint, you really oughta consider losing your Game Pass subscription due to the BDS boycott," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/funnywes.online/post/3m25hyiehls2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> voice actor Wes Wiggins. "[But even] not from a moral standpoint, what the fuck. ... That's one and a half <em>Silksongs </em>a month. That's three <em>Yakuza 0s</em> a month. That is, funnily enough, 360 dollars a year."</p><p>This is the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second Game Pass price hike in just over a year</a>, a severe impediment to Microsoft’s strategy of turning everything – <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/this-is-an-xbox-microsoft-claims-over-an-image-of-a-car-that-will-soon-offer-cloud-game-streaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including cars</a>, for some reason – into an <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-marketing-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>. After all, if you’re trying to expand your user base beyond the confines of a specific piece of hardware, you’d want to keep your primary offering well outside the ballpark price range of said hardware. In related news, tariffs recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced Microsoft</a> to raise the price of the Xbox Series X to $650 and the Xbox Series S to $400. Late last month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/handheld-gaming-pcs/the-rog-xbox-ally-x-priced-at-usd1-000-and-available-to-pre-order-in-october-making-it-officially-the-most-expensive-xbox-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also announced</a> that the Xbox-branded versions of the ROG Ally handheld coming in at $600 or $1,000 depending on how many bells and whistles you want. In other words, an impulse buy – assuming the thing you’re impulsively purchasing is a Steam Deck.</p><p>There was no reason to put up with Microsoft’s endlessly enshittified operation months ago, when the company unceremoniously laid off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9,100</a> people, and there are even fewer now. Studios, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hollowed out by layoffs</a>, are footing the bill for the gargantuan $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard purchase, and customers are paying for Game Pass’ lack of actual profitability (once you subtract Microsoft’s <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941933309900013850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fake accounting math</a>). All of <em>that</em>, as well as productivity programs people depend on <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/29/vibe-working-microsoft-agent-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Word and Excel</a>, is then being <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3m22wrg5wjs2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fed into</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the AI meat grinder</a>, ensuring that the worst is yet to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Today Israel <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/9/2/live-geta-thunberg-once-more-on-board-sumud-flotilla-sailing-for-gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intercepted a flotilla</a> meant to provide aid to starving Palestinians and arrested those involved.

And up until very recently, I’d argue that under his watch, the brand really did put players first, even if Xbox has continued to lose market share to PlayStation. As a reminder: Phil immediately <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/13/microsoft-reveals-xbox-one-without-kinect"><u>unbundled</u></a> the Kinect from the Xbox One, removing the $100 albatross weighing the console down. His first big initiative as boss was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/15/e3-2015-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-update-enables-360-xbla?_gl=1*quxw10*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg1ODYxMjY3LjE3NTkyODE1MzY.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTkyODE1MzYkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTkyODE1MzYkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>championing backwards compatibility</u></a>, which is inarguably a huge success. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-fps-boost-far-cry-4-watch-dogs-2-sniper-elite-4-ufc-4"><u>FPS Boost</u></a> on Xbox Series later made many of those old games run even better. He dragged Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/02/sonys-stubborn-stance-on-cross-play-is-embarrassing"><u>kicking and screaming</u></a> into normalizing cross-play. The Xbox One X <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/08/xbox-one-x-review"><u>one-upped the PS4 Pro</u></a> by offering true, native 4K. And Xbox gaming has undeniably become more inclusive in the Phil Spencer Era thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-accessibility-advancements-controllers-ui"><u>Xbox Adaptive Controller</u></a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-accessibility-is-the-future-of-gaming"><u>laudable ASL features</u></a> in multiple first-party games. Finally, there’s Xbox Game Pass, whose mystery economics continue to make it controversial amongst both gamers and developers alike, but has nevertheless been a tremendous value for subscribers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until now, at least. On IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/xbox-unlocked">Unlocked podcast</a>, I (far too) often make reference to that Simpsons gif where Sideshow Bob keeps <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-simpsons-sideshow-bob-RSOUOj8H9A3Xq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>stepping on the rakes</u></a> he’s surrounded by. And the reason I do that is because Xbox always seems to find a way to ruin any momentum it builds up, typically through no fault of anyone but itself. Take the month of October, for instance. Microsoft is shipping not one or two but <em>three </em>really exciting new games in the next 30 days: the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-first-hands-on-impressions-its-faster-and-bloodier-than-ever"><u>very</u></a>-<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-the-final-preview"><u>awesome</u></a>-so-far Ninja Gaiden 4, which revives the beloved fast-action franchise after a dormant decade; Double Fine’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-fines-next-game-keeper-has-you-controlling-a-walking-lighthouse-driven-by-a-goofy-bird"><u>promising</u></a> Keeper, the studio’s next project after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed"><u>Game Awards Game of the Year-nominated</u></a> Psychonauts 2; and ever-reliable Obsidian Entertainment’s RPG/shooter sequel The Outer Worlds 2, which we’ve loved every time we’ve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first"><u>seen</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-hour-has-layers-and-layers-of-role-playing-opportunities"><u>played</u></a> it. That’s a potentially huge month for Xbox – particularly when so many Xbox fans remember how it wasn’t long ago when we’d be lucky to get three ultra-promising first-party releases in an entire <em>year</em>, let alone a single month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All three will drop onto Xbox Game Pass on day one – but this is the part where Xbox starts stepping on all those rakes. Effective immediately, you’ll need to pay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-rises-to-30-a-month-microsoft-adds-more-day-one-games-and-throws-in-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-to-help-justify-the-cost?_gl=1*16yxkxu*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTYzNzk0MjM4My4xNzU5MzM0NzE3*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTkzMzQ3MTYkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTkzMzQ3MTYkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>a whopping 50% more</u></a> for that privilege. Microsoft has raised Game Pass prices for the third year in a row, with the give-me-all-the-day-one-releases tier now setting players back $30 per month. Fourteen months ago, by the way, Game Pass Ultimate was $17. That’s how high and how fast the price has risen. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fourteen months ago, Game Pass Ultimate was $17. Now it's $30. That’s how high and how fast the price has risen.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fairness to Microsoft, the company has added more to Ultimate: Ubisoft+ Classics, Fortnite Crew, and higher-resolution cloud gaming. It’s also worth mentioning that multiple likely Game of the Year candidates hit Game Pass Ultimate on day one this year: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Blue Prince. But we all know that the biggest appeal of Game Pass are those day-one benefits for Xbox-published games, and this price increase feels directly targeted at that. (For the record, PC Game Pass is going from $12 to $16.49 per month.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes immediately on the heels of the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-in-the-usagain"><u>jacking up Xbox console prices</u></a> for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday"><u>second time</u></a> in the past four months, with the top-end Xbox Series X now carrying an eye-watering price tag of $800. But that $800 almost sounds like a damn bargain next to the much-hyped ROG Xbox Ally X handheld gaming PC, which weighs in at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-and-rog-xbox-ally-price-finally-revealed-microsoft-goes-for-1000-for-most-powerful-version-amid-tariff-uncertainty"><u>NINE-HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE U.S. DOLLARS</u></a>. Sure, there’s a less powerful, more affordable version for $599, but nobody knows if that one’s worth a damn, because Microsoft has only ever let media and influencers get their hands on the more powerful Ally X. Hopefully it proves useful, as the Series S has for the non-hardcore gamer part of the market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heck, the only thing the Xbox folks haven’t raised prices on are first-party games. Oh, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-microsofts-first-confirmed-80-game"><u>they tried</u></a> with The Outer Worlds 2, to be clear – and they inevitably will next year when Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, Forza Horizon 6, etc. drop – but the Xbox community wasn’t having any of that, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers"><u>Microsoft relented</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I realize we live in crazy times, and that Sony and Nintendo are not exactly blameless here either after each of them raised prices on their own aging hardware in the past year (with Nintendo also aggressively raising software prices for the Switch 2 generation as well). Blame the Trump tariffs if you want to (heck, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-in-the-usagain"><u>Microsoft does</u></a>), but I’m sorry: at the end of the day, the buck stops with Microsoft. This is a company with a market cap of nearly $4 <em>trillion</em>, who has done layoff after layoff, after spending upwards of $80 billion on studio and publisher acquisitions. And it’s fair to wonder if those naysayers who question the sustainability of Game Pass and its business model are being proven right with this latest, deepest round of price hikes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We’ve reached a sad point where gaming is becoming less accessible to new players rather than more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s worse is that, in the bigger picture, we’ve reached a sad point where gaming is becoming less accessible to new players rather than more. Historically, console prices go down and the size and quality of the game library goes up over the course of a generation, leading to more units sold and a healthier ecosystem for everyone inside it. And while again, the blame for the absence of that this generation does not rest squarely on Microsoft’s shoulders, the actions of Team Xbox are of a company that isn’t showing a lot of empathy towards its customers as the cost of groceries, gas, and other bare essentials keeps going up. Again, these larger economic issues aren’t Microsoft’s fault, and it has to contend with rising development costs too, but they are choosing profit over players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, while I recognize that this Xbox console generation isn’t over yet, it’s almost certainly going to be remembered first and foremost for Microsoft’s greed: two hardware price increases (and counting), three Xbox Game Pass price increases (and counting), one software price increase (so far), and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>tens of thousands of layoffs</u></a> as well as multiple studio closures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s kind of a monkey’s paw situation, really: all Xbox gamers have wanted since the start of the catastrophic Xbox One generation was a steady supply of great first-party games. Well, in 2025 we’re finally getting that – and as I’ve already mentioned, 2026 is shaping up to be a banger too – but it’s coming at the cost of, well…practically everything else. But it’s not our fault. Instead, Microsoft’s greed is to blame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Drawing inspiration from the ARPG greats like Diablo, Path of Exile, and Grim Dawn while packaging everything in a highly replayable roguelike formula, Gell Clock provides a great middle ground for people who want to experience the power fantasy of an ARPG without having to grind for hundreds of hours every season. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/hell-clock/news/hell-clock-1-1-crafting-system-preview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Patch 1.1, the Clockmaker’s Tools,</u></a> is Hell Clock’s largest update yet.

Take a look at IGN's post on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hell-clock-update-11-detailed">Hell Clock 1.1 Update</a> for more information.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/img-2-beginners-guide-1759338858483.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Maxroll Hell Clock Beginner's Guide</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll’s comprehensive <a href="https://maxroll.gg/hell-clock/getting-started/hell-clock-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Hell Clock Beginner's Guide</u></a> gets into the details of Hell Clock's core systems and mechanics with links to more detailed guides where you can learn more. Start by exploring the campaign, progressing through each act, and challenging bosses. Next, learn more about the game's progression and metaprogression systems. These include Skills, Blessings, Gear, Passives, Relics, and Constellations, all of which combine to make a variety of builds. Then learn about what awaits you in the endgame with Abyss, Oblivion, and Ascension.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/img-3-getting-started-1759339001410.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Getting Started in Hell Clock</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting started with the Beginner's Guide, continue your journey with Maxroll’s new player resources.

Some Skills, like Split Shot, are easy to spam and often act as your primary damage. Others, such as Spectral Knives, have a longer cooldown and often take a secondary role. As you progress through the Acts and defeat bosses, you can access new skills (via the Skill Book), but you must spend 100 Soul Stones to unlock them.

<p>If you end up taking a trip to the Nintendo Museum in Japan any time soon, you'll be able to purchase an official museum book.</p>
<p>The 'Nintendo Museum Official Book Vol. 01' goes on sale at the museum's Art Gallery on 2nd October 2025 (<em>that's today!</em>) and is priced at 1,650 yen. It features an "in-depth guide to the museum" and also celebrates Super Mario's 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>Notably, there's an "English Version" of the book available, and it's the first volume – so there's seemingly more to come. Here's the official announcement, along with a look at the cover featuring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> World 1-1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning Thursday, October 2, the Nintendo Museum Official Book Vol. 1 will be available for purchase at the Art Gallery located on the 2nd floor of Exhibition Building 1. This exclusive publication offers an in-depth guide to the museum and includes special features celebrating the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. *Please note that only cashless payments are accepted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we hear any significant updates about this book or future volumes, we'll let you know. Once again, it's available directly from the museum's Art Gallery. This news follows Nintendo's recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-nintendo-museum-is-opening-an-art-gallery-this-september">Art Gallery opening at the museum</a>, which features art from Mario's games.</p>
<p>There'll also be a "limited-time" lighting display at the Nintendo Museum. It's taking place this December and will include a special installation featuring the Mario 40th anniversary logo.</p>

            <p>
Am I good at chess? I'll take no for $1500, Alex. But do I love a funky twist on games that are older than time itself? You bet your bottom dollar I do! Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/below-the-crown">Below the Crown</a>, a chess video game that is also a roguelike, ,and is also a turn-based strategy game, and is also a dungeon crawler on top of that. It's a lot! It also works very well, and in a demo that just came out today (alongside an early access release date), there's a suggestion of something a touch more… unsettling… going on under the hood.
</p>
<p>
In Below the Crown, you are a wizard who is working to get The Emperor the gold he knows is down in the dungeon below his castle. This wizard version of you places a single king on a chess board in each run, with a selection of other, occasionally remixed versions of classic pieces at your disposal. You slowly add pieces to the board as you try to strategise your way towards taking down opposing kings, adding abilities to your various pieces as you go room by room. Sometimes you'll be offered the opportunity to buy certain useful cards too, like one that will freeze an enemy piece in place for five turns.
</p>
<p>
It's chess! And it's not chess. The important thing is that the essence of the age-old game is there, that feeling of thinking where you're going to place which piece where, albeit in a refreshingly different way. Though, it definitely is a game that is smarter than me, at least when it comes to chess, because I really would like to stress I'm pants at actual chess. Still fun though! And then there's the creepy bits.
</p>
<p>
In between rounds, you might get asked to do things like placing a marker on a graph that reads loneliness on the Y axis and anxiety on the X axis. Upon beating a run I was asked to rank my pieces based on how I felt about them, and was then questioned on my choices afterwards. Methinks there is a bit more than just retro, roguelike chess going on here, and I'm curious to find out more.
</p><p>
Which I'll be able to do soonish! As developer Misfits Attic (who also made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a>) shared that Below the Crown will be launching into early access next month, November 10th. Better keep practicing at regular chess in the meantime so I don't totally suck at this twisted video game version of it.

            <title><![CDATA[Candy Crush Player Sues Over Alleged ‘Scam’ Tournament]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/candy-crush-player-sues-over-alleged-%E2%80%98scam%E2%80%99-tournament.1314298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Candy Crush Saga</em> player Ruben Valenzuela is suing King and Activision Blizzard over a $250,000 <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> tournament, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/926665368/Candy-Crush-player-sues-over-alleged-scam-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to court documents reviewed by Aftermath</a>. Valenzuela and his lawyers allege in a complaint filed last week in a Los Angeles court that King “tricked players” into believing they had better chances of winning than they actually did, leading to players spending much more time and money than they might otherwise.</p><p>Valenzuela wrote that King did not accurately supply players with information necessary to assess their chances—how many players advance through each stage (and obscuring the amount of players that did), rampant cheating, unfair advantages given to “super users,” and the ability for players to play offline and mask scores, which mucked up the tournament’s leaderboards. Valenzuela and his lawyers posit that the <em>Candy Crush</em> All Stars 2023 tournament is a way for King and Activision Blizzard to “entice users to spend money and to spend more of it.”</p><p>The <em>Candy Crush</em> All Stars tournament began in 2020 and has been held yearly since. A New Yorker named Jay Simunovich won in 2023, beating out “roughly 20 million people,” <a href="https://newsroom.activisionblizzard.com/p/victory-is-sweet-for-candy-crush" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to King</a>. Fifteen million people participated in 2025, where an Ohio man, Ben Chin, won the $500,000 prize. This year, in June, King awarded another $500,000 to a man named Tiago, from Portugal, after he beat out 15 million people. Players are pooled into groups and tasked with climbing to the top of their leaderboards by collecting All Star Candies, which are rewarded for completing levels. Players do this through a bunch of different rounds until the top 10 players reach the finals, which are held in person.</p><p>Valenzuela is one of those 20 million players who participated in 2023, according to the complaint. Lawyers wrote that the tournament “consumed” his life because the leaderboards gave him the impression he was in the lead.&nbsp;</p><p>“At every turn, he was given the impression that he was in the lead, and knew that if he stopped playing for even a few minutes, he would lose his place,” they wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>It went on for a month before Valenzuela was knocked out of the tournament and stopped playing. He spent “thousands of dollars” on the event, according to the complaint, buying in-game bonuses to help him accrue points.</p><p>His lawyers called the event a “scam.”&nbsp;</p><p>“And perhaps we could blame Ruben, and the millions of people like him who did the same, if the game had been fair,” they wrote. “We could say that adults should not allow themselves to be led astray by sleek corporate marketing and clever corporate machinations designed to draw players into a game where they need to spend their wages on color bombs and lollipop hammers. After all, if a corporation can convince people that they should exchange their money earned in the real world for intangible thingamajigs in the cyber world, then people have only themselves to blame.”</p><p>But lawyers said the tournament isn’t fair, largely due to how King allegedly obscures a person’s chances at winning. They said that the player numbers are obscured by King pulling people into small groups of just dozens of players, instead of thousands, which leads people to believe they’ve got to beat less people. They also alleged that <em>Candy Crush</em> All Stars was rife with cheaters who quickly scale the leaderboards knocking legitimate players out—the issue here, according to the complaint, is that it’s not disclosed to players. Similarly, lawyers said King doesn’t disclose the advantage some players who play a ton of <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> get; players who beat more than 14,000 <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> boards gain access to levels that have huge point multipliers. Lastly, lawyers blame the lack of disclosure of offline players, whose scores aren’t uploaded until a person goes online, making the leaderboard misleading. So, if a person accrued a million points while playing offline, it wouldn’t be listed on the leaderboard until the device was connected to the internet. A player with 999,999 points would think they’re in the lead.</p><p>The big problem with all this, according to the lawyers, is that players like Valenzuela made purchasing decisions based on the leaderboard positioning. A person in third place would potentially spend money on boosts to reach first place, but may not <em>actually</em> be in third place, say, if someone with a higher score was playing offline. That person will appear to suddenly surpass you when they do connect to the internet, and their score appears on the leaderboard.</p><p>The lawsuit cites <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> forum posts in which players rant about the tournament—offline players making it “impossible” to gauge positioning, about cheaters who had impossibly high scores just minutes after the event began, and lamenting the sheer amount of money they’d spent in an attempt to win big.&nbsp;</p><p>“The whole tournament is designed to mislead players into spending money for what was essentially a lottery,” one person wrote.</p><p>The&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush</em>&nbsp;All Stars tournament’s current <a href="https://candy-all-star-live--king-ccs-campaign-cms-prod.us-central1.hosted.app/en/pages/all_stars_terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terms and conditions</a> do address some of these complaints. A section titled Unfair Play described a “zero-tolerance policy” for anything deemed unfair play, like using exploits or hacking, sharing an account, using bots, and playing on multiple devices simultaneously. King also addressed offline play, though not necessarily for players on the other end: King wrote that players using the game offline could see disruptions to their scores. “You agree that King is not liable for any data loss resulting from your offline play, and we will not restore any such data loss to your gameplay or King account,” it said.</p><p>In a section labeled Costs, King said participants don’t have to make purchases to play, but certainly can.</p><p>Indeed, elsewhere on the internet, players warned each other against getting too invested. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/candycrush/comments/1c3ymfd/comment/l27jpol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One person who claimed to reach the final knockout round</a> said they played for 24 hours straight to get that positioning. Another person chimed in: “I played from 8am to about 3am non stop and when I noticed the person in 2nd stopped playing I took a quick nap and rested my eyes up until I saw them started playing again so I continued around 6am until 7:30,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/candycrush/comments/12sev6e/comment/jh0uxh8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they wrote on Reddit</a>. “There were times when they took over first but I took it back and finally got a 40k lead on them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Some players wrote they’ve made it past several rounds <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/candycrush/comments/12rg8q5/comment/jguili4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without spending any money</a>, but others, like Valenzuela, said they’ve spent thousands for a chance at the grand prize.</p><p>Valenzuela and his lawyers are looking to find King in violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and also alleged fraud and unjust enrichment. They’re looking for the lawsuit to be certified as a class action. Aftermath has reached out to Activision Blizzard and King for comment.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>, whether it ends up being a good game or not, is clearly a confident one. You have to be brave to so blatantly, we'll say, borrow from so many different games. Like many anime-esque games of its ilk, it will live and die by its characters (which, by the way, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/locking-characters-behind-gacha-would-have-clashed-with-anantas-intended-playstyle-and-high-degree-of-freedom-producer-explains/">you won't have to gacha roll for</a>), of which it seems to have in spades judging from that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ananta-looks-expensive-like-a-mix-of-gta-spider-man-and-yakuza-and-a-bit-overwhelming">first gameplay trailer</a>. These characters will all play differently too, and according to Ananta's producer Ash Qi, the dev team wants you to think of them like Avengers members. Comparing your new thing to an older, widely loved thing is always a safe move!
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/gta-and-spider-man-are-big-shoes-to-fill-but-ananta-producer-decides-to-raise-expectations-even-higher-with-marvel-avengers-comparisons-they-are-the-protagonists-of-their-own-stories/">GamesRadar</a>, Qi said he believes "many of the characters in the game could be protagonists in their own game." Qi went on to explain that they're "trying to create a big storyline that will evolve, giving the characters focus, which will add new characters and new cities to explore. Take Marvel as an example; there are many different heroes and champions in The Avengers. 
</p>
<p>
"However, characters like Captain America and Spider-Man have their own storylines, separate from the larger plot, and they are the protagonists of their own stories, each with their unique missions." Qi goes on to note that this approach, of trying to make each character stand out, is their attempt of keeping them in focus - not to mention a feature they're working on where several characters can all fight other enemies at once.
</p>
<p>
One point I do take slight umbrage with is that Qi also said the studio is trying to "achieve a design that feels unique compared to other RPG games." Sure, there might not be many RPG games like this one, but there are even just some animations that seem uncomfortably similar to other games.
</p>
<p>
I still have my reservations about Ananta, but I'm still curious to find out how it actually shapes up… whenever that is.

              <p>A TikTok content creator allegedly flew all the way from the United States to Edinburgh, Scotland to stand outside the offices of <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> developers Rockstar North and yell at people entering and exiting the studio. According to the creator, he is “sick and tired” of waiting for a new trailer or information on any further delays.</p> <p>On September 30, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-devs-harassed-by-tiktoker/">as spotted by </a><em>TheGamer,</em> TikTok user Backonboulevard shared a video on the social media service that appeared to show him staking out the Rockstar North office in Scotland and then yelling at two different people that he seemingly assumed were developers working on<em> GTA 6</em> after spotting them entering and exiting the building. The video has over 140,000 views and is currently pinned on the TikTok user’s channel.</p>

 <p>In the first incident, a person can be seen walking toward the office when Backonboulevard yells at them: “When’s the delay? When’s the next trailer? I wanna know!” The person shrugs, starts walking away quickly, and replies, “I don’t know.”</p>

   <p>In another incident shown in the video, Backonboulevard seemingly follows a person after they have presumably left the office and shouts at them, asking: “When’s the delay happening? Is there another delay? What about the trailer? Another trailer? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me nothing?” That person looks visibly scared and understandably nervous about a random dude aggressively confronting them in the dark, and quickly flees the scene as the TikTok creator follows before the video cuts.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted the TikTok user about the video and reached out to Rockstar Games.</p> <p>“I’m sick and tired of waiting for the answers,” explained Backonboulevard in the video. At another point, he showed the outside of Rockstar North’s offices to prove he was there. “Right now we are here, right here, live from Rockstar North. I told you guys I wasn’t playing around.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1973022044251152503">On Tuesday, the video was flagged by <em>GTA</em> content creator GameRoll on Twitter</a>. “If you’re waiting outside of somebody’s workplace to harass employees over a video game, give your head a wobble,” said GameRoll.</p> <p>While many in the comments below GameRoll’s post shared disbelief and anger over what Backonboulevard seemingly did, there are many, many comments below the original video on TikTok that take the creator’s side and blame Rockstar’s lack of information and new trailers for the harassment. And to be clear: That’s fucking stupid and you should never, ever, ever sit outside a video game studio and harass the people inside and demand answers from them. That will never work out, it might get you in trouble legally, and it’s just a dick move.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch in May 2026 <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">after being delayed earlier this year</a>. It will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Don’t yell at the devs about it, okay?</p>

The new game brings a futuristic setting for multiplayer, the largest round-based Zombies map ever, and a new Resurgence map for Warzone called Haven's Hollow. GameSpot went hands-on with Black Ops 7 during Call of Duty: Next, and while the jump into the future does enough to distinguish the multiplayer from last year's offering, and the latest iteration of Zombies creates a new experience, Warzone's upcoming integration currently falls flat for Black Ops 7.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Futuristic and refined multiplayer</h2><p dir="ltr">I've always believed that Call of Duty was at its best with a rotating developer cycle. I liked flip-flopping between developers and the different series within Call of Duty. Going from Modern Warfare to Black Ops was refreshing because the different teams each introduced different styles, modes, and features to their takes on the game, lessening the yearly "CoD fatigue."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">So, with another Black Ops title coming so soon, my biggest concern was how Treyarch would make Black Ops 7 feel fresh enough. I didn't want another year that felt like more of the exact same, because we already lived through that with back-to-back Modern Warfare titles. Thankfully, I can happily report that Black Ops 7 does enough to remain an invigorating multiplayer experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking Black Ops out of the '90s of last year's entry and into the year 2035 does a lot to change how multiplayer feels. Treyarch leans into the tech of this future, providing more interesting scorestreaks such as the dog-like robot called the D.A.W.G. and the Rhino, which is a robotic take on Call of Duty's juggernaut enemy type from previous games.</p><p dir="ltr">Loadouts can also be equipped with other tech and gadgets from the future to further differentiate Black Ops 7 from its predecessor. There are field upgrades that let you launch drones, temporarily cloak yourself, and even place decoy holograms of your operator to trick your enemy. These aren't new mechanics in Call of Duty, but we haven't seen equipment like this since the days of the high-tech jetpack games, and they add immersion to Black Ops 7's futuristic warfare.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578517-b1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578517" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578517-b1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578517"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578517-b1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch also enhanced the omnimovement system introduced in Black Ops 6, making the movement faster, more fluid, and oftentimes flashier. The team removed the tactical sprint (you now need a specific perk to use it), increased the base movement speed, and added a wall jump. On paper, these changes to omnimovement seem minimal, but the adjustments do feel impactful. Wall jumps can be chained together, and these hops can be used to reach windows and other areas not previously accessible in boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty games.</p><p dir="ltr">During my hands-on time, I was able to perform a few fancy wall jumps where I could tap the wall, giving me extra height, and then spin around in the air to catch an opponent off guard. I could also toss a stun grenade into a window to daze a sniper, and then wall jump high enough to reach and eliminate them, which is a play the previous game's movement didn't allow for. I'm not super savvy with advanced movement, so there will be players who perform much more impressive plays, but it does give you more options on how you approach areas of the maps, as well as your gunfights. This also may or may not sound like a huge feature to some, but fundamentally impacting the moment-to-moment gameplay in this way can really freshen things up for Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The maps I played were also large enough to give space for pulling off these over-the-top action moves. One complaint I ended up having in Black Ops 6 was that most of the maps were on the smaller side, with a focus on chaotic and in-your-face action, but the Black Ops 7 maps we played gave me much more room to breathe. These aren't huge designs, but they are all medium-sized Call of Duty maps.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce, and senior director of production Yale Miller, the developers explained how this year's maps were meant to feel more like classic maps inspired by Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"The big things we talk about with map design are being fair and fun," Miller said. "It's also because this is a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2, so it's really leaning into those core beliefs on three-lane maps. Each lane needs a really clear purpose. If one side has a power position, there should probably also be a power position on the other side."</p><p dir="ltr">Forge was easily my favorite multiplayer map. We played Domination on Forge, which is set at a Guild research and development center. There are two large wings of the facility to fight indoors, and the B flag for Domination is located outside at the center hub of the map. Uniquely, the B flag is surrounded by sections of cover that continuously rotate around the point. This center hub provided a lot of interesting opportunities while fighting for B. Sometimes the rotating cover would move at just the right time to expose an enemy, while other times it would catch me off-guard and leave me vulnerable. There are also exterior building walls that curve around this center hub, giving plenty of opportunity for those flashy wall-jump plays.</p><p dir="ltr">Forge was also the map the developers said proved to be most challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578518-b4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578518" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578518-b4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578518"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578518-b4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Not from a sheer design point, but just everything that went into it," Miller said. "There is rotating cover, and like, how is that going to work?"</p><p dir="ltr">The map is also complicated from a technical standpoint, he said.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a lot of glass. Glass canopies and other stuff," Miller explained. "To make the map look right when light is coming through the glass, you need reflection and refraction, so it drops a little bit of shade."</p><p dir="ltr">Scronce and Miller also confirmed that last year's training grounds would return in Black Ops 7 to give you a safe place to practice the game's updated omnimovement. Black Ops 7's training takes place on Forge, and the map's design makes a great location to practice wall jumps and other moves, as this was the map that provided me the most real estate and opportunity for performing these actions.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also an intelligent movement setting in Black Ops 7 that helps you with the wall jump.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's listed as a wall jump assist in your movement settings," Scronce said. "Then, you can jump at the wall, and it will wall jump for you."</p><p dir="ltr">This, combined with the practice map, should help players like me improve their movement skills.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the standard Call of Duty weapons, perks, and attachments remain in Black Ops 7, so it was the map design, refined movement, and future tech that sold the multiplayer for me. I had a blast wall-jumping and launching drones into the air, and I look forward to trying out the rest of the map pool at launch.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Wonder Vehicle changes the Zombies experience</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 introduces Ashes of the Damned, the largest round-based Zombies map ever, but this time the design is more road-like than that of a standard map. It's inspired by Black Ops 2's Tranzit and features a figure-eight layout with separate chunks of map locations that are all connected by dangerous stretches of road. In Tranzit, you navigated the roads via a bus that would continuously loop around the map, but Ashes of the Damned puts you in the driver seat of Ol' Tessie, the map's new Wonder Vehicle. Tessie is an old junker of a truck that you gain access to at the start of your match, and you can drive and upgrade the vehicle on your journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Design director Kevin Drew and lead game designer Steve Bianchi explained that Ashes of the Damned was specifically designed around Tessie.</p><p dir="ltr">"We created it around the vehicle," Bianchi said. "The scale of the map matches having a vehicle as a core element to the map. It's the fifth member of your squad.</p><p dir="ltr">"The fog and the roads between are treacherous to travel, so we wanted those to be very streamlined but also really cool for the vehicle to travel," Bianchi continued.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="401869495" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

format.     </p><p>Sorry, but you can't access this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">In my short time with Zombies, I did get to ride around in Tessie, and it was very satisfying to run over the hordes of zombies in my path. I didn't get to experience the full upgrades available, but I did get to the portion of the map where you can upgrade the vehicle to include a Pack-a-Punch machine. That's right: The truck becomes a moving Pack-a-Punch machine, and you can upgrade your weapons on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to take the roads on foot, you're met with a fast-moving enemy type called Ravengers. These creatures swarm you and make it difficult to proceed, so it's a lot safer to travel with Tessie. It also made for awkward and tense moments when our vehicle was destroyed while traversing these roads. Enemies and crashes can cause enough damage to disable the Wonder Vehicle, and while Treyarch told us there was a way to repair Tessie, we didn't figure that part out.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Zombies maps, Ashes of the Damned features a main storyline quest, a unique Wonder Weapon, and plenty of mysteries to uncover. Features like Wall Buys, GobbleGums, and the iconic Mystery Box return. I also appreciate that Treyarch isn't drip-feeding the perks to us this year. Black Ops 6 started with a small selection, and each seasonal update expanded the list of perks. Black Ops 7 includes all the perks available in Black Ops 6 and introduces a new perk called Wisp Tea. I didn't get to try this perk out for myself, but it spawns a spectral orb-like protector to help you fight off zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to being the largest round-based map, Ashes of the Damned also includes the largest cast yet. The map features eight playable characters: the crew of four from Black Ops 6, as well as the iconic cast of Takeo, Dempsey, Nikolai, and Richtofen. You can mix and match any of these characters for up to four-player co-op. They all have unique voice lines, and Drew said some dialogue will depend on which characters are included in your party. Much of the character dialogue was blocked from our hands-on session, as Treyarch wanted to preserve the story elements for the full launch, but I am excited to see where Tessie and this new story will take me in Black Ops 7.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone lacks meaningful changes</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 will integrate with Warzone during Season 1. A date hasn't been confirmed for this first post-launch update, but the content will include map changes for Verdansk and a new Resurgence map called Haven's Hollow.</p><p dir="ltr">Due to the popularity of Verdansk, I'm not surprised the developer is bringing it back as Warzone's big map battle royale. However, I am surprised by how uninspiring the map's changes proved to be in our hands-on session.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 1 update will add two POIs: Factory and Signal Station. Factory is a large factory-style building next to Superstore, and it's a very forgettable location. Signal Station is a little more interesting as it offers objectives you can complete in order to get rewarded with extra intel. Completing the objectives will upgrade your Tac Map to reveal enemy density for a portion of the map. The Tac Map will highlight quadrants in orange or red based on how populated those areas are. Intel is always handy, and maybe this will become a hot spot for players, but ultimately my time on this version of Verdansk played the same as any other match pre-integration.</p><p dir="ltr">The season's new map is a smaller one for Resurgence. Haven's Hollow is set in the same town as Black Ops 6's Zombies mode. Of course, this version of Liberty Falls is designed pre-outbreak, meaning there are no Zombies elements or destruction here; this is just a quaint West Virginia town. It does include the church, bowling alley, bank, and other major points of interest, but the playable area also extends beyond the areas within the Zombies maps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578519-b2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578519" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578519-b2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578519"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578519-b2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Haven's Hollow is a vibrant map, and it's filled with rich color not often seen in a Warzone map. I do appreciate the effort to make this map easy on the eyes, and I wish other maps had been this colorful, but unfortunately, it's not a memorable location to fight for a victory royale. Liberty Falls was the least interesting of all the Zombies maps, and when you take away the Zombies elements, it feels even truer for Warzone . A boring '90s version of West Virginia feels like another missed opportunity to do something futuristic and fitting of the Black Ops 7 theme. Of course, this was just my initial impression after a few matches on Haven's Hollow, so maybe this map will grow on me with time, but it lacks any initial wow factor.</p><p dir="ltr">It would've been nice to see a futuristic new map or an upgraded version of Verdansk with new lighting and robots to fit the Black Ops 7 theme. Warzone's yearly integration with a new title usually brings something new or fresh-feeling, but this is definitely the battle royale's most uninspiring yearly update yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch did announce the return of Black Ops 4's popular Blackout battle royale mode on the Avalon map. This new Blackout battle royale experience won't arrive until sometime in Spring 2026, and we didn't get to play or learn any details about the mode at Call of Duty: Next. While Warzone is leaving me disappointed and wanting a whole lot more, I am excited to see what the return of Blackout looks like in Black Ops 7. I just hate that we'll be waiting long after launch to play it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Final thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr">Warzone really missed the mark with uninspired maps, and it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Fans like myself will likely need to wait until the springtime to get any major or impactful changes to battle royale, and that is a huge disappointment for the yearly integration. However, multiplayer and Zombies content make me excited for the full launch of Black Ops 7. Redefined omnimovement makes the game even more satisfying to play, and if the rest of the maps have the same quality as the ones I sampled at Call of Duty: Next, it can be another enjoyable and action-filled year for Black Ops.</p>

              <p>Peacemaker’s dance emote will return to <em>Fortnite</em> now that Epic Games is satisfied it had nothing to do with Nazi imagery. Following the reveal of the HBO show’s recent season 2 twist, the company implied it was concerned the dance moves<a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842"> intentionally recreated a swastika</a>. The emote will now return next week, with modified animations.</p> <p>“We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current <em>Peacemaker</em> storyline,” the<em> Fortnite</em> account on X posted on Wednesday. “To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI">https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI</a> <a href="https://t.co/CnsrL8QL7t">pic.twitter.com/CnsrL8QL7t</a></p> <p>— Leryensu (@iLegendTz) <a href="https://twitter.com/iLegendTz/status/1973484250289807592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> we’re about to mention some major plot points from <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2.</p> <p>This whole thing started after the alternate universe that John Cena’s Chris Smith has been exploring this season was revealed to be one in which Hitler’s Germany won WWII and America is now run by Nazis. If you then went back and looked at the&nbsp; dance in the Peaceful Hips <em>Fortnite</em> emote, which is supposed to be the one Cena does in the season 2 intro, you can sort of see that maybe there’s a swastika in there somewhere if you overlay multiple freeze frames.</p> <p>Epic Games then pulled the emote and said it would investigate to see if this had been done by someone at Warner Bros. on purpose. It seems the company is now satisfied that it was just an unintended coincidence. But what fans really want to know is if the dance will actually sync up to the music this time the way it’s choreographed in the show. We’ll know when the emote returns during <em>Fortnite</em>‘s reset next week on October 9.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-announces-luna-another-cloud-based-streaming-ga-1845170977">Luna, Amazon’s video game cloud-streaming service</a>, is shifting gears. While the service will still feature AAA video games like <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Dead Island,</em> the retail giant has announced new plans to “reimagine” Luna as a way for families to play casual, easier-to-learn games using their phones. And the first one of these games Amazon revealed is a courtroom comedy game featuring an AI-powered Snoop Dogg as the judge. Hmm.</p> <p>Launched back in 2020, <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-cloud-streaming-war-xbox-ps5-ps-portal-luna-1851704159">Amazon Luna followed in the footsteps of Google’s video game streaming service</a>, Stadia. But unlike Stadia, <a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">which died back in 2022</a>, Amazon has continued to support Luna, offering a subscription service with access to over 100 games as well as giving Prime members a small catalog of games to play for free. It’s never felt like Luna was a big hit, though, despite some publishers like Ubisoft and EA continuing to support it. Well, Amazon seems to have admitted it wasn’t working, because the company just revealed big plans to rebrand Luna as a more casual experience built around couch co-op and new, unique games.</p>

  <p>On October 1, <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna">Amazon announced that later this year, Luna will change.</a> While the service will still allow you to buy and play AAA games, Amazon is going to target, as explained in a press release about the pivot, “the <span>100s of millions of people who&nbsp;</span><span>want</span><span> to experience the magic of playing games on the big screen but feel left out” due to games being too complicated or consoles being too expensive. Amazon’s play is to turn Luna into a place where friends and family members can gather around the TV, pull out their phones, and play less complicated games together. If this sounds a lot like Jackbox, well, congratulations, you too can be an Amazon Gaming executive.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>The big centerpiece of this rebrand is Game Night, a new Amazon-developed hub within Luna that will offer a variety of Jackbox-like, family-friendly, casual games. Players just scan a QR code using their phone, and a few seconds later, they’re having a great time playing… a Snoop Dogg courtroom game powered by AI?</p>

 <p>Yeah, the big game revealed today is <span><i>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg,&nbsp;</i>which Amazon describes as an “</span><span>AI‑powered improv courtroom game where players invent outrageous characters, spin wild stories, and do whatever it takes to defend their testimonies before Judge Snoop Dogg.” Gather around, grandma, pull out your Cricket Wireless smartphone, and let’s yell at an AI-powered recreation of a famous rapper who has, <a href="https://www.snooppassport.xyz/">let’s say,</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/snoop-dogg-criticizes-lgbtq-couple-disney-lightyear-1236353064/">made some</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-43733/snoop-dogg-trump-perform-inauguration">bad choices in recent years</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Will this big pivot work out? I have no idea. A lot of this pitch reminds me of the same stuff Google said about Stadia and what Intellivision promised about <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-new-gaming-console-thats-become-a-giant-car-crash-1847699027">the disaster that is the Amico console</a>. Maybe Amazon will find success where others haven’t? Maybe. I mean, it’s not like Luna’s setting the world on fire at the moment. We’ll find out when the big pivot happens later this year.</p>

                <p>Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul, is one of the breakout creations from Prime Video's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-amazon-show-review-of-the-people-for-the-people/1900-6418209/" data-ref-id="1900-6418209">Fallout</a> TV series. Now, The Ghoul is coming to Fallout 76 later this year as part of the Burning Springs expansion. While Burning Springs won't officially launch until early December, a public test server for the expansion is going to be open on October 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGPRrcnJ5Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9bGPRrcnJ5Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players won't be able to control The Ghoul, but they can find him in Burning Springs, Ohio, where he operates out of a bar called The Last Resort. His function in the expansion is to give the players bounty hunter assignments. The grunt hunts are the lower-tier bounties that can be used to gain experience and the occasional legendary item. Tougher targets can be purchased in exchanged for caps. The most difficult assignments are the head hunts, which are "open to anyone in earshot." Those are some of of the most difficult targets to handle, and players may need backup to bring them down.</p><p>Burning Springs is also introducing an important new character called the Rust King. He's an intelligent super mutant who hasn't lost his taste for violence and is described as "super threatening." Players will work with the Rust King as they get acclimated to Burning Springs' cutthroat environment. In the accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGPRrcnJ5Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev chat</a>, the Fallout 76 team teased that the Rust King may have a role beyond this expansion.</p><p>Bethesda recently showed off a Fallout 76 update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-next-update-is-designed-to-make-camp-building-easier/1100-6534181/" data-ref-id="1100-6534181">makes building a C.A.M.P. easier</a>.

                <p>Microsoft announced some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">significant changes for Xbox Game Pass today</a>, headlined by a 50% price increase for Game Pass Ultimate, bringing it up to $30/month. But it may not be the last change for the service, according to at least one expert.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973424993909211530" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad</a>, Microsoft is betting that its console players stay loyal to Game Pass even at the higher price while the company continues to release more and more games on rival platforms like PS5 and Switch 2, in addition to its ongoing efforts in the PC market. Ahmad also suggested Microsoft could look at an ad-based tier for Game Pass to help the subscription service remain sustainable.</p><p>"The primary concern for Xbox at this time is managing the transition from a closed-console-based ecosystem to an open multi-device ecosystem. Console sales have dropped considerably, PC Game Pass uptake has been slow, and cloud is still seen as an extension of existing play, rather than a primary entry point," he said.</p><p>"The bet that Microsoft is making here is that its existing console base remains loyal to Game Pass at higher prices (or current prices with Premium), while it looks to ramp up growth on PC, PS5 and Switch 2 via day one / late ports that are fully priced," Ahmad added.</p><h2><strong>A Game Pass ad tier?</strong></h2><p>Can Game Pass remain sustainable for Microsoft against this backdrop? That's the "big question," Ahmad said. The company may look to a variety of sources to help grow Game Pass in the future, including by introducing an ad-supported tier, Ahmad said.</p><p>"The big question going forward is if Game Pass can be a sustainable product off console and how best they can reach this audience. At the very least that's going to require a lower entry cost (Essential) and experimentation with cloud only, ad supported, or mobile-first offerings," he said.</p><p>It's expected that Game Pass will continue to evolve over time, but whether or not the things Ahmad said, like an ad tier, come to fruition remains to be seen. How an ad-based version of Game Pass could work is unknown. Back in 2012, Square Enix launched an ad-based streaming game service called Coreonline before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-kills-ad-supported-streaming-service/1100-6417195/" data-ref-id="1100-6417195">killing it off 15 months later due to a lack of uptake from players.</a></p><p>For now, Game Pass Ultimate is going up in price from $20 to $30 per month, while the Core and Standard tiers have been renamed Essential and Premium (with no price hikes). For the increased price, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-are-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-the-new-game-pass-ultimate-perks/1100-6535143/" data-ref-id="1100-6535143">Ultimate subscribers are getting Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics</a> added to their memberships, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/94-new-game-pass-games-released-today-heres-the-full-list/2900-7083/" data-ref-id="2900-7083">a lot more games.</a></p><p>The price increases for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass come just ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> in November.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-fortnite-crew-and-a-ridiculous-price-increase.1314226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has announced a major shakeup of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, bringing more games to players across its four versions, including the addition of Ubisoft+ to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but with the top tier getting a staggering, frankly ridiculous 50% price increase because of this.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has long been the go-to tier for Game Pass, giving access to a library of games, Day One access to a bunch of new releases (including all first party games), cloud game streaming, and online console multiplayer. Now, Microsoft is guaranteeing at least 75 day one games will be added each year, and the addition of Ubisoft+ Classic and Fortnite Crew.</p>



<p>The price of Game Pass Ultimate has crept up in the last few years, and has stood at $19.99 and £14.99 per month since last summer. Now, though, the price is going up by 50% to $29.99 and £22.99 per month.</p>
<p>That’s justified by the Fortnite Crew addition, which is valued at $12 a month as it gives you the Fortnite Battle Pass and 1000 V Bucks each month, and the Ubisoft+ Classics library, which is valued at $8 per month. It’s starting to sound a bit like cable TV or Sky Sports, where you pay through the nose for a huge package of channels, even if you only really want the one thing.</p>

<p>This now puts a massive premium on Game Pass Ultimate and, while there’s additions and more promises, it feels like Microsoft is readjusting the business model in a way to compensate for “lost” revenue from first party game sales. If you see no value from Fortnite Crew or Ubisoft+, then this is just a huge price increase.</p>
<p>The other way to get day one games, in a more limited fashion, is with PC Game Pass. This is only usable with Windows PC – and with the upcoming Ally X handheld – and is going up from $11.99 / £9.99 to $16.49 &nbsp;/ £13.49. The only change here is the addition of Ubisoft+, getting it for $4.50 / £3.50.</p>
<p>Game Pass Standard has now been rebranded as Game Pass Premium, thankfully holding onto the same $14.99 / £10.99 price point. This is actually just becoming a better deal, as while you don’t have day one games, you will get Xbox published games added within a year of launch, and there is now priority cloud gaming for the Game Pass Premium library and for select games that you own.</p>
<p>The runt of the litter remains Game Pass Essential, which replaced Xbox Live Gold a good while ago. Sticking with $9.99 / £6.99 per month (and I believe still with a 12 month purchase possible) this is required for online gaming, and includes a much smaller selection of games. That’s been doubled now, from 25+ to 50+ games, and you can now access cloud gaming.</p>
<p>All of this comes down to how you use Game Pass to consume games. Do you like the additions to Game Pass Ultimate, or would you be reconsidering your subscription at this price point?</p>
