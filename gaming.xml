			<p>During The Game Awards 2024, Chinese publisher Netmarble aired a trailer for Game of Thrones: Kingsroad. If you were watching the show on a tiny screen at FullHD resolution or lower, it might have looked like everything Game of Thrones fans have ever wanted from a game based on Martin's beloved saga: an action-adventure RPG where we could stand side by side with the most important characters, who bore properly made likenesses and voiced by the real actors behind the award-winning HBO show.</p>
<p>However, if, like me, you were watching the show at 4K resolution and on a large TV, you likely immediately noticed that the visual quality was nowhere near those of other games that premiered in the show, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD Projekt RED's The Witcher IV</a>. In fact, it looked a couple of generations behind, especially when it comes to things like hair and clothes.</p>
<p>There's a simple explanation for that: Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is, sadly, a game for Android and iOS devices. Sure, mobile games have gotten a lot closer than they used to be, but when it comes to the triple-A segment, there's still a massive difference with PC and console games. Sure, a PC version might be released at some point, but it wouldn't be the same thing as developing natively for PC and consoles first.</p>
<p>Anyway, the game will put you in the role of a new character who unexpectedly becomes the heir to House Tyre, a small noble house from the North. The character is customizable both visually and in terms of classes, of which there are three: Sellsword, Knight, and Assassin.</p>
<p>Netmarble (which previously made a Game of Thrones <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-mmorpg-for-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMORPG</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-beyond-the-wall-rpg-is-now-available-for-iphone-and-ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn-based RPG</a>, both for mobile) shared the following statement from CEO Young-sig Kwon:</p>
<p><em>We believe Game of Thrones is a world rich with untold stories and adventures, and we’re pleased to bring Westeros to life in an exciting new way for gamers.</em></p>

<p>Netmarble aims to release Game of Thrones: Kingsroad at some point next year in Europe, America, the Middle East, Africa, and Oceania, while the timing for Asia hasn't been finalized yet.

That should mean improved colors and deeper blacks, and potentially improved response times.</p><p>We don’t have any specs or marketing claims yet, though, like the all-important battery life size. Nor have we gotten a glimpse of the ports on this system. There is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">an AMD Z2 Extreme chip coming</a> that could likely be the core of this handheld, but we don’t yet know.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">In my review of the original Legion Go</a>, I was mixed on the detachable controllers with their sharp-ish edges and loads of extra mouse buttons that made them awkward to hold. These one seem to be far more smoothly sculpted, though, with revised mouse buttons on the right detachable pad, and a cover you can place over the mounting rail so the copper charging pins don’t poke your palm.</p><p>The images we’ve seen do <em>not</em> feature a Steam button, so it’s quite likely Lenovo is still hedging its bets with Windows in addition to SteamOS.</p><p>But we <em>are</em> much more confident in our prediction that the smaller Lenovo Legion Go S will be a SteamOS handheld. Blass showed me filenames that suggest the S will be “powered by” Steam, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr#:~:text=Valve%20now%20has%20an%20explicit%20label%20for%20third%20parties%20to%20create%20%E2%80%9CPowered%20by%20SteamOS%E2%80%9D%20devices">mirroring Valve’s new branding guidelines</a> for “Powered by SteamOS” devices. </p><p>Valve defines “Powered by SteamOS” as “hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.” </p><p>We’ve reached out to Valve and Lenovo to hopefully learn more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been confirmed that Geralt of Rivia <strong>will indeed appear </strong>in The Witcher 4, but everyone involved is NDA’d out of their minds and can’t say exactly in what capacity he’ll surface.</p>



<p>It was just a few days ago that Doug Cockle, the veteran voice actor behind Geralt, confirmed that he’d ‘been slapped’ by CDPR for commenting about appearing in The Witcher 4. Now, CDPR itself has confirmed that Geralt will appear in the upcoming title, which was unveiled this week at The Game Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-path">On The Path</h2>



<p>In the first trailer for The Witcher 4, a few seconds were reserved right at the tail end for a line from Doug Cockle in true Geralt form. It referenced staying on ‘the path’ that Witchers follow, and it commented on this being the beginning of a new saga.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will star Ciri in a leading role, which shouldn’t come as a surprise to the franchise’s truest fans. It has always been about Ciri, after all – it was <strong>expected </strong>that she’d take up the mantle of ‘The Witcher’ in this all-new game from CDPR.</p>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, CD Projekt confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Geralt will appear in the game, but we don’t want to spoil his role precisely. You’ll have to wait to learn more for now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the end of Blood and Wine, the final expansion for 2015’s The Witcher 3, Geralt effectively retired to a vineyard in Toussaint. What he’s been doing since then is anyone’s guess, but it’s now assumed to be canonical that Ciri took up the silver sword and went Witchering in his place. </p>



<p>In the trailer for The Witcher 4, we see an empowered Ciri consuming potions and using signs, which means she’s undergone the Trial of the Grasses, at the very least.</p>



<p>Perhaps Geralt of Rivia will appear in The Witcher 4 in a similar role that Vesemir served in The Witcher 3, as a wise old mentor.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to own a 1/2 scale replica of The Witcher’s Ciri of Cintra? Well, thanks to Pure Arts, you can now do just that – but it’ll set you back $3,000.</p>



<p>Recently, the high-end collectables company unveiled a brand-new Ciri statue (nice timing), and it stands almost four feet tall. It’s limited to just 500 pieces and it’s arguably the most detailed statue I’ve seen in my entire life.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll invest in the ultimate Ciri statue?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unreal-detail">Unreal Detail</h2>



<p>Pure Arts’ Ciri of Cintra statue is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p>



<p>For $3,000, you’re getting a ‘hyperdetailed’ statue with glass eyes, individually punched synthetic hair, silicone skin, ‘real clothing’, and metal weapons. The team has assembled a design that uses real leather, hand-sewn elements, removable accessories, and a polyresin base for durability.</p>



<p>It weighs a whopping 14 kilos – 20.5 kilos if you include the packaging.</p>



<p>The statue depicts Ciri as she appears in 2015’s The Witcher 3, standing on a plinth alongside a piece of headgear (or perhaps <em>a head</em>) from one of the riders of The Wild Hunt. She’s midway through drawing her silver sword, looking intense and standing ready for a fight.</p>



<p>Pure Arts has also produced a similar statue of Geralt of Rivia. It’s almost the same size and weight as the Ciri statue, but the team has ramped up the detail on this one, individually implanting each beard hair on his face. It’s unparalleled, truly.</p>



<p>It’ll cost up to $300 to have these items shipped, and the Geralt of Rivia statue costs $3,499 for starters, so you’ll need to be prepared to part ways with a pretty penny to secure these figures.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll invest? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Game director Alex Cox recently talked about why the team at Hangar 13 chose that setting and time for the new Mafia game after the latest entries were set in later time periods of mob history.</p><p>Cox said in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/12/12/mafia-the-old-country-preview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with Xbox </a>that while the first three Mafia games explored different eras of the American mafia, the team "loved the idea of heading to Sicily and exploring the early years of this fearsome crime organization."</p><p>For comparison, the original Mafia took place in the 1930s, with Mafia II picking up in the 1940s. Mafia III, meanwhile, was set in the late 1960s.</p><p>Cox went on to say that making The Old Country has been a "refreshing departure" for Hangar 13, as its staffers got to work on elements of the "rugged Sicilian countryside" as opposed to the busy cities of the other Mafia games.</p><p>"Building this story has been a great experience for everyone at Hangar 13--first learning about Sicilian history and the origins of the Mafia, then adapting that into an exciting criminal adventure," Cox said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrB-tEzp7ag" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FrB-tEzp7ag" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In particular, though, Cox said he's excited about elements of the time period, including horses, vintage vehicles, and knife duels. Taking place in the early 1900s means cars with hand-crank engines will appear in The Old Country, he said. "We've never had the player riding on horseback before! Galloping across the Sicilian countryside feels incredibly freeing and is unlike anything we've done in the past," Cox explained.</p><p>While no entry in the Mafia series has been set completely in Sicily, the first mission in Mafia II, titled <a href="https://mafiagame.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Country_(Mafia_II_Chapter)" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Old Country</a>, takes players to Sicily in 1943.</p><p>Developers from Hangar 13 visited Sicily to get a firsthand look and feel for the island and its culture. Cox went on to say that Hangar 13 has been working with a "local Sicilian partner" that gave the studio "invaluable guidance." The team also consulted Sicilian history experts to help the developers nail down things like era-appropriate bricks, music, and even swear words.</p><p>Because The Old Country is set in the early 1900s, players won't have access to modern weapons, so the game aims to make combat feel "more tactical and deliberate."</p><p>"We've leaned heavily into the 'tools of the trade' of a Sicilian Mafioso, from lupara shotguns to stiletto blades. There's real grit to these older, more traditional weapons," Cox said.</p><p>Finally, although The Old Country features a new main cast of characters and aims to appeal to newcomers to the series, Cox said existing fans "will get a kick out of how Mafia: The Old Country connects to the rest [of the franchise]."</p><p>The Old Country releases Summer 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

By the looks of it, there are a few differences between the game and the series. In images Netflix has released of the game, players appear to be able to wield items like bats and balls. Also, the infamous glass bridge challenge appears to now let players all run across the bridge at the same time instead of individually like on the show. Also, a massive piggy bank swinging from a chain doesn’t look like it’s going to be easy to get past at the end of the bridge. </p><p>Alain Tascan, president of games at Netflix, spoke about what players can expect from the game at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032">The Game Awards</a></span>. <em>“Squid Game: Unleashed</em> is all about playing with (or against) your friends in the iconic games from the series like Glass Bridge and Red Light Green Light, so we’re inviting everyone into the chaos this holiday season.” </p><p>The second season of <em>Squid Game</em> premieres on December 26. You can catch up on the series by bingeing the first season, and then follow it up by trying to win the game yourself.

                <p>Bandai Namco is making a bold pivot for Pac-Man’s 45th anniversary next year with Shadow Labyrinth. Announced at The Game Awards, the new game is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-reimagined-as-a-hollow-knight-inspired-2d-action-platformer-shadow-labyrinth/1100-6528429/" data-ref-id="1100-6528429">wild reimagining of the iconic yellow puck</a>. Instead of a family-friendly arcade game, Shadow Labyrinth is a much darker take on the franchise that appears to pull inspiration from hits like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest. The intriguing title is slated to launch on PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025, and preorders are already available for the physical Switch and PS5 versions at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DPLL3428,B0DPLKXWT5,B0DPLKM2FG,B0DPLLQ74T&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/6kwrmksiyyrfk?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/1734115488128?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. Multiple editions are available, including a limited Secret Edition that's packed with extras.</p><h2>Shadow Labyrinth Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Preordering at Best Buy unlocks the digital bonus “Original Arcade Sound FX.” It’s unclear if this is a retailer exclusive, or if others will offer the content when preorders become available elsewhere.

                <p>Nearly 20 years after its release, Okami is getting a sequel. The project was announced during The Game Awards, and while we still don’t have a specific release date or platforms, Hideki Kamiya is confirmed to be spearheading the game. That means you have plenty of time to play through the original in anticipation of Okami 2, and right now, you can grab the Steam version of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fanatical.com%252Fen%252Fgame%252Fokami-hd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fprep-for-okami-2-with-this-deal-for-nearly-60-off-okami-hd-on-pc%2F1100-6528465%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Okami HD</a> for just $8.59 (was $20) on Fanatical. This deal expires on December 25, so you only have a couple of weeks to cash in on the offer.</p><p>Though Okami was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/okami-review/1900-6157846/" data-ref-id="1900-6157846">originally launched on PS2 in 2006</a>, it was remastered and released as Okami HD on various platforms, including a port to PC in 2017. Okami HD kept the game’s iconic sumi-e ink art style intact while enhancing the game with HD visuals, making this the definitive version to play in 2024. Okami takes about 30 hours to complete--but with no launch date revealed for Okami 2, you should have plenty of time to explore its memorable world.</p><p>Along with your purchase, you also get a 5%-off coupon code to use on your next Fanatical purchase.</p><p>Looking for even more PC deals?

CWA <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/zenimax-online-studios-workers-form-latest-video-game-union-communications-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that Microsoft has recognized the union, in accordance with the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/10/13/microsoft-affirms-commitment-to-labor-principles-cwa-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality agreement</a> it signed with CWA in 2023.</p><p>According to CWA, ZOS United (a very cool name for a union that will look rad on a tshirt) is made up of 461 members including artists, designers, web developers, and engineers. Most are based in Maryland.&nbsp;</p><p>“With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace, including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits – in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about,” ZOS United wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhqnqfs26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>.</p><p>ZeniMax more broadly is home to a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23495140/microsoft-zenimax-media-union-vote-qa-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA union</a> that staged <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/zenimax-union-workers-strike-in-protest-of-microsoft-remote-work-and-outsourcing-policies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strike in November</a> over return-to-work and outsourcing policies.

I love movies and games about isolation. I think, in my ideal reality, I’d be aimlessly floating in a little space station, with excellent wifi and perhaps a module for my wife and kid. When I see such circumstances represented in games, I’m always absolutely intrigued. From <em>No Man’s Sky</em> to <em>Subnautica</em> to <em>Raft</em> to 2008's <em>Minecraft </em>even, I’m so drawn into the serenity of solitude. And despite having a name I cannot remember thirteen seconds after last typing it, <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> immediately gave me those same vibes.</p><p>It’s not a genre vibe, I should add. Clearly this looks like a fighty-fighty game that sees you battling evil robots, rather than some sort of survival sim. It’s just about being someone who’s content with their own company. A misanthrope? No, not quite. Let’s go with “introvert.”</p><p>I also just instantly liked the character. Apparently she’s called Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter, clearly pursuing an obsession that her agent wishes she’d leave  alone. The newspaper clippings on her ship show that she used to be part of a legendary band of criminals called the Five Aces, and among their number was the person she’s now chasing: Colin Graves, played by actor Kumail Nanjiani (<em>The Big Sick</em>, <em>The Eternals</em>). We can extrapolate that the gang broke up, and now she’s hunting them all down.</p><p>Mun, played by Tati Gabrielle, is just so immediately personable. She’s twinkle-eyed, gleeful in her refusal to follow her agent’s advice, and thanks to some stunning motion capture and art, conveys vast amounts about her character through the smallest expressions. I want to hang, except neither of us would actually want to hang. We’d nod at one another, then sit at separate ends of the ship.</p><figure id="" data-id="fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-recommend-id="image://fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-recommend-id="image://fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And while the hitting a robot with a sword element of the trailer didn’t exactly make me leap out of my chair in delight, I’m finding myself in the weird position of being delighted that this is a Naughty Dog game, despite my, er, not exactly enthusiastic history with the studio’s output.</p><p>In fact, when it comes to Naughty Dog’s games, I’m quite the downer. I absolutely cannot stand <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>—it seems like the anathema of gaming to me, a game in which you can’t see where you’re going and have to fail to progress: bleurgh. It’s <em>Rick Dangerous 3D</em>. Then, due to my being pretty much PC-only during the PS2/3 era, I totally missed out on the first releases in the <em>Uncharted</em> series. When <em>The Last of Us</em> came out I was intrigued, but then I instantly absolutely detested it. I hated it! Like, in a way I would normally characterize as somewhat problematic in a person!</p><p>I hated the way it so callously killed a child purely as a means to give motivation to some dullard bloke (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-tv-show-ps5-game-remake-episode-1849995987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-tv-show-ps5-game-remake-episode-1849995987">I wrote about this in more detail a while back</a></span>), and I hated that it was a cover shooter at a time when <em>everything </em>was a cover shooter. I found it arrogant and irritating in the extreme! </p><figure id="" data-id="9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-recommend-id="image://9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-recommend-id="image://9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, I’m not defending any of this as some sort of critical position. It’s pure emotion, a visceral reaction that is quite unlike me, and given so many people whose opinions and intelligence I love and respect enjoy the game so much, I feel sure I am missing out. (I’ll still argue that it was a grotesque, awful “fridging” though, and probably fold my arms.)</p><p>But I did eventually catch up on <em>Uncharted</em>, and big news: those games are great! I really enjoyed them! I had issues, and bloody hell, crates. But yeah, really lovely games, with—and here’s the key—fantastic, personable storytelling.</p><p>And it’s this that makes me think, “Actually, maybe I’ll bother to grind through yet more hitting robots with swords, if it means I get to experience acting as good as I saw in this trailer and a story deserving of that character, I’m in. (Shout-out to whoever is playing the agent as well—I loved her delivery so much too!) I’m ready to go. I have such good vibes! I want to be the cool space criminal bounty hunter who thrives on her own!</p><p>Of course, it could end up being be stinky-poops (a critical term you likely aren’t familiar with). I don’t know! No one does. Forming conclusions on this game after a single trailer would be perhaps <em>deeply</em> stupid. But if I’m going to allow myself a moment of vibes-based enthusiasm, of all the games in that teetering pile of commercials, this is the game that got me. I’m excited.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
