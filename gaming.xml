            <p>A while back Ubisoft revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-is-finally-heading-to-feudal-japan-plus-one-with-blair-witch-vibes">about a billion Assassin's Creed projects</a>. The first of these to leap into the carefully placed haystack of release was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage/">Mirage</a>, which I liked. Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and it's getting an "official cinematic world premiere trailer" debut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8">on YouTube tomorrow</a>, at 5pm BST.</p>
<p>Also, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The text is gone now, but a couple of screencaps made their way into the wild (h/t <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-seemingly-leaked-by-ubisoft-in-its-own-trailer-placeholder/">GamesRadar</a>). Lending credence to this possible date are the facts that a) we already knew Shadows was supposed to come out before the end of the financial year - so, by March 2025, and b) every single main AC game has come out in November or October.</p>
<p>Shadows is supposedly going to be another full-sized AC game in the vein of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Valhalla</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Odyssey</a>'s massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open worlds</a>, which means you will probably see me screaming about it needing to be smaller and less full of busywork. Mirage was smaller but it was still big! And it was really fun!</p>
<p>Anyway. Personal bugbears aside, I wouldn't expect too much from the cinematic trailer, partly because it's a cinematic trailer, which means nothing for what the game will actually be like, but also because I'd predict bigger reveal-sauce will be saved to spray all over Geoff Keighley's eager face at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest</a> in June. I am actually excited for this game, by the way, I really like Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>Also worth keeping an eye on is any news about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-infinity">Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>, a sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-infinity-still-exists-is-still-a-confusing-assassins-creed-live-service-maybe">Assassin's Creed-specific hub... launcher... thing</a>. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">an interview with Eurogamer</a> in 2022, chief Assassin's Creed man Marc-Alexis Coté said the plan is for Infinity to arrive alongside Shadows. Is that still the plan? Who knows!</p>
<p>Remember to check back on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8">that YouTube video</a> after work tomorrow to see a dramatic trailer with all action music and silhouettes and that.</p>

            <p>Square Enix is reportedly preparing to lay off an unconfirmed number of workers as part of restructuring efforts.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/">VGC</a>, staff were said to have been informed during an internal meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>According to those in attendance, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu said teams in America and Europe would be affected over the next month, mainly in its publishing, IT, and indie divisions.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Square Enix for further comment.</p>
<p>In the company's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-embarking-on-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-as-profits-drop-70">quarterly financials published yesterday</a>, Square Enix announced its plans to implement a new strategy following a disappointing financial year after many titles "failed to live up to profit expectations, especially outsourced titles and some AAA titles."</p>
<p>This will involve "rebuild[ing] its overseas business divisions from the ground up" and "structural reforms" to optimise costs at its European and American offices.</p>

        <p>A Nordic publishing veteran is using a data-centric approach in a bid to re-invent video games publishing, and early results suggest he’s onto something</p>

    </div>

            <p>One need only take to their social media platform of choice to gauge the popularity of publishers among modern gamers. Some are bemoaned for crippling previously successful studios with the imposition of unwanted live service models, while others are lamented for implementing unpopular matchmaking algorithms that prioritise retention over connection quality or fair team composition. Certainly, while most big studios can boast of healthy fan support (look at the devotion enjoyed by From Software or Larian Studios, for instance), you don’t come across many vocal EA or Ubisoft fanboys.</p>
<p>Of course, in reality publishers play a vital role in promoting both the success and therefore financial health of the creative forces that make the video game industry what it is. However, it is fair to argue that, at a time when the AAA model that has ruled the roost for decades is under more threat than ever opportunities await for those who strive to evolve.</p>
<p>Sebastian Bastani is a AAA publishing veterans, having left a successful career in food to pursue his love of games, eventually heading up Activision Blizzard’s Nordic sales operations. Following a further fruitful three years at Funcom, for the last year he and the Re-koup team have been going it alone in pursuit of what Bastani describes as what “publishing as it should be”.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The whole concept of Re-koup is to rethink the relationship between the publisher and the studio."</p></blockquote>
<p>Lamenting the trappings that come with working for a large company, the Re-koup founder explains: “I love to execute things. I love to be where it happens. I want to be there at the forefront negotiating good game deals, or evaluating partnerships, or making decisions that promote positive change.” Escaping the transatlantic bureaucracy of international publishing means he is finally free to make educated, data-led decisions that, instead of being imposed by a remote parent, are born from both many years of experience and an understanding of the surprisingly simple techniques studios of any size can exploit to improve the success of their new and back catalogues.</p>
<p>Of course, the best part of a decade at one of the world’s largest publishers does come with its perks. Not only does it provide a contacts book which opens more doors than most, but it also means your bar for success is a high one. “Working on those kinds of titles, you always have to think big,” Bastani adds. “The targets are so high and the impact has to be enormous every time. Even though we now work with smaller budgets, we maintain that ‘think big’ approach.”</p><figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SebastianBastani.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>“Along with that passion for business is also a passion for change. The whole concept of Re-koup is to rethink the relationship between the publisher and studio. Look at the music industry, which has many synergies with games. The games industry is basically now on the same digital journey that changed music. How artists get their music out there and get paid has been a major discussion, but looking at games, we still essentially have traditional publishers doing the same thing they’ve always done. We need to change this; we need to do something totally different, something that puts the studio first. I mean, developers are our songwriters and performers. As an industry, we need to place the focus back on our creators.”</p>
<p>Re-koup was established with the ability to help studios at many points along the development process. The firm acts like an in-house publishing team, promoting both the IP and the studio.It is not only the IP that sell games it´s also the consumer perception of the studio’s brand and creditability</p>
<p>Its network of investment partners can help finance exciting concepts, while Bastani knows all there is to know about launching a game. But of course, it doesn’t end there – even if a game has shipped and its makers have long since moved onto to other things, a world of potential success remains for the taking if studios let the data guide their way.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We know for a fact that lifecycle management can have a huge impact."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“When seeking investment, you can go to a VC and give up a lot of equity, partly losing some control of your company, or you can go to a publisher that probably wants to take your IP and have a controlling stake in the game design,” Bastani argues. “So no matter what, you either lose part of your company or you lose a lot of creative freedom. Our private investors are thinking about just one thing – is this a good investment? Can I double or triple my money if I invest? The art of making games is not something they’d pretend to know about.”</p>
<p>This is Re-koup’s fundraising and self-publishing service, where they green light a pitch and the rest is up to the studio, giving the team 100% creative freedom while having Re-koup in the background as their own in-house publishing team.</p>
<p>Another service the firm offers is around long-tail revenue for a game that has already been released. For this, Re-koup will only take a share of the additional sales it generates. When a partnership is struck, an agreement of a title’s anticipated base sales is made, created from a thorough analysis of sales patterns and market conditions. Re-koup then takes its share of any additional revenue beyond this baseline. If for whatever reason it fails to increase sales as forecast, then Re-koup gets no money at all. The deal is essentially risk free for studios, who are only surrendering a small slice of sales that would otherwise not exist.</p>

<p>“Our long-tail revenue model makes sure nothing is ‘stolen’ from the studio – it’s important to us that the studio feels comfortable that we are not tapping into revenue they would have still got without our help,” Bastani elaborates. “By looking at historical data, it is quite easy to establish a natural yearly sales decay. Things become a bit more tricky if a studio plans to launch their first DLC during our partnership, as the potential sales uplift needs to be accurately predicted. We have, however, done this for many titles in the past and have a very good sense of what to expect. In the end, the studio has to agree with our sales estimations in order for us to enter a partnership.”</p>
<p>Re-koup’s modelling is flexible enough to account for both games that continue to be supported post-launch, as well as those that are not and even back catalogue releases. Adds Bastani: “One of the great things with this service is that ongoing title support from the studio is absolutely not required. We are able to maximize sales and revenue intake of their game even if the studio has already moved onto a new project.”</p>
<p>It looks good on paper, but digging down into some of Re-koup’s early numbers is equally as impressive.</p>
<p>Papa’s Quiz from Swedish studio Old Apes launched on Steam back in December 2020 and then on consoles throughout 2021. Re-koup came on board in late 2023 and immediately the game enjoyed its best ever month in terms of revenue. And by far, too, with numbers jumping 278 per cent year-on-year In the same period, units were up 415 per cent year-on-year. Bastani adds somewhat humbly that some of this was down to luck thanks to the game being picked up by a popular influencer, but of course it was Re-koup itself that initiated the influencer outreach program.</p>

<p>“Over the years we've met a lot of influencers, content creators and streamers and we've been smart about collecting their information,” he explains. “The first thing that we always do when we start working with a new studio and their game.</p>
<p>There’s more to it than that, of course.. Bastani emphasises that discoverability is, in his opinion, the single biggest challenge facing any new release, and much of the publisher’s work focuses on improving this.</p>
<p>In the case of Papa’s Quiz, Re-koup immediately addressed the game’s Steam tags to help get the right eyeballs on its Steam page, and adjusted the frequency of sales promotions, along with the amount of discount applied. As a result, the game’s impressions soon jumped from 86,000 per month to 235,000. The language on the Steam page was adjusted, too, to be more descriptive of the game experience and to appeal to fans of the appropriate genre.</p>
<p>Re-koup then increased the game’s base price from $9.99, which it felt was too low, to $12.99 without suffering any unit sale losses. It also tapped up its network of first and third party partners to garner the game additional exposure on digital storefronts.</p>
<p>“We got a lot of curated support from first and third parties by leveraging all of their different marketing and sales vehicles in a strategic and coordinated way,” Bastani says. “And the end result was that the studio was very happy. We've been working with them for five months now and the results have been really, really good.”</p>
<blockquote><p>"The deal is essentially risk free for studios, who are only surrendering a small slice of sales that would otherwise not exist"</p></blockquote>
<p>Inspector Schmidt: A Bavarian Tale, from German developer Active Fungus Studios, is another success story. Despite a fairly positive critical reception, sales of the title quickly fell off a cliff shortly after its launch in February 2023.</p>
<p>“The first thing that we did was to change the name of the game from the very German-facing A Bavarian Tale – Totgeschwiegen to ‘Inspector Schmidt: A Bavarian Tale’,” Bastani says. “We sent out influencer codes, although this time we also ran a small paid campaign costing $3k. Along with securing some renewed support from third-parties, we regained a lot of the game’s previous visibility.”</p>
<p>Unit sales jumped 663% year-on-year jump in March, while revenue increased 66% in February and 114% in March. Perhaps it’s no surprise then that, while Re-koup has clients with games that are still in early development or approaching release, this demonstrable success in managing the notoriously tricky long-tail is leading to a lot of demand.</p>
<p>“In games we talk a lot about pre-launch and a lot about launch, obsessing over Wishlists and the like. But we very seldom hear discussions about what happens afterwards,” Bastani observes. “For some reason, we only focus on the first two thirds of a game’s lifecycle. Having worked in the industry for 10 or 15 years now and across some 150 or so games, we know for a fact that lifecycle management can have a huge impact.</p>
<p>“Re-koup’s average revenue uplift across all its clients currently stands at 40 per cent. From a technical perspective there’s a ton you can do – maxing out the number of campaigns, being dynamic in the way you set discounts and ensuring you enter the right promotions with the right discounts. Make sure that you utilise partners, properly look at your Steam data and learn how to work with the algorithm a bit. Think about where your visitors are coming from. Identify where the problems are. Is it click-through? Is it conversion. The methodology works and every time we manage to increase sales.”</p>

            <p>Sony has released its full-year financial results, showing a solid twelve months for its PlayStation business ahead of a year in which it is forecasting declines.</p>
<p>The platform holder saw net sales for its Game &amp; Network Services division, which includes PlayStation, rise by 17% year-on-year to ¥4.3 trillion ($27.5 billion), while operating income rose 16% to ¥290.2 billion ($1.9 billion).</p>
<p>Sony also managed to ship 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units throughout the fiscal year. This was an improvement on the 19.1 million managed in the previous year, but fell slightly short of its 21 million target. This in itself was already reduced from an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-aims-to-sell-25m-ps5-units-by-april-2024">initial target of 25 million</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside its financial results, Sony announced new leadership for PlayStation with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-names-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-as-its-new-ceos">Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino taking over from Jim Ryan as joint CEOs</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know:</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p><em>Full-year (12 months ended March 31, 2024)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥11.3 trillion ($72.2 billion, up 12% year-on-year)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income: </strong>¥1.04 trillion ($6.6 billion, up 5%)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services net sales: </strong>¥4.3 trillion ($27.5 billion, up 17%)</li>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services operating income: </strong>¥290.2 billion ($1.9 billion, up 16%)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Q4 (3 months ended March 31, 2024)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥2.8 trillion ($17.9 billion, up 9%)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income: </strong>¥203.3 billion ($1.3 billion, up 115%)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services net sales: </strong>¥1.1 trillion ($7.03 billion, up 2.2%)</li>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services operating income: </strong>¥135.8 billion ($868 million, up 172.5%)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>Breaking down the full-year results for its G&amp;NS division, Sony reported software sales of ¥2.2 trillion ($14.1 billion, up 24% year-on-year), of which digital software and add-ons accounted for ¥1.9 trillion ($12.1 billion, up 27%).</p>
<p>The platform holder said 286.4 million games were sold for PS5 during the course of the year, of which 39.7 million were first-party titles. By comparison, the previous fiscal year saw 264.2 million games sold, of which 43.5 million were first-party.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-hits-59m-as-helldivers-2-breaks-playstations-launch-sales-record/">VGC</a>, Sony announced during its earnings webcast that Helldivers 2 sold 12 million copies in 12 weeks across PC and PS5. The company said this was "far exceeding expectations" and makes it the fastest-selling PlayStation game launch to date.</p>
<p>Hardware revenues saw a 9% boost at ¥1.7 trillion ($10.9 billion), which there was decent growth in revenue from network services — including PlayStation Plus — at ¥545.5 billion ($3.5 million, up 17%).</p>
<p>There were 118 million active PSN users at the end of Q4 (three months ended March 31, 2024) — down from the 123 million reported at the end of Q3 but up from 108 million marked at the same time last year.</p>
<p>The success of the G&amp;NS division was cited as a key factor in Sony's overall results, as well as increases in its music, financial services, and imaging and sensing solutions segments.</p>
<p>PlayStation's forecast for the new financial year reaffirmed the company's previously stated expectation of a decrease in hardware sales, but this will also deliver a decrease in hardware losses.</p>
<p>The platform holder expects an increase in non-first-party sales and a decrease in first-party, due in no small part to the fact there will be <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-generates-93-billion-in-holiday-quarter-but-expects-hardware-decline-in-2024">no new entries from PlayStation's blockbuster franchises until the following fiscal year</a>.</p>
<p>The forecast also predicts an increase in sales from network services, mainly PlayStation Plus as Sony grows its subscription service.</p>
<h2>The forecast</h2>
<p><em>FY24 (12 months ended March 31, 2025)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales: </strong>¥11.4 trillion ($72.9 billion, up 1%)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income: </strong>¥1.13 trillion ($7.2 billion, up 9%)</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services net sales: </strong>¥4.2 trillion ($26.8 billion, down 1.5%)</li>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services operating income: </strong>¥310 billion ($2 billion, up 6.8%)</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Square Enix has been hit by a round of layoffs, impacting employees in its US and European offices as part of "structural reforms".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how many people are affected, but as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/">VGC</a> reports, staff were informed during an internal meeting on Monday. Eurogamer has contacted Square Enix for comment.
</p>
<p>
The layoffs will happen over the next month, with employees in publishing, IT, and the indie games division Square Enix Collective most affected.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Newscast: Why are there so many games industry layoffs?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ScDpS3rrhY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>

UK employees will enter a one month consultancy period, as per local employment law. US employees could leave their positions even sooner.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Square Enix released its latest financial report, in which the company stated it had "begun optimising costs at its European and American offices via structural reforms" as part of a plan to "rebuild overseas business divisions from the ground up".
</p>
<p>
As company president Takashi Kiryu has previously stated, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">Square Enix is undergoing a revision of its development system</a> to improve the quality of its games.

</p>
<p>
Yesterday's report provided further details on its medium-term business strategy, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">plans to "aggressively" pursue a multiplatform strategy</a> across Nintendo consoles, PlayStation, Xbox and PC.

</p>
<p>
It aims to be "bold" in creating new franchises as part of a shift from quantity to quality, balancing developer creativity with data from customers and the wider market.
</p>
<p>
However, following the release of the report, shares in Square Enix fell by 16 percent, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/square-enix-shares-tumble-by-most-in-13-years-on-weak-outlook-1.2072502">Bloomberg</a> reported, which is the company's biggest decline in 13 years.

</p>
<p>
Despite the release of big games like Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, profits have fallen due to high development costs, a decline in MMO and mobile games, and the write-off of £112m worth of in-development projects.
</p>
<p>
And while the company is streamlining its development efforts, it will take time for this to translate into sales, Kiryu said.
</p>
<p>
Layoffs at Square Enix follow the likes of Sony, Microsoft, Sega and more, as well as smaller companies. Check out our feature on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">video game layoffs across the industry</a>.

<p data-characters="296" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Everyone already knows <em>Helldivers 2</em> has been a smash success for publisher Sony, but there were never any hard sales figures for it. Now, Sony itself has confirmed the game has pushed over 12 million units across PlayStation 5 and PC, making it the fastest-selling PlayStation launch of all time.</p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">Sony shared this during a webcast to discuss its financial results for the company’s fiscal year ending in March 2024 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-hits-59m-as-helldivers-2-breaks-playstations-launch-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). It described <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s sales as “far exceeding expectations,” having sold 12 million units in its first 12 weeks. That means, on average, it was selling a million copies every week since its February 8 launch.</p> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="polar warbond helldivers 2 soldier" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot via PlayStation’s YouTube channel</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">This is extra impressive when you remember <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man 2</a></em>, the big-budget PS5 exclusive starring one of the most popular superheroes in the world, only <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/marvels-spider-man-2-sales-zip-past-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the 10 million sales mark this February</a>, four months after its launch. Not only that, but the previous record holder for fastest-selling PlayStation game was <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-god-of-war-ragnarok-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Ragnarök</a></em>, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks.</p> <p data-characters="632" data-current-count="1010" data-injectable="true">While <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s success was obvious even without exact figures (it was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-still-outselling-everything-else-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the UK’s best-selling game two months in a row</a>), it’s nice to actually put a number to it. As for how it achieved such a record, there’s no doubt multiple contributing factors. For starters, it launching on PS5 and PC the same day would have helped simply because it allowed more people to play it than if it had been PS5 only. Not to mention it quickly fostered a dedicated community of players and a strong social media presence, which combined would’ve helped to attract new players who otherwise may have missed out on it.</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">Furthermore, Helldivers 2 is simply much cheaper than the likes of <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>. Whereas those games were sold at $70 / £70, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a far more affordable $40 / £35. Plus, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is enjoying continuous updates whilst <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> are one and done single-player adventures. $40 for a game that’s frequently adding new content is arguably far more enticing than a $70 game you can complete from start to finish in a month or two.</p>
 <p data-characters="645" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="false">Sony will most likely want to keep supporting <em>Helldivers 2</em> in the long-term, though it’s already demonstrated that it’s quite easy to kneecap the game’s popularity. The decision to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-bringing-back-mandatory-playstation-accounts-for-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">force everyone to get a PlayStation account for the game</a>, which would’ve resulted in it becoming unplayable in multiple countries, almost felt like the end-times for <em>Helldivers 2</em> and would’ve culled its playerbase <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-backpedals-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-plans-after-3-days-of-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had Sony not pulled a U-turn</a>. Going forward, Sony may be more careful with how it handles <em>Helldivers 2</em>. After all, it’s a golden goose for the company right now and the last thing it will want to do is squander it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pricing-and-season-pass-dlc-plan-have-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release date leak</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows also got its pricing and season pass/DLC plan leaked, although through another source.</p>
<p>This info was <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft_Frax/status/1790110727774130281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> on Twitter by Ubisoft leaker Frax, who wrote that Assassin's Creed Shadows will be priced at £59.99 (so, likely $69.99) for the base edition. Frax also revealed info on the Season Pass, which will include two expansions, and the currency packs purchasable in-game through microtransactions.</p>
<p><em>Season Pass - $/€40</em><br>
<em>Welcome Pack (4200 Helix) - $/€35</em><br>
<em>Expansion 1 - $/€25</em><br>
<em>Expansion 2 - $/€25</em></p>
<p><strong><em>—-Currency Packs—-</em></strong><br>
<em>500 Helix - $/€5</em><br>
<em>1050 Helix - $/€10</em><br>
<em>2300 Helix - $/€20</em><br>
<em>4200 Helix - $/€35</em><br>
<em>6600 Helix - $/€55</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows, formerly codenamed Assassin's Creed Red, was announced by Ubisoft during the September 2022 franchise showcase. At that time, Vice President and Brand Executive Producer Marc-Alexis Côté said:</p>
<p><em>This is Codename: Red, our next premium flagship title and the future of our open-world RPG games on Assassin's Creed. It is being developed by Ubisoft Québec, the studio behind Assassin's Creed Odyssey, under the creative direction of Jonathan Dumont.</em></p>
<p><em>It will let players explore one of their most awaited settings ever on the franchise, feudal Japan, and they'll live a very powerful shinobi fantasy.</em></p>
<p>Last year, Insider Gaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-red-to-feature-samurai-and-shinobi-as-main-characters-focus-on-stealth-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that there will be two playable characters in the game: a female samurai and an African refugee shinobi. The report also highlighted an increased focus on stealth, with mechanics borrowed from franchises like HITMAN and Splinter Cell. That would certainly fit a game titled Assassin's Creed Shadows. Later, we learned there would be some <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-red-early-2024-reveal-destructible-environments-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destructible environments</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-reds-gameplay-inspired-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mechanics inspired by FromSoftware's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> (a posture bar that will have to be broken to get through the enemy's defenses).</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, players can <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-red-to-feature-ray-traced-global-illumination-and-virtual-geometry-stealth-to-be-expanded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look forward to</a> virtual geometry, ray traced global illumination, and improvements to the weather system and animations.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be released on November 15. While the official reveal is slated for tomorrow at 9 AM Pacific Time, it is likely that we'll get a lot more info during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forward-returns-on-june-10-with-the-latest-on-ubisoft-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Forward event</a> scheduled to go live on June 10 from Los Angeles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has announced during its financial report that Helldivers 2 has sold an impressive 12 million units in its first 12 weeks.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 has been a tremendous success for developer Arrowhead Game Studios and its publisher, PlayStation. The figure makes Helldivers 2 one of PlayStation’s fastest-selling first-party games of all time, up there with God of War Ragnarok, which sold 11 million units in 10 weeks.</p>



<p>The impressive figure comes following controversy earlier this month, which saw Helldivers 2 get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands of negative Steam reviews</a> due to a PSN linking policy — A policy which PlayStation later reversed. </p>



<p>It’s unclear how many of the game’s sales were attributed to PC, but with an all-time concurrent player peak of 458,709, it’s not hard to imagine it in the millions. As such, the success of the game puts a huge question mark on Sony’s future strategy with its first-party titles, with the success of the game suggesting that it could be a strategy replicated moving forward.</p>



<p>Microsoft is already seemingly on board with the strategy of releasing its first-party games on other platforms. While the company hasn’t confirmed any other releases past its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-available-ps5-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original 4</a>, it’s likely only a matter of time before more announcements come.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-new-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix announced</a> that it will move away from console exclusivity and will take a multi-platform approach.</p>



<p>Despite Helldivers 2’s success, though, the company saw a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">29% year-over-year decrease</a> in its hardware sales for the quarter, which could also imply a change in first-party strategy moving forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has reported that its PlayStation 5 sales dropped 29% YoY in its latest financial report, selling a total of 20.8 million units in FY23.</p>



<p>The number is slightly below Sony’s previously revised estimations that the company would sell 21 million units. The company also expects console sales to decline, which would be the first time that PlayStation 5 sales fall below the previous year. Sony expects 18 million units to be sold in FY24.</p>



<p>Last year, Sony announced that the PlayStation 5 is entering its “later stages” of this generation. While the company’s sales approximations are not surprising, they do pose a bigger question about console m market growth. As of June 2022, the PlayStation 4 sold 117 million units, whereas the PlayStation 5 has sold 52.6 million as of now. Even with 18 million units sold for the next three years (when the PlayStation 6 is expected to be released), the numbers suggest that the console market isn’t growing.</p>



<p>In April 2024, Microsoft also reported that its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xboxrevenue-up-and-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware sales were down by 31%</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PlayStation 5 sales and the console market as a whole? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

			<p>Today, alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its financial report</a>, Sony announced a new leadership structure for its PlayStation division (Sony Interactive Entertainment). Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-head-jim-ryan-retires-in-march-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">departure of Jim Ryan</a>, they had been looking for a new Chief Executive Officer; as it turns out, they found two.</p>
<p>Hermen Hulst, formerly Senior Vice President and Head of PlayStation Studios and, before that, Studio Head at Guerrilla Games, will be the new CEO of the Studio Business Group. He'll focus on the development, publishing, and business operations of all first-party PlayStation content.</p>
<p>Hulst said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>I am thrilled to lead the studio business group and continue to build on our success with PlayStation 5 while preparing for the future. The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world and has been built on the marriage of content and technology, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of play and entertainment.</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, Nishino, formerly Senior Vice President of the Platform Experience Group, will take the role of CEO of SIE's Platform Business Group, focusing on technology, products, services, the platform experience, and third-party operations.</p>
<p>Nishino stated:</p>
<p><em>We will continue to connect players and creators through world-class products, services, and technology. We always strive to grow our community even bigger with innovation in every area at Sony Interactive Entertainment. I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen. By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future.</em></p>
<p>For his part, Hiroki Totoki (Interim CEO at SIE and President, COO and CFO at Sony Group Corporation) added:</p>
<p><em>Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology. These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences.</em></p>
<p>In other PlayStation news, several insiders including Jeff Grubb and <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1790172881009390006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dusk Golem</a> believe a PlayStation Showcase is inbound later this month. This would line up with last year's Showcase that took place on May 24.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy.869967/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The amount of quality indie titles that have launched in May is already overwhelmingly large, so I'm here to urge you to add another game to that list: <em>Mullet MadJack</em>. With a name as awesome as <em>"Mullet MadJack</em>," you're in for one wild, non-stop ride in this nostalgic, 90s anime-style first-person shooter.</p>
<p>Players take the role of the eponymous Mullet Mad Jack, a "moderator" that kills robobillionaires. You're also out to save a damsel in distress, but you're going to have to climb high into a skyscraper filled with those darn robobillionaires and drones -- and they're armed to the teeth. Thankfully, the gameplay itself is as fun as the premise behind the story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-cinematic.jpg?itok=DoA6zQ2I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-cinematic.jpg?itok=b1rsbMvX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="15fc4683-2351-45db-b94e-836a884077c4" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-cinematic.jpg?itok=b1rsbMvX" alt="A cutscene from Mullet Madjack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Time to get those hands dirty.</figcaption></figure><h2>Slay Robobillionaires in <em>Mullet MadJack</em></h2>
<p><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a<em> </em>potent combination of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghostrunner-review"><em>Ghostrunner </em></a>meets <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review-killed-dick">Bulletstorm</a>. </em>We have the fast and frenetic gameplay of <em>Ghostrunner</em>, combined with <em>Bulletstorm</em>'s stylish, FPS mayhem and lethal environmental hazards. Of course, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> has plenty of other tricks up its sleeve, making for one bombastic and fresh experience.</p>
<p><em>Ghostrunner</em> combines parkour and one-hit-kill gameplay, making for an extremely fast-paced adventure. Similarly, <em>Mullet MadJack</em>'s robobillionaire enemies can kill you fast, so you're constantly on the move and aiming to kill as many of them in a myriad of stylish ways.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-smg.jpg?itok=3Xa-YfE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-smg.jpg?itok=h7ssINJT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8651fee8-abd0-4aea-b81d-b32f60ce09d6" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-smg.jpg?itok=h7ssINJT" alt="A look at the SMG weapon from Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Some glorious robobillionaire-slaying action!</figcaption></figure><p>The main thing you need to take into account is a 10-second limit to your life. Life is not measured by traditional means, but rather through this constant countdown. Seconds can only be replenished through slaying robobillionaires in different ways; conversely, you can <em>lose </em>seconds by succumbing to their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a giant race to the finish line as you climb floor by floor through increasingly difficult sections of a skyscraper. Each floor grants players an upgrade that'll help them survive and replenish those precious seconds of life, and by the end of it, you ought to be armed well enough to defeat the boss at the end of each chapter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-upgrades.jpg?itok=QW6t4to9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-upgrades.jpg?itok=c795P5Hg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="73f5805b-6eba-4452-a9ef-95b17f9b9f49" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-upgrades.jpg?itok=c795P5Hg" alt="A look at upgrades in Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>I love the UI when choosing upgrades!</figcaption></figure><h2>Gear Up to Get the Job Done in <em>Mullet MadJack</em></h2>
<p>With these upgrades, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> has some roguelite elements to it. You get more and more powerful each floor, but if you die, you'll start at the beginning of the chapter and you'll have to gain these upgrades all over again. There's a reasonable amount to choose from, so your build is likely going to vary each chapter, though I did wish for a bit more variety.</p>
<p>Upgrades can range from new weapons like an uzi or fire katana, to environmental invulnerability and more. The most essential power-ups were the ones that granted extra seconds based on the way you killed certain enemies -- that's where those <em>Bulletstorm</em>, environmental kill elements come in.</p>
<p>The sprawling complex of rooms within the skyscraper is filled to the brim with ridiculous traps and hazards, like dangerous spinning fans, lasers, acid, and more. With certain upgrades, knocking an enemy into fans would grant more seconds. The best way to do that is with your kick, which is always a blast to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-parkour.jpg?itok=lERW4gf9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-parkour.jpg?itok=XPiohNa2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="df8232a3-b2ab-4732-a0de-473824269259" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-parkour.jpg?itok=XPiohNa2" alt="A look at some parkour action in Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Ready for some parkour?</figcaption></figure><p>There's also one that gives you an extra second for shooting robobillionaires in the crotch or head, so cater to your playstyle. Again, though, there isn't a huge range of upgrades to choose from, which does lead to a feeling of repetition. Mainly, there are only a few weapons to choose from and you're more than likely to prefer one or two over the rest.</p>
<p>While weapons can be upgraded further,<em> Mullet MadJack</em> needed another two or three to really break up more of the repetitive moments. That's where this otherwise brilliant game suffers, is in its variety. Environments introduce more and more hazards as you go on, but does little to shake up the gameplay beyond its frantic rush to the finish.</p>
<p>Since I mentioned bosses, by the end of most chapters you'll have fight one. These are way easier than climbing the tower itself, though it's probably by design. Failing right at the boss and resetting your progress in that chapter would be really disappointing, so they feel more like a part of the story to experience rather than a challenge to overcome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-cutscene.jpg?itok=H_WxQxn3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-cutscene.jpg?itok=FQAw_aSV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a9951bf1-66c5-4943-b39d-859a498920f1" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-cutscene.jpg?itok=FQAw_aSV" alt="A look at a cutscene from Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Locked and loaded.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Mullet MadJack</em> - A Visual Ode to 90s Anime</h2>
<p>The levels themselves also look pretty darn similar throughout, so you get a feeling of deja vu constantly. It's not a matter of getting lost -- you just run straight and get to the next floor -- but some visual diversity here and there would do some good for <em>Mullet MadJack</em>.</p>
<p>But despite that, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a very strong game in terms of visuals. It's deeply inspired by 90s anime and the vaporwave aesthetic, and the over-the-top colors and zaniness of the characters and story reflect that. It is undeniably one of the most stylish games I've played all year.</p>

It's fast, there are explosions from fire extinguishers and vending machines and and enemies going on everywhere, and the UI will throw words in your face at any moment.</p>
<p>I can see this as being a bit overwhelming for some players as it was for me, but it also adds to the overall charm and personality of <em>Mullet MadJack</em>. I appreciate the way this game deviates from the norm and does something a bit different, even if it's at the expense of some visual clarity.</p>
<p>Complementing the visuals is an exceptional, nostalgic synthwave soundtrack. When you combine these tracks with some truly cinematic cutscenes, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> looks and sounds cool as hell, plain and simple.</p>

<p>It's a pretty short game when all is said and done, but there are a few extra bits that I appreciated nonetheless. First, there's an Endless Mode, so if you're trying to tackle the leaderboard, you can contend with other players and aim for the top. It's an appreciated feature, but again, it does suffer from some of that same feeling of repetition.</p>
<p>There's also a mode that goes through the "unboxing" of a fake physical copy of <em>Mullet MadJack</em>. Man, I remember loving physical PC copies with their fancy boxes and surprisingly robust booklets inside -- and this little segment was a nice way to vicariously relive that nostalgia once again.</p>
<p>It's quite evident that <em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a lovingly crafted game that comes from a place of love of the 90s and classic anime. Even though it's a shorter experience, each moment is full of non-stop action. Take this baby for a spin and you'll have the time of your life.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Combining elements from Ghostrunner and Bulletstorm in a 90s-anime inspired package, slaying robobillionaires is a blast in Mullet MadJack -- though, it is a bit short. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p data-characters="296" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re not really good at valuing ourselves or each other. Humanity loves easy answers, so when we can’t quantify human value, we use numbers. Views, followers, profits; these are all just numbers that don’t say anything about our worth. Not to us. But do you know who loves numbers? Robots.</p> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">Robots judge our worth today. If we’re not valuable in the eyes of a computer, we aren’t valuable at all. If we don’t create content or products that make numbers go up, we’re worthless. And in this world, quantity will get you much further than quality so that content and those products might as well be created through pattern analysis to find what will be most widely accepted and will achieve the largest number. Computers are great at patterns, so get out of the way, human, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-death-noodle-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’re worthless</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="159" data-injectable="false">And that’s why <em>Mullet MadJack</em> is here. It takes the trajectory of society to the absolute extreme, then sails past it right into thought-provoking absurdity.</p> <figure data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ05cropped.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Mullet MadJack headshot" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ05cropped.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ05cropped.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ05cropped.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ05cropped.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="122" data-injectable="false"><strong><strong><strong>Mullet MadJack (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111190/MULLET_MADJACK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> [Reviewed])<br>Developer: Hammer95<br>Publisher: Hammer95, Epopeia Games<br>Released: May 15, 2024<br>MSRP: </strong>TBA</strong></strong></p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">The eponymous <em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a “moderator” in a world ruled by robot billionaires known as robillionaires. As a retrohuman, your life is dependent on the dopamine hit you get when someone likes, comments, and subscribes. As such, you have 10 seconds to live, but you can extend it by killing a robot live on stream.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Mr. MadJack is part Duke Nukem, part Brock Samson, and part Mr. Rogers. “Persistence is better than talent!” he’ll scream as you shoot a robot in the dick. I’m not sure it counts as being misanthropic when you’re taking out your boundless rage on robots. Toasters don’t have feelings, though they can own assets.</p> <p data-characters="69" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">MadJack’s mad. Also, he has a mullet. The name is very appropriate.</p> <figure data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ04cropped.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Mullet MadJack slotting a pink audio cassette that says &quot;Magic is Real&quot;" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ04cropped.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ04cropped.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ04cropped.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ04cropped.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">The game itself generally follows the formula set by <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285670/Post_Void/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Post Void</a></em>. In fact, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> features so many similarities to that game it’s almost tempting to call it a rip-off. Even the way that the protagonist holds their time/health bar in their left hand and the garish neon colors feel as though they were lifted directly from <em>Post Void</em>.</p> <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">However, for as much as it takes from <em>Post Void</em>, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> runs with the formula. To be fair, <em>Post Void</em> didn’t go all that much farther than the core concept.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">So, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> features the same momentum-based corridor dash that <em>Post Void </em>had, but it also has you performing <em>Doom Eternal-</em>style glory kills and kicking robots into environmental hazards like giant fans and exposed wires. There are vending machines you can blast open to sup from their delicious juices. Between each floor, you’re provided a small selection of power-ups to choose from to make your next floor both more fun and survivable.</p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">But it would be hugely amiss to claim that Hammer95 is simply cashing in on someone else’s success. So much of what I love about <em>Mullet MadJack</em> goes beyond its gameplay. From the moment you start the game, you’re blasted with visual overload. Animated cutscenes precede the main menu, showing shots of Mr. MadJack changing gears in his Toro GT in exceedingly lavish details. Every shot contains so much information that I could watch it all day.</p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">This continues into gameplay where you wade through an everlasting stream of explosions, slide down ramps wallpapered with advertisements for fake but familiar products, and jam manga into a robot’s throat. Don’t spend too long looking at the cover of that manga, you only have a few seconds to grab it and ram it down the throat of a nearby robot.</p> <figure data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Mullet MadJack sliding down a ramp." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true"><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a lot of dumb fun, but it’s all in support of its central themes. It’s a game where you can look it over from a variety of angles, peel back its layers, and find something new in every crevice. At the surface level, it shows a depiction of the internet taken to an absurd but weirdly believable extreme. It’s a playground exclusively for robots while the rest of us go to great lengths to gain their approval.</p>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">Advertisers are the only humans of importance. They prop up influencers as people of importance, though they add nothing. The only person raging against the machine still has to play their game.</p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">It’s excessive, it’s noisy, there’s too much going on at once. You just keep trying to get those likes and maybe you’ll eventually get a new pair of shoes.</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="697" data-injectable="true">Yet, despite the heaviness of its themes, the whole thing is presented in a mocking but amiable way. Mr. MadJack is a fun protagonist. He has a penchant for screaming out one-liners, which in less capable hands can be extremely annoying. But the way he mixes his venom and robocidal ravings with vapid affirmations is legitimately charming.</p>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Among the random perks you can choose between levels is the useless option to make Mr. MadJack talk at every opportunity. It adds nothing from a gameplay perspective, but I found it amusing to listen to. Simultaneously sadistic and sympathetic, he’s either a caricature of a vapid internet personality or an eager and enthusiastic friend.</p> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Mullet MadJack sniper scope" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">And between the one-liners is a game that is all about flow. If you’re not dashing between glorious robotic destruction, you’re probably on the verge of death. There’s very little time to stop and calculate. At best, you’ll be able to recognize a target and decide how to deal with it. Some enemies are persistent against everything except a headshot, while one can only be defeated by kicking it into an environmental hazard.</p>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false"><em>Mullet MadJack </em>provides one of the few things that still relaxes me in these days of distraction: flow-state concentration. It doesn’t matter if most stages are just one randomly generated linear corridor, the action that goes on in between is constant and gripping. Shallow, perhaps, but in a way that supports the way it wants you to move.</p> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="874" data-injectable="true">Occasionally, it does trip over itself. The wall running feels terrible. It’s hard to describe, but it feels less like parkour and more like you’re dragging your face against a wall. On a similar note, the bottomless pits are unwelcome. There’s one particular narrow walkway that I kept falling off of because the kickback of my gun would push me off. The abrupt end to my run always felt like a slap in the face. I would have preferred a way to recover at the expense of time off the clock. Instant death doesn’t fit here.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Mullet MadJack AI Future" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">There are also some issues with menu navigation and English translation. However, the latter problem isn’t that intrusive, and considering that it utilizes the cyberpunk trope of pervasive Japanese text, awkward translation kind of fits.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">The flaws of <em>Mullet MadJack</em> are apparent. It’s a bit derivative, somewhat shallow, and sometimes uneven, but between the pulsing synth music, overload of visual information, and hatred of robots, I can readily say it’s my favorite game released this year. The first time I sat down with it was also when I completed it (about 3 hours), but I immediately jumped into endless mode and have been jumping back in occasionally ever since. I need those shoes.</p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">The most important component, however, is that it’s obvious that Hammer95 obviously had immense fun with the project. From the in-game “unboxing” to the lavish animation and art, they went above and beyond with many small details that you might just wind up missing. And even that is incredibly on message. A robot can’t have fun creating a video game.</p> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">If you’ve ever had thoughts of throwing your phone away or abandoning the internet to its robotic rulers, <em>Mullet MadJack </em>taps into that frustration. The neon nostalgia of a better era is fertile ground for a game that feels like beating a microwave to death with a crowbar.</p>

			<p>PS5 sales have surpassed 59.2 million units worldwide, Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveale</a>d.</p>
<p>Sony published its most recent financial earnings for the 4th quarter of its current fiscal year, announcing that it managed to sell 20.8 million PS5 consoles during the (fiscal) year. This is slightly below the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-fall-short-of-estimates-sony-confirms-no-major-franchise-release-in-next-fiscal-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revised sales target of 21 million</a> that the company set some months ago. As revealed in the <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supplemental information</a> that Sony has released, 4.5 million PS5 consoles were sold during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. For reference, Sony managed to sell 6.3 million consoles during the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>With global PS5 sales being down year-over-year, Sony now expects sales to decline to 18 million during its current fiscal year (FY24). Back in December of last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-50-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wrote that the PS5 was tracking in on PS4 time-aligned sales</a>, but with PS5 sales now being down year-on-year, we wonder whether PS5 sales will ever surpass lifetime PS4 sales.</p>
<p>In other sales-related news - as revealed (<a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1790278247038562446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> Tom Warren) during Sony's conference call, Arrowhead's hit title Helldivers 2 has sold over 12 million copies across both PS5 and PC as of May 5th. This means that those copies were sold in 12 weeks. Interestingly enough - three weeks after the title's launch in early February, Arrowhead <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-has-sold-3-million-units-in-just-over-two-weeks-director-says-dlss-is-cool-but-not-necessary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported that over 3 million units were sol</a>d. This implies that around 9 million additional copies were sold in 9 weeks - roughly 1 million a week.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony says Helldivers 2 reached 12 million sales across PS5 and PC in the first 12 weeks since launch <a href="https://t.co/wpcwWBzBVT">pic.twitter.com/wpcwWBzBVT</a></p>

<p id="7e50o5">If you already have a shiny Abra (or its evolutions), you may have participated in Abra Community Day in April 2020. The first few evolutions have only a slight difference when shiny, but Alakazam and its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids">Mega</a> form get more prominent pink accents, which rule.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Abra in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Abra is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

<p>It seemingly takes two people to replace one Jim Ryan. <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2024/new-leadership-structure-formed-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has announced</a> that both Hermen Hulst&nbsp;and Hideaki Nishino&nbsp;will take over as joint CEOs of PlayStation starting June 1, 2024.</p>



<p>Hulst moves on from his role as head of PlayStation Studios to the role of CEO of the newly formed Studio Business Group. Hulst’s group will be responsible for all of PlayStation’s first-party games as well as PlayStation IP in TV and film. He had been the head of PlayStation Studios since 2019 and is also known as a co-founder of Guerrilla&nbsp;Games, the studio behind the Killzone and Horizon franchises.</p>



<p>“It’s a true privilege to be asked to lead the new Studio Business Group for Sony Interactive,” Hulst said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1790157531555500085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on Twitter</a>. “I’m excited to continue working with incredibly talented teams and studios to deliver unforgettable game and entertainment experiences.”</p>



<p>Regarding Nishino, he moves into the role of CEO of the Platform Business Group. In his new position, he will be responsible for PlayStation console hardware, accessories, technology, the PlayStation Network, and third-party relations for both major publishers and indie studios. Before the promotion, Nishino was SVP of Platform Experiences.</p>



<p>“I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen,” Nishino said. “By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future.”</p>



<p>Both Nishino and Hulst will report directly to Sony Interactive Entertainment chairman Hiroki Totoki. Totoki had been PlayStation’s interim CEO since Ryan’s departure.</p>



<p>“Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology,” Totoki said. “These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences.”</p>

It contains the <em>Samurai Warriors 4</em> base game, as well as more than 150 pieces of previously released downloadable content.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A total of 55 different officers are featured in this rich depiction of the Warring States period. The new deluxe edition of <em>Samurai Warriors 4</em> contains more than 150 previously released downloadable content, including costumes, weapons, customization parts, scenarios, background music, and more.</p><p><strong>Interact With 55 Different Officers, Including Nobuyuki Sanada and Yoshitsugu Otani</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In response to popular demand, Nobuyuki Sanada and Yoshitsugu Otani are now among the many officers featured in this vivid portrayal of the Warring States period. Takatora Todo, Naotora Ii, and Munenori Yagyu, who previously appeared only in Japanese releases, also appear for the first time in the main <em>Samurai Warriors</em> series. In addition, character designs have been revamped and action elements have been enhanced for fan-favorite characters like Yukimura Sanada and Nobunaga Oda. The range of 55 unique officers, the greatest number of officers in a single game in the series, is a key component of <em>Samurai Warriors</em>.</p><p><strong>Journey Through the Colorful History of the Warring States Period</strong></p><p>In the main Story Mode, a tale based on historical events unfolds in two separate parts. While the regional stories focus on officers from regions across the land, such as Kyushu and Shikoku, the story of unification details the events leading up to the end of the Warring States period. Unlike previous <em>Samurai Warriors</em> titles, this game features battles between each faction, allowing for a more dramatic depiction of the relationships between officers. <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> firsthand the convictions, conflicts, and complex feelings of these officers.</p><p><strong>Experience the Most Exhilarating <a title="Genres > Action [1,831 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> in the Entire Series</strong></p><p>The true thrill of this series, mowing down hordes of enemies in battles of one-versus-1,000, has been made even more exhilarating with the addition of new elements, including Hyper Attacks, which allow players to quickly close in on their enemies and cut them down, and Rage mode, which powers up attacks when the Spirit Gauge is full and allows players to perform the ultimate finishing move: Musou Frenzy Attacks. In addition, characters’ attack types and the overall progression system have been revamped. These new elements offer an unprecedented variety of attacks, along with the strongest sense of exhilaration of any game in the series, all while maintaining the simple controls characteristic of the <em>Warriors</em> series.</p><p><strong>Travel Across the Land in Chronicle Mode</strong></p><p>Explore the world of <em>Samurai Warriors</em> in the new Chronicle Mode by completing various types of requests, meeting officers, and collecting items in regions across the land. Leave a lasting mark on the history of the Warring States period by customizing officers via Create Character in the upgraded editing mode.</p><p><strong>Switch Between Characters in Real Time During Battle</strong></p><p>Use the Switch Character feature to switch between two different characters on the battlefield in real time as they strive for victory. By switching characters, players can gain an advantage in battle, discover hidden objectives, and receive various benefits. They can also set a detailed plan of action for the character not currently being played.</p><p><strong>Utilize the Strong Connection Between Morale and Combat</strong></p><p>Enemy camps are made stronger by higher Morale levels, but completing objectives and defeating standard bearers lowers enemy Morale and makes it easier to claim victory. As such, the player’s actions have a drastic effect on battle conditions.</p></div><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155982/sony-playstation-co-ceo-hermen-hulst-hideaki-nishino<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is appointing co-CEOs Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino to lead its PlayStation business <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2024/new-leadership-structure-formed-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/">from June 1st</a>. Hermen Hulst, who currently serves as PlayStation studios chief, will be appointed as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment’s (SIE) studio business group. Hideaki Nishino will be appointed CEO of SIE’s platform business group, and both will report up to Sony CFO and SIE chairman Hiroki Totoki.</p><p>The unusual appointment of co-CEOs comes just months after former PlayStation boss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23893389/sony-playstation-jim-ryan-ceo-steps-down">Jim Ryan retired</a>. Totoki had been serving as interim CEO of SIE and was working to find the successor for the SIE CEO role, but Sony has now decided it wants to split up responsibilities for leading its PlayStation business across platform and games. Both Nishino and Hulst are Sony veterans, with Nishino having served multiple roles for more than 20 years at Sony. </p><p>This is the first time Sony has appointed co-CEOs to run its PlayStation business, and it comes amid a game industry that’s reeling from layoffs over the past 18 months. Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084494/sony-playstation-layoffs-2024">laid off 900 PlayStation employees</a> earlier this year and closed its London Studio in the UK that developed PlayStation VR games. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">laid off 1,900 Activision</a> and Xbox employees earlier this year, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">shut down the Bethesda studios</a> behind <em>Redfall </em>and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> last week in another round of layoffs.</p><p>Sony’s announcement of new PlayStation leaders also comes just hours before it’s due to report its latest earnings. Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072692/sony-ps5-forecast-cut-q3-2023-earnings">lowered its PS5 console sales forecasts</a> last quarter, so all eyes are now on the number of PS5 units that the company managed to sell in its 2023 fiscal year ended March 31st. We might also get further hints at Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132846/sony-playstation-pc-overlay-shared-trophies-ghost-of-tsushima">ambitious</a> PlayStation PC plans.</p><p>During an earnings call earlier this year, SIE chairman Hiroki Totoki also <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1757842077121921231">discussed</a> the opportunity to grow PlayStation games on PC / multiplatform. “In the past, we wanted to popularize console... but there is a synergy to it,” said Totoki. “So if you have strong first-party content, not only with our console but also other platforms like computers, first-party can be grown with multi platforms and that can help operating profit to improve.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Take a look at our five picks below. </p><p><em>Have a PS5? Check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd"><em>best PS5 SSDs</em></a></p><h2><u><strong>The Best Xbox Series X SSDs</strong></u></h2><h2><strong>1. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S</strong></h2><h3>The Best Xbox Series X SSD Overall</h3><div id="189730"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/seagate-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-x-1698863147358.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S</h3></p><div><p>Grab this easy-to-install, official Xbox SSD to enjoy extra storage and speedy transfer rates so games feel like you’re playing directly from the console’s storage.</p></div></div><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Easy to install</li><li>Fast transfer speeds</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Expensive</li></ul><p>The Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S is just about as fast as the console’s internal SSD meaning you can play games optimized for Xbox Series X|S</p><p>By offering plug-and-play installation, you don’t need to be a tech wiz to gain extra Xbox Series X storage. Extra storage is available with no setup, providing you with high data transfer rates and loading times, so it will feel no different to playing an Xbox game directly from your console’s storage.</p><p>Yes, it is expensive, but that’s really the only downfall of the expansion card. If you want to increase your Xbox Series X’s limited storage the “official” way,  this is how you do it. Working side-by-side with the Xbox’s Velocity Architecture and supporting Quick Resume, you can enjoy games how they were intended. You can also choose between the 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB versions depending on your requirements.</p><h2><strong>2. WD_Black 1TB C50</strong></h2><h3>The Most Portable Xbox Series X SSD</h3><div id="189731"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="WD_Black 1TB C50" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/wd-black-1tb-c50-1698863271281.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>WD_Black 1TB C50</h3></p><div><p>The WD_Black C50 is Western Digital's official Xbox Series X|S SSD, that promises to run your games just as fast as the native SSD.</p></div></div><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A cheaper alternative to the Seagate Expansion Card</li><li>Durable and pocket-sized</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Marginally slower boot times</li></ul><p>While Seagate previously owned the Xbox expansion card market, there is now a Western Digital drive with the WD_Black 1TB C50. Compact in size and durable in design, this expansion card comes in 512GB and 1TB storage options and is a more affordable option than Seagate’s offering.</p><p>This expansion card easily slots into the Xbox Series X’s expansion card port, meaning no setup is required. You can transfer games to the expansion card in a matter of minutes, so you can have a variety of games at your disposal. Compared to the Series X’s internal storage, the WD_Black 1TB C50 does offer slightly slower boot times, but this is really very marginal.</p><p>If you don’t need the 2TB option that Seagate offers, then the WD_Black 1TB C50 is the next best thing at a more appealing price. It will take a couple of minutes to transfer large 80GB files, and it’s small enough that you can easily transport it from your house to your friend’s, and enjoy a large library of Xbox games.</p><h2><u><strong>For Archival and Backwards-Compatible Games Only</strong></u></h2><h2><strong>3. Samsung T7 External SSD</strong></h2><h3>The Most Versatile Xbox Series X SSD</h3><div id="189732"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Samsung T7 External SSD" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/samsung-t7-external-ssd-1698863454574.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Samsung T7 External SSD</h3></p><div><p>If you're looking to play backwards-compatible games or store your games long-term, longtime favorite external Samsung T7 SSD is a great choice. </p></div></div><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lightweight and portable</li><li>256-bit AES encryption for storing files</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cannot play Series X games directly from the SSD</li></ul><p>When you move away from the Xbox Series X’s expansion card storage options, you’ll start to notice you get a lot more storage for your money. This SSD from Samsung, for instance, is around the same price as the WD_Black 1TB C50 but offers an additional 1TB of storage, but there’s a catch – you can’t play Xbox games directly from the SSD.</p><p>Instead, the Samsung S7 is best used for storing Xbox games that you might want to play at a later date, but don’t want to wait around installing them. For instance, you can install the latest Call of Duty game directly onto your Xbox Series X, then store the previous version on the Samsung SSD S7 and transfer it back to your console when you feel like playing it again.</p><p>Weighing a mere 2 ounces, the S7 is perfect for portability. And with 2TB of storage, you can easily store your Xbox games, photos, or work documents on the same SSD. Simply connect it to the Series X using a USB-C cable and enjoy read/write speeds of up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s. Plus, you can make the most of Samsung’s AES 256-bit encryption to secure your files.</p><h2><strong>4. Crucial X8 External SSD</strong></h2><h3>The Best Value Xbox Series X SSD</h3><div id="189733"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Crucial X8 External SSD" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/crucial-x8-external-ssd-1698863650916.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Crucial X8 External SSD</h3></p><div><p>The Crucial X8 External SSD is a value conscious SSD that's great for storing all your Xbox One and Xbox 360 games, clearing up your Series X SSD for newer titles that need the extra speed.</p></div></div><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Compact and quick</li><li>Storage up to 4TB</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>No encryption</li></ul><p>No different in speed from the Samsung T7, the Crucial X8 offers exceedingly good value for money. You can purchase the X8 in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities. This portable device is great for storing Xbox Series X games, but just like the Samsung T7, you can’t run current-gen games off of it.</p><p>However, you can use the Crucial X8 for your Xbox, PC, and Mac. Whether you need to store games, files, music, photos, or more, it’s easy to carry this little SSD with you. It’s also shock-resistant and durable, so you can sling it in your backpack without it getting damaged.</p><p>With 4TB of storage space potentially at your disposal, it’s an easy sacrifice to make if you have to wait a few more minutes for your Xbox Series X games to transfer over back to your console. In fact, you could store your whole library of Xbox games on the Crucial X8 and enjoy a more affordable storage solution.</p><h2><strong>5.

That doesn't mean you can't store them there for later, though.</p></div></div><p>Pros</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fast transfer speeds</li><li>Robust and stylish design</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A little pricey still</li></ul><p>If you want to make the external storage on your Xbox Series X stand out, you might want to consider the WD_Black 2TB P40 for its stylish design, complete with flashy RGB lighting. Granted, the RGB lights aren’t going to offer better performance, but they do look pretty awesome. Plus, the P40 can be used for your Xbox, PC, Mac, and PS5. But, because it’s an external SSD, you can’t run Xbox Series X games off of this drive.</p><p>Options start from 500GB, and include 1GB, and 2TB capacities, too. The WD_Black 2TB P40 is relatively affordable when compared to the Xbox’s official expansion card SSDs, but in the realm of external SSDs, it’s still a little pricey.</p><p>But, thanks to the USB 3.2 Gen2x2 interface, you can enjoy speeds of up to 2,000MB/s, which is faster than the Crucial X8 and Samsung T7. The SSD is also encased in a shock-resistant material, which can survive drops of up to 2m.</p><p>If you appreciate style and want the substance to go with it, the WD_Black 2TB P40 offers both, with plenty of storage to house your Xbox Series X games and other files.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Xbox Series X SSDs</h2><p>If you’re looking for a plug-and-play SSD ready to run the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-x-games"><u>best Xbox Series X games</u></a> and support features like Quick Resume and Velocity Architecture, you’re options are limited. That makes deciding on an SSD easy, as the <a href="https://zdcs.link/68y2d?_ga=549648315.1689878480" target="_blank"><u>Seagate Storage Expansion Card</u></a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/42q7J?_ga=549648315.1689878480" target="_blank"><u>WD_Black C50</u></a> are basically your only options. Unfortunately, they're both expensive and hover around the same price for 1TB of storage; we’ve found that 1TB is usually the sweet spot for these SSDs.  </p><p>However, if you don’t need to play your Xbox Series X games directly from the drive, there are a variety of other USB 3.2 SSDs to choose from. So, you’ll have an easier time finding budget or high-capacity options ready to store Xbox Series games as well as play older Xbox One and 360 titles. Luckily, these drives easily slot into the USB port on the Xbox Series X. </p><p>You’ll want decently fast read and write speeds for quick loads and saves. Other factors like durability and size should be taken into account, especially if you’re looking to take your SSD on the go. As mentioned, you’ll probably want a 1TB SSD or larger if you’ve got a decent gaming library, but there are drives up to 4TB for a massive amount of storage. </p><h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><h3><strong>Can any SSD work with Xbox Series X?</strong></h3><p>You can only play Xbox Series X games directly from the console’s internal storage, or via a licensed external SSD, like the Seagate Expansion Card. However, you can use external SSDs to store your Xbox games so you don’t have to keep installing and uninstalling them to free up space.</p><h3><strong>Is the Xbox Series X SSD fast?</strong></h3><p>The Xbox Series X’s storage is a 1TB NVMe SSD, with an IO throughput of around 2.4GB/s.</p><h3><strong>Why does my Xbox Series X only have 800GB?</strong></h3><p>While the Xbox Series X’s advertised storage is 1TB, it uses some of this space for system software, reducing the available storage space to around 800GB.</p><h3><strong>Do You Actually Need Additional Storage for Your Xbox?</strong></h3><p>While the Xbox Series X|S comes with either 1TB or 500GB of storage, you may want to increase this if you plan to install multiple games on your console at any given time. Some AAA titles exceed 150GB in size, so after installing a handful of games, you’ll soon realize you need additional storage if you want to quickly access games and play them straight away.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-franchise-announcement-hinted-at-by-bethesda-trademark/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Doom franchise had a bit of renaissance with 2016’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom</a> and 2020’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/doom-eternal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom Eternal</a>, and with it now being over four years since the last entry in the series, fans are starting to get a bit antsy to shred some demon butt again. Well, a newly discovered trademark may hint something is on the way.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed fans have discovered a <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/983/49/idkfa-98349237.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent pending trademark</a>, listed under the codename IDKFA, by ZeniMax Media (ZeniMax is, of course, the umbrella company for Bethesda). Beyond confirming that it’s for video game software, the trademark filing doesn’t reveal all that much, but we can infer quite a bit from the IDKFA title, as that is a classic Doom cheat code that gives players access to all weapons, keycards, and full ammo (<strong>ID</strong> <strong>K</strong>eys, <strong>F</strong>irearms, <strong>A</strong>rmor).</p>
<p>This speculation isn’t just coming out of nowhere, as there’s a big <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> coming up, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1789633764336795986" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable Microsoft insider Tom Warren</a> and others have been teasing that something Doom-related may indeed be at the show. And again, if developer id Software sticks to their 4-year timeframe for making new Doom games, a 2024 release for the latest one would make sense. Of course, all that said, until Microsoft and Bethesda actually confirm something, consider this all speculation and take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Xbox has been facing quite a bit of blowback from once-loyal fans, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X/S sales flatline</a>, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-xbox-exclusives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring former exclusives to other platforms</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close studios responsible for acclaimed games like Hi-Fi Rush and Prey</a>. It’s widely expected the Xbox Showcase will provide a first look at the next Call of Duty and Gears titles, so adding Doom to that lineup really would make it an exciting show for shooter fans.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase will be streamed on June 9. What do you think? Excited to get your hands on the next thing from id Software? Just how crazy will the next Doom get?</p>

It's been a funny few weeks for Helldivers 2; one day it was riding high on its well-deserved success, the next it was being reviewed bombed into oblivion after Sony decided to foist <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">mandatory PSN accounts</a> on PC players. But now that drama is starting to subside following a dramatic U-turn, all thoughts have turned to one thing: was the review bomb cape developer Arrowhead's CEO Johan Pilestedt previously hinted at real? It would certain seem so.
</p>
<p>
Talk of a review-bomb-inspired Helldivers 2 cape, if you're a little behind on events, first surfaced as fans celebrated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony's U-turn</a> on Tuesday - an unexpected reversal that followed one hell of a weekend for Helldivers 2, in which Arrowhead's was unusually, publicly frank about its frustration with Sony and its handling of the PSN situation, and in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">over 200,000 negative Steam reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">mass refunds</a>, and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">absolute mess</a> of a situation in territories where PSN was unavailable finally forced Sony's hand.
</p>
<p>
As the drama began to subside, Pilestedt took to social media to <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1787370710597312605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">share a community created cape</a> design - featuring four red vertical lines mirroring those of Helldivers 2's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">Steam review sentiment graph</a> during the review bombing - offhandedly remarking when asked if it would become "a thing", that, "The team is talking about a good name for it right now." It just wasn't entirely clear to what degree he was joking. And it turns out he (probably) wasn't joking at all.
</p>
<figure><figcaption>Helldivers 2's latest Warbond recently arrived.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwQzxcWQook" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Over the weekend, Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">posted a cropped image</a> seemingly teasing an official new Helldivers 2 cape design, which notably included three red lines bearing a suspicious resemblance to Helldivers 2's now legendary Steam review slump graph. And if that wasn't enough to convince that Arrowhead really is readying to commemorate the community's monumental collaborative achievement, Helldivers 2 community manager Twinbeard (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-is-actually-making-a-review-bomb-cape-to-commemorate-the-helldivers-2-psn-fiasco-complete-with-two-huge-negative-review-bars/">PC Gamer</a>) also popped up on the game's official Discord server to say, "We already have a name, should there ever hypothetically be a cape, that is."
</p> 
<p>
There's no indication of when - if - such a thing might eventually make it in-game but it'll give the Helldivers 2 community something to look forward to while Operation Clean-up, which has so far successfully managed to reverse around half of those negative Steam reviews, continues.

                <p dir="ltr"><span>For avid gamers who spend a lot of time sitting at their desks, investing in a quality gaming chair is a wise decision. A good gaming chair can keep you comfortable and supported through marathon gaming sessions--not to mention everything else you do at a desk, like working from home, streaming, or voice chatting with friends.</span></p><p dir="ltr">To help you find a good chair that fits your lifestyle and needs, we put together this list of the best gaming chairs available in 2024. The list features an array of choices from top brands, from the classic racing-style seats from Razer, sleek ergonomic chairs with lumbar support from Herman Miller, and even a giant beanbag that's perfect for lounging. We've also made sure to include picks from a range of price points. While the best gaming chairs often start at around $400, our comprehensive list includes options for every budget. However, if you're looking for a list full of cheaper alternatives, make sure to check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-cheap-gaming-chair-2020-budget-chairs-under-200/1100-6476492/">best budget gaming chairs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Before we dive in, let's briefly discuss the benefits of gaming chairs.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Benefits of a gaming chair vs. office chair</strong></h3><p>The main benefit quality gaming chairs have over many regular office chairs is their ergonomic design, particularly <strong>lumbar and head/neck support</strong>. While a regular swivel office chair may do well for short intervals, a PC gaming chair is made for consistent, prolonged use. They generally have thicker cushions and, importantly, extra lumbar and head cushions. If you're finding that your lower back is sore after sitting in a regular desk chair, an ergonomic gaming chair is a great option for you.</p><p>Once you assemble your chair, there are a few things you should keep in mind when using it at your desk. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Mayo Clinic</a> recommends adjusting the seat height so that your feet lay flat on the floor. Armrests should be situated so that your shoulders can be relaxed while resting your elbows, and your knees should be parallel to your hips.</p><p>Gaming chairs are versatile, though. When not hammering away at the keyboard, they still provide comfort and support when reclined. While remaining upright at a desk is helpful, chances are you're looking at a gaming chair for more than just work, and most of the chairs on this list are designed for both work and play.</p><div title="6486393 - Best Gaming Chairs - Entries" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="797" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6486393 - Best Gaming Chairs - Entries" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Overall Gaming Chair</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 Series</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/3858696-titanevo2022.png">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> Secretlab NEO Hybrid Leatherette, SoftWeave Plus Fabric, or Secretlab NAPA Leather</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> cold-cure foam</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> Built-in dynamic lumbar support</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 33 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width:</strong> 19.3 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> 85 -165 degrees</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> Adjustable 4-directional armrests with hot-swappable armrest tops</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 200lbs (Small); 220lbs (Regular); 395lbs (XL)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>User height range:</strong> ≤ 5’6” (Small) / 5’7” - 6’2” (Regular) / 5’11” - 6’9” (XL)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warranty:</strong> Up to 5 years</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Memory foam head pillow; optional SoftWeave Plus fabric skins.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Secretlab Titan Evo gaming chair is our pick for the best gaming chair you can buy today.

The Lite version is a more affordable option that maintains the standard Titan Evo's overall design and ergonomics, including cold-cure foam padding in the seat, built-in lumbar support, and memory foam head pillow that makes it great for long gaming sessions or general office use alike.</p><p dir="ltr">The main concessions between the Evo Lite and standard Evo is versatility and customizability. Whereas the standard Evo has three models to choose from, the Evo Lite only has two (Regulard and XL), which may limit its viability for anyone looking for a smaller chair. It also offers fewer upholstery options, but the Prime Leatherette and Softweave fabric are both solid choices. For those reasons, we're keeping the Evo Lite to just our "runner-up" best gaming chair option rather than the top pick, but if the sizing and fabric options match your needs, it's absolutely worth checking out. The chair is available at both Amazon and Secretlab, though you'll find more customization options available at Secretlab.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Premium Gaming Chair</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Mavix M9</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/3858697-mavixm9.png">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> M-Breeze Fabric</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> Cool gel memory foam</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> Dynamic Variable Lumbar support</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 34 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width:</strong> 21.74 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> Up to 127 degrees</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> 4-directional armests</li><li dir="ltr">Weight limit: 275lbs</li><li dir="ltr">Warranty: 5 years</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Adjustable headrest angle; optional Elemax heating pad</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Mavix is a relative newcomer to the gaming chair space, but it's already made waves thanks to high-profile streamer sponsorships and a dedication to quality. Mavix currently has four gaming chairs, each of which share a similar design. The Mavix M9, the company's most extravagant and expensive chair, is the comfiest chair on this list and comes in as our pick for the best premium gaming chair.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike most of the other chairs on this list, the M9 doesn't have a racing seat look. Instead, it's designed to resemble a high-end ergonomic office chair with subtle flair. The back has a two-piece design, with an ergonomic lumbar support and a backrest that gets wider as it rises. It's supported by a thin mesh covered in premium fabric that has a far more cushiony feel than you'd expect. Meanwhile, the seat is covered with Mavix's M-Breeze fabric (similar to PU leather) and filled with cool-gel memory foam that helps keep your bottom comfortable through long gaming sessions.</p><p dir="ltr">The M9 is highly adjustable, allowing you to find the right settings that work for you. The backrest reclines to 127 degrees, and a tension dial provides even further customization for your recline. The backrest can easily be moved up and down, which changes the positioning of the lumbar support. The M9's construction also allows for seat depth customization, which can be important for ergonomics when it comes to leg comfort. It's also fitted with roller blade-style wheels for a smoother roll and comes standard with 4D armrests.</p><p dir="ltr">From a comfort standpoint, the Mavix M9 is a step above the other contenders on this list. It's also far more expensive, so it's ideal for those who sit at their desk for hours on end every day. Mavix M9's comfort and wealth of customization options make it a clear standout in its price range. The M9 is available in four fabric color schemes: black, white, black/blue, and black/white, and nine different wheel colors. You can also add an Elemax massage pad, footrest, and full-rotation armrests at separate costs.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Value</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Mavix M4</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/3925104-mavixm4.png">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> Mesh fabric</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> Dynamic Variable Lumbar support</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 30 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width: </strong>19.5 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> Height-adjustable armrests</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 275lbs</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warranty:</strong> 3 years</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Locking wheel casters; optional Elemax massage pad and footrest.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">While the Mavix M9 is our pick for the best premium gaming chair, not everyone can (or wants) to shell out around $1,000 for a chair. If you like the M9's design, another great option is the Mavix M4. As Mavix's lowest-priced gaming chair at $444, the M4 is the best combination of performance and value on this list.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mavix M4 retains the shape and general features of the M9, including the wonderful dynamic variable lumbar support. Where it mainly differs is the materials. The M4 uses cooling mesh on both the backrest and seat cushion. While it doesn't have the superb memory foam seen in the M9, the seat base still the cleverly implemented curvatures that make it comfortable to sit on for lengthy gaming sessions.</p><p dir="ltr">The M4 has locking wheel casters, but these are conventional wheels unlike the rollerblade-style units featured on the M9. The M4 can recline back and lock into place, though not as far as some chairs on this list. It also has an adjustable headrest that removes the need for an additional pillow. You can go for all-black or grab one of the three two-tone designs with different colored backrests: blue, red, or green.</p><p dir="ltr">Mavix also offers a separate footrest for the M4 as an add-on, and you can add the Elemax massage pad, too. It's available in four fabric color options and 10 wheel colors.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built\/dp\/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Value</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built\/dp\/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Razer Enki X</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1701/17013431/4302434-enkix.jpg">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built\/dp\/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> Leatherette</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> High-density molded foam</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> N/A*****</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 33 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width:</strong> 18 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> Up to 152 degrees</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> 2-directional armrests</li><li dir="ltr">Weight limit: Up to 300lbs</li><li dir="ltr">User height range: 5'2" - 6'4"</li><li dir="ltr">Warranty: 3 years for moving parts</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Razer's Enki line are some of the best gaming chair's we've reviewed, but in terms of value, nothing beats the $600 Razer Enki X for us. The Enki X runs a smidge smaller than the standard Enki and Enki Pro models, but its supported height range of 5'2" to 6'4" tall and up to 300lb weight limit still makes it a highly versatile option. The leatherette upholstery and high-density molded foam padding also make for a comfortable seat. The integrated lumbar support is also decent, though it's a fixed support and its placement won't be ideal for all users.</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to its more costly siblings, the Enki X's rocking mechanism is simpler, its armrests only offer 2-directional adjustments--both the standard Enki and Enki Pro feature 4-directional armrests--and it does not come with a detachable neck pad. However, unless one of those features is a must-have for you, none are dealbreakers, and the baseline comfort and build quality are still higher than what you normally find at this price range.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're willing to spend a bit more, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-enki-chair-review-comfort-for-the-long-haul/1100-6497240/" data-ref-id="1100-6497240">standard Enki chair</a> is $500 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Enki-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGH3KY8Y?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs%2FRazer-Enki%2FRZ38-03720300-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-gaming-chair%2F1100-6486393%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's online store</a>.

It's a stylish and innovative ergonomic gaming chair that features the best lumbar support we've tried. While most gaming chairs have a small, detachable lumbar pillow, the Iskur has an ergonomically designed lumbar support integrated directly into the seat's back. It's large and contours to the shape of your back, providing support across a larger area. The lumbar support is also unique in that it's adjustable, so you can position it to the shape of your spine--something you don't often find on other gaming chairs, including Razer's Enki line.</p><p>The fine-tuned customization extends far beyond just the lumbar support. You can easily tinker with the angle and height of the chair, and its 4D adjustable armrests allow movement in multiple directions so you can find your perfect position. The Iskur is made with high-density foam that molds to your body for optimal comfort, and it's wrapped in synthetic leather that is both soft and durable. The only major downside to the chair's design is its armrests, which we found caused some discomfort depending on how you position your elbows on them. However, this was a minor issue, and whether you experience it will depend on how hard you push your arms into them.</p><p>While the Iskur V2's dimensions can fit a wide range of users between 5'2" and 6'5", anyone taller than that should consider the XL model of the original Iskur chair, which is available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Gaming-Chair-Multi-Layered/dp/B099MV2Z1Ptag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs%2FRazer-Iskur%2FRZ38-03950300-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-gaming-chair%2F1100-6486393%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer</a>.

gaming chairs, and at $1,995, the Embody is the most indulgent of the batch--though you may not realize that judging by its utilitarian design. The Embody is designed for long-term ergonomics, making it shorter and sleeker than the racing seat style most gaming chairs use.</p><p dir="ltr">The chair's fixed back only reaches 20.5 inches high, which will stop at or below the shoulders for most people--which, yes, means this doesn't have a headrest, but that doesn't mean it's not comfortable. The back is molded to contour to the user's back, featuring a curve for lumbar support that, coupled with the angle of the seat, makes for a chair you can sit in for long periods of time without aches or pains setting in from poor posture or pressure points. Of course, ergonomics and comfort are two different things, and though the Embody has great support for you back and shoulder, it's also padded with copper-infused cooling foam that feels good to sit on, and even designed to stay cool.</p><p dir="ltr">However, one ergonomic feature the Embody doesn't offer is four-directional armrests. Instead, it only offer two-dimensional adjustments. While that might seem like an odd omission--especially for a chair that costs this much--the lack of those extra adjustment vectors is moreso due to Herman Miller's fine-tuned ergonomic considerations rather than a shortcoming.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/foldablegamingchair.com\/products\/foldable-gaming-chair&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair">Best Compact Gaming Chair For Travel</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/foldablegamingchair.com\/products\/foldable-gaming-chair&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair">The Foldable Gaming Chair</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4181297-foldablegamingchair.png">                             <a href="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/foldablegamingchair.com\/products\/foldable-gaming-chair&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> 600D water-resistant polyester</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> Foam back padding</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 350 pounds</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 22.5 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width: </strong>22 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> Static</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 300 pounds</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Folding design with carry bag; includes drink holders, retractable headphone/headset hook.</li></ul><p>For something a bit different, check out The Foldable Gaming Chair. This unique option resembles a traditional folding lawn chair, but it's far more comfortable than you might expect. With ample cushions and a clever shape that provides support for your back, bottom, thighs, and arms, The Foldable Gaming Chair is a great option for your game room. It's quite wide and supports up to the 350 pounds.</p><p>This chair has a couple of novel benefits. As the name suggests, it easily folds--just like a lawn chair--and comes with a bag to store it in. This design perk could prove useful for space-conscious users who might not necessarily want a bulky chair taking up precious floor space.

Admittedly, the average bean bag chair isn't the most comfortable option for adults. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/moon-pod-review-is-this-300-ergonomic-beanbag-wort/1100-6480934/" data-ref-id="1100-6480934">Moon Pod</a>, however, is anything but an average bean bag chair. While not technically a "gaming product," the Moon Pod absolutely works as a high-end living room chair for those who want to sit closer to their TV while gaming (especially for those games where the text is annoyingly small). It also works well for those who are working from home and need to take a break from their office chair. Unlike most bean bag chairs, the Moon Pod's design is specifically aimed at providing an ergonomic lounging experience. The Moon Pod contours and adapts to your positioning, providing back and lumbar support. The bean bag, which is appropriately shaped like a pod, features high-density beads that are packed to simulate the sensation of weightlessness, and it's incredibly relaxing to sink into.</p><p dir="ltr">At $300, however, the Moon Pod is extremely pricey for a bean bag, and there are add-ons that raise the price even more. The Crescent back pillow, which is helpful for additional back support, tacks on another $129 to the price. For that reason, we recommend just getting the base product first to try it out before snagging any add-ons, though we will say the combination of the Moon Pod and the Crescent feels absolutely incredible.</p><p dir="ltr">The Moon Pod itself is also quite large, taking up approximately four square feet, so you definitely need to have a spot picked out for it or somewhere that you can store it between uses. That said, this is the most comfortable bean bag chair around and checks all of the boxes for a solid living room gaming chair.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4567">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-computer-speakers/1100-6499140/">Best Computer Speakers For Gaming</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-4k-tv-for-gaming/1100-6482374/">Best 4K TVs For Gaming</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-monitor/1100-6488680/">Best Monitor For PS5, Xbox Series X</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Tech Picks From GameSpot Links (6)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-chair/1100-6486393/">The Best Gaming Chair In 2024</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-cheap-gaming-monitor-2022-budget-monitors-for-gaming-and-productivity/1100-6474721/">Best Cheap Gaming Monitors In 2022</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-headset/1100-6486018/">Best PC Headsets In 2023</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-switch-controller-you-can-buy-in/1100-6469264/">The Best Nintendo Switch Controllers You Can Buy</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-vr-headset-for-march-2020-half-life-alyx-/1100-6473057/">The Best VR Headsets In 2020</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-webcam-to-buy-in-2022/1100-6480048/">The Best Webcam For 2021: Top Picks For Streaming On Twitch And YouTube</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino will jointly succeed Jim Ryan as the CEOs of Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>Hulst is CEO of the newly named Studio Business Group, which includes all of PlayStation’s first-party teams, plus covers the development of PlayStation IP onto other mediums, such as TV and film. Hulst was already head of PlayStation Studios. He was previously the co-founder of Horizon and Killzone developer Guerrilla Games, which was acquired by Sony in 2005.</p>
<p>"I am thrilled to lead the studio business group and continue to build on our success with PlayStation 5, while preparing for the future,” Hulst said in a statement. “The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world and has been built on the marriage of content and technology, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of play and entertainment.”</p>
<p>Hideaki Nishino will lead the Platform Business Group, which includes console hardware, technology, accessories, PlayStation Network and third-party relations (covering major publishers and indie studios). He was already SVP of Platform Experiences. He’s been part of the Sony business since 2006, holding numerous roles at Sony Network Entertainment, Sony Corporation and SIE.</p>
<p>"We will continue to connect players and creators through world-class products, services, and technology," Nishino said. "We always strive to grow our community even bigger with innovation in every area at Sony Interactive Entertainment.”</p>
<p>"I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen. By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future."</p>
<p>Both leaders will report to Sony Interactive Entertainment chairman Hiroki Totoki, who has been acting CEO of the division since Jim Ryan stepped down from the role at the end of March. Totoki is also president, COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation. The latest changes will take effect from June 1st.</p>
<p>“Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology," Totoki said. "These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences."</p>
<p>The fact both new CEOs are established PlayStation veterans is in-keeping with Sony’s approach of promoting from within. However, the decision to have two leaders is not something the business has done before and reflects the growing size and scale of the division.</p>
<p>PlayStation’s Studios business has grown exponentially over the past ten years, both in terms of headcount and scale of its brands. Its recent strategy has seen it port more of its titles to PC, develop TV shows and movies based on its IP and push into live-service game development, which included the acquisition of Destiny developer Bungie in 2022.</p>
<p>However, costs have also grown significantly, resulting in recent game cancellations, staff redundancies and the closure of its London Studio. The release detailing the new leadership says that this structure is designed to deliver 'sustainable growth'.</p>

Players will likely recognize the location as the same spot where many have dropped a young penguin off of the mountain’s cliff in the Nintendo 64 classic.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/13/mario-1715631589943.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="SUPER MARIO 64 COOL, COOL MOUNTAIN DOOR FINALLY UNLOCKED" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/13/mario-1715631589943.png?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>SUPER MARIO 64 COOL, COOL MOUNTAIN DOOR FINALLY UNLOCKED</figcaption></figure></output><p>The cabin set just to the side of the penguin nest is where you can find Super Mario 64’s unopenable door. It usually serves as an exit for Cool, Cool Mountain’s first stage, Slip Slidin’ Away, awarding players with a Star after they complete the slide and walk through the door. However, Mario is unable to walk back through from the outside, as this half of the door is uniquely missing a doorknob and is blocked by an invisible wall. Anyone who’s played Super Mario 64 has probably tried to walk through the door even if they don’t remember doing it, and now, after 28 years, a solution is here.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmqFoojMeD8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pennenkoek2012’s video</a> walks players through the struggles presented by the legendary door and how Alexpalix1 managed to bypass them. While players have been able to use the mother penguin to make Mario clip through the invisible wall and near the door, they’ve never been able to actually use the door itself to enter the cabin.</p><p>Alexpalix1’s new method still guides the penguin up against the cabin, while backflipping in between the blue bird and the building just as others have done before. What they change, though, is Mario’s animation just as he comes into contact with the door’s hitbox. There’s no floor on the other side of the invisible wall that blocks the entrance, and unfortunately for our plumber friend, he needs to be walking when opening a door.</p><p>Alexpalix1 tricks the game by turning Mario around just before he falls, allowing him to briefly walk in midair long enough to use the door. The player can levitate for one frame when triggering Mario’s turn-around animation, so even though Mario continues to fall through the floor, the door opens and sends Mario back inside the cabin. Voila!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Players have finally solved a mystery they were never intended to solve after nearly 30 years of work. Unfortunately, it looks like there isn’t really a good reason for anyone to try and replicate Alexpalix1’s strategy. Entering the cabin from the outside does not benefit the player in any way other than providing an alternate entrance to the bottom of the ice slide. As Pannenkoek2012 notes, the doesn’t seem to have any use as a speed-running strategy either, as it’s still quite a bit slower than simply taking the slide down from the top.</p><p>For more on Super Mario 64's endless mysteries, make sure you check out some previously long-lost footage that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-64-footage-seemingly-shows-off-a-multiplayer-mode-with-luigi-for-the-first-time">seems to reveal that Luigi was almost included in the game</a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Supergiant Games is preparing its first patch for the Early Access of <em>Hades 2</em>, which will include new changes and address issues later in May. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072251730219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-patch notes are live</a>, and not quite as illuminating as you’d maybe like. But Supergiant plans to drop all the details when the date arrives.</p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"><em>Hades 2</em> has been in Early Access for about a week, with the developer tweaking the game here and there with minor hotfixes. The upcoming patch should notably be larger, as the studio announced its upcoming due date in a Steam community note earlier today. It’ll likely be the first of many regular patches for the game, but not necessarily a major one. Much of the game is still being worked on, but it just released so don’t expect to see new Regions or weapons yet.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-first-patch-for-hades-2-addresses-dashing-concerns" data-injectable="false">The first patch for <em>Hades 2</em> addresses dashing concerns</h2> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">The first <em>Hades 2</em> Early Access patch is focused on two aspects of the game: Resource gathering and navigation. According to the team, Supergiant doesn’t want “resource gathering to feel too frustrating, such as if you didn’t bring the right gathering tool along for the ride.” The studio also plans to change how Melinoë’s Dash and Sprint functions, so she’ll feel more “nimble” and “responsive” during combat. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="hades 2 first patch - dashing and resource gathering" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="802" data-injectable="true">Personally, I haven’t had too many issues with either concern. There are multiple tools to use in <em>Hades 2</em>, and taking one down into the depths or onto the surface is a progression choice. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-bronze-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do I need Bronze today</a>? Better bring the pick. I’m speculating that perhaps an upcoming change will allow you to swap tools between Regions. Sprinting and dashing also feel fine to me, but I will admit it took me a while to figure out that you hold Dash to continue Sprinting. I’m a professional.</p>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">As for when these updates arrive, Supergiant Games hasn’t set a date yet, but it does say this first patch should be coming sometime later this month.</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Supergiant is also looking into balance changes, but isn’t ready to implement them with this first patch. Instead, it’s asking players to continue playing the game and sending feedback. Some of the items the studio will soon begin tweaking include boons, enemies, weapons, and more.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="hades 2 first patch - feedback needed" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="false">The company mentions there will be a small hotfix after the upcoming patch, with a Major Update arriving “some months from now.” As part of the developer’s content roadmap, the Major Update will include “various new features and content.” </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/neha-patel-venba-music-sound-design-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the latest instalment of <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our feature series 'What I Do'</a>, where individuals in and around the video game industry tell us what, exactly, they do for a living.</p><p>The purpose of this feature is two-fold. First, as we saw with<a href="https://aftermath.site/f2p-economy-live-service-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an RPG's economy lead</a>, individuals have interesting stories to tell! And secondly, it's my hope that by showing this business is made up of specific people with specific (and often wildly different) jobs, it can help dispel the idea that everyone is just a "dev". Video games are more complicated (and interesting) than that!</p><p>Today's feature is an interview with Neha Patel, a composer, sound designer and indie advocate<a href="https://www.nehapatelaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who has worked on games like <em>Venba</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett</strong>: <em>Hi Neha! Please, tell our readers a little bit about yourself.</em></p><p><strong>Neha Patel</strong>: I’m a composer at heart and learnt sound design on the fly by doing a crap ton of game jams. But before that, I actually did my studies in classical piano. Fun fact: I begged my parents for piano lessons because I heard the soundtrack to <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>and absolutely wanted to play the piano version of “One Winged Angel.” They said no, you see we were poor and there wasn’t an understanding that music is beneficial to a child. Two years later I got hit by a car and the doctor commented on how long my fingers were, and asked if I played the piano. I got lessons immediately after, it was a sign!</p><p>Back to game audio, in 2018 I was finishing up my undergrad and on a whim applied for a scholarship to go to this thing called ‘GDC’. I knew I wanted to get into game audio but had no idea how. School wasn’t a place where I could openly discuss it (video game music is frowned upon in a music conservatory) so I spent countless hours online googling ‘how to be a video game composer’. That’s how I saw that scholarship opportunity, so I just went for it. It was completely life changing. The talks and people that I met changed my perspective on freelancing and what I could do with my life. The game audio community taught me to move forward with kindness, curiosity and respect. Game audio shouldn’t be a competition, it should be an inclusive space where we help and celebrate each other.</p><p>Somehow I was in an odd situation where, even though I was from Montréal, I did not know a single dev from the city (I was too busy practicing piano). I started my career abroad and it forced me to have this worldview and helped me see what other possibilities there were. I felt more prepared to enter the industry as a fresh grad. For example, I knew that unpaid internships were bullshit. If you truly want to help a junior, it should be a mentorship, not unpaid work. My point is, meeting all these different people and keeping up with them online truly helped me grow.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Wait, video game music is frowned upon at school?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Oh in most classical music schools, film and video game music is disregarded. Now look, I can only talk about my personal experience and things might have changed, but when I was there, it definitely was the vibe. My friend's composition teacher told him "Monkeys can compose film music".</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>If you had to put a job title on a business card, what would it be?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Depends on the gig! I call myself a composer/sound designer. I currently exclusively work in indie games (but I’m winking at you, Yoko Taro), so it depends on the contract.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A while back, a couple friends of mine were telling me how much they were underpaid by an established indie studio, whose entire imagery online was about wholesomeness and treating their workers well. And I’m sure that studio did treat their full-time employees well. But not their contractors. That pissed me off.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>So depending on the gig, then, what's an average day look like?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: If it’s writing music, I usually get a couple sentences describing the scene or character and poof! I whip out something. I never write a complete piece immediately. I start with a small excerpt and send it to the devs just to make sure I’m on the right track. Sometimes I'll hit the nail on the head immediately and other times there’s back and forth. Rarely, when the budget permits, I get to hire musicians to play the main melodies.</p><p>With sound design, I often end up doing audio direction with it too. I’ll look at the build, scope out what’s needed, start a mediocre excel sheet and make a priority list. Sometimes I end up having to take a whole ton of videos to time the sounds to, so it helps a lot when the devs do that for me, haha! Depending on the software we’re using, I also do integration. Sometimes that means directly in Unity but ideally in a middleware (yay Wwise!). The programmers and I usually end up becoming very good friends by the end of the project, they help me out so much!</p><p>Whether I’m doing music or sound design, I think the most crucial aspect is giving us audio people time for pre-production. I need to take the time to look at other games that we can use as an inspiration, often playing them or at very least watching a playthrough. I’ll research the examples and see if the composers or sound designers wrote a blog or gave a talk about their work. With music, I listen to the reference pieces a LOT. I’ll put the music on when I’m doing chores or going on a walk, it’s a constant thing.&nbsp;</p><p>One more thing, if I’m writing the whole OST (Original Sound Track) I need to have a clear timeline of when the game is releasing and be given enough time to get the album ready. This is because I am in charge of releasing the album on all streaming services and timing is key to hitting a higher audience. Also, the music that you hear in-game isn’t the same as the one in the album. We do a completely different mix/master and it’s a lot of work! I have an entire GDC talk about releasing an OST and what you can do right before release to achieve peak revenue.</p><p>As for scheduling, I try to make my days align to the usual ‘9-5’ schedule and work from home. But that’s just a framework, I change it around depending on needs and deadlines. I don’t crunch but there are days I overwork, it happens. In exchange, I get so much flexibility and I value that a lot. Some weeks are heavier than others. On lighter weeks, it gives me time to actually play more games and take care of myself better. It’s hard giving an exact answer because it really depends on what’s happening. For me it’s less about ‘clocking in the hours’ and more about achieving tasks and milestones.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi im a video game composer and I charge ~1000$/min! </p><p>That number is not ✨wtf high✨it's an approx industry standard for someone who shipped + couple years of experience!</p><p>It's a number shared by a lotta vg composer who work ethically, i did not just make it up!</p></div>— Neha🍉 (@Nehapolitan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nehapolitan/status/1785026933027377541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>In addition to your music and sound work,</em><a href="https://twitter.com/Nehapolitan/status/1785026933027377541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> you've also become something of an advocate for indie development, especially when it comes to fair pay and conditions</em></a><em>.

So I think it’s important to understand my personality. I am an empath. I feel everything, I’m a sponge that absorbs the emotions of others very intensely. It’s not fun at all but it leads me to the following: I feel very strongly about other people’s injustices, more than my own.</p><p>A while back, a couple friends of mine were telling me how much they were underpaid by an established indie studio, who’s entire imagery online was about wholesomeness and treating their workers well.

I also saw the effects of an unpaid internship and forced crunch a friend of mine had to endure at a local studio. These were people that were known in our community and it hurt so bad. My friend was so harshly exploited, they got sick. Again, I couldn’t do anything.</p><p>The only reason I wasn’t exploited at the start of my career was because I had met a wider game audio community that taught me about sustainable freelancing. I knew about the red flags before I started professionally. I knew when to say no, when to pass on ‘opportunities’ that in the long term might have burnt me out. Those friends that were exploited did not. They just took the first thing that was given to them, usually out of fear of missing out. So initially, I just started telling them everything I knew. Then I realized ‘oh crap, there’s a lot of people I need to tell this too’. So I started the easiest thing one could do: Write tweets.</p><p>I also knew that I wanted to keep going to these game conferences but good lord are they way too expensive. So…I applied with talks. I knew I had information about how Steam OST sales work and how to launch an album, so I kept talking about that! Sustainability in game audio freelancing is such an important topic to me. People were transparent and kind to me, so I’m just giving it forward. I don’t intend on being an advocate, it feels like a lot of pressure. I’m not inventing anything, I’m just sharing the numbers I have.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>What do you think are the biggest challenges you're facing in your job in the games industry today? And how would you like to see them overcome?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Yikes. Uh, late stage capitalism? What stage are we even at?? Greed-fuelled layoffs, housing crisis, global warming??</p><p>Ok I’m going to try and scope smaller here. I don’t have that much experience, I only started my career around four years ago. Getting consistent gigs is difficult, I had one fall through just now, ha! I guess that brings me to how unstable the industry is. You never know what could happen. I don’t have a clean cut solution.&nbsp;</p><p>I do have to say, though: Be really good with your finances. Especially if you’re a freelancer. And even more so if you’re a freelance audio person that works in indie games!! The industry isn’t secure, but you can try and mitigate risks by looking at your personal finances. You should know your expense rate and be financially literate. It’s never too late to learn! Also don’t be swooned by the latest gear and software. If they are not going to be paying themselves off in the next 3 months, you probably don’t need it. You should have seen my old desk and how tiny my screen was. I am cheap with my gear, but not the humans I work with, if that makes sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Thanks so much for chatting with us!
