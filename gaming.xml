            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous-children-of-morta-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Surprise! A brand new&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>DLC pack has been revealed, and it's bringing a crossover with a major indie roguelite. What's more, it's free for everyone!</p>
<p>The DLC is called&nbsp;<em>Visitors from Morta</em>, and as you've probably guessed, it's a crossover with pixel-art roguelite&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/children-of-morta"><em>Children of Morta</em></a>. Download this one and you're getting a new area, new unique opponents, and more.</p>
<p>Developer and publisher Owlcat says it "tried to capture the mood of&nbsp;<em>Children of Morta</em>" with this DLC, as well as preserving the characters' unique personalities while still making sure they're integrated well into the world of&nbsp;<em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-children-of-morta-dlc-characters.jpg?itok=uSCZpI7B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-children-of-morta-dlc-characters.jpg?itok=fzzficv3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>has some new free DLC for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>If you download and check out this DLC, you'll get a new location to enjoy, plus two new archetypes that are designed around&nbsp;<em>Children of Morta&nbsp;</em>heroes John and Lucy. You'll also be able to use those archetypes when creating your own character.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll get a new female hairstyle based on Lucy's do, as well as a new quest involving John and Lucy, whom you must rescue and guide home.</p>
<p>If you want to access the DLC, you can do so either at the start of&nbsp;<em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>' second chapter, or at any stage in chapters three or five. Either Anevia or Arsinoe will bring you the quest, and you'll need to visit the new location on your map to start it.</p>

<p>This DLC comes as a surprise given that back in May, Owlcat <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous-dlc-release-date">announced</a> that the then-upcoming DLC pack&nbsp;<em>A Dance of Masks&nbsp;</em>would serve as the game's final expansion.</p>
<p>Still, I suppose a little freebie doesn't count as a "full" DLC pack, so Owlcat can still claim it's done with making major&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>content. Well played, Owlcat.</p>
<p><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em>'&nbsp;<em>Children of Morta&nbsp;</em>DLC is available right now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. A Switch version of the DLC is also in the works and will arrive "soon". You can check out our&nbsp;<em>Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>review <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous-review">here</a>, and you can read our&nbsp;<em>Children of Morta&nbsp;</em>review <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/children-of-morta-review-appealing-action-rpg">right here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-mobile-release-date-revealed-in-funny-yet-terrifying-trailer.973074/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Playstack and developer LocalThunk have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>mobile release date, and the information comes alongside a trailer that's sure to contribute to your insomnia.</p>
<p>The addictive poker roguelike lands on iOS and Google Play, as well as Apple Arcade, on September 26th, so if you've already been enjoying its endlessly absorbing gameplay on PC or consoles, well, now you've got an excuse to play it on the go as well.</p>
<p>News of the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>mobile release date comes alongside a trailer that features a joker card by the name of Jimbo, as well as some surreal imagery and&nbsp;<em>Inscryption</em>-style creepy energy. I don't want to overexplain it, but you can check the trailer out here.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(and the above trailer didn't put you off), it's a poker-based roguelike in which the goal is to "play illegal poker hands, discover game-changing jokers, and trigger adrenaline-pumping, outrageous combos".</p>
<p>The game features a campaign mode with eight difficulty levels, as well as plenty of different cards, decks, and synergies to discover. In short, if you're a roguelike fan, then you're likely going to love this one.</p>
<p>You wouldn't be alone if you did, either; within its first two weeks,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">crossed the 500,000 sales mark</a>, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">a million copies in its first month</a>&nbsp;and to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon">cross the two million barrier last month</a>.</p>
<p>More content is on the way to&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, too; LocalThunk and Playstack have confirmed that a major update is on the way next year, and it's set to bring "new ideas and strategies" to the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-mobile-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=uzbfzQDE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-mobile-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=Em34-22_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is set to come to mobile later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/balatro/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/balatro/9pk087lngjc5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/balatro-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's coming to Android and iOS via the Play Store and the App Store on September 26th, so you might want to think about booking that day off.</p>

The update adds new, gruesome cinematics for some of the game’s evil endings, new legendary actions for Honor Mode encounters, and official in-game mod support.</p><p>However, with Patch 7 comes a big ole asterisk from the game’s maker, Larian Studios. The patch is currently only available for PC, meaning that players will be unable to load cross-platform save files from PC on their console versions. PC / Mac multiplayer is also disabled. Larian says that it intends to launch Patch 7 on consoles and Mac sometime in October, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827343/baldurs-gate-3-reactivates-ps5-cross-saves">if you like to hop between desktop and console to play <em>BG3</em></a>, you’ll have to wait about a month. The compatibility issues can be avoided by simply declining to update the game on PC, but with all the other Patch 7 improvements, that might prove a difficult choice.</p><p>The official mod support will allow players to browse, download, and manage user-made mods directly in the game. Enterprising players will also be able to use the new toolkit to create their own mods that will work across PC and console (once Patch 7 is available on consoles).</p><p>Patch 7 also includes the requisite host of tweaks, improvements, and bug fixes. You can check out all the specifics <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-7-now-live_121">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p> "Do not forget to turn the system off before touching anything," says my astronaut colleague over the radio. I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tin-can">Tin Can</a> is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/space_exploration">Steam's space exploration fest</a>. And I enjoy a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a> that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.</p>

<p>We haven't covered it before, but it's basically <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> in space. Or perhaps Gravity starring Sandra Bullock, but funnier. The escape pod is notoriously troublesome. During the tutorial your colleague jokes that it is barely worth the effort of keeping the heap of junk maintained. "I would rather die than have to escape in this thing," he says. Well.</p>
<p>It is full of small moments of comic misjudgement. My fellow space employee asks me to install some components back into the oxygen generator, slotting circuit boards and pumps into an intimidating drawer full of machinery. "You can't get it wrong," he says. </p>
<p>I fumble with the loose switch and drop it on the floor. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm a janitor. </p>
<p>But it's possible the game is stealthily teaching me science. The engineer colleague talks all about the correct ratios of oxygen to nitrogen in breathable air, for example. But it's the tension of needing to survive that really hammers home the knowledge about pressure bars or nuclear decay. You learn a lot quicker when faced with the practical concern of, you know, not dying. </p>
<p>The requirements soon stack up. When the main computer is down there's no way of knowing which exact component is faulty within the pod. So you have to glance at a bunch of little monitors for cryptic four-letter codes, then resort to flipping through a clipboard manual to identify those error codes and understand which do-hickey is causing trouble. It is hugely cumbersome. I love it.</p>
<p>Like I say, it's on sale, so you can suffocate for half price. But there's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315980/Tin_Can/">a demo on Steam</a> that will take you through all the basics I describe here, and have you switching little buttons on and off with the reckless abandon of a toddler in the front seat of a station wagon. Go on, embrace a few mistakes. If you don't accidentally turn off the gravity at least once, how will you know to avoid it in the future?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Pssst. You into hardcore 2D platformers? And do you like lil' green guys, just like, gooby wooby lookin' orbs of green? Then I present to you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gimmick-2">Gimmick! 2</a>, which has an unexpected exclamation point before the "2" and all of the above. It's out now and will no doubt please fans who've been waiting <em>years</em> for a sequel to the original Gimmick!, and possibly other platform enthusiasts who are after a decidedly different style of gap-hopper.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For a brief nugget of context, the original Gimmick! was a Famicom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> developed by Sunsoft and released in 1992. Funnily enough, at the time it only ever got localised for Scandinavia, where it was called Mr. Gimmick (what all of the Demon Souls bosses should've been named… ahem, anyway). It starred a green yokai called Yumetaro, who embarked on a quest to save a young girl from evil toys. And it has since been re-released a bunch of times, most recently getting a 2023 remaster called Gimmick! Special Edition. </p>
<figure>
<p>

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QqtRjEhf2s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>And so Swedish dev Bitwave and publisher Sunsoft have come together to release Gimmick! 2, many years later. It stars the same Yumetaro who embarks on a different quest, all in an updated aesthetic that has a Spelunky sheen. In it you'll hop and avoid spikes and do puzzles, like almost all other platformers. But what sets it apart is Yumetaro's ability to summon and throw a powerful star - his gimmick, you could say - that not only bounces, but <em>also</em> retains momentum from his movement. You can use it to activate switches, bonk enemies, and eliminate chunks of the map to reveal secret spots. Oh and you can trick enemies so that their heads form helpful platforms as they fall to their deaths, too.</p>
<p>Honestly, Gimmick! 2 looks like a tricky platformer, owing to the physics-y interactions between your little green goob, his bouncy star, and the obstacles you're trying to bonk or cross or flip. I imagine it requires a lot of precise movement and a lot of risk-taking, especially when it comes to surfing on that star in critical moments. But I also imagine it makes for some fun problem solving that doesn't just require some carefully timed air-dashes. There's an assisted mode if you want an easier time, otherwise you've got the Gimmick! mode for the "true-to-the-original" challenge.</p>
<p>You can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2994880/Gimmick_2/">Steam</a> if you're interested. Cheers to RPS commenter treelo for giving us the heads-up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-25-gameplay-deep-dive-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>EA Sports <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/nhl/nhl-25/news/gameplay-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has released the deep dive</a> for NHL 25 gameplay ahead of its October release. The deep dive was originally set to be released on August 30, but was postponed due to the tragic deaths of Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau.</p>



<p>In the NHL 25 gameplay deep dive, EA Sports gives insight into its new Ice-Q technology for this year’s game. From new vision control to updated AI to more reactive actions, EA Sports is hoping that the gameplay updates will help make the on-ice action more authentic than ever before.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 25 Official Gameplay Trailer | Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hw0APrAqgDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-nhl-25-gameplay-features">NHL 25 Gameplay Features</h2>



<p>All of the below information comes directly from EA Sports itself.</p>



<h3 id="h-next-gen-vision-control">Next-Gen Vision Control</h3>



<p><em>“Next-Gen Vision Control is an evolution of Chel’s skating system that allows you to create more time and space on the ice by providing fresh abilities, improvements, and a user-initiated skating mode that ups the responsiveness, explosiveness, and expression on the ice for human and AI players alike.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“For example, when Next-Gen Vision Control is active and the player has the puck in the offensive zone, they now skate with the net as the target. This opens up the player’s body creating the ability to skate and attack the net, shoot the puck, or pass from anywhere in the offensive zone in a contextually more authentic way.”</em></p>



<h3 id="h-empowered-ai">Empowered AI</h3>



<p>“<em>Empowered AI is a complete overhaul of our AI player system, heightening CPU skaters’ awareness of other players and positioning on the ice, giving them more fluid and helpful reads to execute in a true-to-life fashion.</em></p>



<p><em>“On top of that, all of Chel’s In Zone strategies — including Behind the Net, Overload and Crash the Net — have been rebuilt from the ground up to allow skaters to better utilize open space and position themselves to be bigger offensive threats.”</em></p>



<h3 id="h-reactive-actions">Reactive Actions</h3>



<p>“<em>New to NHL 25, Reactive Actions like collision avoidance animations allow players to swim past one another and into position smoothly like the pros, no longer running into and getting tangled up with each other.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“Plus, all-new panic turns let players quickly change direction and use their stick to take away space if they are beaten on the ice, making defensive players more athletic and dynamic. Players will also stick out their legs to try and block a shot or pass and offensive teammates will lower their sticks into passing lanes if they feel they’re in a good spot.”</em></p>



<h3 id="h-skill-based-one-timers">Skill-based One-timers</h3>



<p><em>“Anchored by a new in-game visual indicator that identifies a teammate as a target for a Skill Based One-Timer, when passing to a teammate you’ll need to input the shot control as the puck arrives. The timing window to nail a Skill Based One-Timer is dynamic and takes into account how fast the pass is traveling, as well as the shooter’s abilities like the One T X-Factor.</em></p>



<p><em>“If timed correctly you’ll unleash the Skill Based One-Timer, which is more powerful and accurate. If your timing is off, the shot’s accuracy drops, raising the stakes and making the action all the more exciting.”</em></p>



<figure></figure>

<p>Astro Bot’s release is here, but people are already wondering about DLC plans for the future. Luckily, the base game doesn’t appear to be all that developer Team Asobi has planned.</p>



<p>During a special pre-release presentation for select invitees, Team Asobi talked about plans for Astro Bot. According to the developer, the plan is to add 10 challenge levels as well as five speed run levels for players.</p>







<p>So far, no release window or actual public confirmation from the developers have been announced.</p>



<p>In the base game, Astro Bot will have 300 bots to rescue. Half of them will be call backs to various PlayStation characters and games of the past. Astro himself will also have abilities and skills that will remind players of classic characters.</p>



<p>Astro Bot is available starting September 6 exclusively on PlayStation 5.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Balatro Mobile - Official Release Date Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Balatro is a card-based puzzle game which sees players use traditional playing cards to battle against "Blinds," as playing cards from their hand earns them points--think poker, but with rules you can mess with.

            <p>
Not very shockingly for a game that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukongs-record-setting-launch-popularity-soured-by-co-publisher-request-to-avoid-feminist-propaganda-in-streams">set Steam records</a> within hours of release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is getting DLC, the first in a series of follow-up projects that continue the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> epic's explorations of Chinese mythology. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That's from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win?leadSource=uverify%20wall">a new Bloomberg interview</a> with Daniel Wu, co-founder of Hero Games, the largest external shareholder in Wukong developers Game Science. What the DLC actually consists of and when it'll launch remain to be seen, but the article compares it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, which has demonstrated how a timely and substantial expansion "can spur a fresh flurry of sales for the original."</p>
<p>I imagine there will be new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-bosses">bosses</a> and a few more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-black-myth-wukong-meditation-spots">meditation spots</a>, but perhaps they'll flesh out the setting in less combative or progression-driven ways. Edders, who authored our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>, is hoping for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-needs-an-assassins-creed-style-discovery-mode">some kind of Discovery Mode</a>.
</p>
<p>
DLC aside, the Bloomberg piece dips into the backstory of both companies: a much-publicised 2017 meeting between Wu and Apple bigwig Tim Cook, which didn't really go anywhere; Game Science's "four failures in a row", including several free-to-play mobile games, prior to releasing Wukong; and the fact that even following Wukong's success, with Game Science now worth "several billion yuan", the 2000-person Hero Games team aren't making a profit. 
</p>
<p>
Hero Games sunk 60 million yuan ($8.5 million) into Game Science back in 2017. They aren't profitable, it seems, partly because they're still making their money back from previous Game Science flops, but Wu also notes that "this is the most gruesome year for China's games industry ever," with wider economic difficulties leading to cuts in entertainment spending and a number of cancellations.
</p>
<p>One way to keep growing Wukong's audience could be to make more of an appeal to overseas players - according to Game Developer, the <a href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449">vast majority of the launch sales came from China</a>.</p>
<p>
As ever with Hero Games, Wu declined to answer questions from Bloomberg about a notorious guidance document asking English-language Wukong streamers and video makers to avoid discussing "feminist propaganda", Covid prevention measures, or Chinese government policy. In what a less generous soul might read as an exercise in telling on your creepy self, the (not legally binding) caution about "feminist propaganda" came in the wake of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">an extensive IGN report from last year that Game Science has a culture of sexism</a>.
</p>
<p>
The developers and their partners have staunchly avoided discussing or fielding questions on the subject. I asked a PR representative for Black Myth: Wukong about the streamer "Do's and Don'ts" in August, and was told a week or two later that "unfortunately, we cannot provide a comment at this time".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-is-the-obnoxious-game-we-needed-it-to-be/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Video games allow designers and developers to take whatever ideas they have in their minds and bring them to life in ways you can only imagine. Sometimes, you get games with great stories; sometimes, you get games with great art styles; and sometimes, you get Squirrel With A Gun.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-hands-on-another-indie-must-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This sandbox puzzle game</a> is one of the more over-the-top games you’ll ever play. You see inspiration from games like Untitled Goose Game and even Goat Simulator, but things are done in a way that makes everything feel unique.</p>



<p>From the opening cutscenes, you get an idea of what you’re in for with this game. What you think is a cute, innocent squirrel quickly turns into the menace of the town once you find a gun. Get it? Because the name of the game is… Yea, you get it!</p>



<p>Anyway, from the opening Secret Bunker to various areas throughout the town, there is no shortage of chaos that unfolds. From going through a house filled with lava to saving a wedding to getting into an old-fashioned western shootout, the game just feels all over the place with what happens. There doesn’t feel like there’s any rhyme or reason behind locations aside from doing the craziest things you can think of. And, to be clear, that’s not a bad thing. You can’t expect a game called Squirrel with a Gun to have much in the way of logic.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-post-launch-support/">What’s Up With Squirrel With a Gun Post-Launch Support?</a></h6>



<p>In each area you have to collect Golden Acorns which are used to unlock new weapons and vehicles. There are also reload wedges and clothing to collect, with some clothing actually impacting the game play. For example, the eye patch makes your neck snapping a bit more effective to make sure your victims never get back up.</p>



<p>From a weapons standpoint, you have a nice mix. From shotguns to grenade launchers to six shooters, each weapon has its own pros and cons. The shotgun will help you jump higher, coming in handy for certain puzzles in the game. The sub-machine gun&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each weapon also has its own finishing animation, but each gun only has one. They are all fun the first few times, but they do get old after a little while. But just when you think you are over the animations, you trigger one after going through a group of wanna-be Agent Smith’s that reignites that enjoyment again.</p>



<p>It’s not just running around the town wreaking havoc, however. The puzzles are both challenging and satisfying. Figuring out how to place weights to open a staircase, learning how to cook the burgers for the miserable cookout guests, and finding out which gun you need to reach a certain area of a building all give you just enough of a challenge without it being something you have to look up online. Each area has a flag pole that you can climb to get an overview of the level with each level section giving you a hint of what you have to do.</p>



<p>There are actual boss fights within the game to give you that sense of story and accomplishment. The first boss fight involves a tank manned by “Father”. The second involves a helicopter, and it’s just as over-the-top as any Mission Impossible movie.</p>



<p>There are some things that frustrate me with the game. The biggest being the camera. It can be hard at times to really see what’s going on in the game, and manually reorienting the camera over and over can get frustrating. It would be nice to have a quick button click to reset the camera, especially during the more intense action sections of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, you can be hit by agents shooting at you without any indication aside from actively looking at your health. When you are focused on the events on-screen, you can quickly lose track of your health.</p>



<h2 id="h-squirrel-with-a-gun-review-verdict">Squirrel With A Gun Review Verdict</h2>



<p>Squirrel with a Gun is the exact type of obnoxious game it needed to be. While things can feel a little empty at times, the game having a shorter completion time of just 5-6 hours helps keep things from getting too dry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite its name, platforming and puzzles are the best part of the game. Each feels rewarding when completed and adds to the joy that comes from playing this game. The gunplay can get kind of dull after a bit, but it’s nothing that’ll stop you from completing the game</p>



<p>It’s the perfect game for those looking for something new and out there without wanting to break the bank or spend 30+ hours on something. It fits nicely in its space, and is a fun first step for a game that sees a larger sequel come in a few years.</p>

"However, we don’t plan to do anything like deliberately changing conversation topics in order to cater to new fans."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>He continued: "We are middle aged guys ourselves, so I guess that’s the kind of target audience we’re going for, probably. I think this is precisely one of [the series'] selling points. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, everything starts with three unemployed middle aged guys being like, 'Let’s go to [the job centre].' They have a different air about them than a group of young heroes would, complaining about back pain and the like. But this humanity you feel from their age is what gives the game originality."</p><p>The Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-renamed-like-a-dragon-in-the-west-explained-why">which had a confusing name change in 2022</a>, focused on original protagonist Kiryu Kazuma through the first six games and prequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a>. While he was just 20 in that game, Kiryu was 37 in the first Yakuza (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/21/yakuza-kiwami-review">which was remade as Yakuza Kiwami in 2016</a>), 38 in Yakuza 2 (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/23/yakuza-kiwami-2-review">remade as Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>), then 41, 42, 44, and eventually 48 in Yakuza 6. He appears in later games too, and continues to grow older alongside the series.</p><p>Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga, who takes over from Kiryu in what's essentially Yakuza 7, is 42 in that game and 46 in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (essentially Yakuza 8). The series does feature plenty of characters who aren't middle aged men, but most of its main cast are.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p>"The characters are flesh and blood human beings much like our players are, so their problems are relatable," Horii said. "That’s why it’s easy to really get into the game and feel like you’re listening to conversations between ordinary people. There isn’t any typical 'game-like' language like 'where is the treasure chest?'"</p><p>Yakuza/Like a Dragon lead planner Hirotoka Chiba gave an example. "There’s a conversation where Adachi is conflicted about whether he should drink beer or not because he’s worried about his uric acid level," he said. "We’re making the hearty talks of middle-aged dudes our identity, rather than youthfulness."</p><p>Fans expecting a hard left turn in the next game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rgg-summit-showcase-to-reveal-next-yakuzalike-a-dragon-game-in-september">which is being revealed on September 20</a>, may therefore have to think again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Adachi is conflicted about whether he should drink beer or not because he’s worried about his uric acid level.</p></div><p>It's unknown if this new game (or potentially games) is the next mainline Yakuza/Like a Dragon entry, another spin-off game like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a>, another remake like Yakuza: Kiwami or Like a Dragon: Ishin, another game from spin-off series <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/20/judgment-review">Judgment</a>, or something else entirely, however.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-fans-buzz-as-sega-trademarks-yakuza-wars">Publisher Sega did register a trademark for something called Yakuza Wars</a> in August 2024, however, and RGG has already said fans will be "surprised" by the reveal.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

That’s enough to put Black Myth Wukong up there with Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as one of the fastest-selling games of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Black Myth: Wukong Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1831660859606684139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insight at Niko Partners, said the $700 million figure is actually dated August 30, and that Black Myth Wukong is now around the $800 million mark. That’s an astonishing return for a game Bloomberg reported had a budget of $70 million over six years of development.</p><p>Fans, though, will be most interested in Game Science’s plans for Black Myth Wukong now it’s out in the wild. While the developer has yet to say, Bloomberg’s report confirmed an expansion is in the works, with Game Science said to be following Elden Ring’s lead. Elden Ring, itself one of the best-selling video games of all-time, saw a significant expansion DLC called Shadow of the Erdtree launch in 2024, two years after the base game.</p><p>From Bloomberg: “It won’t take another six years for the next chapter in what’s planned to be a series based on Chinese mythology — though that won’t be a sequel, Wu [Daniel Wu, Hero Games boss] said. Game Science is working on an expansion to Wukong, which will give it a chance to monetize the game a second time. 2022’s Elden Ring, a title with similar play style and design, has shown how the release of an expansion — this year’s Shadow of the Erdtree — can spur a fresh flurry of sales for the original.”</p><p>Last month, IGN verified <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-marketing-team-offers-content-creators-a-steam-key-but-bans-feminist-propaganda-and-all-talk-of-covid"><u>an email sent from the Black Myth: Wukong marketing team</u></a> at Hero Games that told content creators who were granted a Steam key that they must not include “feminist propaganda” or use what are called “trigger words” such as COVID-19 in their coverage. At the time, Hero Games failed to respond to IGN’s request for comment on the matter, and Wu declined to comment when asked by Bloomberg.</p><p>Game Science has yet to respond to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west"><u>IGN’s previous report</u></a> compiling numerous sexist comments made by the studio's founders and other developers spanning the last decade.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source">Black Myth: Wukong's delay on Xbox is due to an exclusivity deal with Sony</a> and not a development issue with Microsoft’s consoles, a knowledgeable source has told IGN.</p><p>This week, a Microsoft spokesperson issued IGN a fresh statement: "As we have said before, we’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X and S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>“We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>IGN has otherwise reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-black-myth-wukong-you-can-summon-one-boss-to-beat-another-boss-while-basically-doing-nothing"><u>a super cool Black Myth: Wukong secret that lets you summon one boss to beat another boss while you basically do nothing</u></a>, and on how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-very-early-black-myth-wukong-boss-is-absolutely-destroying-players"><u>one optional boss encountered very early in the game is absolutely destroying players</u></a>.

                <p>PlayStation's latest big game, the multiplayer arena shooter Concord, launched in late August and struggled so much out of the gate that Sony decided to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">stop sales and take the game offline beginning September 6</a>. Lead character designer Jon Weisnewski has now thanked fans for their support ahead of the server shutdown, while acknowledging that the studio doesn't know what the future holds.</p><p>Posting on social media, Weisnewski said the team at Firewalk Studios is <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1831389525530308892" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"packed with tenacious fighters"</a> who built Concord amid a number of challenging scenarios. This included multiple acquisitions--the latest of which was Sony's buyout of the company in 2023--along with an engine upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. Weisnewski also mentioned how Concord was developed during the pandemic and faced delays, noting that "the fact we shipped at all is legendary."</p><p>"To all the players who showed up for Concord: thank you. The positivity and constructive feedback in the face of overwhelming noise was huge for everyone at Firewalk. Building a positive community was why we did this. We saw you. Every stream, post, thread, emoji, we saw it all," the developer <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1831385535186936235" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added.</a></p><p>As for the future, Weisnewski admitted, "None of us know what's next, but I do know this team is capable of wild energy when faced with a challenge."</p><p>When Sony announced the news that Concord would shut down, game director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."</p><p>Ellis said the team will "explore options" for how to "better reach our players," which sounds like the game could return in some form down the road. This is not confirmed, however. For now, Sony is refunding everyone. Even if Concord does make a comeback, many are wondering what Concord could do to differentiate itself in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/">already-crowded market for arena shooters. </a>Some believe <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1831039618122174707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Concord is doomed</a> and won't find success, even under a different model.</p><p>Concord is the first game from Firewalk, a studio founded by developers who worked on Call of Duty, Destiny, Apex Legends, and Halo. The team had about 150 employees when Sony acquired the studio from ProbablyMonsters in 2023; the companies had <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210422005352/en/Firewalk-Studios-a-ProbablyMonsters-Studio-Reveals-Publishing-Partnership-with-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-for-AAA-Multiplayer-Game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worked together for "years" previously.</a></p><p>In 2023, Sony said Firewalk would contribute to the company's efforts to "define a new generation of live-service experiences for PlayStation gamers." Sony is also working with Assassin's Creed veteran Jade Raymond's team at Haven on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-new-ps5-and-pc-game-from-assassins-creed-boss-revealed/1100-6514454/" data-ref-id="1100-6514454">heist-themed multiplayer game called Fairgame$ (yes, really, that's the name)</a>. However, Sony is indeed scaling back its live-service efforts.</p><p>Sony was at one point planning to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surpass-17-million-10-live-service-games-coming-by-2026/1100-6500204/" data-ref-id="1100-6500204">10 live-service games by 2026</a> but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cut the figure in half as the company outlined a plan to focus on quality over quantity.</a> Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online, once described as the developer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-title-ever-druckmann-says/1100-6510559/" data-ref-id="1100-6510559">most ambitious game ever</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">was canceled</a>.</p><p>According to a report, one of the last major decisions that former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan made was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were said to be upset by this, and the blame apparently fell on industry veteran Connie Booth. A 30-year veteran, Booth left PlayStation in October 2023, and no reason for her departure was ever provided. Some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">she was fired.</a> Booth is now an executive at Electronic Arts.</p>

            <p>The mobile release for the supremely popular card roguelike Balatro is later this month.</p>
<p>The game will be available on both the iOS App store and the Google Play store from 26th September. Further, it'll be included as part of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> subscription from the same date.</p>
<p>Playstack has released a new trailer to celebrate the release, which you can watch below.</p>

<p>If you're yet to play Balatro, it essentially uses the rules of poker in a roguelike structure to hit high scores and progress. On top of that, players can purchase a huge variety of Joker cards to tip the balance in their favour.</p>
<p>All of which is to say it's already proven captivating in its current form on Steam.</p>
<p>But now it's coming to mobile, which means Balatro can be played anywhere at any time. That is, quite frankly, a dangerous prospect.</p> <div>

<p>The game originally launched in February, but it was hindered by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama">drama around its rating due to the perceived gambling connotations of its poker theme</a>. "It is what it is," said the game's solo developer localthunk at the time.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">Balatro sold 1m copies in its first month</a>, and I imagine the mobile release will add plenty more.</p>

			<p>Star Wars Outlaws launched last week, but it has already received criticism from casual and die-hard fans. The scores from critics are incredibly varied, with some giving it high praise while others provided plenty of reasons to dislike it. Currently, the Metacritic score stands at 76 for Star Wars Outlaws. Star Wars Outlaws Director <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-is-a-little-disappointed-with-the-metacritic-score-but-plans-to-keep-improving-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julian Gerighty spoke with GamesRadar</a>, and shared his thoughts and feelings on how the audience has received the game. "I'm a little disappointed with the Metacritic. Of course, recognition from press and critics is very important to us, but players are really connecting with what we did."</p>
<p>However, it seems that the vast majority of the criticism the game has received is warranted. Those who purchased the early access version of the game had to start their file from the very beginning or had their fair share of game-breaking bugs. Although the Star Wars Outlaws Director admitted that he wasn't too impressed by the score it received, he is still hopeful for the overall presence of the game, saying: "This will be a game that millions of people are going to play for years and years, and we're never going to stop improving it."</p>
<p>Although Star Wars Outlaws scored 76, that isn't necessarily bad news. It's still considered a good score. It's clear that Gerighty had high hopes for this game and expected a higher score overall from the critics. However, that isn't the only issue for Ubisoft, the game's publisher. After the launch of Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/game-developer-ubisoft-slides-amid-muted-reception-star-wars-outlaws-2024-09-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft shared</a> that they have hit a 10-year low. This doesn't spell good things for Ubisoft, as this game has the biggest marketing campaign in the company's history. Although Star Wars Outlaws has a vast amount of responsibility in this, they also were behind Skull and Bones and XDefiant, which didn't last very long for the players.</p>
<p>While the full base game of Star Wars Outlaws has been officially released, the Season Pass is still yet to come. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/">Season Pass</a> provides new cosmetics and alternative storylines for players to complete, even if it means caving in and purchasing a microtransaction to access them. Whether they will continue adding more to the Season Pass after the initial releases are done remains to be seen and will most likely depend on whether the game picks up in sales.</p>
<p>Although the game has had its fair share of hardships, Gerighty says that there's a "level of pride, happiness, and sense of accomplishment amongst the team. Outlaws was in development for roughly four years and the team literally reached for the stars."</p>

I can’t speak to the possible features of a new platform, but the Nintendo Account is a strong basis for having that communication as we make the transition.”<br></p><p>Anticipation for a Switch 2 reveal has been heating up ever since Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote back in May</a></span> that a Switch successor <em>wouldn’t</em> be mentioned during the company’s June Nintendo Direct. Naturally, fans took this to mean that a mention <em>would</em> be coming sometime later in the year. Time is starting to run out, but knowing the <em>Mario</em> maker, the first news of a Switch 2 could be shadow-dropped any day now in something as simple as a single press release or a trailer suddenly shared to social media. </p><p>And as manufacturing of the devices gets underway, the pressure will be on for Nintendo to reveal the console itself before grainy cellphone footage from a Chinese warehouse that looks like it’s from 2007 reveals it instead. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Balatro, one of the biggest hits of the year, is heading to a new platform. Developer LocalThunk <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1831695226886300045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced that</a> Balatro Mobile is launching on September 26th.</p>



<p>The game will be available via Google Play, the App Store, and Apple Arcade. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“I’m sorry,” LocalThunk said on social media when announcing the mobile version of the game. Obviously it’s one of those “sorry, not sorry” situations as the game’s release on mobile is something fans have been wanting since its first launch earlier this year.</p>



<p>The reveal of Balatro Mobile is the third of three recent announcements from LocalThunk. In addition to the new platform, Balatro received a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-collaberations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Friends of Jimbo” update</a> last month. It was also announced that a major free gameplay update with “new ideas and strategies” will come to the game in 2025.</p>







<p>More details on that update will be revealed at a later date. Pre-orders for Balatro Mobile are now open.</p>
