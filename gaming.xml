            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-digital-revenue-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has released its financial information for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the studio's revenue is up, largely driven by the success of back catalogue games like&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>.</p>

<p>According to Devolver's latest financial presentation, the studio's revenue is up 13% on last year, rising to $104.8m as compared to a total of $92m in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/human-fall-flat-2-delayed" rel="nofollow">the 2023-24 fiscal year</a>. Devolver says this is down to "strong back catalogue" and "success of lead titles".</p>

<p>The presentation also includes the latest revenue figures for a number of Devolver's titles, including&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, which has now passed the $90m revenue mark.&nbsp;<em>Astroneer&nbsp;</em>is Devolver's next best-selling game at over $80m revenue, and the&nbsp;<em>Stronghold&nbsp;</em>series, which Devolver acquired in 2021, is sitting at over $50m.</p>

No cause of death was revealed, but I hope it comes as some small comfort to his loved ones to know that so many people are enjoying the game on which he worked.</p>

<p>Later in Devolver's presentation, the studio says the Switch is its most successful console, with over nine million units sold across all of its games.</p>

<p>Devolver calls the recently-revealed Switch 2, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">which launches in June</a>, an "opportunity", pointing to several games highlighted during the recent Switch 2 Direct show:&nbsp;<em>Human Fall Flat 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</em>, and <i>Enter the Gungeon 2</i>.</p>

<p>As for what's coming up on Devolver's software slate (as well as the aforementioned, of course), upcoming games include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tron-catalyst-mike-bithell-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Tron: Catalyst</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Train 2</em></a>, and Bennett Foddy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow"><em>Baby Steps</em></a>, among many others planned for the next twelve months or so.</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees.1164804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Welp, it's finally happened. After many months of mainly murder related updates, Larian's stonker of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has at last received its final major content update. Patch 8 - which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538849539213231622">read in full here</a> - brings Photo Mode, full cross play, and 12 new subclasses to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. That's one for each playable class, and likely at least six more than I'll ever reasonably experience. Still, a swarmkeeper ranger sounds very tempting. Yes the bees, is what I always say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The full set of subclasses are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Path of the Giant Barbarian</li>
<li>College of Glamour Bard</li>
<li>Death Domain Cleric</li>
<li>Circle of Stars Druid</li>
<li>Arcane Archer Fighter</li>
<li>Way of the Drunken Master Monk</li>
<li>Oath of the Crown Paladin</li>
<li>Swarmkeeper Ranger</li>
<li>Swashbuckler Rogue</li>
<li>Shadow Magic Sorcerer</li>
<li>Hexblade Warlock</li>
<li>Bladesinging Wizard</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a sucker for a good drunken master, too. According <a href="https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Way_of_the_Drunken_Master">to the Wiki</a>, this'll grant your Monk immunity to negative booze effects, Ki regain once a day on drinking, a strike with a chance to make whatever you're punching drunk themselves, and another strike that sobers them up, causing psychic damage.</p>
<p>Oh, this sounds exciting too! There's now "partial level editing" available in the modding toolkit. "Partial level editing means that what you won’t be able to do with the official Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit is add dialogues or change the static parts of the world like buildings, scenery or terrain," say Larian. "You can, however, create your own interactive objects". Sounds like you'll be able to add NPCs too, although mute ones, presumably.</p>
<p>The update also brings the usual round of fixes, although I haven't played in so long I couldn't tell you which of these were pressing issues. I've been waiting till this patch was out!</p>
<p>As for what's next for Larian, they've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games in the works currently</a>, although are yet to share any details. Wizards Of The Coast, meanwhile, seem to be under the impression that all they have to do is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dds-makers-are-spending-1-billion-on-their-own-video-games-promising-theyll-be-quality-and-authentic-like-baldurs-gate-3">throw money around for several more Baldur's Gates</a> to fall into their laps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/larians-final-major-game-patch-for-baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-out-now-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios' journey with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> began in <a href="https://larian.com/support/faqs/general-information_46#:~:text=Baldur's%20Gate%203%20is%20using,game%20design%20in%20late%202016.">2016</a>, with a small team starting work on the game's design and story. Then, in 2020, the game launched in an early access state on PC before its full release three years later in 2023. Now, it's known as one of the best RPGs ever made.</p>
<p>Today, the journey has ended in a significant way, with Larian Studios releasing the "<em>final major game patch</em>" for Baldur's Gate 3, Patch 8, which is now live on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Mac, and PC. This is the final patch Larian will release that includes new content, and every update after this will focus on continued maintenance and bug fixing.</p>
<p>"<em>We've told our stories the way we needed to tell them, and tried our best to make them impactful and engaging, and we're continuing to get better at handling our own chaos so that we can continue to create more chaos in the future,</em>" the studio wrote in a <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138">blog post</a> on its website.</p>
<p><iframe title="Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CwCyTt8fSAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>From patching in a way to change your appearance with the Magic Mirror, introducing Honour Mode for those of you looking for a hard time, and giving you new ways to make out with your romanced companion, to new cinematics for your most evil runs, and handing you the tools to create your own supported mods, Patch 8 now rounds off with cross-play, Photo Mode, and 12 new subclasses for you to enjoy.</em>"</p>
<p>Beyond the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">subclasses</a>, cross-play functionality is one of the more significant features added in Patch 8, and it'll even work with most mods you might want to use. There are a few hang-ups, though, like the fact that all players will have to have the same version of the mods installed, and PC players squadding up with console players will need to be aware that only mods compatible with consoles will work when trying to use cross-play across PC and console devices.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble, Larian put together a handy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4ffv7xLsI">video guide</a> to take you through the process. Larian even put together a video guide to help you learn the ropes with the newly included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RrZaWrZG-8">Photo Mode</a> to apply your photography skills to the world of Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>You can find the full patch notes here to dig into every adjustment and change in Patch 8.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening Delayed to June for "Improvements"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-delayed-to-june-for-improvements.1164771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Funcom has announced that upcoming survival game&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure the devs can implement "improvements".</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Funcom says that it still needs "a bit more time to cook" in order to "act on a lot more of the feedback" provided by beta testers in the past few months. As such,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on June 10th instead of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date" rel="nofollow">previously-set date of May 20th</a>.</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't take the decision to move the game's release date "lightly", but that the three extra weeks will give Funcom "the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-delayed-laser.jpg?itok=dgfONd6m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-delayed-laser.jpg?itok=GZhzaVBY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to come out.</figcaption></figure><p>Funcom also says that this delay will allow it to "do a large-scale beta weekend next month", during which more people will get the chance to play&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>and provide feedback to the team.</p>

<p>The studio closes by calling&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"a beast of a game" that represents "multiplayer survival on a massive scale", and it goes on to say that the game is "making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, it is, believe it or not, a survival game set in the universe of Frank Herbert's popular&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>novels. However, the game takes place in an alternate version of the books' timeline in which Paul Atreides was never born and Lady Jessica gave birth to a daughter.</p>




<p>Much like Funcom's other survival game&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>tasks you with surviving in a harsh desert environment. You'll comb Arrakis for resources, crafting equipment and using iconic&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>vehicles to traverse the land.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dune-awakening/9pj6fv3130qz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on June 10th.</p>

                <p>Given the recent difficulties at Ubisoft, it was hard not to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">Assassin</a>'<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">s Creed Shadows</a> as a make or break game for the publisher. There's still some uncertainty about Ubisoft's plan to spin-off Assassin's Creed and other top franchises <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">into a dedicated subsidy with Tencent</a>, but the good news is that Shadows is reportedly one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">the best-selling games of the year</a> so far.</p><p>Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said via his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> account that Assassin's Creed Shadows "has been the best-selling video game in the US for each of its first 3 weeks in market." Piscatella went on to add that among games released in 2025, it is No. 2 to-date behind only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. Prior to that, the No. 2 seller had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. Shadows was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ps5s-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-march-2025/2900-6421/" data-ref-id="2900-6421">the best-selling game on PlayStation Network</a> for March.</p><p>According to Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-reaches-impressive-milestone-in-just-one-day/1100-6530275/" data-ref-id="1100-6530275">Shadows reached 1 million players</a> across all platforms in a single day. The game reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/" data-ref-id="1100-6530301">2 million shortly thereafter</a>, but that doesn't necessarily line up to the number of copies sold. Assassin's Creed Shadows is also available to players who subscribe to Ubisoft+. However, the title's current success on the video game sales charts suggests that players are actively buying it as well.</p><p>Shadows still has a long ways to go before it can replicate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-isnt-doing-as-well-as-valhalla-but-thats-okay/1100-6530333/" data-ref-id="1100-6530333">the success of Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>. Ubisoft is reportedly considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-are-considering-an-even-tougher-difficulty-option/1100-6530486/" data-ref-id="1100-6530486">an even higher level of difficulty</a> for Shadows.

However, no specific dates were set for the mentioned beta weekend.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening is an open-world survival game set on Arrakis, the harsh desert world of Dune.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has been delayed slightly to implement last minute changes from beta testers.</p>
<p>Back in February, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">Funcom announced a release date of 20th May on Steam</a>. That's now been pushed back to 10th June (with earlier access for pre-orders on 5th June).</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, Funcom explained a major preview beta has been initiated in addition to the game's ongoing Persistent Closed Beta that's provided "invaluable" feedback to ensure the studio can "launch a quality game".</p>

<p>"Thanks to this process, we've concluded that with a bit more time to cook, we can act on a lot more of the feedback we know is important to our beta testers," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"This is not a decision we take lightly, we know everyone is very excited to get playing, but these three extra weeks will give us the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one."</p>
<p>As a result of the delay, Funcom will launch a large-scale beta weekend next month, with more information expected soon.</p>
<p>"Dune: Awakening is a <em>beast </em>of a game," the studio said. "This is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and we're making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing."</p>

</span></p><p>There's no mention in the statement of the game's console release on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, which is expected to follow PC.</p>
<p>Before May was originally confirmed, the game had an "early 2025" release date. The game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakenings-early-2025-release-date-is-looser-than-you-might-think">executive producer Scott Junior told Eurogamer</a>: "I guess it depends how you define early. It could be the first half of '25 - that could be 'early'. So I'll leave it there. It could be the first half of 2025."</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese came away impressed after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">hands-on with Dune: Awakening</a> at the start of the year, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within. Dune: Awakening has promise - keep an eye on this one."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More images of the much-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake, which is seemingly becoming the industry's worst-kept secret, have apparently leaked, and from none other than the purported developer's very own website this time.</p>

<p>Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Taurnil</a>&nbsp;spotted the images in the backend of developer Virtuos' website. Although it hasn't been confirmed by Bethesda, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">been reported</a> that Virtuos is working on the <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake, and these images rather seem to back up that claim.</p>

<p>ResetEra user Mattmo831 also <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">collected a number of images</a> from the&nbsp;Virtuos website, so although the images are no longer accessible via Virtuos' page, it's looking pretty unlikely that they're fake at this point. We won't be including them in this article, but they're easily accessible via the above links at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remake-images-leaked-original-conversation.jpg?itok=zlfrXHOS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remake-images-leaked-original-conversation.jpg?itok=A0qXEBKB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion</em>'s upcoming remake now seems like a foregone conclusion.</figcaption></figure><p>The images depict a wide range of scenes from&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, including one-to-one comparisons with the original, and surprise surprise, it looks like the new version will sport vastly improved visuals.</p>

<p>New key art has also seemingly been leaked, depicting an armored warrior standing in front of the game's logo, although there aren't any screenshots of the remake's conversation system yet, so we don't yet know if it's the same weird dead-eyed hoedown it was in the original.</p>

<p>Journalist Jeff Grubb <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-release-date-reportedly-narrowed-down/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggested recently</a> that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake will "shadowdrop" - that is, launch without any prior fanfare - sometime in April. The sudden appearance of these screenshots on Virtuos' website would seem to back up that claim.</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth bearing in mind that no announcement has officially been made by Bethesda or Virtuos, and so all of this is still technically speculation. Still, the evidence is mounting, so I'd be surprised if April passes with no word on the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtuos-metal-gear-solid-delta.jpg?itok=MDQy3q0u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtuos-metal-gear-solid-delta.jpg?itok=i94dF2l7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Virtuos has served as a co-development studio on games like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If Virtuos is indeed working on the <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake, past form would indicate it's a good choice for the project. Previous games worked on by Virtuos as a co-development studio include&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">the upcoming</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>(which, I suppose, would make the latter a Virtuos Mission).</p>

<p>We'll almost certainly hear something about the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake in the coming weeks (assuming, of course, it doesn't get shadowdropped tomorrow). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-launches-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-on-may-13-alongside-new-expansion-elderwood<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Singularity 6 is bringing its fantasy life sim adventure, <em>Palia</em>, to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series on May 13. While the game has already been available for PC and Nintendo Switch for a time, this new batch of console players will be able to join in with full cross-platform support.</p>

<p>Originally released n 2023, <em>Palia</em> has thrived on its free-to-play multiplayer model that encourages people to explore, craft, and live the life sim they’ve always wanted. <em>Palia</em> has released over 24 content updates to date, including 800 housing items, seasonal events and minigames, trading and building mechanics, and immersive storylines.</p>

<p>Alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series launch, <em>Palia</em> will release its new round of content with the introduction of the Elderwood – a new Adventure Zone filled with a magical forest that is set to be the largest release since the original launch. Elderwood offers up new ways to explore, alongside familiar characters such as Nai’o and Subira with new quests.</p>

<p>In Elderwood, there’s new collectables, hostile huntable creatures such as the Ogapuu, and elusive ones like the Shmole. Players can also try their hand looking for various artifacts, which unlock a new equipment type called Relics, which can help buff up your party.</p>

<p><em>Palia</em> strives to be an experience the player can play at their own pace, with enough content for years to come.</p>




<p>Elderwood in particular sets off to prove as much with all of its addition. A brief demo included a further look at housing, and all the colorful collectables one can hold within. Of course, there’s fishing and farming to do too.</p>

<p>Once into the actual forest of the Elderwood, things start to get a little mysterious with plenty of purples and blues. There’s a lot of exploration to be had outside of the town, with plenty more materials to find for crafting and housing.</p>

<p>Palia’s resident NPCs are there too, and have plenty to say about what’s going on in the Edlerwood. Characters such as Nai’o are useful for learning more about the world, and taking on quests marked on the map.</p>

<p>All of this will be available on May 13 along with the return of the Refer a Friend program. Players can invite their friends to Palia to earn the Elderwood Fun Guy Plush in five different sizes.</p>

Well, we found out back in 2021's “The Matrix: Resurrections.” Despite other stars like Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss returning and reprising their roles in the fourth film in the franchise, Laurence Fishburne, who played and helped shape the iconic role of Morpheus, did not return.<br></p><p>Instead, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II joined the film as an alternate “version” of both Morpheus and the franchise’s villain, Agent Smith. Fans, of course, were confused and many let down by the omission of the Emmy and Tony Award-winning actor in the film. Now, on a recent appearance on “The View,” Fishburne is finally opening up about why he was not involved in the film, and his answer will surprise you.</p><p>A fifth installment is currently in the works, and when asked by “The View” host Sara Haines asked if Fishburne would return, Fishburne replied, “It depends on the circumstances — who is involved, how well the script has been written, if they offer me.” He then said, “You know, I offered my services to the fourth <em>Matrix</em>, and they didn’t respond well.”</p><p>To the shock of the hosts including Sunny Hostin, Whoopi Goldberg and more, Fishburne continued, “So hey, it’s not like I didn’t say, ‘Oh, I’d like to offer my services.’ I did. And for whatever reason, that didn’t happen.”</p><p>He then called it,  “the truth” of the situation, before adding, “So we’ll see.” Hostin chimed in then, saying, “You need to come back!” Haines added, “It sounds like a decision as to whether they want it to be a great ‘Matrix’...”</p><p>At the time of the fourth film’s announcement, Fishburne did publicly state that he was not invited, though did not go into the depth the same way he went today on “The View.” He simply said at the time, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923">we reported,</a></span> “I have not been invited. Maybe that will make me write another play. I wish them well. I hope it’s great.”</p><p>The fourth film was certainly a success and did well enough at the box office to justify a fifth installment. Hopefully this time the powers that be wake up and consider Fishburne’s offer, after all, he is all but synonymous with this series!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Frtx-5060-desktop-family-laptop-5060-coming-soon%2F" rel="sponsored">announcing</a> its RTX 5060 family of GPUs today, just a day before it releases the RTX 5060 Ti on April 16th. Two variants of the RTX 5060 Ti are launching, the $379 8GB of VRAM model and the $429 16GB version. The $299 RTX 5060 will launch at some point in May with 8GB of VRAM.</p><p>The RTX 5060 Ti will ship with 4,608 CUDA cores, a 2.4GHz base clock, 2.57GHz boost clock, and a 128-bit memory bus with either 8GB or 16GB of GDDR7. Nvidia says the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is launching on April 16th, but that the 8GB model will follow “shortly afterwards.” The cheaper RTX 5060 features 3,840 CUDA cores and uses a 128-bit memory bus with 8GB of GDDR7 memory.</p><p>Both the RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060 will support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation</a> (up to 4x), as well as PCI Express Gen 5 and DisplayPort 2.1b. The RTX 5060 Ti will have a total graphics power of 180 watts, while the RTX 5060 will consume up to 145 watts.</p><p>Nvidia is promising high RTX 5060 frame rates in a variety of games, thanks mainly to Multi Frame Generation. The GPU maker has tested games at 1080p with max Frame Gen levels, AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, and 1080p max settings:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Half-Life 2 RTX</em> - 130fps</span></li><li><span><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> - 234fps</span></li><li><span><em>Alan Wake II</em> - 114fps</span></li><li><span><em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>- 130fps</span></li><li><span><em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>- 148fps</span></li><li><span><em>Stalker 2</em> - 208fps</span></li><li><span><em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>- 105fps</span></li><li><span><em>Marvel Rivals </em>- 330fps</span></li><li><span><em>Avowed</em> - 220fps</span></li></ul></div><p>While Nvidia is obviously pushing 4x Frame Gen with these new RTX 5060 cards, there will also be performance improvements to rasterization. “In a game that doesn’t support Multi Frame Gen, you’ll see about a 20-25 percent performance improvement gen over gen on the RTX 5060,” says Justin Walker, Nvidia’s senior director director of GeForce product management, in a press briefing. “You’ll see about 20 percent on the RTX 5060 Ti.“</p><p>Nvidia isn’t making Founders Edition versions of the RTX 5060 cards, so it won’t be able to directly impact the pricing its board partners set this time around with its own cards. That means it might be very difficult to find an RTX 5060 at $299, especially with the uncertainty around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">Trump’s tariff situation</a> that changes almost daily.</p><p>That said, the pricing might not be the only uncertain aspect of these new cards. The choice to offer 8GB of VRAM will be controversial, I’m sure. “We are trying to optimize price and performance,” says Walker. “When you get to a GPU like the RTX 5060, you have to look really hard at trade offs.”</p><p>Nvidia argues that VRAM doesn’t have a big impact on GPU performance, and that it has optimized for pricing with the RTX 5060 series. But we’re still regularly seeing games consume a lot of memory, which really impacts 8GB cards. “The RTX 2060 was $349, and that was years ago,” says Walker. “The RTX 3060 was $329, and I bet even if you looked back and did the inflation math of the RTX 1660 and RTX 1060, I think you’ll find that $299 for a GPU is a pretty good price.”</p><p>Pricing and VRAM debates aside, the RTX 5060 will also be available in laptops in May. With prices starting at $1,099, Acer, Asus, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, and Razer will all have models with Nvidia’s latest RTX 5060 laptop GPUs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles available in April 2025, including the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, a game you may have heard of. As announced previously, this return also brings with it the PC Game Pass debut of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-arrives-on-pc-game-pass-this-month-for-first-time-in-enhanced-edition">GTA 5's new Enhanced Edition for PC players</a> - the first time the game has been offered in any PC subscription service.
</p>
<p>Also included in these latest additions is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - the more recent one from 2022 - although you'll only be getting access to that, for now, if you have Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. It's the same deal as well for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, the turn-based RPG from France that we've been keeping a hopeful eye on.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late April 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5 (Cloud, Console and PC, via Standard, Ultimate and PC) - available now</li>
<li>Neon White (Console, now with Game Pass Standard) - 16th April</li>
<li>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game (Cloud, Console and PC, via Standard, Ultimate and PC) - 16th April</li>
<li>Crime Scene Cleaner (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S and PC, via Standard, Ultimate and PC) - 17th April</li>
<li>Tempopo (Cloud, Console and PC, via Ultimate and PC) - 17th April</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S and PC, via Ultimate and PC) - 24th April</li>
<li>Towerborne: Game Preview (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S and PC, via Ultimate and PC) - 29th April</li>
<li>Far Cry 4 (Cloud, Console and PC, via Standard, Ultimate and PC) - 30th April</li>
<li>Anno 1880 (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S and PC, via Standard, Ultimate and PC) - 1st May</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (Cloud, Console and PC, via Ultimate and PC) - 1st May</li>
<li>Dredge (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S and PC, via Standard, Ultimate and PC) - 6th May</li>

As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, so it taketh away. Games getting the chop this time include Rebellion's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite-5">Sniper Elite 5</a> and the Annapurna-published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thirsty-suitors">Thirsty Suitors</a>. </p>
<p>
The full list of titles leaving Xbox Game Pass on 30th April are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a Nice Death (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Kona II Brume (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Sniper Elite 5 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Last Case of Benedict Fox (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Thirsty Suitors (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Rewinder (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount before they leave the service.</p>
