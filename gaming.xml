              <p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> has been through a hell of a journey to reach us. At <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">last night’s Opening Night Live from Gamescom</a>, Paradox revealed the long-delayed game finally has a release date, October 21. What the publisher didn’t boast about was is that it is locking two out of the six playable clans behind paid day-one DLC, and it’ll cost you an extra $30 to unlock them. A third of the ways to play the game.</p> <p>Expensive day-one DLC was once the most loathed concept in gaming. Back in 2012 <a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-dlc-triggers-fan-outrage-bioware-respons-5887626">it was the talk of the industry</a>, as companies deliberately developed a chunk of the launched game with the intention of hiding it behind a further paywall, and people understandably <em>hated it</em>. Times moved on, and now we’re screwed over in all manner of different ways, most usually seeing significant portions of games sectioned off behind so-called “battle passes,” where we’re expected to not just pay once but to buy new ones multiple times throughout the year! Yay video games! But Paradox is kicking us old-school with <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>by deciding that a full third of how you can play the game will require you to fork out 50 percent of the original asking price again. The cheapest version of the game will cost you $60 on PC, but if you want to buy everything they developed for launch, it’ll cost you an extraordinary $90. Not even the $70 “Deluxe Edition” will secure you either of the missing clans. (Thanks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc"><em>RPS</em></a>.)</p> <p>A huge part of how the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines</em> played was based on the clan you chose at the start. It affected not just more common features like stats, but entirely changed how you approached the game. Different clans within the world treated you accordingly, missions were experienced differently as a result, and the means by which you could approach the RPG quests were all affected by who you were. Play as Brujah and you were a mighty warrior but very vulnerable to “frenzy,” where you’d fully lose control of your bloodlust. But pick a Toreador and you were a schmoozer, expert in socializing, but weakened by your inability to turn away from the truly beautiful. Clearly these made for very different experiences of the game. But now, in&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, if you want to be a Toreador and play that way, it’s going to cost you an awful lot more.</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/bloodlines-faq">the game’s own FAQ</a> makes clear, these choices are not cosmetic.</p> <p>“How will the dialogue options differ in each playthrough?” asks one of the questions. The answer:</p> <blockquote> <p>The dialogue options differ depending on which clan you’ve chosen and what choices you’ve made throughout the story. When hunting for Blood Resonance, specific disciplines and outfit choices can also affect NPCs on the street.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also notes that “each clan offers new, unique abilities, playstyles, and distinct outfits.” Play style seems a hell of a thing to lock to day-one DLC.</p> <p>For a while, Bloodlines<em> 2</em> did look to have become vaporware, after its original development under Hardsuit Labs fell apart in 2021 following its former leads being fired. Then in 2023 it re-emerged, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">now being developed by The Chinese Room</a>, the studio best known for their walking sims, which has had its own turbulent few years. Given The Chinese Room only released their most recent game, <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, in June of last year, it seemed unlikely that <em>Bloodlines 2</em> could be imminent. But here we are! It’s out in just a couple of months.</p> <p>We’ve reached out to Paradox to ask what has motivated the decision to lock away such a significant chunk of the core game behind day-one DLC. (Although we can guess it’s at least in part, “We desperately need to recoup some of the costs of the last six years of development across two different studios under multiple different leaderships for the sequel to a game that came out in 2004.”) We’ll report back if they respond.</p>

<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally has an official release date. </p>



<p>After weeks and months of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ally-x-release-date-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors and leaks</a>, it was officially confirmed on Wednesday that the Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally will launch on October 16. The announcement came during the official Xbox Gamescom stream.</p>



<p>What fans might be surprised to find out, however, was that only a release date was announced. What wasn’t confirmed was the price of the devices, at least at the time of publishing. Even in the <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1958159636370174153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official post on social media</a>, pricing wasn’t mentioned. </p>



<p>There are rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-and-asus-delay-xbox-ally-price-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">circulating on the floor in Cologne</a> regarding the price after it was leaked yet again that it will cost $549.99 for the Xbox Ally and $899.99 for the Xbox Ally X. However, it’s pure speculation at this time.</p>



<p>When official pricing information is announced, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft announcing the release date of the Xbox Ally but not the pricing? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

Availability will expand to additional regions where the ROG Ally series is already sold today. Pricing and pre-order details will follow in the coming weeks.</p><p>ROG and Xbox co-developed the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X to give gamers the freedom to play their way, anytime and anywhere. The ROG Xbox Ally is powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor featuring four Zen 2 cores with eight threads and eight RDNA 2 GPU cores. This offers ultra-efficient performance, paired with 16GB of LPDDR5X‑6400 RAM and a 512GB M.2 SSD, and all backed by a 60Wh battery for extended play.</p><p>The premium, high-performance ROG Xbox Ally X ups the ante with an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, a new 8‑core/16‑thread Zen 5 APU with 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores and an integrated 50 TOPS NPU. The ROG Xbox Ally X also features 24GB of LPDDR5X‑8000 memory, a 1TB M.2 SSD, and boasts a larger 80Wh battery for longer playtime.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Optimized for Handheld</strong></p><p>The team at Xbox has been hard at work behind the scenes partnering with game studios to test and optimize thousands of <a title="Platforms > PC [23,978 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> titles for handheld compatibility. This new Handheld Compatibility Program ensures day-one users have the best experience possible on their ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. At launch, compatible games in the game library will sport Handheld Optimized or Mostly Compatible badges.</p><p>Handheld Optimized means that the game is ready to go—with default controller inputs, an intuitive text input method, accurate iconography, clear text legibility, and appropriate resolution in full-screen mode. Mostly Compatible means that the game may require minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld.</p><p>The Xbox team is also bringing advanced shader delivery to the ROG Xbox Ally. This allows the Xbox app to preload a game’s shaders during download, so supported games will launch up to 10x faster, run more smoothly, and use less battery on first play. Xbox is working on adding this feature to even more games over time.</p><p>The ROG Xbox Ally X also features AMD’s cutting-edge Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor with a built-in NPU, that unlocks upcoming AI powered features starting early next year—with more to come. These features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR)</strong> – a system-level feature that uses the power of the NPU to upscale games running at lower resolutions. This delivers high-resolution visuals and smooth framerates across a wide range of games, with no additional changes required from game developers.</li><li><strong>Highlight Reels</strong> – AI captures standout gameplay moments—like epic boss battles or victories—and generates short replay clips to share with friends or on social channels.</li></ul><p><strong>See the New ROG Ally Lineup in <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a></strong></p><p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will make their fully playable debut at Gamescom 2025, joined by ROG’s complete 2025 laptop lineup powered by the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.

How does Leslie feel about the competition? He told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-lazy-accusations-and-battlefield-6-lets-all-have-fun" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that he recently played the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> open beta and concluded that "it's a fun game," but Activision is staying focused on its own product.</p><p>"We're fans of all games and I think we look for inspiration anywhere. But we're focused on our own craft. They're doing their thing," he said. "We know if we can hit our goals, we're going to deliver what the fans want and that's the key, because if we're happy when we're play testing, then we know fans are going to be happy play testing."</p><p>Leslie added: "We're fans of the FPS genre. We're fans of lots of games. Let's all have fun."</p><p>The developer was also asked to respond to the claims from some in the FPS community that Call of Duty doesn't do enough to innovate with its annual releases. Leslie said, "You just don't worry about it." He said the developers instead aim to stick to their vision and make something fun for people to enjoy.</p><p>"There's always going to be people that are going to try to knock you down and not have positive criticism, which we do look for. So, it's like noise. You try to cut through that and stick to your vision and plan," he said.</p><p>Former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently said</a> that Battlefield 6 will "boot stomp" Black Ops 7. "The real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it," he said.</p><p>For what it's worth, experts do not expect Battlefield 6 to outsell Black Ops 7, in part because the masses of casual players who play Call of Duty <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will buy the newest game every year even if they complain about a lack of major changes or innovation.</a> As for Ybarra's comments specifically, one research firm said <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he needs to "chill out" and think more critically.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, which is about a month after Battlefield 6 arrives on October 10. </p>

                <p>For the first time ever, Activision is releasing new Call of Duty: Black Ops games in consecutive years. Beyond that, the same two developers that led the production of Black Ops 6--Treyarch and Raven Software--are once again co-leading the development on<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073"> Black Ops 7</a>.</p><p>With Activision previously stating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-three-year-dev-cycle-ensures-best-id/1100-6421741/" data-ref-id="1100-6421741">how important it is to have a three-year production cycle for each new Call of Duty game</a>, many are wondering how it's even possible that Black Ops 7 is coming just a year after Black Ops 6. Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-was-developed-in-parallel-to-black-ops-6-treyarch-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that development on Black Ops 7 actually began at the same time as Black Ops 6--that game had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-being-forced-to-wipe-the-slate-clean-led-to-its-biggest-new-feature/1100-6526217/" data-ref-id="1100-6526217">franchise-longest four-year development cycle</a>.</p>

<p>"They were started at the same time," Leslie sad. "So obviously they have different production ramp-up times, but they were started in parallel and greenlit at the same time. That was a really unique challenge, but also fun to be able to know that you're going to do that. Black Ops 6 is going to be 1991 rogue team, and now how do you flip the script on Black Ops 7 in 2035?"</p><p>Also worth noting is that while Treyarch and Raven are the two co-lead developers for Black Ops 7, Activision's network of studios are contributing to its development. For example, Beenox is heading up the PC edition specifically. Other studios that worked on Black Ops 7 include Activision Shanghai, Demonware, Digital Legends, High Moon Studios, Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, Activision Central Design, Activision Central Technology, and Activision QA.</p><p>Lead narrative producer Natalie Pohorski, meanwhile, said making the games in tandem affords for some "payoffs" that might not have been possible in a different setup. "A lot of the things that we innovated on with Black Ops 6, you're going to see in Black Ops 7, and so it's a great connector," Pohorski said.</p><p>One of those features is the Omnimovement system, which is expanding in Black Ops 7 with things like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-see-wall-running-and-active-camo-in-action-plus-other-major-multiplayer-changes/1100-6534097/" data-ref-id="1100-6534097">wall-running</a>. Additionally, Black Ops 7 adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-adds-a-new-20v20-mode-with-wingsuits-and-grappling-hooks/1100-6534075/" data-ref-id="1100-6534075">wingsuits and grappling hooks.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC, and it'll also be available at launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s Jet</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section></header><section><p>Once upon a time, Jet-Ski games were all the rage. Arcade cabinets and fifth generation consoles were replete with these high-speed polygonal racers that sent you careening around tracks set in sunny locales with bobbing water physics. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_aqua_jet">Aqua Jet</a> was an early example of the trend and released the very same year as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/wave_race_64">Wave Race 64</a>. Now, you can play it in all its glory on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Hamster Corporation has recently released two other classic Namco arcade titles on the new console in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_air_combat_22">Air Combat</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-aqua-jet">Aqua Jet</a> is just as lovingly curated as those games. In lieu of riding a replica personal watercraft, like the original cabinet offered, there's some nice feedback from the HD rumble and togglable gyroscopic controls. Elsewhere, there are widescreen format options and the ability to play both English and Japanese versions of the ROM.</p>
<p>There is such a wealth of customisation and ways to tailor your experience here that it's a shame the actual game doesn't warrant much of your time. Only two courses are available and unlocked from the start, with the advanced course being simply an extension of the normal course.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version features High Score and Time Attack modes, which offer some replay value, while a Caravan mode gives players a continuous five-minute block to set the best scores. You can also rewind if you're not happy with a turn.</p>
<p>The tracks still look great, with bright colours popping in both docked and undocked modes and an impressive sense of speed. Big jumps send you plunging underwater to catch a brief glimpse of the fauna, while whales and helicopters dart about at the periphery of the course.</p>
<p>Mirror variants and a goofy penguin mode can be unlocked with cheats detailed in the menus, but that’s still only two more versions of the same track. So unless you're a hardcore aquatic racing fan, or a big fan of the arcade original, this might not be the right game for you.</p>
<p>Aqua Jet offers one other nice feature in online leaderboards to keep you cracking away at course times, but with no multiplayer, there's barely any reason to revisit this once you're satisfied with your performance.</p>
<p>Still, Hamster has done another solid job bringing a '90s arcade classic to Switch 2 and making it sing. Unfortunately, without much content present in the base game, there are only so many times you can revisit this colourful racer before things get repetitive.</p></section></article><div><p>Ken Talbot has been playing games since they came in the form of cassettes.

<p>The game initially launched on PC in China in December 2024, followed by an iOS and Android launch this past January. It's been a long time coming to PS5, as lead designer Chris Lyu explains in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/where-winds-meet-launches-november-14/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that the November date will be the culmination of five years worth of work at Everstone Studio.</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve crafted this game with care, pouring our hearts into every detail over the past five years, and we’re beyond excited to share it with the world," </em>Lyu writes.</p>

<p>The final PC and PS5 test for Where Winds Meet was <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/">held last month</a> ahead of this November launch, and around that time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got the chance to speak to Everstone Studio</a> and, more specifically, today's PS Blog author, Chris Lyu, about the coming title. </p>



<p>At the time, Lyu told Wccftech, "<em>Our main goal has always been to share the world of Eastern martial arts in a way that feels new, exciting, and approachable for players everywhere. We want to present something truly different, but also make sure it’s easy for everyone to connect with, using familiar language and storytelling styles."</em></p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how that resonates with players when it arrives on PC and PS5 on November 14, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>2025 is very much shaping up to be the year for the return of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401">Mega-Evolved Pokémon</a>. While GameFreak is being frustratingly tight-lipped about which mega pocket monsters will be appearing in this October’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682/15#content">we do already know that Mega Dragonite</a> will be making its weird-ass mutant debut in the game. At the same time, September will see the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> start a new era of cards, returning to the enormously popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-mega-evolution-leak-lucario-latias-1851786474">Mega Pokémon designs</a> and presumably some new beasts there too. But can you cuddle any of those? No ma’am, you cannot. So thank goodness for <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/new-releases">the Pokémon Center’s new range of plushies</a>.</p> <p>Eight new plushies have been added to the store, featuring both fan-favorites and a couple of more obscure choices. The most important thing is, yes, there’s Mega Gengar and Mega Gardevoir. But personally, I’m most excited to see Mega Mawile, because it’s so spectacularly bonkers.</p> <p>Each new plush costs a pretty steep $40, and are roughly about 11 to 13 inches tall or wide (obviously they vary, given the shape of the Pokémon, so Mega Lucario stands almost 16″ tall, but is narrow). And based on what amounts to an embarrassing degree of personal experience (I’ve lost count of how many Pokémon plushies I’ve bought, but it certainly falls under “too many”), Pokémon Center cuddly toys tend to be made to extraordinarily high standards. They really seem to be exquisitely well made, although you’d hope so given the premium prices. And yeah, stop judging me, but I’m absolutely buying the Mega Mawile.</p> <p>I’ve put images of each of the eight Megas in the following gallery, to see if you can be tempted too. And think fast—I don’t imagine Mega Gengar will stay in stock for long.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new video showcasing the Resident Evil Requiem gameplay has surfaced online, featuring Grace Ashcroft. </p>



<p>Yesterday, players finally got a new look at Resident Evil Requiem’s gameplay at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gets-gameplay-trailer-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>; however, there was barely any action to be seen. Players have been waiting for some proper gameplay action since the first preview, and it has finally arrived online. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-showcases-grace-being-chased-by-a-monster">Resident Evil Requiem Gameplay Showcases Grace Being Chased by a Monster</h2>



<p>The new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay comes from a new X post (formerly Twitter) from <a href="https://x.com/famitsu/status/1958122126684434578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1958132494718669014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a>). The video starts with Grace being confronted and chased by a massive female monster. Grace is shown running and stumbling through different rooms and hallways as she searches for a way to hide from the frightening creature. Interestingly, the creature has the ability to suddenly appear in front of the player or even break through doors, keeping them on their toes at all times. Check out the full video below. </p>

<iframe title="『バイオハザード レクイエム』先行プレイ。ひたすら追ってくる謎のクリーチャーが怖すぎる！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZrxMd-n57k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the latest Resident Evil Requiem gameplay, Grace seems to be in a panic mode, holding only a lighter to find her way through the dark and eerie hallways. The monster can also bite her if she gets too close to it. Later on, she is seen entering a well-lit room; however, the monster can’t follow her inside as the light seems to be reacting with its skin. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveals-details-about-the-stalker-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> from earlier today informed us that the stalker monster is not well-suited to bright light, and it appears that entering well-lit areas is the only way to escape it. </p>



<p>Towards the end of the Resident Evil Requiem gameplay video, we see Grace enter a completely different room, where she climbs a table to get her hands on a toolbox. The toolbox includes a screwdriver, which is something the character was seemingly looking for. Moreover, the room is in complete disarray, with blood splattered all across the floor and walls, and some lockers turned upside down. </p>



<p>An earlier <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> had stated that this woman monster is none other than Alyssa Ashcroft, Grace’s mother. Additionally, the next Resident Evil Remakes are reportedly going to be Code Veronica and Zero, and they are expected to arrive in&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027/2028</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ww1-gallipoli-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ww1-gallipoli-hands-on-preview-a-fantastic-next-installment-in-the-world-war-1-game-series.1275495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has had one of the first hands-on opportunities to play BlackMill Games’ next World War 1 multiplayer shooter, WW1 Gallipoli.</p>



<p>I’ll be the first to admit that I was thrilled when I first heard that BlackMill Games was releasing a new WW1 game in its series, which already includes Verdun, Tannenberg, and Isonzo. At the time of writing, I have a good few hundred hours of playtime across all of those titles, and with WW1 Gallipoli set to release sometime in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, those hours of playtime will undoubtedly grow next year. Even more so now that I’ve had the chance to play the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-middle-eastern-combat">Middle Eastern Combat</h2>



<p>As the game’s name suggests, WW1 Gallipoli will focus on the Gallipoli campaign that was fought in Ottoman Turkey between April 1915 and January 1916. It marks the first time in the series that desert combat is featured in a fully-fledged fashion, with BlackMill Games once again continuing to maintain the accuracy it’s known for in its WW1 Game Series with authentic maps, weapons, uniforms, music, and more.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WW1: Gallipoli – Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yp0WfD85DzU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>During my limited time with the game, which, for full disclosure, was a pre-alpha build that the developers described as “very early in development”. However, apart from the usual bugs and glitches that you’d come to expect from a game in pre-alpha, I’m pleased to say that if you’re a fan of the series, you won’t be disappointed.</p>



<h2 id="h-squad-based-combat">Squad-Based Combat</h2>



<p>WW1 Gallipoli continues to build on the foundations laid by the series’ predecessors, all while maintaining accessibility for new players. Some of the bigger changes to the game are its class and squad system, which now sees additional roles added, including ‘Stretcher Bearer’, essentially a medic class, and an ammo class, the name of which I’ve forgotten. The developers tell me that this is to ensure more variety and give classes one specific weapon type. For example, in Isonzo, the Assault class had access to bolt-action rifles and submachine guns, whereas this time they don’t.</p>



<p>Another interesting change is a complete overhaul to the squad system, which now sees five squads of five players battle it out. Each Squad has a different assigned name and restrictions; for example, one squad might not have access to a sniper role, but have two stretcher-bearer roles, and another squad may focus on passive-combat. Another addition was a new downing system, which, if a non-lethal shot hits a player, will see them go ‘down’ rather than instant death. But whether or not players will actually revive others remains to be seen (I had a terrible experience in the recent Battlefield 6, please revive team mates!) </p>



<p>Overall, I think the changes to the squad and class system felt like a logical improvement – and while again, it was a pre-alpha build against bots, I can see the changes working out well. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-initial-thoughts">Final Initial Thoughts</h2>



<p>Although my time was limited and didn’t allow for the whole multiplayer experience the game offers (playing against bots can be fairly dull at times), BlackMill Games is clearly cooking up another classic with WW1 Gallipoli.</p>



<p>I’ll have more in-depth thoughts when I return from Gamescom with further details, but yeah, perhaps writing my initial thoughts surrounded by sweaty gamers isn’t ideal… But I needed to get <em><strong>SOMETHING</strong></em> up.</p>



<p>WW1 Gallipoli launches on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC in 2026.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> HIGH ON LIFE 2 Official Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>It's unclear if Roiland is involved in the development of High on Life 2, as he left Squanch Games in 2023 after a former employee sued the studio over accusations of sexual harassment and wrongful termination. The case was eventually settled after Roiland's exit. Recently, it was announced that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-success-story-high-on-life-getting-a-tv-show-with-one-of-its-hilarious-voice-actors/1100-6525587/">High on Life animated series</a> is in development.</p><p>One of the big changes in the sequel (<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/high-on-life-2-demo-hands-on-preview-gamescom/" rel="nofollow ">via Xbox Wire</a>) is that players can move around levels with a skateboard instead of a standard sprint option. This new component offers more than just a speedy way to move about, as players will be able to perform tricks and turn levels into skateparks, or use the board as a makeshift weapon in fights.</p><p>February is typically a big month for new game releases, and as the new year draws closer, we're seeing more titles announced for that month. February 2026 isn't too busy--for now--but High on Life 2 will be competing with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-explores-the-backstory-of-new-heroine-grace-ashcroft/1100-6534107/" data-ref-id="1100-6534107">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the next chapter in Capcom's popular survival-horror series.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Nintendo booth has captured much of our attention, with a particularly stacked line-up including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, all playable on Switch 2.</p>
<p>It's quite the sight, and we've been snapping up pics left, right and centre so you can get a taste of the Big N's presence on the show floor. So, here's a gallery of some of the Nintendo sights we've seen so far, starting with a handful of big ol' game banners and backdrops:</p>



<p>All looks good, but aren't those booths a little... secluded? For those keen to play in front of a crowd, it seems that Nintendo has you covered, too. This large area looks primed and ready for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> tournaments, though nothing was happening when we initially walked through. Looks intense though, right?</p>

<p>Naturally, there's some My Nintendo Store representation on the show floor too, with a handful of displays showcasing some of the finest Nintendo merch out there. Do you think we could get away with filing that Master Sword under 'checked baggage'?</p>

<p>There are plenty of other games <em>outside</em> the Nintendo booth that will be making their way to Switch and Switch 2, of course. Here's a handful of snaps from the ones we've spotted so far:</p>

<p>There will be much, <em>much</em> more to see over the coming days, and you should keep an eye out on our Nintendo Life site and YouTube channel for our hands-on thoughts soon enough. But gosh, isn't it nice to see Nintendo at an in-person event again?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has announced that its latest adventure into the zone will arrive on PS5 on <strong>November 20, 2025</strong>, with the standard version available for $59.99.</p>



<p>We first learned that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl would be making the jump to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ps5-release-late-2025/">PlayStation last month</a>, with a short teaser trailer that featured some of the characters in-game vying for who could have the chance to sit down at the TV and play STALKER 2 on a zone-looking PlayStation controller. </p>



<p>Now we not only have a release date to look forward to, but players who are still looking to collect physical copies can rejoice that there will be a physical copy of STALKER 2 releasing alongside its PS5 launch. There's even a special collector's edition coming called the Ultimate Habar Pack, though per the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/news/ultimate-habar-pack-update">game's website</a>, the Habar Pack won't be arriving until sometime "<em>in early 2026</em>."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this announcement came with no specific details on how the PS5 version of the game will run and what graphical modes will be available, nor are there any details about what experience PS5 Pro owners might be getting in STALKER 2, but there's still plenty of time between now and November. We likely just have to wait a little longer to see what kind of experience PlayStation players will get when STALKER 2 arrives in November.</p>

            <p>Not long before the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2025">great Geoff-fest</a> kicked off yesterday, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a>'s latest update arrived. Dubbed 1.2.4, it's delivered the likes of world wonder rebalancing, but has also impacted mods more heavily than your average Civ update. Firaxis have since explained why the latter was the case, as there was a method to the mod breakage.</p>
<p>Updates to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">polarising</a> 4X strategy sim have settled into a nice monthly cadence following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/improving-civilization-7s-ui-is-the-top-priority-say-firaxis">barrage of changes</a> that followed its launch, when the likes of the user interface had folks ordering improvements like they'd just run across a farmless tile. If you want a refresher as to what was in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">July's patch</a>, there you go.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Before I get into the contents of update 1.2.4, here's what Firaxis have said about its sacking of modstantinople. "We wanted to acknowledge that this update hit mods harder than usual," community manager Sarah Engel wrote on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1307104947426295818/1307105366114566234/1407477327931379742">the game's Discord</a>. "With 1.2.4 we moved our UI workflow to a new system. It makes the interface more reactive and easier for the team to build on, but the downside is a lot of UI files were renamed or bundled differently. Mods overriding those files stopped lining up, which is why so many broke at once with this update."</p>
<p>Hence an update that the developers say was "rougher than most", but due to the sort of deep changes that you can anticipate remaining a rare occurrence going forwards. There's also the option to roll back to the game's "legacy" branch via Steam's betas if you'd prefer to keep your current load order working without having to wait for mod updates to match 1.2.4. "This was a big shift behind the scenes, but it also lays down a foundation that should make the UI better in the long run. More info on that front to come," Engel concluded.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for the update's non-backend changes, it boasts wonder tweaks galore. Erdene Zuu's now available earlier, the Colossus and Monks Mound have been pushed to different civic branches, and you can stick pyramids in places that aren't sandy. The pointy mummy buildings are sadly still banned from snowy tundras, though. The Gate of All Nations and House of Wisdom have been nerfed in order to ensure ancient Persian doorways and Abbasid-era libraries aren't easy routes to victory. Meanwhile, the likes of Petra and the Eiffel Tower have been nudged in the opposite direction.</p><p>Age transitions when you've got continuity enabled will now see alliances and more of your accrued gold/influence roll over, with the devs also looking into the general balance of games with the setting turned on. Aside from that, the AI opponents have gotten some tweaks aimed at toughening them up and having them make fewer weird moves, such as accepting your plea for friendship when circumstances mean they'll have to ditch you straight away. Plus, a bunch of interface improving that you can check out the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">full notes</a> for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a period of time, video game genres tend to calcify. They establish firm rulesets that are difficult to break. This leads to familiarity and, eventually, repetition. How many third-person shooters have you played that all kind of felt the same? Capcom is trying to break the rules with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, a sci-fi shooter in which you have to hack every enemy before you can do any damage to them. It’s a smart idea – one we first got to grips with at this year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-hands-on-preview">Summer Game Fest</a>, and have now had a chance to explore further at gamescom 2025. But while it produces a combat experience quite different to anything I’ve played before, I’m left wondering if that same level of ingenuity will be felt in Pragmata’s exploration and level design, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the past decade or so, perhaps the most popular method to spice up shooters has been increased speed and movement – see games like Vanquish, Titanfall, and Doom: Eternal. Pragmata twists the dial in the opposite direction, slowing the tempo right down in favour of making each individual combat engagement longer and more complex. Hugh, your armoured astronaut, cannot put a dent in the enemy robots until your mysterious synthetic child sidekick, Diana, hacks through their firewall. This is done via a quick minigame – aiming at a foe displays a grid on which you must draw a line, passing through damage-increasing blue tiles on the way to an end point. Succeed, and you’re weapons free to pump your target full of lead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pragmata - Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The hacking challenge varies depending on your targets. Flimsy flying drones are protected by a mere three-by-three grid, while big chunky mechs have a larger five-by-five grid that may also feature blockers that must be avoided as you snake towards the finish line. Acquiring hacking nodes during your travels will also populate the grid with additional tiles that, when passed through, apply additional effects such as lowering an enemy’s defence, allowing you to deal greater damage upon the hack’s completion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While all this initially requires some mental recalibration to get to grips with, after chewing through three or four enemies it became second nature… and perhaps a little too easy. At least during the demo’s sample section, enemies only arrived in ones and twos – certainly a concession to the fact that you have to solve a puzzle in real-time as an android tries to rip you apart. But by the mid-point of a short half-an-hour demo I was already eager for an increased challenge – be that via increased enemy numbers, more complex hacking challenges, or ideally a mix of both. I fully expect that’s the thesis behind Pragmata’s difficulty curve, but I hope it doesn’t take too long to find the right balance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best example of where things may be headed is the SectorGuard boss battle, the demo’s explosive finale. This big boy bipedal bot is armed with multi-missile launchers that cause the entire arena floor to light up with warning beacons as warheads fly through the air. The challenge, of course, is to avoid the incoming rockets while simultaneously hacking through the robot’s firewalls. And since this is a boss, a single hack won’t do – you’ll need to repeatedly burn through different layers of security as the battle rages on. <em>This </em>is the kind of multi-tasking juggling act that I hope Pragmata can continually deliver as the campaign opens up.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The hacking mechanic creates a functioning symbiotic relationship between Hugh and Diana – they simply cannot survive without each other.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The SectorGuard battle also introduces one of Pragmata’s flashier abilities. Diana has a sort of “ultimate” hack called Overdrive Protocol which stuns all enemies around you and opens them up to damage. Triggering this requires filling a meter that <em>sloooowly</em> builds each time you perform a regular hack. I expect such a skill will be utterly invaluable when facing a room full of relentless enemies, but a single boss wasn’t the ideal testing ground – especially when I could hold it in place using a stasis gun that deploys a large disabling dome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’d have liked a fiercer sampling of what this new combat system is capable of, it certainly sparks my imagination. The hacking mechanic also creates a functioning symbiotic relationship between Hugh and Diana – they simply cannot survive without each other, and I hope that theme becomes something meaningful as the story progresses. Unfortunately the gamescom demo was light on narrative, only divulging that Hugh is stranded in a damaged lunar base and must find his way back to Earth. We’ll have to wait and see if this new dynamic duo has any substance in their relationship – and if their adventure will be quite as reality-shattering weird as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pragmata-capcom-release-date-2022">Pragamata’s debut trailer</a> was, back in 2020. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing I’m curious to see more of is Pragmata’s wider exploration and adventure design. This demo featured minimal combat engagements and so often I was running through the station without an enemy in sight. That meant the focus for long stretches was entirely on navigating the environment, done so via some light platforming. I appreciate how each character’s combat abilities are re-purposed here; Hugh’s suit thrusters, used to dodge attacks, are here utilised to leap further or hover over long drops. Diana’s hacking skills can rewire the facility’s mechanised components, raising or retracting pillars in Pragmata’s equivalent of moving crates around. It’s a fine starting point, but I’d have liked the exploration to have its own interesting mechanical quirk to mirror the efforts made with combat. There are terminals to hack and obstacles to power down that make use of a couple of bespoke-but-basic minigames, but at least in this section they don’t feel like a cohesive part of the experience in the same way the combat hacking does. And considering the even balance of battle and exploration in this demo, I think both halves need to be equally interesting. With any luck, those environmental hacks will develop over time to unlock a more interesting approach to level design.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another issue is that navigation is marred by an environment that looks near-identical no matter what room you’re in, resulting in a bit of involuntary backtracking and accidentally running in circles. My goal through the demo was to restore power by hacking five different terminals, each hidden somewhere in the base, but as I explored there was no telling if I was in an engineering bay, a server room, or a command centre. This is visually unfulfilling, but more crucially it makes it difficult to plot the space out in your head. I’d be less concerned if the demo had been more linear, but the openness of the area meant I had to scratch my head a couple of times while searching for the next terminal – especially as there’s no map. My hope is that, as Hugh and Diana delve deeper into the facility’s bowels, the “NASA in the year 3,000” aesthetic evolves to create more distinct, readable playspaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has been on an almost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-golden-age-the-rise-and-fall-resident-evil-monster-hunter-wilds">decade-long winning streak</a>, but that streak has been rooted in smart approaches to its legacy games. Where it has tripped up recently is with brand new, original ideas – 2023’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/exoprimal">Exoprimal</a> has already faded from memory. I hope that’s not the fate for Pragmata – it’s a bold thing to rethink the fundamentals of a genre as traditional as the shooter, and I’d really love to see its hack-and-blast design soar. But I can’t deny that this demo’s simple combat engagements and exploration left me feeling detached from a concept I really want to engage with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-aims-to-break-the-rules-of-third-person-shooters-gamescom-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say we’re currently living through a golden age for swordplay games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> lead a pack of accomplished duelers where every strike, lunge, and parry feels supremely satisfying. Hoping to find a place among them is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, Capcom’s long-awaited return to a series slumbering since the PS2 days. And, based on a small sample I’ve been able to play at gamescom 2025, I’d say its chances are looking very good indeed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in a dark fantasy reimagining of Kyoto during the Edo period of Japan, Onimusha: Way of the Sword has you take up the sharpened blades of Miyamoto Musashi, a swordsman sporting both the face of the late legendary actor Toshiro Mifune and a talking gauntlet that eats the souls of dead enemies. That second point is the more pertinent one; fallen foes drop souls, represented by flames that float around the battlefield before being sucked up by your hungry jewelry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right, before you get any wrong ideas, Onimusha may have <em>souls </em>but it is absolutely not a <em>Soulslike</em>. On its default “action” difficulty setting, Way of the Sword is not particularly punishing, at least not in this 30-minute demo (which, admittedly, does feel plucked from very early in the story). It certainly requires skill to get the most out of the enjoyably flashy combat, but generous parry windows, a block that protects from all angles, and cushioned enemy attacks mean Onimusha seems on track to be one for all action fans, not just the FromSoft fanatics. And while I would have liked to have faced a steeper challenge in this demo, the foes I faced – especially the end-of-level boss – felt well-judged.    </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/onimusha-cross-swords-1755259896921.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Onimusha's swordplay has the potential to compete with the best in the business. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m particularly impressed by how combat is built on a foundation of both health and stamina. Enemies are, of course, defeated by bottoming out their health bars, but each time you strike or deflect their attacks, you erode away their stamina bar. If that hits zero, the foe becomes exhausted, quite literally pausing to catch their breath. This is, of course, the perfect time to strike – a single button press triggers a “Break Issen” move that violently dismembers your target. The animations are gloriously extravagant and can be chained together if a couple of enemies have been exhausted at the same time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For regular enemies, breaking their stamina spells instant death. And because parries quickly exhaust fodder, you’re rewarded for honing that skill – you take less damage <em>and </em>get to witness cool kills. I’m deeply amused by how you can deflect arrows back at archers who then, winded by their own projectile, stand around simply awaiting their fate of single-click decapitation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But things change when it comes to boss fights. The demo’s final clash against the exuberant Sasaki Ganryu – a tall, gangly samurai powered up by his own Oni gauntlet – is a much fiercer affair in which you’ll deplete his stamina bar at least once before being able to deal the final blow. In this situation, an alternative version of “Break Issen” plots two marks on your target: strike the red one and you’ll be rewarded with a burst of extra damage, hit the purple to generate a bonus batch of souls. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s almost certainly a secret science to nailing the feel of when steel lands on steel, and Capcom has absolutely cracked it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And that brings us back to souls. These flickering flames are colour coded; red souls are used to purchase upgrades, while blue souls feed your Oni Power Gauge, which when full can be used to unleash special attacks. Yellow souls, meanwhile, are rarer and replenish your health. All three are vital, not just for their individual properties, but for how they form a cycle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, in the demo Musashi was equipped with the Two Celestials, a twin-dagger special weapon that reaps yellow souls from fallen enemies. It can only be used when the Oni Power Gauge is topped off. As it’s a powerful attack that requires resources, it’s sensible to use it against tougher opponents who, naturally, deal more damage. Killing such foes with the Two Celestials basically refunds damage you take thanks to the yellow souls the attack creates. And so there’s the cycle - you kill foes to gain blue souls, which powers up the ability to use special attacks, which cause enemies to drop yellow souls, which instantly heal you from the wounds sustained during that fight. It perhaps doesn’t feel quite that elegant in-game, but there’s a clear system upon which battle thrives. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other examples of that, too. Successful parries generously build a diamond-shaped meter that eventually causes your blade to temporarily erupt with damage-buffling blue sparks. Hitting that mark feels fantastic – the animation alone makes it feel as if the battle has been hit by a shot of adrenaline – but if you can continue a successful chain of deflects, you can sustain that buff seemingly indefinitely. It’s another smart system that rewards consistent skill with your blade.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/onimusha-souls-1755259911833.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Your Oni Gauntlet can absorb enemy souls and use them to power abilities, heal wounds, and buy upgrades. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s only when I came to write this preview that I realised that Onimusha is very much a game about managing gauges and meters. You need to deplete health bars and stamina meters, build power gauges, and keep other buff-providing vessels topped up. On paper, that may sound dull and overly mathematical for a game about supernatural samurai fighting through demon-infested feudal Japan, but in practice it works well. That’s entirely down to the fact that the implement for juggling those meters – your sword – feels fantastic to wield. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The parry window may be wide, but the ringing clang of a deflect is supremely satisfying, especially because the subsequent counter attack animation is so extravagantly slick. Slicing through the amusingly gross regular “Genma” enemies, which range from mutant swordsmen to what I can only describe as demonic floating Furby heads, feels great, but it’s the boss fight that really sold me on Onimusha’s swordplay credentials. There’s almost certainly a secret science to nailing the feel of when steel lands on steel, and Capcom has absolutely cracked it – there’s an energetic flow each time the warrior’s blades meet and push each other away. And while the duel against Ganryu doesn’t feel destined to go down as an all-timer – it is, ultimately, too easy to enter those halls – I think it acts as a decent enough promise that, further into the campaign, there will be something that stands up to the very best of Ghost of Tsushima. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gamescom demo may have been short – little more than some winding paths and a boss fight in a temple – but it’s more than enough to convince me that Onimusha: Way of the Sword is built on rock-solid swordplay fundamentals. I’m genuinely excited to master them and take on its campaign’s toughest challenges. But it’s also made me curious about several other things. As a tutorial-styled section, the demo had no real exploration opportunities, so it’s currently unclear what kind of scope the environments will work with. Then there’s the story, which caught me off-guard with its humour. There’s hints of an amusingly rocky relationship between Musashi and the voice inside his Oni gauntlet, and the pre-boss battle banter was just on the right side of goofy. I’m fascinated to see where Capcom has drawn the line between a dark samurai tale and sparky anime humour. But even if that line ultimately ends up drawing an uneven balance, I’m confident Onimusha’s razor-sharp combat will more than make up for a few bad jokes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-skilfully-sharpens-a-ps2-classic-for-a-new-generation-gamescom-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Of all the announcements at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-opening-night-live-gamescom-2025">last night's gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, it was an announcement of an announcement that stole the show: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong is real, and a full reveal is set for later this week.</p>
<p>Host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> began the lengthy show with this news and a mere thirty seconds of gameplay that showed the game's protagonist Hornet jumping and battling bug enemies. Since then, fans have been going feral.</p>
<p>That snippet of gameplay is the first time the game has been seen since its initial reveal trailer six years ago. But in that time every livestream, every Direct, every awards show has been dominated by cries from Hollow Knight fans desperate for information. Soon, the wait will be over. But the real question is whether Silksong can live up to the hype.</p>

<p>That's why, at gamescom itself, the Silksong demo is already building huge queues at both the Xbox and Nintendo booths - and it's only media day. At last year's event, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> was <em>the </em>game of the show, with fans queuing for hours just to play a small section. I suspect Silksong will be this year's equivalent.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Dom Peppiatt has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-only-is-hollow-knight-silksong-real-ive-played-it-and-its-harder-and-faster-than-the-original-but-is-it-better">braved the queues to check out Silksong</a> and is already impressed by its higher challenge and how Hornet's movement feels different to that of the original game's Knight.</p>
<p>"Hollow Knight had a peculiar difficulty curve; it always felt quite simple and straight-laced as an action platformer for the majority of the base game, escalating rapidly in challenge as you got towards the end, and then going completely off the rails in the DLC and post-game," wrote Dom. "It feels, at first swipe, that Silksong is carrying on the same trajectory. And that's kind of fascinating."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-offers-buttery-smooth-performance-on-switch-2">Nintendo Life</a> has also confirmed the game supports 120Hz on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> with its TV Mode.</p>
<p>Now social media is awash with images and videos of the booths, as well as clown memes. This post, from a Silksong subreddit mod, sums up the community's feeling.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, fans have been sharing images of the demo booth, proving Silksong's veracity and presence at gamescom.</p>

<p>And then there are the already extensive queues, which will only get worse as the week goes on.</p> <div>

<p>So what can we expect from Thursday's reveal? Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1mulvtu/special_announcement_video_is_153_long/">reddit</a>, sleuths reckon the YouTube video will be just 1:53 in length, suggesting this will be a fairly brief trailer rather than an extended look. Will we at least get a release date?</p>
<p>Bloomberg's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4vytd322k">Jason Schreier</a> will simultaneously have a story on Silksong's development.</p>
<p>As for the release date itself, we know now that Hollow Knight Silksong will be released later this year. It's coming to PC (where it's the most wishlisted game on Steam), Nintendo Switch consoles, PlayStation, and Xbox (including a Game Pass release day one).</p>
<p>Before then, you'll even be able to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-is-playable-in-a-museum-this-september-but-that-probably-doesnt-help-narrow-down-its-release-date">play the game in September at Australia's national museum of screen culture</a> (ACMI) as part of its Game Worlds exhibition - presumably the same demo gamescom attendees are currently enjoying.</p>
<p>How did we get here? Silksong's initial reveal trailer was released back in 2019 and has since been watched 4.5m times. The game was playable at EGX that year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">Eurogamer going hands-on with the standalone sequel</a>. "Team Cherry has stated in the past the game won't be released until it's ready, and for a game as wonderful as this is shaping up to be, I wouldn't have it any other way," wrote Imogen Beckhelling at the time, which feels a little ironic now. I remember attending that EGX before I worked at Eurogamer and playing the game myself.</p>

<p>But since then, there's been barely any new information. And that silence from developer Team Cherry has only fuelled the fires of hype to a seemingly uncontrollable level. That's the problem with hype, and Team Cherry has seemed content to ride that wave while simply beavering away at development.</p><p>Will it actually be any good, though? For some, more of the same Hollow Knight will be good enough, but judging by Dom's preview Silksong should have enough of its own identity. And considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">GTA 6 has moved to next year</a>, Silksong has free reign of the hype machine for the remainder of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s honestly so refreshing for a game that’s steeped in Japanese folklore to emerge without mention of being a Soulslike or Roguelite. Of course, it’s equally pleasing that Onimusha: Way of the Sword is reviving a beloved PlayStation 2 franchise, which flared through the early 2000s before drifting into obscurity for more than two generations of console.</p>
<p><iframe title="OnimushaGCPreview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtFrm59tUc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Edo-era Kyoto and its countless shrines and temples are corrupted by Malice and the emerging Genma monstrosities, the only person that can stand in their way is the renowned historical swordsman Miyamoto Musashi (modelled after actor Toshiro Mifune and voiced by Kenichiro Thomson), a samurai who’s found himself bonded to an Oni Gauntlet that gives him the chance to fight back against the supernatural.</p>


<p>This is a fresh take on the Onimusha series, meaning that you won’t have to have played the earlier titles to appreciate the story –&nbsp;more than understandable given the almost two decades since the last new entry in the series –&nbsp;and absolutely plays into Musashi’s character and bond with the spirit within his gauntlet.</p>
<p>But first, one of the most important things for Onimusha: Way of the Sword is to let you feel like a badass samurai, souped up by some supernatural powers. At its heart, you’re looking to both damage enemies and sap their resistance, staggering them to let you deal a finishing blow (if you haven’t already offed them, of course). While you can absolutely take a front-foot approach to combat, the Issen technique returns, allowing you counter enemy attacks and dish out devastating killing blows in return, slicing them in half in the process. It takes a moment to get used to, in contrast to many contemporary control schemes, as you hold to block and tap another button to counter. This even works on ranged attacks, letting you ping arrows back at archers, staggering them and giving you the chance to get close for a finishing move –&nbsp;you can even string together a bunch of finishers in an Issen Chain.</p>


<p>Much of this is also dependent on you’re ability to evade, with another swift finishing move only available to you once you’ve filled up the meter by dodging. This requires you to ghost out of the way of the incoming strike, leaving a fleeting spectral form as Musashi shifts barely half a step to evade, keeping you right in the thick of the action when compared to a full-blown dodge roll. Each dodge gradually builds up the meter until you can unleash this attack.</p>
<p>Defeating enemies sees their souls float nearby waiting for you to manually absorb them in three different colours and types. Blue charges your energy attack, yellow your health and red your experience. You’ll need to be fast in certain situations, some kinds of floating Genma will actively try to suck up these souls and use them to attack you with elemental abilities. Obviously, it’s best not to let them do that…</p>

<p>There’s also a new type of soul, a black soul to absorb that furthers the story and reveals more of the plight that befell this region. Drawing upon a real myth surrounding the Kiymizu-dera temple, this shadowy flashback reveals the local population making sacrifices to try to and appease the demons, though naturally failing as kids and others are sent plummeting down the sides of the mountain.</p>
<p>There’s environmental puzzles tied in with some of these moments, giving you Genma tendrils to follow and destroy, though we only really saw this in its most basic form. More fleshed out were some of the environmental interactions that fed into the combat. You can, for example, kick up a tatami mat to use it to block some attacks, or grab and push a cart through a bundle of enemies to gain the advantage.</p>

<p>Our hands on time with the game concluded with a battle against another swordsman with an Oni Gauntlet. Sasaki Ganryu has what would no doubt be an utterly infuriating personality to encounter in real life, all of his movements looking so thoroughly lazy, but backed by bags of self-confidence and awareness that, yeah, he really is all that. He’s in many ways the polar opposite to Musashi’s steadfast tone.</p>
<p>He’s a satisfying opponent to face, able to strike quickly but, at this point in the game, still rather languid and lackadaisical, giving you plenty of opportunities to dodge and strike back. Once his stamina is depleted, it triggers a full-blown Issen Break, giving you a choice of where to strike –&nbsp;head or armour –&nbsp;perhaps giving a more tactical approach to later combat.</p>
<p>After two decades away, it’s lovely to see Onimusha return and do so with such a striking panache. this is absolutley one to keep an eye on for 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Blood of the Dawnwalker Preview - From Dusk 'Til Dawn]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/blood-of-dawnwalker-preview-from-dusk-till-dawn</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-blood-of-the-dawnwalker-preview-from-dusk-til-dawn.1275402/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a lot to be said about the rise and continued popularity of dark-fantasy RPGs. With the modern landscape spearheaded in part by games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/dark-souls" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Souls</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/witcher-3-wild-hunt" rel="nofollow"><em>The Witcher</em></a>, we’ve seen a wealth of creativity from established and indie studios alike.</p>

<p>That’s where Rebel Wolves comes in specifically, having splintered off from CD Projekt RED with the goal of making something unique. This has since been manifested in an all-new game called <em>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</em>, which is planned for launch on current-generation platforms.</p>

<p>While we caught a glimpse of the title earlier this year, Bandai Namco and Rebel Wolves recently set aside some time to give us a better look at <em>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</em> ahead of Gamescom and its release in 2026.</p>

<p><em>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</em> is selling itself as an open-world, fantasy RPG set in a dreary medieval Europe – one that is very story-focused with the core theme of vampirism at night and humanity during the day.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the_blood_of_dawnwalker_screenshots-8.jpg?itok=p8TCtKUz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the_blood_of_dawnwalker_screenshots-8.jpg?itok=-J1mPDuZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It’s set in the year 1347 AD in a valley located somewhere in the Carpathian Mountains known as Vale Sangora. It’s here an opening cutscene draws open the curtain, where a man, soon to be our main character, runs away with a sickly child until he is surrounded and eventually saved by a mysterious group of vampires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We learn that the Plague has been decimating Europe, and in this world, a group of vampires have decided to take control of the area because of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The demo then kicks into high gear by dropping the lead character, Coen, straight into a lived-in world with one goal: he must save his family. And this is evident why in the opening we saw, though there’s been a bit of a skip to keep some of the story fresh here.</p>

<p>While Coen has this overall goal, it’s not necessarily a race against the clock. <em>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</em> operates in a manner where time will move forward at a cost depending on your actions and quests taken, and it will let you know when that is taking place before committing to anything as time is a very specific resource. This is marked by an hourglass symbol on screen.</p>

<p>Coen’s first task that we get to see involves infiltrating a cathedral, and the interesting part about all of this is that the experience will differ depending on if it’s day or night. Much of this is clearly marked with sun or moon icons on the user interface to let you know if a quest can only be undertaken during their respective time periods.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the_blood_of_dawnwalker_screenshots-4.jpg?itok=fFedDaJl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the_blood_of_dawnwalker_screenshots-4.jpg?itok=62tk0K6l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Starting out at night, Coen has to sneak his way in using his vampiric abilities and can do so to reach hard-to-reach places and get around locked doors. For example, making use of the scaffolding is a clever way to avoid enemies and offers up a path into the cathedral without getting caught.</p>

<p>Coen has the ability to scan his environment, which is important to sus out clues and figure out where to go next. After doing a little bit of investigation, we’re taken around to show off some combat, which can be dynamic depending on player preference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the main abilities Coen can use at night is his vampiric claws to slash and attack enemies. He can also make use of an ability called Voracious Bite to drain enemies of their blood to replenish his health.</p>

<p>Coen can also fight swiftly using a sword, and this is notable because the team did make adjustments following some initial feedback from the reveal trailer. Specifically, new camera options have been added for both exploration and combat. Want the camera further or closer? It’s up to you.</p>

<p>This element of choice is prevalent throughout <em>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</em>. It’s being touted as a “narrative sandbox” because there's a lot of ways you can tackle each and every story thread.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the_blood_of_dawnwalker_screenshots-6.jpg?itok=3LGTSnfw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the_blood_of_dawnwalker_screenshots-6.jpg?itok=OOjhNijz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The flipside of this coin lies in the dual gameplay loop. While Coen can operate as a vampire during the night, in day he is a human who has different skills and weaknesses. His method of combat during the day requires a little more blocking, and you can use stamina to simplify things through the addition of an auto-combo feature to keep the battle flowing.</p>

<p><em>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</em> features a skill tree to help customize Coen, with several sets of perks depending on if he’s human or vampire. There’s also some shared perks that operate between both night and day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But to illustrate the real difference in his humanity, the demo took us back to the cathedral, to where we were able to walk right in instead of sneaking around. This means Coen has the opportunity to talk to other NPCs here and gain access to quests, interact with dialogue choices, and uncover more of the story.</p>

<p>We saw a bit of a side quest here, following clues on a caretaker using the same investigation modes as before. One element that helps pinpoint where to look are colored moths, as they indicate something is important, and that feels key when it comes to parsing through an open world.</p>

<p>Coen can also use magic during the day such as necromancy. Once such example had him compelling a dead soul to collect more information. He can also gather what’s called catalysts, which provide further context during these investigations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually Coen makes his way down to a crypt, and the demo culminates in a boss fight, which is the outcome of all of the clues gathered from the cathedral to that particular point. What’s interesting is this quest could have been completed at night as well, but it would of course change the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re certainly keen to dig in with the full game and see where all the different alternative paths go. The developers at Rebel Wolves have also confirmed with us that everything you do in <em>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</em> will ultimately have its consequences, so it’ll be interesting to see just how many different endings and combinations there truly is, and how much weight the narrative has when the game launches in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An insider has revealed new details about the stalker monster from Resident Evil Requiem, which could relate to the game’s gameplay. </p>



<p>After months of waiting, we finally received a new trailer for Resident Evil Requiem at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gets-gameplay-trailer-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom’s Opening Night Live</a>, which featured Alyssa Ashcroft, Grace’s mother. We also got a small glimpse of gameplay before it was interrupted by the stalker monster. Now, new details about this monster have been revealed by an insider.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-stalker-monster-s-skin-reportedly-melts-in-the-sun">Resident Evil Requiem Stalker Monster’s Skin Reportedly Melts in the Sun</h2>



<p>The latest leaked details about Resident Evil Requiem’s stalker monster come from none other than Dusk Golem (AestheticGamer). The leaker had previously posted an image of an ice cream melting, and now they have provided <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1957896949287514353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">context</a> for it. It appears that the stalker monster’s skin begins to melt “gruesomely” in the sunlight, which serves both a “bigger plot” and a “gameplay purpose.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you don't mind some early bird spoilers, though undoubtedly will be revealed tomorrow I feel, the meaning of the ice cream:<a href="https://t.co/a128A0kxPo">https://t.co/a128A0kxPo</a><br>SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING<br>The stalker monster's skin starts melting off gruesomely in light, has bigger plot &amp; gameplay purpose.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1957896949287514353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leaker has stated that this is an early bird spoiler from them; however, players should soon learn about it officially, as Resident Evil Requiem has a press embargo lifting soon, and players might know more about this stalker monster then. Nevertheless, as this information doesn’t come from an official source, readers should treat it with caution. </p>



<p>Dusk Golem has provided players with several leaks leading up to the game’s new trailer at Gamescom. Most recently, we were informed that the game will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three playable characters</a>, including Grace, Leon, and a little bit of Alyssa.
