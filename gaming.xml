			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 dock has arrived today, thanks to some new pictures shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2dH7Za0#n35dYx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new pictures</a>, which have been shared online by the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4119">Famiiboards forums</a>, provide a new look at the console's dock, highlighting some of the changes over the current dock, including what looks like a grid on the base of the dock, which suggests a change in the cooling and air intake over the current model.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-awaited reveal last month, Nintendo has kept pretty silent about its new system and will likely continue to do so until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>. According to a former Nintendo employee, the event won't only go over the Nintendo Switch 2 features that were briefly teased in the reveal trailer, but will also likely confirm the console's release date, which is speculated to be sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">June</a> for a few reasons, so there's the chance that we won't have to wait much longer to learn when it will finally launch worldwide.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches this year. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fear-gog-preservation-program-monolith<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that it's adding 2005 horror shooter&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>to its Preservation Program ahead of schedule in order to "recognize" the contributions of shuttered developer Monolith.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, GOG says that while&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>- which collects the base game and its expansions - was due to be added at "a later timeframe", the release has been accelerated to honor Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>For context, it was revealed yesterday that Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">closed down by parent company Warner Bros</a>, and that the studio's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game has been canceled.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First was also shut down following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">failure of the crossover fighter</a>, as was mobile studio Warner Bros San Diego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=NhAk4SMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=p7q3MxAQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>is now a part of the GOG Preservation Program.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.</em>, GOG says that "other Monolith icons" will join the Preservation Program, and that "even more news" will be shared regarding the Program tomorrow as well. These are exciting times for game preservation.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what the GOG Preservation Program is, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">an initiative</a> started by the GOG folks to ensure that certain PC games will always be supported, regardless of whether they're receiving official support from their publishers or not.</p>

<p>Many games have already been added to the program, including titles that have been delisted by their publishers, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games</a>. Other games that are already part of the project include classics like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease" rel="nofollow"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, plus many more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=4wiGnRzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=gSSQcij3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games already bearing the GOG Preservation Program stamp.</figcaption></figure><p>Other Monolith games that might make it to the Preservation Program include the likes of classic FPS&nbsp;<em>Blood</em>, cult shooter <i>The Operative: No One Lives Forever</i>, and, of course, the two&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>sequels.&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>is already part of the program, but&nbsp;<em>Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>has yet to be added.</p>

<p>Sadly, Monolith and Player First are just two of the latest casualties in what is somehow becoming an increasingly tumultuous time for the industry. Other studios to close in recent months include NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">Seattle&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>studio</a>, Dr. Disrespect's ex-studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">Midnight Society</a>, and some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft's studios</a> as well.</p>

<p>If you want to support GOG and its efforts to preserve Monolith's games, you can check out&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fear_platinum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now via the storefront</a>.</p>

<p> Come on, let loose. I need all your best game soundtrack recommendations for background music while I work. Nothing intense, no combat music, nothing too distracting. Just a nice vibe. Something to get lost in over time. Now gimme what you got! It's urgent!</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Splitgate 2 Multi-Team Domination Mode And Glacier Map Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In total, there will be three new locations available in the open alpha:</p><ul><li><strong>Glacier (8v8v8)</strong> - This location is 20 times the size of any map from Splitgate and is full of icy slopes that allow players chain speed from sliding with portal momentum</li><li><strong>Bypass (4v4)</strong> - A vertical map designed for high-flying plays, so you'll want to keep an eye on the sky</li><li><strong>Eden (4v4)</strong> - This map has plenty of portal-walls, as well as a launch-portal that can be used for daring aerial attacks</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">Cross-play</a> will also be supported, and some of the modes that'll be available to try out include Multi-Team Domination--where teams will battle to take control of four zones--and Multi-Team Hotzone, where players will battle it out to take control of a central zone.</p><p>For the new modes, 1047 Games will introduce Splitball and Firecracker to the game. Splitball is a two-team arena mode that combines classic Capture the Flag gameplay with the fast-paced strategy of Halo's Oddball, so teams will need to focus on offense and defense simultaneously. Search-and-Destroy game modes inspire Firecracker, and it involves an attacking team working to deploy the titular firecracker while the defending team attempts to stop them from setting off their fireworks.</p><p>1047 Games added that the open alpha will represent less than half of the content that will be present in Splitgate 2 when it launches later this year on PC and consoles. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/">Splitgate 2 preview</a>, we said, "New additions like character classes and abilities help further distinguish Splitgate 2 from a field of extremely familiar shooters."</p>

                <p>GOG has announced that it is adding FEAR to its preservation program next month after the game's developer, Monolith Productions, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">shut down yesterday</a>. The version being added is the Platinum one, which includes the base game and both expansions. It's on sale right now on GOG for $1.</p><p>While FEAR was already planned to be added to the preservation program, GOG decided to accelerate the process. "Monolith Productions has given players some of the most unforgettable experiences, blending groundbreaking gameplay with rich storytelling," GOG said in a statement on <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>. "To honor their legacy, we’re proud to announce that F.E.A.R. Platinum will be joining the GOG Preservation Program."</p><p>There are two other games in the FEAR series, including FEAR 2 and FEAR 3.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> players are reporting that some in-game children now have pregnant bellies, following the game's latest patch.
</p>
<p>
Several <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">posts on The Sims' reddit</a> from over the past 24 hours report the issue and provide visual evidence, showing young Sims strutting about with a baby on board.
</p>
<p>
"Umm guys..." one player wrote. "My kid is pregnant..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iy87lc/since_todays_patch_all_the_male_children_in_my/">Wrote another</a>: "Since today's patch all the male children in my game have pregnant bellies." 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">Umm guys… My kid is pregnant…</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FutureApricot8074/">u/FutureApricot8074</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/">thesims</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
It's unclear what new bug has caused the issue, or how widespread the appearance of pregnancy has spread.
</p>
<p>
The bright side here is that these young Sims are only appearing pregnant, rather than actually having their in-game status set to give birth. As far as players can work out, the issue is simply a visual one - though still, bizarre.
</p>
<p>
"I think the overall bug is that they're mixing up adult and child body presets somehow," one player suggested. "One in my save is very muscular suddenly and I saw another one with the classic beer belly and narrow shoulder combo. Really hope they fix it soon."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted The Sims publisher EA for more detail on what's gone wrong.
</p>
<p>This week's patch for The Sims 4 - the one that seems to have caused this issue - was meant to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">finally add the series' iconic burglar, after 11 years</a>. </p>
<p>Amidst some uncertainty surrounding The Sims' future, the franchise is currently celebrating its 25th anniversary with a range of events, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-and-2-patch-fixes-numerous-issues-following-farcical-re-release">somewhat wobbly remasters of The Sims and The Sims 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SEGA has provided a new release window of Spring 2025 for Sonic Rumble, along with details about new game modes and other features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sonic Rumble’s new release window was announced in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on its website. Along with the Spring 2025 window, the developers have provided details about new game modes and features such as Quick Rumble, Rival Rank, and the “Crews” feature. The developers have also provided a road map for the game that gives players details about what to expect until release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In update 1.1.1, the developers added 12 new stages, new co-op battles, a Special Rumble, friend invitations, and 12 new languages. The game then received the new Quick Play mode with update 1.1.2. Now, update 1.2.0 will introduce a competitive game mode, new ‘Crews’ feature, and skills for each game character.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-sonic-rumble-game-modes-and-features">New Sonic Rumble Game Modes and Features</h2>



<p>Sonic Rumble’s Quick Rumble is a quick-play mode that allows players to hop in and play a bite-sized one-round challenge. Rival Rank is a fresh competitive mode enabling players to showcase their skills and earn extra rewards at a new stage. The ‘Crews’ feature, on the other hand, allows players to take on the competition as a group and earn even more rewards.</p>



<p>The developers have stated they will pack Sonic Rumble with new content features before it arrives this Spring. They will also add specific abilities for each character from the Sonic Universe to make them feel truly unique, such as Amy’s Piko Piko Hammer.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sonic Rumble, the Fall Guys-inspired party game from Sega, was supposed to launch at the end of 2024. That didn't happen, of course, and the free-to-play game is now set for launch this spring.</p><p>In a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Sega thanked fans for their patience, saying the studio is "committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans." </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em6-SjjaYQE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Em6-SjjaYQE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sonic Rumble was already available in a pre-launch early-access period with a limited set of features. For the global launch in Spring 2025, Sega will bring the game up to 1.2.0, and this will include a new competitive game mode and the "Crew" feature that allows players to get in on the action together.</p><p>A mode called Quick Rumble will also be there at launch. This offers "bite-sized" matches that only last one round. Sega said this is aimed at people who are short on time.</p><p>Whenever it's ready, Sonic Rumble will release on iOS and Android, as well as for PC via Steam. As for the console series, the latest release was 2024's Sonic X Shadows Generations. The next big release is Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, which launches later this year for console and PC.</p><p>Outside of games, the movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-gets-march-2027-release-date/1100-6528922/" data-ref-id="1100-6528922">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is set for releases in theaters in March 2027</a>.

			<p>A new Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition trailer was shared online today, providing a new look at the game's mechanics and features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioWlTKzw2VM">The new overview trailer</a>, which can be watched below, is an excellent introduction to the game, as it goes over its most important features, like exploration and traversal, the combat system, the armored vehicles Skells, online features, and more. The trailer also has something for those who played the game on Wii U, as it provides a new look at the additional story content of the Definitive Edition, which includes a new location to explore, new characters, and more.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is setting out to be the best way to enjoy the game developed by Monolith Soft, thanks to its visual improvements and updated interface that make it easier to get into what can be a very overwhelming game, even for veterans of the series. You can learn more about what the game offers in its first ten or so hours by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hands-on-impressions/">preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition doesn’t feel like a particularly radical upgrade through its first 10-or-so hours, but some UI updates and a limited visual makeover ought to make the game more approachable for the large majority of Switch owners who missed out on it the first time around. I still have a lot more to try out, including the game’s teased new content, but so far, it feels like X still marks the spot.</em></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches on Nintendo Switch on March 20th worldwide.</p>

After passing trials at an early age, I was then molded into the tool that now serves the Imperium at Inquisitor Halikarn's request. The others may have misgivings, but I never do. The Inquisitor points, and I obey. But this hive city? This miracle? Even I have my doubts. But if there's corruption, either way, I will find it and snuff it out.</i></p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Soulbound</em>&nbsp;starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the starter set for the other <em>Warhammer 40K</em> roleplaying system that they produce, <em>Wrath and Glory</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=-2lkQ2H0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=T8cp7KQO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set includes 2 books for the GM and a load of great reference sheets for the players, with background as well as rules.</figcaption></figure><h2>Corruption and Miracles</h2>

<p>Similar to Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy roleplaying systems, their sci-fi <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> (or <em>40K </em>for short) roleplaying systems also have 2 options, with different mechanics and styles. The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system that we've looked at <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;uses 6-sided dice, similar to the tabletop wargaming system, and is much more combat-focused.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Imperium Maledictum</em> (which we are looking at here) uses a D100 system similar to that of the <em>WFRP </em>system that Cubicle 7 also produces and is much more focused on investigation and social encounters. Think of the split of systems between heroic systems using D6s (<em>Wrath and Glory</em> / <em>Soulbound</em>) and street-level using the D100 system (<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> and&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum).</em></p>

<p>All of the previous starter sets we've covered recently have been out for a year or two, but the <em>Imperium Maledictum&nbsp;</em>starter set is brand new, released this month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-5.jpg?itok=6sSfJeeg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-5.jpg?itok=OPryp0cl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As well as thematic Inquisitorial seal for Inquisitor Halikarn, you get 2 awesome custom D10.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Tools Of The Ordo Hereticus</h2>

<p>Following the pattern of the other Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying starter sets we've covered, <em>Imperium Maledictum</em> contains all the components for 6 players plus a Games Master to play through their first adventure and beyond. Each player gets a pre-generated character sheet, which we'll go into more detail about below, along with some quick reference sheets for all the rules they need to play.</p>

<p>The Games Master, who runs the adventure, gets 2 books, the&nbsp;Blazing Seraph, the core adventure and rules tutorial for <em>Imperium Maledictum,</em> and Rokarth: A Guide to the Hive, a sourcebook full of details background details for the hive, a giant city structure, and its inhabitants, from the ruling noble houses, merchant guilds ad the gangs that run the underhive.</p>

<p>It also contains some random encounter tables for the different levels of the hive that can be used to flesh out the introductory adventure or expand into a full campaign in Rokarth before picking up more&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum </em>books.</p>

<p>The set also includes a custom set of dice, 2 10-sided dice, one with the 10s (10, 20, etc) and the other with 0 to 9 to show a number between 1 and 100 when rolled together. The dice have custom markings, and any 1s are represented by the InquisitoriaI I symbol. Out of all the custom dice in the 4 <em>Warhammer</em> starter sets, these are my favourite.</p>

<p>I say the same things in all my reviews of the Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em>&nbsp;starter sets, that the Games Master needs to do some prep (which is standard for all GMs), but here if you're not a <em>Warhammer 40K</em> fan already it would be very helpful to read a little beyond the starter set books.</p>

<p>They do a great job of introducing the system and the hive, but a wider understanding of the setting would be beneficial, especially as this is aimed at the lower levels of society and is a lot more intrigue and investigation-based. Having a great understanding of that will make your games much more fun and vivid for your players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=wU0Nfb1Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=PRcbJE3w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The box the&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set comes in turns into a GM screen with a map of the sector. Some helpful charts for the GM would have really added to the set though.</figcaption></figure><h2>Those Who Serve The Imperium</h2>

<p>The<em>&nbsp;Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> starter set includes 6 pre-generated characters, and similarly to the other starter&nbsp;sets, each character comes with a fold-out sheet full of background details to flesh out the character beyond the stats. Also, similarly, it includes a great spread of characters to introduce players to the setting.</p>

<p>Players can choose from a zealot of the Imperial creed, armed with their faith and a chainsword, a covert infiltrator, an Imperial scribe, who's knowledge and data access usually proves more useful than any of the combat effectiveness of the other characters, a sanctioned psyker, a powerful magic user allowed by the Imperium, a mechanically augmented member of the cult of the machine god, who amusingly is the best healer for the fleshier members of the team, and an Imperial soldier.</p>

<p>Unlike in the <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set, where some characters can be at odds with the others, here, they are all entirely dedicated to Inquisitor&nbsp;Halikarn and share the same passion for the Imperium. They're all unique characters, so they don't always get along, but they're entirely joined up about their mission and reasons for working together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=ySApL6FP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=sLrfbnXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set incudes a great spread of characters from the setting, that all have their own character folio with some great depth.</figcaption></figure><h2>Not Only War In Warhammer 40K</h2>

<p>The <em>Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> system requires players to roll 2D10 to get a number between 1 and 100, needing to score under their skill to succeed. The GM can add or subtract to the character's skill, depending on how hard the test is. Success levels (SL) can then be used to work out how well you succeed (or fail), and the 10s number rolled is subtracted from the difficulty of the test. The number left is compared to a table to show how successful you have been.</p>

<p>There is also the opportunity to gain superiority during the adventure, which can be used to further boost your SL. This is gained by learning about the enemy, the battlefield, and each other, and the mechanic plays extremely well into the investigatory nature of the system and rewards players for doing social and research encounters rather than just blasting their way into and through situations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Imperium Maledictum Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> starter set is a great introduction to the style and mechanics of the system, but not the setting as a whole, so if everyone is completely new to <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, some background reading is advised first. The focus on the other aspects, over bringing war to your enemies (which it still does well), is really brought out with the pre-generated characters, and the adventure takes players through that.</p>

<p>The components and design are of the quality standard I've come to expect from Cubicles 7's starter sets, and the range of characters and detail in the sheets is fantastic. I think that the only thing missing from the set is a small <em>Warhammer 40K</em> primer document for those new to the setting, but that detail can be found easily enough online. Otherwise, it's a fantastic product, with a great adventure and an awesome custom dice set.</p>

            <p>
One of the internet's primordial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art">New Media</a> experiences is the Wiki Game - an asymmetrical "racing sim" in which you hurry from one Wikipedia page to another by clicking on the fewest number of links. Try doing that in the Museum of All Things, "a nearly-infinite virtual museum generated from Wikipedia", which you can <a href="https://mayeclair.itch.io/museum-of-all-things">download for free from Itch</a>. Devised by <a href="https://may.as/">Maya Claire</a> using the Godot Engine with audio from Neomoon's Willow Wolf, it's either a charmingly unusual way to browse a wonderful public resource or a free-associative liminal death-spiral, depending on your mood going in.
</p>
<p>
The Museum pulls down and generates new exhibition spaces from individual Wikipedia pages as you explore. Its scale is limited only by the quantity of cache memory you assign it in the settings. Needless to say, you'll need to be online for it to work. There's no attempt to disguise the procgen: instead, the simulation makes an insidiously graceful spectacle of its own self-assembly. Marble displays, neatly captioned imagery and overhead light fittings slide and rattle into view as you enter rooms (again, you can decide the proximity at which they appear in the settings). Instead of hyperlinks, there are little signs with arrows pointing you down a tunnel to a relevant exhibit.
</p>
<p>
If the Museum Of All Things is a celebration of Wikipedia, with the option of jumping out from the pause menu to visit the relevant page in a browser, the glamour of its generation quickly takes priority over the act of retrieving information. The air-con serenades you steadily as you venture down one staircase after another, pursuing a layout that is unapologetically non-Euclidean, with entire schools of thought and the wisdom of bygone ages tucked Tardis-like inside blocks a few metres wide. 
</p>
<p>
This space is vast beyond comprehension, and yet, terribly small, for each room's architecture is the same collection of assets, elegantly rearranged. The polished wooden floors reflect the exhibits but you can't see yourself in them. A distorted background tone intrudes upon the hum of the air-con - is that a tannoy announcement? Somebody singing? Oh hell, I have to get out. I tumble down the corridor to "Butter Tea", hurry on through into "List of Butter Dishes", then "Dish (food)", then "Eat", then "Chewing", then "Teeth". I pause before a diagram of a rat's incisor and I know that the rat is me. The Museum has me now. Please, come find me.

<p>Delta Force is laying down the law as an FPS not to be messed with, and its controller support keeps cropping up in combat. Mouse and keyboard players need not worry, but let’s see if Delta Force has a controller as a trusted ally.</p>



<p>The gaming market is never short of shooters—third-person, first-person, or otherwise. Black Ops 6 and Warzone remain popular despite dwindling numbers, Marvel Rivals is dominating the hero shooter genre, and Fortnite has infinite lives. Gray Zone Warfare was an example of an indie shooter trying to break out and match the extraction success of Escape From Tarkov—but Delta Force is a force in its own right.</p>



<p>The first-person shooter title has received new fans courtesy of its free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down Campaign DLC</a>. We’ll clear up any confusion about controller support for Team Jade’s shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-have-controller-support">Does Delta Force Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Trickier than it needs to be. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Delta Force officially doesn’t have controller support on PC yet, meaning you either have to use keyboard and mouse or unsupported controller support.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, Delta Force doesn’t let you use a controller right now. If you want to use a controller with Delta Force, you need to enable <strong>Steam Input</strong>. This allows you to connect a controller, but the controls might be a bit funky and unstable. You might experience input issues you wouldn’t have with proper native support.</p>



<p>For now, you’re better off using a keyboard and mouse. This might not be forever though as updates have been provided concerning controller support.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-controller-support-coming-to-delta-force">When is Controller Support Coming to Delta Force?</h2>



<p><strong>The developer has confirmed controller support is coming to Delta Force in Q1 2025.</strong></p>



<p>On Dec. 5, 2024, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/4638240954399129918/?ctp=2#c4638240954399140782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam General Discussion thread for Delta Force</a> discussed the topic of “No controller support?” User Philx.v posed this question about Delta Force. The question wasn’t left for the community to discuss amongst itself though.</p>



<p>A Team Jade dev commented on the query: “Thank you for playing Delta Force! We’re working on adding controller support and are aiming to introduce this feature to the game by Q1 2025.” It’s looking likely that <strong>March 2025</strong> will see the addition of controller support, but this is subject to change.</p>



<p>It was rumored the support would coincide with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-console-release-window-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console launch of Delta Force</a>. However, the Delta Force console release date—as of writing—has been postponed. But it is coming, so keep those dual analog sticks warm while you wait.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nacon-connect-2025-announced-for-next-week.1119423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has revealed the air date for its latest Nacon Connect presentation, which will feature information on some of the studio's previously-announced games as well as a few surprises.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out Nacon Connect 2025 next week; it's airing on March 6th at 10am Pacific (that's around 1pm Eastern and about 6pm GMT, in case you're wondering). Nacon is remaining cagey about exactly what's going to be announced during the showcase.</p>

<p>Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2023" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>, Nacon gave us a look at games like&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum&nbsp;</em>(the latter of which was not yet wreathed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-gollum-studio-reportedly-abandons-game-development" rel="nofollow">tragedy that would subsume its developer</a> after its release).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-nacon-connect.jpg?itok=G_ihziSU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-nacon-connect.jpg?itok=k5X4lYoi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In 2023, Nacon showed off&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City&nbsp;</em>as part of its Nacon Connect presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>The festivities <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" rel="nofollow">returned last year</a>, when Nacon revealed survival game&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>&nbsp;during Nacon Connect 2024, as well as showing off the likes of action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em>,&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, and racer&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em>.</p>

<p>As for what could be coming in this year's showcase, the studio's upcoming slate still contains all four of the aforementioned games, all of which are yet to receive definitive release dates (although&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>is admittedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap" rel="nofollow">out now in Early Access</a>).</p>

<p>In fact,&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" rel="nofollow">delayed back in August last year</a>; it was originally slated for a 2024 release, but it was subsequently pushed back to 2025.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get a release date or a release window for&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, and I'd be surprised if we didn't hear more about Rogue Factor's&nbsp;<em>Hell Is Us&nbsp;</em>and Midgar Studio's&nbsp;<em>Edge of Memories&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>




<p>Whatever's on the way - and whatever surprises Nacon has planned - will be revealed in full during the Nacon Connect 2025 presentation, which is set to air on March 6th. You'll be able to check it out via Nacon's YouTube channel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/619605/framework-desktop-preview-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework’s mission is to “fix consumer electronics, one category at a time” by making them modular, repairable, and upgradable. It’s the only laptop maker to ever <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23125965/framework-laptop-upgrade-intel-12th-gen">truly succeed</a> at that “upgradable” part. But <em>desktop</em> PCs are already modular, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">why is Framework making one</a>?</p><p>At first, I thought it saw a unique opportunity to make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">a cute yet badass tiny gaming PC</a> with AMD’s unusual Strix Halo processor and decided to shoot its shot. As you’ll read below, I’m excited by the result. But I also have another idea I’ll share with you afterward.</p><p>Let’s start with the gadget part: yes, the tiny 4.5-liter gaming desktop that Framework announced yesterday is just as cool in person as it was in Framework’s photos, and yes, it can game.</p><p>At first, I wasn’t sure we’d be able to meaningfully try that last part. Almost all the Framework Desktops at the company’s live event in San Francisco yesterday were either running games that don’t offer a great sense of performance (<em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em>) or were unplugged so we could take photos from every angle. But partway through the event, someone had fired up <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and I saw my chance.</p><p>The first benchmark was promising but not exactly running smoothly, averaging just under 30fps at 4K with ray tracing, FSR upscaling, and Frame Generation turned on. But when we swapped to a native 1440p at Ultra settings, no ray tracing, and none of AMD’s fancy tricks, I saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-cyberpunk-2077-internal-pc-benchmarks-tested-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-consoles">a PS5-beating</a> 73fps average — with lows of 60fps! — from a box that’s actually smaller than a PS5 (or an Xbox Series X) in volume.</p><p>That’s because the Framework Desktop contains a new and rather unusual <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD Ryzen AI Max processor</a> whose integrated Radeon 8060S graphics are as powerful as a discrete mobile graphics chip — namely, the laptop version of the Nvidia RTX 4060 — and can apparently trade blows with the mobile RTX 4070 when it gets enough sustained power like the 120 watts it can tap into here. It also shares a massive amount of unified LPDDR5x memory across the entire system, including graphics — up to 96GB of VRAM for its GPU.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs">an Asus tablet</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339771/i-lifted-128gb-of-memory-and-the-most-powerful-integrated-graphics-with-one-hand">an HP laptop</a> also contain the same chip, the Strix Halo’s power may be constrained by its cooling and battery, and yet, unconstrained, the chip still doesn’t have enough power to supplant today’s big gaming laptops or desktops. But here, Framework has built an attractive miniature desktop that’s not quite like anything that currently exists.</p><p>It lets you pick your own front I/O ports thanks to the same expansion cards on Framework’s laptops. It has magnetic front and side panels that easily pop into place, then slide down to secure. There’s an optional carry handle that I already love — when you spin each of its halves into place, they act as the thumbscrews to keep your case fully closed, then you screw the two halves of the handle together <em>using the handle itself</em>, and it feels incredibly secure once you’re done. (See my embedded video if that sounds confusing.)</p><p>It also seems easy to personalize this case: there are 21 slots for colored plastic squares on the front panel, you can 3D print your own (I saw some Lego bits attached to 3D-printed studs on one and fake grass attached to another), and it’s incredibly easy to pop the squares out to make room for new ones if you remove the front panel first.</p><p>I’m not yet sold on this computer being easy to upgrade like Framework’s other products, though. Even forgetting the soldered memory, there’s not necessarily enough space in here to maneuver its parts like a larger desktop; I had to reach inside pretty delicately to unplug the ATX motherboard power cable and USB headers. While removing the fan, storage, and Wi-Fi modules is quite easy, I was told I’d have to disassemble the top rails of the case itself to remove the motherboard, which doesn’t have enough room to escape through the large side panel hole.</p><p>But it’s possible some of that will change before its Q3 launch; Framework stopped me before I could fully extract the board or remove the cooler to expose the Strix Halo chip, telling me that what I’d see underneath is not quite final.</p><p>Since yesterday morning’s announcement, I’ve already seen a bunch of reasonable people questioning whether this desktop makes sense — is it truly a modular desktop with no upgradable socketed CPUs, GPUs, or memory? — and noting how unusual it is for Framework to dive into a category it can’t necessarily improve.</p><p>But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if single-board computing might genuinely be a new direction for mini desktops. They’ve largely been at the mercy of the vestigial ATX motherboard spec for a long time, a spec that’s long assumed you’ll plug your memory modules and graphics cards at a 90-degree angle to your motherboard, sticking out perpendicularly, which limits the sizes and shapes of upgradable mini PC designs.</p><p>With Framework’s laptops, the reason they’re so <em>easily</em> upgradable is that Framework builds an entire computer on a swappable board, right down to the USB-C ports, save for the <em>other</em> components you might like to easily upgrade (storage, memory, and Wi-Fi / Bluetooth radios). This is only one component (memory) different from that, and maybe <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173813/this-is-what-a-desktop-motherboard-with-camm2-memory-modules-looks-like">flat-mount CAMM memory</a> can change that in future designs. (Framework’s CEO <a href="https://youtu.be/-lErGZZgUbY?si=x0208DpFBZPUPCad">told Linus</a> that CAMM wasn’t going to work for Strix Halo, though.)</p><p>Maybe Framework can help unlock more new sizes and shapes of mini PCs, especially if others follow its lead, which feels more likely now that it’s iterating on an existing standard desktop motherboard spacing pattern, rather than boards designed to fit specific Framework laptops. Maybe Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm might like to get in on single-board mini PCs that’d fit such computers, too.</p><p>Even if not, AMD seems potentially interested in doing more. At CES, I asked AMD chief gaming solutions architect Frank Azor if Strix Halo was a one-off, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17346234/intel-nuc-8-pc-gaming-amd-vega-review">like the unusual Intel chip with AMD graphics that also once powered a tiny gaming PC</a>, or if it’s a new category that’ll stick around. He said he couldn’t announce any new products but noted that it was extremely expensive to build this new “Halo” tier. The hope is that it’ll create a new category by enabling laptops and ultra small form factor PCs to do things they couldn’t do before.</p><p>I also asked Azor if Strix Halo was cost-effective; specifically, if manufacturers can build systems with a single Strix Halo instead of a similarly performing discrete CPU and discrete GPU without paying more. He said yes, they could, and get the benefits of AMD’s fast unified memory as well.</p><p>I will note, though, that Framework did not promise that the Framework Desktop would have future revisions or boards available. And there’s no mention of upgradability on its product page. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138475/framework-laptop-product-categories-new">While Framework CEO Nirav Patel told me last April</a> that every new product is the “first stake in the ground” for a new category, and that they won’t be one-offs, it’s a bit murkier whether we’ll see future Framework Desktop boards than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">whether the Framework Laptop 16 will get future GPU upgrades</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The next entry in the long-running beast-battling action series from Capcom follows in the large footprints of its predecessor Monster Hunter World and its generous Iceborne expansion. But just how long is it? Here we’ll let you know exactly how many hours it took different members of the IGN team to finish the main story, what they prioritised doing with their time, and how much they’ve put into the postgame.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Tom Marks - Executive Reviews Editor, Games</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I took just under <strong>15 hours</strong> to reach the credits in Monster Hunter Wilds’ campaign - and that’s the actual end of the story, unlike the first credit roll in Monster Hunter Rise, which comes at barely the halfway point of the larger plot. That said, finishing the campaign here only marks the end of Low Rank, with High Rank after it offering plenty of side quests and greater challenges to tackle, so you’re far from done at that point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me <strong>another 15 hours</strong> to finish nearly all of those quests and get to what should be considered the proper endgame. That meant I had fought all the monsters there are to fight, unlocked all the systems and crafting you are ultimately given access to at launch, and been introduced to the custom Artian weapon system that’s meant to keep you busy from there. Because of Wilds’ streamlined grind, I only needed another five hours to feel like I had reached the peak of the weapons and armor set I wanted, though there is of course plenty more to strive for across other weapon types and the like.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Casey DeFreitas - Deputy Editor, Guides</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I beat the final "story" mission of Monster Hunter Wilds in High Rank at around <strong>40 hours</strong>, about <strong>22 hours after I saw the credits after "low rank."</strong> It's a bit difficult to be 100% accurate though, as I spent quite a bit of time idling in menus for guide purposes. I didn't really engage in any of the more intricate systems of Monster Hunter Wilds during the "Low Rank" portion of the game. I crafted what I could with what I had and carried on, not bothering to repeat hunts. I pretty much did the same for High Rank, but this time I strayed from the Story Missions to tackle new optional monsters and do more hunts with friends, which you kind of need to do anyway to keep unlocking Story Missions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, I made it to the final mission only specifically going out of my way to upgrade my weapon one time by hunting an extra Ajarakan. Otherwise, I made what I could and beelined it to the end. Not that that's how I wanted to play. If I had time, I probably would have had closer to 60 hours at the finish line, as I would have liked to make a better, more efficient armor and weapon set besides the hodgepodge I had cobbled together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, I still have some endemic life-catching and fishing to do, and I have six monster-hunting Side Missions left that I unlocked after the second to last Story Mission. I likely have at least one additional optional quest to unlock, too. But I certainly won't stop there. I want to farm a few particular monsters to upgrade a few Talisman, make some different armor, and try my hand with RNG to see what cool Artian weapons I can make! I'm sure I'll spend time just leisurely replaying through the story with friends while learning a new weapon, too, so I have plenty more I'm excited to do in Monster Hunter Wilds. Not to mention event quests starting next week and the title updates with new monsters coming throughout the year.</p><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Simon Cardy - Senior Editorial Producer</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It took <strong>just under 16 hours</strong> to finish Monster Hunter Wilds’ main story, a runtime that surprised me, as I made it 25 hours into World’s campaign without seeing the end in sight. Somewhat of a MH novice myself, I was also struck by just how easygoing I was finding a lot of its battles, too. I did faint once or twice when it came to some of Wilds’ showpiece apex predators, but on the whole, I found it a fairly breezy adventure. The streamlining to accommodate relative newcomers like me to the series definitely has an impact on this, with elemental strengths and weaknesses, the requirement to craft and tailor loadouts for specific fights, and any real extensive tracking and hunting, all scaled back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, perhaps the biggest impact on the runtime is the consistent story cutscene/monster battles cadence that pretty much continues all the way until the credits. It feels less like a pure Monster Hunter experience at times, and more like Capcom welcoming in one-too-many Western cinematic story-driven development influences into its walls. On the one hand, I appreciated it, as I could swiftly reach the conclusion of its (albeit not entirely original) initial story, but do wonder if it leaves too much of what has made Monster Hunter beloved by fans on the cutting room floor until the post-game hits. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Jada Griffin - Community Lead</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me about <strong>20 hours</strong> to reach the initial credits for Monster Hunter Wilds and while most of that time was spent tackling all the optional and side quests available to me another smaller chunk was spent just vibing in the world of Wilds. I spent time exploring all the little paths littered around the map, hunting down various endemic life (bugs, birds, etc), customizing my radial menus, shouts and finding the most optimal locations for my pop-up camps (there are some really cool ones hidden in various caves).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, it only took me <strong>15 hours to complete all the High-rank missions</strong> and side quests and see all the monsters held for after the credits. As of now, I've spent nearly 70 hours overall doing other things just for fun in the post-credits like hunting monsters with friends for fun, decoration farming, and doing a bit of some semi-serious hunting for monster crowns which are awarded for finding and successfully hunting the largest and smallest versions of each monster. I’ve had a great time with it so far but I am very much looking forward to when Wilds adds more monsters to its roster in future title updates.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Ronny Barrier - Producer, Guides</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw the first credits in Monster Hunter Wilds after about <strong>20 hours</strong>. I mostly mainlined the story, with just a few pit stops to grind out one or two armor sets since they looked cool. I also tried to use a variety of weapons (Switch Axe rocks, by the way), so it took a bit longer than it would have if I just stuck with my faithful sword and shield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still plenty more to do, and since <strong>I’m currently sitting at 65 hours</strong>, I wouldn’t consider those credits the real ending, even if that’s a turning point for the story. There’s plenty more to hunt, new monsters to see, and new hats to craft. If anything, the story seems to be a bit of an extended tutorial, which I’m totally okay with. I still get to find and battle more monsters, after all. Except Congalala. Would prefer to never see him again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

It's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, but this rooster looks ready to throw down. Good luck trying to kick this feathery fiend.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r1t_oDC7z8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="985">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7r1t_oDC7z8?start=985" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Chickens have a long history in Fable, as way back in the original game, you could win a special hat in a chicken-kicking competition. In Fable 2, you could earn two chicken-related titles for kicking the birds a respectable distance, and Fable 3 had a chicken-themed suit that you could unlock and even a chance to earn some coin by gambling on chicken races.</p><p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time that the Fable games have toyed with the idea of rebellious poultry, as <a href="https://youtu.be/PgigSpd8N1k" rel="nofollow ">Fable 3 introduced a renegade chicken in its opening cinematic</a>. That chicken would make a bid for freedom, successfully outrunning soldiers for a while, but it met its end when it ran into a castle and a chef took aim at it with a shotgun. There is a theory that it might have survived, as you can spot a black chicken near the castle kitchen when you visit it, so maybe this new nemesis is related to the Fable 3 rebel.</p><p>Originally scheduled to arrive in 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/">Fable has been delayed to 2026</a>. "We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025; we are actually going to give Fable more time and it's going to ship in 2026 now," head of Xbox Games Studios Craig Duncan explained on the official Xbox podcast. "While I know that's not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it's definitely worth the wait."</p><p>Fable is set to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S, but one prominent leaker has suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delay-into-2026-could-allow-it-to-release-on-ps5-at-launch-leaker-suggests/1100-6529719/">that the delay may allow it to arrive on launch day on PS5</a> as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m a fan of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/bikes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike games</a>, especially these days when I'm woefully short on time to ride. I’m not a fan of doing bike maintenance tasks, which is one of the prices you pay for liking to ride bikes. Upcoming game <em>Wheel World</em> not only makes bike tinkering easier, and more fun, than it is in real life, but scratches the riding itch my hectic schedule and a flat tire have kept me from.</p><p><a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wheel World</em></a> (nee <a href="https://gamerant.com/ghost-bike-rename-wheel-world-change-why-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ghost Bike</em></a>)<em> </em>has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1497460/Wheel_World/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> out now as part of Steam Next Fest. It’s a brief slice of the game, in which you wake up on a mysterious island and have to help a skull spirit recreate the connection between worlds. You do this by activating shrines charmingly shaped like bike bells, collecting bike parts, and levelling up your character through bike races or taking simple jumps.</p><p>Some of the game’s slangy dialogue is a bit cringe, the way <a href="https://screenrant.com/riders-republic-good-bad-dialog-fun-annoying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extreme sports games</a> can sometimes be, but the game itself does away with the flash and tryhard of those games in favor of focusing more on just riding your bike around. The world is stylized and colorful, with wide open roads that let you play with exploration and momentum rather than technical tricks. Your bike makes wonderful mechanical sounds as you roam around, reminding me of the sound design of games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/711540/Lonely_Mountains_Downhill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lonely Mountains: Downhill</em></a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/695330/SEASON_A_letter_to_the_future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Season</em></a>. To activate the first bell shrine, you have to bike up a hill (booo), where you encounter a bike gang blocking the way and have to challenge them to a race. Racing in the demo felt pleasantly simple, with the biggest challenge being drafting--following along in another rider's wake--to earn speed boosts. In real life, the <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1664998270320492545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one bike race</a> I competed in was a terrifying blur of shouting and crashes that encouraged me to stay as far away from other cyclists as possible, so it was fun to experiment with the opposite here.</p><figure><figcaption>Messhof</figcaption></figure><p>Winning races or completing their optional side challenges levels you up in the form of reputation points, and can earn you bike parts, which you can also find scattered around the world. The new wheels, saddles, drivetrains, and frames you find can boost your bike’s speed, handling, and other attributes, and they also change the look of your bike. In the game’s trailer, this can lead to an unholy mashup of a bike, and I think it will be a lot of fun to balance functionality with creating the monster bike of my dreams in the full game.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="WHEEL WORLD | Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmL15GGO1SA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In real life, I’ve got a flat on my daily bike right now, which I got literally <em>just</em> as I arrived at Nathan’s <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> launch party a few weekends ago. While bike shops make fixing flats look easy, I am abysmal at this most basic of tasks. (I’m especially bad at it on my bikepacking bike, which has tubeless-ready tires that are impossible to get off.) To encourage myself to do this little chore, I’ve positioned my bike so that it blocks the doorway to my bedroom, thinking it would force me to pull out my levers and pump. Instead, I just think “I really should fix that” and squeeze by every time I need to change my socks or go to bed.</p><p>But playing the <em>Wheel World</em> demo has reminded me of how lovely it is to just bike around, following where roads go and enjoying meandering rather than thinking about speed or challenging terrain. While I wish fixing my flat in real life were as simple as selecting a wheel from <em>Wheel World</em>’s menu, it’s also not nearly as hard as I think if I have a little patience and confidence. By the time you read this, hopefully I’ll be back out on the road (maybe this time with an actual patch kit in my bag), which should tide me over until <em>Wheel World</em> comes out this summer.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-decision-choices-story-im-so-sorry-everybody"><h3>Every Decision You Make In Avowed Is Terrible</h3></a><p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down"><h3>Fuck WB</h3></a><p>Another all-time great studio sacrificed at the altar of Line Go Up</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While I probably don’t look like it, I am a massive fan of golf games. Maybe it’s because I’m useless at golf in real life, but I’ve been sinking birdies and the occasional eagle for years – and once upon a time, even a hole in one! 2K and HB Studios returning with another entry in their golf series is a welcome sight to behold, especially as PGA Tour 2K25 is an all-round improvement on the last.</p>
<p><iframe title="Next Round, Best Round I PGA TOUR 2K25 Official Announce Trailer I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7TlP1WBr50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The two year gap that this series maintains has paid off once again. Everything looks better; the character models, the course, even the balls look good! The polish doesn’t end there, however. Gameplay overall feels that little bit smoother and with three different types of swing options, the sky’s the limit.</p>


<p>The swing system once again comes in multiple flavours, with the new EvoSwing providing a very realistic feel to smacking your balls<em> [Phrasing? – Ed]</em>. EvoSwing uses your own rhythm and dexterity to better simulate the feeling of swinging a golf club when using Swing Stick, which is neat. For a more laid back experience, you can opt for the new Perfect Swing difficulty setting, which reduces the material impact of external factors on your swing, allowing newer players to get used to the mechanics of golfing without worrying about all the complex stuff.&nbsp;If all else fails, you can revert back to my favourite, the 3-Click Swing. There’s options for all players, which is great.</p>


<p>I got a tad frustrated with chip shots which often felt a little weird trying to get the ball on the green. I have fond memories of being able to chip the ball and getting it real close to the hole in previous game, but I struggled to get this right in 2K25. I’m not going to blame the game here as this is likely user error on my part, but something definitely feels different with it that I’ve yet to master.</p>
<p>That being said, being able to change your tee position, which doesn’t seem like a big deal, (but was a major annoyance in 2K23), combined with the ability of now being able to choose your hazard drop shot, gives you a level of control you didn’t have before.</p>
<p>The first port of call for almost all players will be MyCareer. One thing I really appreciate is a game that respects my time, and 2K25 absolutely does that, letting you choose how much of each course you want to play. If you only have time for a quick blast, you can play just 6 holes of an 18 hole course and let the sim do the rest. Even the simming can be balanced how you want, with the AI version of your player being as good or as bad as you want them to be.</p>
<p>The goal in MyCareer is, of course, to compete for points in tournaments, trying hard to qualify for the FedExCup. Instead of just dropping you off at each holes, before each event, you can partake in training and minigames as a way to earn stat buffs and get the lay of the land. Earning stat buffs is crucial for later in the game, as that extra few meters on a drive will come in handy when you need to get closer to the hole. It’s easy to dismiss this as simple padding, but there’s a rhyme and reason for it.</p>

<p>MyCareer and the building of MyPlayer feels a bit more of an RPG this time around. You can unlock specific shots in the skill tree, as well as stats buffs for helping with your shots. There are six trees in total, and I went for the Powerhouse character, focusing on smashing the ball as far down the fairway as I could.</p>
<p>In addition to levelling up your player, you can also level up your clubs using tokens to enhance stats in certain areas, before using EvoTools to unlock a higher potential, shaping&nbsp; your equipment to match and enhance your style of play.</p>
<p>There’s also a popularity mechanic which is nothing new, but adds a little flavour to the overall experience. Off the course, you can spend time influencing fans during interviews, with your answers coming across as bold or subdued. It’s like the paragon or renegade sliders from Mass Effect, just without a meaningful effect. Yes, the number on screen was going up over time and I gained more social media followers, but this really didn’t have a massive impact on anything on the course, so I failed to see the benefit of engaging with the system too much. It could have tied in with the sponsorships system, but really the game just boils down to playing good golf to get branding and unlock cosmetics.</p>
<p>The rivals feature still feels a little lacklustre. I got to the end of a tournament and the game told me I’d beaten my rival. I didn’t even know I had one! All I did was score better than him. If they just made a bit more of a fuss about the rivalries and gave some sort of payoff for beating a difficult opponent, I might be more invested. As it stands, this is a bit of a non-feature.</p>

<p>Outside of MyCareer, the online modes from 2K23 have returned. Naturally, I’m a fan of Divot Derby, which is a fast and chaotic mode in which up to 20 players tee off at the same time and race to the hole in a unique golf ‘battle-royale’ style jamboree of madness. In short, it’s a lot of fun. Topgolf is also back again and is an arcade-style game mode in which you’ll take aim at a series of targets and attempt to score as many points as you can. It was introduced last year and was super popular so it naturally deserved a returning spot.</p>
<p>Ranked Tours is a new feature for 2K25 which contains daily and weekly seasonal events and follows the PGA schedule while the real PGA TOUR season is in full swing which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling creative, you can once again create your own course and share them for the world to see. It’s always good to see everyones creations and attempt to become the master of each hole.</p>

<p>The Clubhouse Pass is back but this time <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/2k-reveals-whats-waiting-in-pga-tour-2k25s-clubhouse-pass-seasons/">it doesn’t expire</a>, coming in line with a lot of other recent titles. There’s a free version and a Premium track but thankfully, that and the other microtransactions on offer are mostly cosmetic based. Of course you can spend real world bucks to upgrade your stats immediately, but you can do it almost as fast from simply playing the game, so it’s not too egregious bad. Also, the stats don’t have a patch on simply having skill in this game, when compared to the NBA 2K games where the stat buffs are really felt.</p>
