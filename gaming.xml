<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cff408fab2636/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Team Cherry has finally lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">release date</a>. It's <strong>4th September</strong>, if you missed it, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier has sat down with the devs to find out why it has taken so long to make.</p>
<p>The short answer, as detailed in Schreier's feature (paywalled), is that the team has simply been having a nice time making it. The ideas kept piling up, and a pesky little global pandemic pushed things back somewhat, but it sounds like Team Cherry has been maintaining a healthy attitude to the whole thing for the past seven years — which, in the grand scheme of high-profile development stories, is rather lovely to hear.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pimluz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Despite spending this much time with the massively-hyped sequel, it seems that Team Cherry already has ideas for <em>more</em> content to add to the game. "Launching it is obviously quite exciting," the studio's co-founder William Pellen told Bloomberg, “What comes after for us is equally as exciting”.</p>
<p>"The most interesting thing now is what we can add to it next," Team Cherry's other co-founder, Ari Gibson, agreed, even teasing that the team has "got a plan" for what these additions might look like. "Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well," Gibson continued, "but hopefully we can achieve some of it”.</p>

<p>And it sounds like the team could have kept going for many more years than the six it's been since Silksong was announced. "It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping," Pellen commented, "We could have kept going”. Gibson even stated that he "had to stop sketching" at some point, to avoid a situation where that game takes "15 years to finish". Heh, it makes six years of waiting sound like child's play, no?</p>
<p>The devs also shared with Bloomberg why their updates have been so few and far between in recent years, with Gibson stating that “We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing, because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it’”. Pellen sang to the same tune, affirming, “Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game” — not that they expected things to take this long, of course.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg feature</a> is full of other details about the game's development besides those mentioned above, and is well worth a read if, like us, you've been wondering what's been happening over at Team Cherry in recent years.</p>
<p>There are just two weeks to go now until we all finally get our hands on Hollow Knight: Silksong, and based on our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/video-at-last-weve-played-hollow-knight-silksong-on-switch-2">Gamescom hands-on preview</a>, it's looking extremely promising.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-interactive-entertainment-sells-its-stake-in-evo-to-nodwin-gaming-sie-to-sponsor-the-event-through-2028.1277316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has sold its ownership stake in the fighting tournament EVO to NODWIN Gaming, a company that's also backed by the Sony Group Corporation, but owned by Nazara Technologies. SIE will continue to sponsor the event globally through to 2028, while NODWIN Gaming will take over co-ownership duties alongside RTS.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2025-business-update">"<em>Business Update</em>"</a> blog post on the official EVO website, where the Evolution Championship Series called the change "<em>a major step forward"</em> for the tournament. </p>



<p>On the transition, SIE senior vice president and head of global partner development and relations, Phil Rosenberg, said, "<em>When SIE acquired Evo alongside RTS in 2021, our goal was to help the Evo community grow and spotlight the skills and passion of fighting game fans on a global stage</em>. <em>As SIE transitions to become an Evo sponsor, the momentum for Evo has never been stronger, following a successful Las Vegas event and upcoming expansion to new regions. We look forward to supporting the continued growth of Evo globally."</em></p>



<p>For NODWIN Gaming's part, co-founder and managing director Akshat Rathee added, "<em>Evo was built by a team whose authenticity and passion for the fighting game community are unmatched</em>. <em>We will continue SIE’s great work and honor the legacy of everyone who has made it what it is today, while opening the door for a new generation to experience the spirit of Evo</em>."</p>



<p>Today's update also included the introduction of a new partner, Qiddiya, which is now a global partner of the tournament and an investor in its co-owner, RTS.</p>



<p>While Sony Interactive Entertainment is no longer a part owner of the tournament, as a global sponsor we can still expect to see SIE and PlayStation use the tournament to showcase upcoming products like the recently unveiled <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike</a> fight stick and playable demos of upcoming fighting games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls,</a> which attendees at this year's show had the chance to try. </p>

                <p>Digital Eclipse has officially confirmed two more games for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection/">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, as the infamous PlayStation-era spin-offs Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat Special Forces are being added to the compilation. These titles have been unavailable for decades on PC and newer consoles, and Digital Eclipse added that they're being enhanced alongside the other Mortal Kombat games in the roster.</p><p>The studio says that there will be a rewind feature to make gameplay more forgiving, on-screen move lists, and a Trainer Mode to help players learn various combos and fatalities. Players can also expect reduced load times in each game.</p><p>The other big reveal from the studio was that the WaveNet edition of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 will also be included in the collection. This was originally developed to support Midway's ambitious WaveNet online matchmaking service for arcade machines, and it was the only Mortal Kombat arcade game to feature Noob Saibot as a playable character.</p><p>If you want an idea of just how big of a deal it is to have this version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 included, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/osu16bit.bsky.social/post/3lwwbjk72w22d" rel="nofollow ">NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback has a detailed thread</a> on just how ahead of its time the technology was, the significant gameplay changes that were made for this edition, and how this version of the game was thought to be lost to time before a working arcade cabinet was found.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O89KZUGXbqY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you never played Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero or Mortal Kombat Special Forces, then you missed out on two <em>interesting </em>games. Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was released in 1997, and it was a sidescrolling action game that still retained the combat from the 2D Mortal Kombat games. A sound idea in theory, but in practice, the unforgiving platform sections and brutally difficult traps-- combined with sluggish controls--made it a chore to play. If you could look past those flaws, the game did have an interesting skill-tree system and live-action cinematics that rivaled the 1995 film in the cheese department.</p><p>Mortal Kombat: Special Forces hit the scene in 2000, and it had a rocky development. Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias and several other staff members left Midway before the game was finished, leading to content being cut and plans for Sonya Blade to feature as a playable character to be scrapped. The game isn't fondly remembered, but it's still an interesting part of Mortal Kombat history that Digital Eclipse is preserving for a new generation of players.</p><p>If you're looking to grab it, you can p<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-preorder-guide/1100-6533623/" data-ref-id="1100-6533623">reorder the Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection right now</a>. With those two entries confirmed, the full list of playable games includes:</p><ul><li>Mortal Kombat -- 1992 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 2 -- 1993 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 3 -- 1995 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis)</li><li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 -- 1995 (Arcade, WaveNet Arcade, SNES)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Trilogy -- 1996 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 4 -- 1997 (Arcade)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero -- 1997 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Special Forces -- 2000 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Advance -- 2001 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance -- 2002 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition -- 2003 (Game Boy Advance)</li></ul><p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection launches on December 12 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch 2, and Switch.

			<p>Now that we're a few days removed from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6 Open Beta</a>, EA and its Battlefield Studios have had a chance to look at the results, which, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">based on the player counts we saw during the beta</a>, are unsurprisingly staggering. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-open-beta-debrief">According to EA</a>, the beta for Battlefield 6 drew in the most players for a beta in the series' history, with 420,127,450 matches played across 92,351,578 hours of gameplay.</p>



<p>The beta also contained more content than any previous beta in the series' history, with multiple modes across four maps available for players to check out. 32% of all players deployed with the Assault class, 26% jumped in as Support, 23% as Engineer, and only 19% of players deployed with the Recon class.</p>



<p>Also, those 23% of players who were running Support were able to rack up 7,453,121 kills with defibrillators.</p>

<p>But EA is doing more than just tallying up statistics when looking back on the beta. It's also analyzing how players behaved during it, and taking in feedback given on the state of the game. As a result, a number of tweaks and adjustments are being made to multiple aspects of the game for its coming launch on October 10, 2025.</p>



<p>Starting with the maps, the collective teams at Battlefield Studios quickly noticed that players were taking advantage of flanking tactics that involved running out of bounds and quickly back into the fight, but behind enemy lines for a few easy kills. If you were one of the players who did this, hopefully you've had your fun, since EA is "<em>actively working on adjustments to prevent unintended access and ensure gameplay stays within the intended boundaries</em>."</p>



<p>Also, if you were concerned that the maps in the beta were too small, EA is reassuring that "<em>more fast-paced maps, larger-scale maps are already part of our launch package.</em>" It continues to say that for all players currently in its Battlefield Labs program, two new multiplayer maps will be tested soon in the lead up to October.</p>



<p>In terms of the weapons, while the beta didn't include the full range of the arsenal that will be available in Battlefield 6 at launch, Battlefield Studios is "<em>making targeted adjustments to deliver a more consistent and rewarding gunplay experience</em>," including tweaking recoil and tap-fire characteristics for all weapons, and the beast that was the M87A1 shotgun is no more, since it will require more than one-shot to get a kill moving forward.</p>



<p>Player movement is also getting reworked, with a reduction in horizontal speed and a greater penalty added for consecutive jumps. Accuracy has also been decreased while jumping and sliding, in order to "<em>make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, EA is taking a pass at player counts, especially in Rush mode, and playlist options, and in each section stresses that "<em>finding the right balance is an ongoing process</em>."</p>



<p>As far as next steps are concerned, the first players to see those will be the ones in the Battlefield Labs program, as EA is introducing "<em>in-game adjustments</em>" for upcoming events. Everyone else will have to wait until Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025 to see what's changed since the beta.</p>

              <p><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> is a very unlikely subject for one of the best games of the turn of the millennium. And yet, that game exists! <em>Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force</em> was one of the best FPS games of its generation! Heck, <em>Elite Force II&nbsp;</em>was pretty damned good, too, and there was almost a Looking Glass game based on the franchise in the mid-90s! Clearly German publisher Daedalic is hoping to capture a little of the same magic with its announcement of <em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em>, a “story-based survival strategy game” set on board the spaceship lost on the other side of the galaxy.</p> <p>With some very hefty&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>&nbsp;vibes, <em>Star Trek Voyager: </em><em>Across the Unknown</em> (<em>VATU</em>) is played on a sublimely lovely cutaway view of the side of Voyager, presented as if on a&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em> display screen. We’ll be captaining the ship as it explores “12 vast sectors” of the Delta Quadrant, the farthest point in the galaxy from our own Alpha territory. This involves managing the ship’s systems and crew, doing all that good&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em> diplomacy, and facing a bunch of moral decisions that will apparently shape how you experience your run through the game. And yes, run through, because this is intended to be replayed,&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>-style, with the ship rearranging its layout and apparently even being “re-imagined” based on the path you take through the quadrant.</p> <p>The trailer, which mostly features lovely images of the USS Voyager swishing and swooping around in space, gives an incredibly brief glimpse of the game itself, which seems a bit of an odd shame given how lovely it looks when you see it. Also, note that somehow Daedalic doesn’t seem to have been able to license the original theme tune, which is very odd.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Announcement Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-0brgSYDEM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>So why&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>? For those who failed to become stranded in the Delta Quadrant in 1995, this was the third ’90s <em>Trek</em> series, starting when&nbsp;<em>The Next Generation</em> had come to an end, and midway through the run of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. However, it quickly separated itself (mostly) from the overlapping storylines of those shows by having the fancy new ship leave DS9 to head to the Badlands to investigate the naughty actions of Starfleet rebels, the Marquis. Except, when it gets to them it gets attacked by some wobbly space wave and finds the remains of its crew, and the remains of the Marquis members, flung across the galaxy to completely uncharted space. The two opposing halves have to form a functioning crew and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(TV_series)"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> cartoon-style, endlessly try to find their way home.</p> <p>Given that the adventures all took place far from Starfleet and thus Voyager was unable to be aided by other friendly ships in the faction, it does make sense to use the show for your <em>FTL</em>-like. On the other hand, though, you’re limiting your audience to people who remember a 30-year-old TV show. Yes, I know <em>you</em> remember it, and you’re thinking, “How can anyone not remember&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>?! It had Seven of Nine in it!” But let me assure you that nearly everyone born in the last 30 years is wondering why you’re shouting out numbers with that creepy look in your eyes. “This game isn’t about nostalgia,” says the game’s director at developer gameXcite (that’s the one time I’ll capitalize their studio name as they want us to), in a press release promoting the game based on the decades-old license loved by nerds in their 40s and 50s. “It’s about giving players the conn and letting them chart their own course through the unknown.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619163">© Daedalic</figcaption></figure> <p>Which then does rather raise the next big oddity. Gives us the conn? But shouldn’t Captain Janeway have the conn? The descriptions of the game that have appeared so far seem very ambiguous about this, especially as it does seem to be using the original crew as characters.</p>

 <p>The big selling point here are some very grand promises to let you rewrite the story of <em>Voyager</em> quite significantly. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">game’s description on Steam</a> suggests it’ll be granting all manner of “what if?” scenarios, including the consequences of Voyager adding Borg technology to its systems as it attempts to recover from the initial disaster. “Did you ever wonder what would have happened had Captain Janeway decided differently?” asks the blurb. “If an important crew member had followed a different path? Or what the outcome would have been had the crew of the <i>U.S.S. Voyager</i> embraced Borg technology to increase their chances of survival?” Uh, no, but I can if you want.</p> <blockquote><p>“Wonder no more: <i>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</i>&nbsp;allows players to take control and shape the journey of the&nbsp;<i>U.S.S. Voyager</i> as they want. Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions! The game features rogue-like elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don’t react accordingly.”</p></blockquote> <p>There are also promises of ship-to-ship combat and away missions, although again it’s not yet entirely clear whether the latter will be under your direct control, or play out as an off-screen event whose outcome is based on the team you selected and the orders you gave. Combat, however, is a bit clearer. “From the bridge, you give commands for offensive and defensive maneuvers, targeting enemy ship systems and using special weaponry,” we’re told. “And even during ship combat, the individual skills of your crew members come into play: Assign battle stations to crew who bring precious skills to the table and trigger them in crucial moments to maximize your combat effectiveness.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619164">© Daedalic</figcaption></figure> <p>This all sounds very ambitious, and I’ve certainly been burned&nbsp;<em>far&nbsp;</em>too many times by games that promise wish-fulfillment variety when what they really mean is a different icon appears on the screen. I’m also a smidge concerned that the team behind it have previously only made a trio of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix"><em>Asterix</em></a>-themed products, making this a big step forward. Still, the early footage looks incredible.</p> <p>Right, so what “what if?” scenarios would I like to see for <em>Voyager</em>? I want to do a run where we continue Janeway and Paris’s post-evolution relationship as lizards, where we see them raise their young together and learn how this form is superior to their paltry pre-warp-10 human incarnations. I want one where the crew never brings on Seven of Nine and so people remember <em>Voyager</em> for anything other than there being a pretty robot lady with big boobs. And I want to do one where, on the first encountering of Q, they just tell him to stop fucking around and send them home, and he agrees, and that’s that.</p> <p>There’s no release date yet, but hopefully we’ll soon get some footage of the game actually being played.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview-tt-games-seem-to-be-cooking-again.1277247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight was easily one of the biggest reveals for Gamescom 2025. Fortunately, Insider Gaming had the chance to try the preview build of the upcoming LEGO Batman game at the event, and here are our early impressions on the preview build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight took the audience by storm at Opening Night Live, showcasing the Caped Crusader in a brand-new light, featuring iconic moments from his cinematic and comic universes while adding the beloved LEGO touch.&nbsp;It features a vast, open-world Gotham City and a narrative experience that begins with Batman’s origins and culminates in his transformation into a living legend. </p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-arkham-but-in-lego">It’s Arkham, But in LEGO</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The preview build at Gamescom allowed players to take on the roles of Batman and Commissioner Gordon as they worked together to take down crime and explore Gotham City. Both characters were unique in their functional abilities, with Batman more attuned to hand-to-hand combat, whereas Gordon focused on ranged attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both combat and movement styles are unique for the characters, each having two side abilities to choose from: Batman has a batarang that can stun enemies and the batclaw, which can grapple enemies. Gordon, on the other hand, has two types of guns: one that shoots pellets and the other that glues the enemy into a mold.&nbsp;The game also features a variety of gadgets that aid in puzzle solving; however, we have yet to see them in action. </p>



<p>The combat takes huge inspiration from the Arkham games, featuring various types of unique takedowns, stealth mechanics, and even a dodge ability that lets you vault over your enemies. Vast hordes of enemies will surround players during most situations, and they are spread across the city, breaking all kinds of laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even for a preview build, gameplay feels solid, and the developers have done a great job in finalizing the combat and traversal mechanics, allowing you to really get into the shoes of Batman.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-gotham-city-is-the-place-to-be">LEGO Gotham City is the Place to Be</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://legobatmangame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TT Games</a> has also successfully captured the essence of Gotham City. The dark and gritty vibe is on point. Moreover, there are various ways to traverse the city, including batmobiles, gliding, batclaws, and more. Just like the Arkham games, players can perch over rooftops, use the focus bar to build momentum, and transition straight into a glide to explore the city from the heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world itself is pretty extensive, not only featuring iconic locations that you may remember from the comics and the movies, but also featuring a plethora of puzzles spread across the city. Players have a lot to do in the game even when they aren’t playing the story mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts </h2>



<p>Overall, my early impressions of the game are that the developers are doing many things the right way. The gameplay and exploration are on point, and I was left wanting more as soon as my time was up. Now all we need to see is how TT games approach the story, different levels, and characters for the final build. However, given their current situation, it seems highly promising and has massive potential.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When you first boot up Okomotive's latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/herdling-review-companion-quest/1900-6418398/" data-ref-id="1900-6418398">Herdling</a>, it may seem like the mystical vistas you encounter are something out of fantasy. But that’s not the case. The development team drew inspiration from hikes they took while creating the game.</p><p dir="ltr">“We went on a few hikes in the Swiss mountains, before and while developing Herdling," Herdling creative director Don Schmocker tells GameSpot via email. "From Medels to the Suretta Lakes, three picturesque mountain lakes located close to the Swiss and Italian border, or up one of the better-known Swiss mountains, Mount Rigi. They were always inspiring and got us away from our computers for a bit."</p><p dir="ltr">Hikes along the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/switzerland/grisons/splugen-surettaseen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Suretta Lakes</a> and up <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/switzerland/lucerne/rigi-panorama-trail" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mount Rigi</a> inspired Herdling, a magical adventure where players guide strange, mythical creatures across magical mountain landscapes. The team’s goal was to capture the feeling of wandering and exploring while herding--and to make it feel natural rather than mechanical.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553984" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553984"></a><figcaption>The mountains may be the most realistic element of Herdling</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">“When we decided to develop Herdling, we were intrigued by the fantasy of guiding strange animals through the mountains,” Schmocker added. “But we knew that the first thing we had to figure out was the original herding gameplay. We built several prototypes to try out different approaches. Some were more direct but felt too mechanical, and some were too unintuitive. Another problem we needed to solve was making the animals feel natural and animal-like, without interfering with players’ intentions.”</p><p dir="ltr">Okomotive eventually found a gameplay style that felt fluid and intuitive. To keep movement smooth, the team looked to games like The Pathless, Journey, and even racing games like SSX--making sure herding never felt like an escort mission or a puzzle.</p><p dir="ltr">The game’s visuals also mix fantastical and real-world influences. The Calicorn creatures are inspired by Bulgarian Kukeri costumes, while films like Pan’s Labyrinth, Spirited Away, and The Last Guardian informed the magical tone of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">“In the FAR games we use environmental storytelling to tell big stories about the world and past events,” Schmocker said. “In Herdling we tell a more personal story that’s centered around protagonist Via and the herd.”</p><p>The game can be completed in a few afternoons--roughly three to five hours--but you might take a little more time exploring its mix of mountain-inspired landscapes. The journey within Herdling resonated with GameSpot's Mark Delaney. He called it a game about finding one's purpose.</p><p>"It's a journey I'll remember for a long time thanks to its depiction of animals as unique individuals who, very much like us, are chiefly seeking love and safety," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/herdling-review-companion-quest/1900-6418398/" data-ref-id="1900-6418398">GameSpot review.</a> "It was one of my favorite experiences in video games to help them find that safety and to feel that love."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Gibson added, "The most interesting thing now is that we can add to it next. We've got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."</p><p>Both Gibson and Pellen stop short of detailing the nature of these ambitions, but consider the Silksong carrot back at the end of the stick. You thought we were done just because we have a release date now?</p><p>It seems that much like Hollow Knight before it, Silksong will be a major focus of Team Cherry for a long time. Despite initially launching in the early months of 2017, Hollow Knight was followed up by four pieces of free DLC, all of which added significant content by way of additional interactions with characters, new quests, boss fights, and music, as well as optimizations and quality-of-life fixes.</p><p>News of Silksong DLC invites some speculation. Like, for example, should players expect a similar number of post-launch expansions as the first game? Considering the lengthy development period for it, is the development team likely to keep adding to Silksong rather than immediately moving to another game? Will Silksong's expansions also be released for free?</p><p>The most ironic piece of this news is, of course, that Silksong was planned as the fifth and final piece of DLC for Hollow Knight before it eventually ballooned into its own game. By 2019, it had transformed into a full-fledged sequel, and the rest, as you all likely know, is history.</p><p>Now though, at long last, Silksong is actually right around the corner. It is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">currently playable at Gamescom</a> and is now officially dated for September 4, which is just weeks away. Let's just hope that DLC doesn't take cues from the main game and take a lifetime to arrive.</p>

            <p>In case you hadn't heard the many summon circle participants crying out in joy that their prayers had finally been answered, or the klaxons sounding far and wide, let me tell you the good news - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">Silksong has a release date</a>!</p>
<p>The much anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> follow up is set to release across Switch consoles, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, including on Xbox Game Pass in just two weeks time, on 4th September.</p>
<p>On the ground here at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, applause could be heard as the date was announced, so of course I headed out into the fray to get some first hand reactions from those waiting in line for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> demo. What I got was a mix of relief, giddy anticipation and, for one person, a little bit of stress.</p>

<p>First up, there was the lovely young gentleman who had somehow missed the news until I asked his thoughts about Silksong's release date.</p>
<p>"Wait, what?! It's coming out? Okay, I am pretty freaking excited. This is crazy, because everybody was waiting for it, and now it's so soon! Two weeks? Ahhh, I am very happy," he beamed. "I played the first Hollow Knight a few years back, and it was the first metroidvania I played, and it made me fall in love with the genre, and since then I have played many more metroidvanias and it's all because of Hollow Knight. I loved it - I hope this is going to be even better!</p>
<p>"You've just made my day."</p>

<p>"I am quite surprised it is so soon," another Gamescom attendee told me. "I've been waiting just as impatiently as everyone else."</p>
<p>"I played the original in 2017, and since then - I've been waiting!!" another added. "It's two weeks, that's wild!! When [Team Cherry] said it's this year, I thought maybe at Christmas, but… two weeks!"</p>
<p>"I am sooo, so so so surprised it is coming out so soon," I was again told. "Ahh, I can't wait!!"</p>
<p>A very eloquent chap of 12 years old told me he had been waiting for this moment for four years. "I loved the first one," he said. "It's super nice." He will "definitely" be getting Silksong day one, he informed me, with this being the game he is most excited about.</p><p>Another chap waiting in the queue for Silksong's demo told me that while he was both "surprised" and "excited", but also already feeling pretty stressed about managing to play all the games he wants to. "It's coming out right between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. I want to play all of those games! But, I will play Silksong day one," he laughed.</p>
<p>"I have been waiting for years [he gestured to his shirt which shows Hornet looking back at me]. It's absolutely great news, I have been waiting for so long."</p>
<p>Are you just as excited as this lot?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Silksong news, it has not, in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">taken so long to release due to being stuck in development hell</a>. Rather, hype skyrocketed sales of the original game to give Team Cherry financial freedom.</p>
<p>Our Dom also braved the Gamescom queues to go hands-on with Silksong, and came away impressed with its high challenge and how Hornet's movement differs from the original game's Knight.

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the most brilliant things about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a> was the way it dropped you into the wilderness to fend for yourself as <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/02/pokemon-legends-arceus-alpha-pokemon-how-to-catch.html">wild monsters tried to kill you</a>. It was a surprising deviation from the franchise’s typically chill vibe that complemented the game’s story about how <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22916203/pokemon-legends-arceus-dangerous-mystery/">humans once lived in constant fear of pokémon</a>. <em>Arceus</em>’ mild horror elements felt like something that might not carry over to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, but the new game’s latest trailer makes it seem like Nintendo wants to keep the scares coming.</p><p>Today, The Pokémon Company dropped another <em>Legends: Z-A </em>trailer that highlights a new(ish) pokémon and suggests some things about the game’s story. Titled “The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident,” the trailer follows as two young trainers wander into an abandoned building somewhere <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">in Lumiose City in the middle of the night</a>. Something is clearly off about the building between its strange scent, the weird noises coming from it, and the puddles of corrosive liquid that the trainers keep seeing as they check out the place. None of that is enough to convince the kids to turn back. But when the trainers venture upstairs, they’re shocked to see a man being attacked by what appears to be a gigantic pitcher plant that bounces around and spews the purple ooze that’s been splattered all over the walls.</p><p>That creature, of course, is a <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Victreebel_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Victreebel</a> that’s undergone Mega Evolution, a game mechanic that first appeared in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em>. According to <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Mega-Evolution-of-the-Flycatcher-Pokemon-VictreebelMega-VictreebelAppe">a press release</a>, Mega Victreebel’s new form increases the amount of sweet-smelling acid it contains so much that the liquid is prone to spilling out. That detail kind of explains why Mega Victreebel resembles a bag that has been cinched at the top — it’s literally overflowing with dangerous ooze that’s meant to lure in unsuspecting prey before it gobbles up and dissolves them. But the trailer also shows that this Mega Victreebel is just a pokémon that belongs to a construction worker who was only trying to train his partner without bothering other people.</p><p>Setting aside its first-person, <em>Resident Evil</em>-inspired tone, what’s interesting about the trailer is the way it suggests that <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>might involve missions similar to “The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident” where players are tasked with investigating strange goings-on around Lumiose. We already knew that the game would once again feature wild monsters capable of attacking players as well as their pokémon. But this new trailer really hammers home how much <em>Z-A </em>is going to be a game about people figuring out how to live in a city that’s meant to be hospitable to humans and pokémon alike. It makes sense that that process might involve some danger given how most pokémon have destructive powers. And that danger is probably going to make <em>Legends: Z-A </em>feel like another wild ride when it drops in October.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/763401/pokemon-legends-za-mega-victreebel#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/763401/pokeon-legends-za-mega-victreebel]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong-devs-explain-why-it-took-so-long-%E2%80%98if-i-don%E2%80%99t-stop-drawing-this-is-going-to-take-15-years-to-finish%E2%80%99.1277181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">will arrive seven years after the first game</a>. Why? That’s what fans have been impatiently wondering for a while now. According to the developers at Team Cherry, there was no major drama or development snafus. Seven years is just how long it takes to make the Metroidvania Soulslike sequel to what some fans regard as one of the best games of the last decade.</p> <p>“I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,” cofounder Ari Gibson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a new interview</a>. “Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’”</p> <p>What began as DLC for 2017’s surprise Steam hit <em>Hollow Knight</em> eventually morphed into a full-fledged standalone game. Team Cherry officially revealed <em>Silksong</em> would become a sequel in 2019. The developers told <em>Bloomberg</em> they wanted to keep their team size small so as not to disrupt the creative flow responsible for the first game. But growing scope—bigger boss fights, multiple towns, a denser world—meant it would take even longer to finish, especially if it would exude the same level of tight controls, visual polish, and world-building mystery of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p>

 <p>When Microsoft doubled down in 2022 on the promise that <em>Silksong</em> would arrive within the year, that was apparently the actual goal. “We did genuinely believe that was the case,” cofounder William Pellen confirmed. “There was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.” The team just kept biting off more than it could chew while also calmly ignoring all of the online chatter about unhinged fans.</p> <p>“I think we’re always underestimating the amount of time and effort it’ll take us to achieve things,” Gibson told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “It’s also that problem where, because we’re having fun doing it, it’s not like, ‘It’s taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.’ It’s, ‘This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let’s perpetuate this with some new ideas.’”</p> <p>It seems to have helped that the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> has now sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry revealed. <em>Silksong</em> is already Steam’s most-wishlisted game. If it lives up to even a fraction of the hype, the team won’t be forced to release their next game any time soon, either.</p>

              <p>Welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we have information about the future of <em>Forza</em>, news about Sony and EVO, and some fresh details about that new Lego Batman game. Also: get excited about The Gorillaz coming to <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <h2>The Gorillaz are coming to <em>Fortnite</em></h2> <p>New leaks seem to indicate that the famous animated band The Gorillaz will be the next <em>Fortnite Festival</em> headlining act. This means the characters from the band will appear in-game as skins and some of their music will be added to <em>Festival</em>, too. The last few artists haven’t been very exciting, but bringing in the Gorillaz has my attention. Expect Epic to start teasing this next week or sooner, and then for the Gorillaz to arrive on August 26 when the current Bruno Mars season wraps up.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GORILLAZ x FORTNITE INFO — AUGUST 26</p> <p>• 2D &amp; Noodle are most likely Item Shop<br>• Murdoc &amp; Russel are Festival Pass (Official Look) <a href="https://t.co/SnbqIstFTZ">pic.twitter.com/SnbqIstFTZ</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1958249205195251776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>The next <em>Forza Horizon</em> game is likely set in Japan</h2> <p>There’s been a lot of rumors that the next <em>Forza Horizon</em> open-world racing game would be set in Japan and well, here’s some evidence that the speculation is probably correct. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-location-leaked-by-car-import-company-fans-believe">As reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, in a now-deleted social media post, a car importing company shared an image that claimed someone working on <em>Forza</em> came by to take scans and photos of a car made by Japanese manufacturer Kei. The post claimed this would be used in the next <em>Forza Horizon</em> game. Oops! But hey, a new <em>Forza Horizon</em> set in Japan sounds great.</p>

 <h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is making the leap to Xbox</h2> <p>During Xbox’s Gamescom stream, it was announced that <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is coming to Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass on September 17. I’m a big fan of this <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-like shoot ’em up and play it all the time on my Steam Deck, so I’m excited to play it on my Xbox and earn some achievements.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor releases Sept 17th on Xbox and coming to Game Pass <a href="https://t.co/ZQgVQeK8Is">pic.twitter.com/ZQgVQeK8Is</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1958524899758113136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>That new <em>Lego Batman</em> game will have Riddler trophies to find</h2> <p>That newly announced <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> game looks to be the <em>Arkham</em> sequel fans have wanted for years now. And adding to that feeling is the confirmation from folks who have played the game at Gamescom that there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/sbOodsqBSmk?t=472">Riddler trophies and puzzles spread around the game’s open world</a> waiting for players to find and collect them all. Good luck with that.</p> <h2>Analogue delays its fancy N64 console…again</h2> <p>Analogue’s fancy, 4K Nintendo 64 console has been delayed again. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html">On August 20, the company announced</a> that the highly anticipated retro games machine had been delayed again until Q4 2025. The $250 Analogue 3D was previously delayed in March and July. Hopefully, this new delay is the last one, and we’ll get our hands on this cool-looking console later this year.</p> <h2>Sony is selling its stake in the fighting game event EVO</h2> <p>Around four years ago, Sony spent a lot of money to buy up popular fighting game tournament EVO. It was weird! And in the years since, it’s remained a weird thing. And now, that era is ending as <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145596/sony-sells-evo-co-ownership-nodwin-gaming?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Sony announced on August 21</a> that it was selling its ownership stake to co-owner NODWIN Gaming. Sony will remain a sponsor of future EVO events.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923"><em>Elden Ring</em> is struggling to run on the Switch 2</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-the-game-announced-will-feature-multiplayer-and-solo-story-mode-2000618930">Michael Myers is back in a newly announced <em>Halloween</em> game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-layoffs-2k-games-delay-2000618914"><em>Bioshock 4</em> studio gutted by recent layoffs</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Militsioner - Official Public Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c18RAdJs5Iw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>“This actually made me Pre-Order [sic] Battlefield 6.” </strong>That sentiment is seemingly felt among a number of players as the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 gameplay reveal trailer is being hammered by the community, with many claiming they’re moving to EA’s Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two days after its reveal</a>, the Black Ops 7 trailer sits at just 42,000 likes despite having over 28 million views. That puts it at one of the lowest-liked reveal trailers in the franchise’s history. Moving to the dislikes shows even more bad news, at least on the surface. </p>



<p>Thanks to a browser extension, it shows that the Black Ops 7 gameplay trailer has 235,000 downvotes as of publishing. And it only seems to be growing in number.  For comparison purposes, the Black Ops 6 reveal trailer has just 5,452 dislikes after more than a year while the gameplay reveal is no longer available on the official Call of Duty YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Moving to the comments shows a drastically different story. Many of the top comments mention Battlefield 6, and how players are more excited or moving over to the game.</p>



<p>The previously mentioned comment about pre-ordering Battlefield 6 sits at 108,000 likes. Another comment  that says <strong>“From a COD player- thank you for making it easy to choose Bf6”</strong> has 41,000 likes.</p>

                <p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 was properly revealed, a perhaps-unsurprising reveal was the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a> would be coming to the platform. The console is more powerful than the original Switch after all, though there was still the question of how it might run given just how big Elden Ring is. Well, as it currently stands, performance might be quite bad, as a demo for the port of the game at Gamescom is reportedly running at a low frame rate. Not only that, but Bandai Namco staff running the demo apparently weren't letting people record footage of the game either.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM">Nintendo Life shared a video</a> featuring video producer Felix Sanchez in which he detailed his experience with Elden Ring on Switch 2. "It's really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible," Sanchez explained, also claiming that no gameplay could be recorded through direct capture or even over the shoulder.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Of course, you're never going to see the light of this--maybe it will just release in that state, but I can’t imagine they will do that. It was like playing Ocarina of Time. It was like 20 frames per second. Sometimes I was like, 'This has dropped [to] 15 frames per second.'"</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that Sanchez played the game in handheld mode, and during the tutorial section of the game it ran well for the most part, but it was when he arrived at the full open-world section where performance nosedived.</p><p dir="ltr">As it stands, Elden Ring doesn't currently have a Switch 2 release date, though it is supposed to be releasing this year. That does give it some time to improve upon these reported performance issues, but you'll have to wait until the game is out to see how the Switch 2 really handles it.</p>

            <p>Earlier today, Team Cherry finally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">announced a release date for its long-awaited Hollow Knight sequel Silksong</a>. After seven years, it will finally be out next month.</p>
<p>Yet contrary to what you may believe, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> hasn't been in development hell for that time. Instead, Team Cherry's developers were just having too much fun making it.</p>
<p>In fact, sales of the original game have skyrocketed from 2.8m copies to 15m copies since Silksong's announcement in 2019, giving the studio the financial freedom to take their time.</p>

<p>What was originally intended as an expansion to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> soon ballooned into its own game, with the studio announcing in February 2019 it would be a full sequel.</p>
<p>"Even at that point we were recognising that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of Hollow Knight or probably exceed it," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "And then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later."</p>
<p>"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson added. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p>
<p>That 12m rise in sales of the original Hollow Knight is extraordinary. Somehow, Team Cherry inadvertently created the ultimate hype machine: hype for the sequel led to sales for the original, which meant it could take longer to develop, which fed the hype even more due to silence, which became a meme, which meant it could take even longer.</p>
<p>"We're very lucky in that regard," said Gibson. "I don't ever really think about it that much. Maybe that's the privilege of it."</p>
<p>No strict deadline and a flood of financial income meant Team Cherry could take its time. It's in stark contrast to so many other studios at the moment hell-bent on chasing trends and generating cash in the face of rising development costs, which has inevitably resulted in the mass layoffs across the industry in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>By contrast, Team Cherry has remained lean. What's more, it's spent the past seven years enjoying development.</p>
<p>"We've been having fun," said Gibson said. "This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It's nice to make fun things.</p>
<p>"We're very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable," Gibson continued. "Not exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that's very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone's off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person's laughed, and that's enough."</p>

<p>"You're always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss," added co-founder William Pellen. "That stuff's so nice. It's for the sake of just completing the game that we're stopping. We could have kept going."</p>
<p>Add to that a desire for exceptional polish, and it's easy to see how development could have continued even longer.</p>
<p>"I think we're always underestimating the amount of time and effort it'll take us to achieve things," said Gibson. "It's also that problem where, because we're having fun doing it, it's not like, 'It's taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.' It's, 'This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let's perpetuate this with some new ideas.'"</p><p>"There's a level of finish that has to be met throughout the entire game," added Pellen. "All the way the systems interact, all the hidden work that pops up later on. It's multiplicative. As you add stuff, the process of tying it all back together just increases."</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Silksong will fully live up to the hype, but with its release date of 4th September it won't be long until we find out. At the least, it follows games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> as a project with a relatively small team and a huge amount of passion finding big success, where so many AAA studios and publishers have stumbled.</p>
