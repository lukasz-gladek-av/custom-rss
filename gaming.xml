		<p>Microsoft and Playground Games have confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> will be launching this autumn, and coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fable - Gameplay Teaser | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4zJJSEm1ag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Featured during the Developer Direct stream, this is really the first good long look that we’ve had at Fable, after years of build up and teasers. From <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/11/richard-ayoade-reintroduces-us-to-fable-by-playground-games/">the giant Richard Ayoade</a> to little snippets of gameplay with a hero wandering through a fantasy city, battling werewolves and goblins, each trailer so far had been rather short. Now we’ve seen a good bit more.</p>
<p>You begin the game as a child, growing up in Briar Hill, which is when your heroic powers first emerge, marking you as Albion’s first hero in a generation. But then your town and all its people are suddenly turned to stone by a stranger. You have to venture out to figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a huge and seamless open world, and it looks gorgeous. At its heart is the capital city of Bowerstone with the huge Fairfax Castle, and all the upper and lower class. To the north, there’s the windswept city of Bloodstone, with two rival gangs vying for power, and the Cult of Shadows.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to pick from a range of character heads, as opposed to having a full character customisation suite, but pair that with tattoos, scars, and a range of outfits to still give yourself an individual look. As in the original game, your playstyle is personalised, blending together melee, ranges and magics. There’s light and heavy combos, building up to slick finishers, while ranged breaks through guard.&nbsp;There’s plenty of returning enemies as well as new ones, like the giant chicken-like cockatrice.</p>
<p>Once again, you can take the game at your own pace, exploring the world. You can buy a house (or all the houses), run a business as a blacksmith or something, marry people, have children, and on and on and on. These are fan-favourite features.</p>
<p>There are more than a thousand people living in this world, getting up, going to work, have hobbies, go to bed, and start it all again. You could even be hiring them, you could be their landlord (or have evicted them). All of these characters are tracked, they have thoughts about you, and they are all fully voiced, and you can talk to them to find out what they think about you.</p>
<p>Morality returns, but it’s not black and white, with a lot of grey areas and subjectivity. Everything you do will earn you a bit of reputation and, again, the people will let you know what they think.</p>
<p>Your choices change the world. Early on you’ll meet Dave – Richard Ayoade – who’s a farmer that manages to grow himself into a giant, and you have to decide what to do about that. If you choose to kill him, then his gigantic corpse will become a fixture of the world and have its impact.</p>
<p>This classic Lionhead RPG series is being revived at Playground Games (better known for their open world arcade racing), but development has naturally taken a good bit longer than has been expected or hoped.</p>
<p>Originally announced way back <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-announce-reveal/">at the start of the generation in 2020</a>, it was three long years before we saw the game next, and then another year after that when the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/fable-gets-another-cinematic-trailer-and-a-release-window/">release was set for 2025</a>. But then in February of last year it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/fable-delayed-2026-new-gameplay-clips/">delayed to 2026</a> with Head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan saying “While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait, and I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team.”</p>
<p>So, does it look like it’s been worth the wait?</p>

<figure data-uuid="b55a908ee0e4b"><a title="Mario Wonder Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b55a908ee0e4b/mario-wonder-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has lifted the lid on a bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a> info today. We got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-arrives-on-switch-2-in-march">new trailer</a> packed with fresh playable characters and challenges, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-is-getting-a-trio-of-new-amiibo">three new amiibo</a>, a closer look at that darn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/mario-wonders-real-talking-flower-sounds-both-charming-and-irritating">'real' Talking Flower</a>, and the all-important release date. We also got a look at the new box art. And it's grim.</p>
<p>Now, look, the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' re-releases have been fighting a losing battle as far as box art is concerned. Those unwieldy titles take up more than enough room themselves, and then they add all of that "Includes the Nintendo Switch game and the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade pack. Upgrade pack also available separately. For details..." at the bottom. But worse than that is the key art 'split', where the old and new designs are slapped together to presumably sell the idea of 'See? This is the same as the one before, but now with a new bit too!'</p>
<p>We saw it used for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>'s physical release, but there's something about the Mario Wonder design that's just rubbing us up the wrong way. We're not sure whether it's the straight line between the two graphics, the busyness of both of them, that giant 'Bellabel Park' icon, or a mixture of everything else, but gosh, it ain't a looker, is it?</p>
<figure data-uuid="8eb7807a63488"><a title="Mario Wonder Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8eb7807a63488/mario-wonder-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, most of us here at Nintendo Life will be playing via an Upgrade Pack (and we'd wager many of you will be in the same boat), so it's unlikely that such an overdesigned cover will ever grace many of our shelves. That said, we can't help but feel like the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' designs — for the re-releases, not the simultaneous launches like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>, we should point out — are getting a bit out of hand now.</p>
<p>Those still keen to pick up a copy can do so on <strong>26th March</strong>. That very same day, Nintendo is launching a trio of Wonder amiibo and the Talking Flower figure, so prepare to splash the cash if you're hoping to catch 'em all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong>, though we knew we'd get a look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/">Fable</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/is-this-nier-beast-of-reincarnation-gameplay-and-soundtrack-immediately-bring-yoko-taros-series-to-mind/">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong>, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-features-secret-fourth-game-says-insider/"><strong>unannounced secret game</strong> was also rumoured</a> to be part of the event. Well, the rumours were correct, as that fourth game was revealed to be <strong>Double Fine's</strong> next project after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/keeper-review-shine-a-light/">Keeper</a></strong>. A "<em>multiplayer pottery party-brawler</em>" called <strong>Kiln</strong>, where you play as a pot looking to smash other pots.</p>



<p>Set to arrive on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 sometime in <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, Kiln is equal parts "<em>creation and destruction</em>" as it's about building and creating pots with your friends, but also about destroying them and each other for the fun of it in brawling game modes, like its introductory mode, <strong>Quench</strong>.</p>



<p>Kiln begins with you as a small, ghost-like figure that has the ability to mould a more secure, tough body out of clay. That means your time in Kiln begins, well, sitting at a kiln, as you spin and form whatever kind of body you can make for yourself out of clay.</p>



<p>"<em>Making pots in real life is really difficult</em>," says <strong>Derek Brand</strong>, the project lead on Kiln at Double Fine, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">in an Xbox Wire blog post</a>. "<em>It takes a lot of practice, and you can get good at it over time, but it is not an easy thing to just jump into. We wanted to make the pot-making super easy and accessible – it’s just a button and a control stick – and you can make any kind of shape you wanted. We wanted people to immediately feel like they’re masters at this craft.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kiln - Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6C11Zmc93-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The kind of pot body you create for yourself will determine what you're able to do when jumping into a brawl with other pots. Everyone gets a basic attack, but pots with different shapes and sizes have different abilities you can lean on to try and ensure you're the one pot left standing without a crack down your side. There are <strong>24 total special attacks</strong> based on the shape and size of the pot you create, meaning there's plenty for you to play around with.</p>



<p>"<em>A little plate which looks like a hockey puck can have a trick shot that will ricochet off multiple enemies. For cup-shaped pots, you have an area-of-effect attack that shoots out popcorn. Or if you make a big cylinder, that can turn into a huge hammer that can slam down and obliterate enemies</em>," the Xbox Wire post explains.</p>

<p>You can also customize your pot far beyond just its shape, with different glazes, finishes, and designs to add, and a whole lobby area where you can practice for future fights, take out pots other players have made for a spin, and a store where you can buy more decorations and designs for your pots called <strong>The Wedge</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>When we’re thinking about the world, we wanted to really incorporate this element of [an] old, ancient technology and art form that has been around forever; we wanted to really lean on that</em>," said Brand. "<em>You start off in this world of Celadon; she’s this deity of creation and destruction. She embodies both of those things. And you’re this little spirit, this little bodiless floating sprite. But within this world, there are other gods that aren’t around, but they have these little floating islands of their old domains, and each map is based off ancient Greek or ancient Egyptian gods.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We gave the old gods their own distinct personalities. For example, Hermes has a map set in his shipping facility, where packages are constantly being sent out and treadmills going back and forth shooting packages you’ll have to avoid. Then there’s Dionysus’ map, which is like a Boogie Lounge, which features a dance floor at its center — if you step onto one of the tiles, you’re forced to dance, creating a dynamic battleground where some players are fighting while others end up dancing</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Kiln will have a beta ahead of its launch if you're keen to try it out, with details on when that'll be coming from Double Fine soon. Like every other game included in today's Developer Direct, it'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass right at launch, and playable through Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>Summer Xbox Game Showcases</strong> usually bring some very interesting, <strong>unexpected announcements</strong> alongside new information on the Xbox blockbusters we have come to know and love over the years. 2025's showcase was no different, as the event introduced us to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong>, an action role-playing game in development by Game Freak, the developer of the Pokémon series.</p>



<p>Although we didn't see much of the game in action in the game's reveal trailer, it was more than enough to show <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">how the game could be a solid action RPG</strong> thanks to its crused protagonist Emma, her canine companion Koo and the verdant world they will have to traverse. And if the game only looked promising, the new look at the game shared during today's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct</a></strong> has only <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reinforced the generally positive opinion </strong>most had about it, with a feel that is markedly <em>NieR</em> in both gameplay and music.</p>



<p>This project represents a massive departure for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Game Freak</strong>, described as a <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"new challenge"</em> by the studio.  <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-developer-direct/"><strong>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 4026</strong></a>, the world has been decimated by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Blight</strong>, a parasitic plant that has wiped out most of the population. </p>



<p>Amidst this ravaged world, <strong>warmth, trust, and loneliness</strong> still manage to shine through, personified by <strong>Emma</strong>, a Sealer who is feared and isolated because she can hunt <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Malefacts</strong>, creatures born from the combination of plant and animal, and seal their blight within her own body. <strong>Her design is a direct reflection of this curse</strong>, as her hair functions as a living vine, a core motif that influences both the world’s visual identity and Emma's traversal and combat abilities.</p>



<p>While the game looks <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">visceral and immersive</strong>, Game Freak hasn't completely abandoned its roots. The combat system features <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">a blend of high-speed actio</strong><strong>n</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">and strategic command</strong> that doesn't look too different from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> series combat system. Emma and Koo have their own <strong>unique abilities</strong> unlocked via dedicated skill trees, and as the bond between them deepens, they unlock more skills to equip as their actions directly influence one another.</p>



<p>In <strong>combat</strong>, once enough power builds up, players can unleash Koo’s attacks via a menu that slows down time, a mechanic that feels like a <strong>clever bridge</strong> from Game Freak’s turn-based history to the action-packed experience of <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>. <strong>Parrying</strong> will also be central to the combat flow, as successful parries allow players to stack beneficial effects via Spirit Stones, rewarding technical execution.</p>



<p>The one feature that seems to stand out, together with the combat mechanics, is <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>'s <strong>atmosphere</strong>. The post-apocalyptic world with a nature flavor, the Golems - the mechanical beings into which humanity transferred its souls that have degraded beyond repair, and the ethereal soundtrack immediately brought the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-automata-genre-bending-every-turn/"><em>NieR </em>series</a></strong> to mind, in the best possible way.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Beast of Reincarnation - Gameplay Overview | Xbox Developer Direct 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ilAwYJaLSKQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although there is surely more to see, the care that Game Freak is pouring into the project is setting Emma’s journey to defeat the Beast of Reincarnation to be one to keep an eye on when the game launches this Summer on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide.</p>

            <p>As the price of RAM, GPUs, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">even SSDs</a> climbs ever higher off the back of AI data centre demand, it's causing a significant price crunch for hardware manufacturers. "It is such a volatile situation at this point in time it is hard to figure out pricing," Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan said in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview">a recent episode of The Verge's Decoder podcast</a>. "I don't know if I can pick a number right now as I speak with you and [be confident in it] by the end of the podcast."</p>
<p>The rapidly increasing prices mean the company are keeping schtum on how much their next round of gaming laptops will cost. "This is something that concerns me," Tan explained. "The RAM prices are going up and we want to be able to make sure our laptops remain affordable and in the reach of gamers out there."</p>
<p>But it wasn't all doom and gloom during the CES podcast recording.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When asked if component prices could hit a level that would force Razer out of the gaming laptop business, Tan said he hoped it wouldn't come to that. "We've seen this happen with the industry multiple times in the past – spikes in pricing. As long as manufacturing kicks in, and we're able to keep up, it's just economics at the end of the day. There is a spike in terms of pricing, we believe that it will come down. What goes up must come down and what goes down goes up too."</p>
<p>So, if you can, even Razer CEO seems to be advising holding off on buying that new gaming laptop for now.</p>
<p>Not that Razer showed off any new gaming laptops at CES this month. Instead, they announced Project Motoko, a pair of camera-fitted, AI-powered headphones that creepily analyse your surroundings as you go about your life, and Project Ava, a holographic AI companion who lives in a tube on your desk and tells you you're looking great, like a sycophantic Zordon – one for the Power Rangers fans out there. All of which was par for the course, when it comes to this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-its-gaming-hardware-contingent-ces-2026-was-a-good-week-to-bury-good-news">AI-seduced trade show</a>.</p>

<p>Razer are far from alone in feeling the pinch of rising component costs. We have seen significant price jumps in components since Valve revealed the Steam Machine last November. As James found, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">even trying to make an estimate of how much Valve's living room PC could cost is a headache</a>. The mini PC is due for release in early 2026, but there is still no hint of a price – only that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-confirm-the-steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-with-similar-specs-rather-than-a-console">Valve won't be eating any of the cost, as console manufacturers do</a>.</p><p>And it's not only hardware makers that are feeling the pinch. The shortages are impacting game developers, too, with Larian revealing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genai-users-larian-forced-to-build-divinity-around-ram-shortage-caused-by-genai">they're optimising the early access release of Divinity to account for lower-end PCs</a>. Traditionally, they would make these optimisations later in the game's development.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must buy a new graphics card, though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-in-2026s-component-hellscape-amds-radeon-rx-9070-xt-is-that-rarest-of-things-a-high-end-gpu-thats-still-decent-value">James was impressed by AMD Radeon's  RX 9070 XT</a>. While the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is better at ray tracing, the two GPUs otherwise perform pretty much evenly, despite the $720 Radeon being significantly cheaper than its $900 GeForce rival. Still, maybe hold off a tad longer if you can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over five years after it was first announced, we’ve finally learned a lot more about the next entry in the <em>Fable</em> series. Get ready for a big open world filled with jobs, relationships, monsters, and more. And it arrives this Fall.</p> <p>This new spin on&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, being developed by Playground Games—the same studio behind Xbox’s amazing<em>&nbsp;Forza Horizon</em>&nbsp;series—<a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-is-bringing-back-fable-1844482199">was first announced back in 2020</a>&nbsp;and is being built&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/huh-the-new-fable-runs-on-the-forza-engine-1846833080">using the same tech</a> that powered those open-world driving games. And <em>Fable</em> sounds and looks impressive as seen in Xbox’s new Developer Direct.</p> <p>Playground Games says <em>Fable</em> will feature a fully seamless open world, a first for the series. You’ll be able explore every corner of Albion at your own pace without loading screens. Well, once you get through the game’s opening tutorial, where you start as a kid and have to watch your village be attacked. It is a <em>Fable</em> game, after all. It’s just tradition.</p>

  <p>During the Dev Direct, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/">Playground Games confirmed you’ll be able to customize your character’s face and clothing</a>. And like in past games, you can interact with villagers and NPCs, even marrying them or kicking them out of houses you own. Yes, you can be a fantasy landlord in <em>Fable</em>. The worst villain of all! Don’t worry, there are jobs that you can do to earn gold and of course, heroic quests to go on via the Hero’s Guild.</p> <p>Apparently, every NPC villager is unique and will react to your wealth, past actions, style, and more. Playground is also promising that the world will react to you in big and small ways. They list one example where a character who uses magic to get massive can be killed or reasoned with, and if you decide to end the giant’s life, his massive corpse will litter the world for the rest of the game. It will even, apparently, lower the property value of nearby homes.</p>

 <p>You won’t just be marrying people, buying houses, and being a terrible landlord. <em>Fable</em> will feature combat that looks similar to other third-person action RPGs. Expect to fight familiar foes, like Balverines&nbsp;and Hobbes, while out exploring Albion. And yes, morality is a big feature in this new reboot of the RPG series, letting you be evil or good.</p>

 <p>This all sounds wild, and looks nice thanks to Playground’s <em>Forza</em>-tech powering the fantasy open world. But I won’t really believe it works until I get my hands on the <em>Fable</em> this Fall when it launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Game Pass, and PC. Though considering how many times it’s been delayed before, I’m also not convinced this RPG arrives before next year.</p>

<p>Fable fans can finally count down to the long-awaited release of the next game in the franchise after the release window was announced during the Xbox Developer Direct on January 22.</p>



<p>Developed by Playground Games, the new Fable is a reboot for the franchise, releasing a whopping 16 years after Fable III, and, after previous delays, a new release window has finally been announced.</p>







<h2 id="h-fable-release-window-announced">Fable Release Window Announced</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>During Xbox’s January 2026 Developer Direct, Playground Games announced that Fable will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC in Autumn 2026. As previously announced, Fable will be available day one with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was confirmed that Fable will be available on PlayStation 5, and the release window will be the same as on other platforms, meaning that PlayStation players won’t have to wait longer for a release, unlike another Playground Games title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p>



<p>Fable was previously slated for release in 2025, but was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed back to a 2026 window in February</a> last year, when Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan said the title was “definitely worth the wait” and is the “most beautifully realized version of Albion” that players have ever seen.</p>



<p>The Fable reboot was officially announced in 2020, though gamers had to wait until 2023 to see the first proper trailer, and it’s been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride since then due to the hefty delay. Finally, though, the end is now in sight.</p>

            <link>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/fable-launches-this-fall-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc</link>
            <guid>1413544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Is this a full reboot of the entire series, or does it sit on the existing <em>Fable</em> timeline?</strong></p><p><strong>Ralph Fulton, Game Director and General <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger:</strong> We’ve always referred to this game as a ‘new beginning’, because one of the things we were convinced of was that we had to reboot the franchise. It’s been a long time since the end of that original trilogy—nearly two generations have passed in video game terms. And those original games are still available to play today, looking even better than they did back then thanks to the wizardry of Backwards Compatibility.</p><p>So, we’ve chosen not to be beholden to the timeline of the original games—the events, the characters—really just to allow ourselves the freedom to build our own Albion and tell our own, new story within it.</p><p>There’s a lot of faithfulness in the way we’ve approached this game—and certainly I think the inspiration of the original trilogy is really clear for everyone to see—but we wanted to make sure that this was a new beginning that would allow us to tell the stories that we wanted to tell.</p><p><strong>How are you balancing making a new game while honoring Lionhead’s work?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> It’s one of the questions that we asked ourselves right at the start: ‘What are the essential components of a <em>Fable</em> game?’ And I don’t mean the features or the locations. I mean conceptually. Really, what is the essence of <em>Fable</em>?</p><p>But one of the things I said to the team was, ‘Look, we’re not Lionhead—we can’t try to make a Lionhead game.’ This has to be Playground game because I’m a really firm believer that the personality and the character of a team is visible in the work they do and the games they make.</p><p>And I think you can see Lionhead in that original trilogy. It would be pointless, I think, for us to try and ape that. And that’s really at the heart of the reboot question, right? It felt imperative to me that this was a reboot because we’re starting again as Playground Games, and making Playground’s <em>Fable</em>.</p><p>And if I’m totally honest, back then I wasn’t entirely sure how ‘faithful’ our <em>Fable</em> game would be to the Lionhead games we love. But as I said during Developer_Direct, I’ve been really pleased to see that this is identifiably a <em>Fable</em> game in lots of different ways.</p><p><strong>So to answer your own question: what is the essence of a <em>Fable</em> game?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> We came up with a bunch of things—the first of which I would say we actually inherited from Lionhead. When we started working on this project, we got a treasure trove of documents from Lionhead that had been in storage.</p><p>Something that I thought was just brilliantly succinct was one of the documents, which said: ‘<em>Fable</em> is Fairytale, not Fantasy’—which is just super neat.</p><p>I guess our interpretation of what that means is that fairytale and fantasy probably exist on opposite ends of a spectrum. I think we all know what fantasy is—it’s The Witcher, it’s Skyrim, it’s Lord of the Rings, it’s Game of Thrones. And I think tonally it’s quite grand, it’s sweeping, it’s geopolitical, it’s serious. You know, you can almost picture the color palette of fantasy.</p><p>And then fairytale exists right at the opposite end of that spectrum. Fairytales are intimate, they’re small stories about regular people; they’re not grand and sweeping, they’re very personal and whimsical and ultimately, they deal with what happens when magic touches the lives of ordinary folks. And also they have this kind of moral component to them.</p><p>And I think that is a brilliant description of what <em>Fable</em> really is—it runs through our art style, it runs through our world building. We’ve really executed against that fairytale idea in every part of the game that we’re building.</p><p>And then <em>Fable</em> has this other tonal pillar, if you like, which is Britishness. You can’t mention <em>Fable</em> without mentioning that it’s quintessentially British. It’s cliche, but it’s kind of true. And I don’t think that’s just because Albion is obviously medieval England through a lens, and it’s not just because the cast have British accents.</p><p>I think—in the original games and in our game as well—there’s a very British sensibility, a tone of voice, a way of thinking about things. And it goes to the humor as well—that British humor that the original games used to such great effect is an absolutely essential component of our game as well.</p><p>And then it’s about choice and consequence. We call that freedom—in the sense that it’s the freedom to make the choices you want. It’s the freedom to be the kind of hero you want to be. It’s a freedom to go where you want and do what you want. And those things wrap up into what people really remember about the original <em>Fable</em> games, and therefore it became imperative for us to include that ability to make choices. Our game is packed full of choices. But also, to see the consequences of that and to live with the consequences of the choices you make.</p><p>So for us—at, like, DNA level—that’s what <em>Fable</em> games are, including our own.</p><p><strong>How does this story begin—what’s the quest you’re following?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> In classic <em>Fable</em> fashion you begin the game as a child. We absolutely love that. And that’s when—and it’s not a spoiler to say—your heroic powers emerge. You realize you’re a hero, and everything changes for you from that point. And from there we do a time jump, and we rejoin you in Briar Hill, your starter village, in adulthood—and for the rest of the game you will play as a mature adult in their prime.</p><p>And it’s then that the real events of the game start to unfold. The inciting incident, the thing that’s the catalyst for your story, is what happens to your grandma and to the village that you grew up in—everyone in the village is turned to stone by a mysterious stranger.</p><p>You’re suddenly alone in this village and forced really to go out into the world, and your motivation is to try and figure out what happened to them and try and reverse it. The only clue you have is this mysterious stranger, who you really only caught a glimpse of at the start of the game. Finding the stranger seems like the only thread you can pull, the only lead you can follow. So that’s how we get you out into the world.</p><p>And there is one last thing that your grandmother says to you: she mentions Bowerstone, the Heroes’ Guild, and how it’s at the Heroes’ Guild that the great heroes live and, if you ever need help, they’re the people to go to. So there’s a soft implication that you should head for the Heroes’ Guild, and maybe there’s help that they can give you.</p><p>But the nature of our game is that as soon as you leave your village, you can go pretty much anywhere. It’s truly open world, so the world is yours to explore. And we’ve written the story so that although there are stakes—your grandmother, your village—there’s no ticking bomb.</p><p>There’s nothing forcing you along the path, because we want to allow the player the permission to just go and do something else in the game. You could go to the most northerly village in Albion, get a job, settle down and get married if you want. The story will wait for you, which I think is really important with the really rich side activities that <em>Fable</em> games come with.</p><p><strong>How does the open world work? Are you ‘level gating’, or encouraging people to go to places in a certain order?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> Right from the start of the project, we’ve always felt it was important that the player can go wherever they want, from the moment you leave your village and venture out into Albion for the first time.</p><p>Even if we know the majority will do the sensible thing—you know, ‘I’ve got to save my grandma!’– we know there are a bunch of players who are going to be like, ‘OK, I’m going to go and see what this world is about.’</p><p>We want to accommodate them, probably more than accommodate them. We want to make sure that they have fun, exciting, immersive things to do, wherever they choose to go in the world. So we took that as the sort of North Star.</p><p>And then we built progression and leveling and difficulty balancing around that. I don’t want to go north and then find that there’s an area I can’t go into because I’m not a sufficient level.</p><p>We’ll talk more about levelling and progression at a future date, but you should know that being able to go to any one of the settlements in the world and have fun things to do there was imperative to us. And so we shaped our progression around that requirement.</p><p><strong>How are you approaching combat?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> We’re taking the original game’s mix of melee, ranged, and magic—‘Strength, Skill, and Will’—and turning it into what we call style-weaving combat. We wanted to create a combat system which was fluid enough to allow you to really frictionlessly, seamlessly swap from melee to ranged to magic, without even a frame’s delay on it.</p><p>You should be able to strike with a sword and then hurl a fireball in a smooth movement. So that’s what we’ve set out to achieve with combat.</p><p>The combat scenarios that you’re going to find in our game are often about groups of enemies—and usually a tactical mix of enemies who will force you into choosing how you use your ranged, your melee, and your magic to crowd control, and to pick them off, and really to navigate the particular combat challenge that a particular set of enemies presents to you.</p><p>And there is still ample variety within those styles to allow you to pick the kind of fighter you want to be. You can opt for big damage spells, you can opt for tactical crowd control spells, you can go super precise or really blunt force with your melee weapons—it’s up to you.</p><p>You can still self-express when you’re in combat in our game, but it is all about cycling through and tactically using the different options available to you.</p><p><strong>It looks like there are emergent elements to combat—we see a Hobbe accidentally hit one of his own companions, and enemy weak spots that can cause specific reactions. Is that built into how you play?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> Very much so. All of our enemies have strengths and weaknesses, and part of the fun of combat is figuring how to exploit them using the different weapons and abilities you’ve equipped yourself with. And obviously that sort of compounds when you’ve got multiple enemies in the same encounter and you’re trying to marshal all of them and find the best way through it.</p><p>That Hobbe that accidentally killed his pal in the video just happened by accident when we were capturing from the build. We thought we’d keep it in because it’s funny, and very much in keeping with that fan-favorite enemy.</p><p>But yeah, keeping in as much of that kind of friendly fire stuff as possible always adds a little bit of chaos and a lot of humor to combat. And that’s, I guess, one of the questions we’ve asked ourselves a lot: if humor is important to <em>Fable</em>, how does it manifest in combat—an inherently serious pursuit?</p><p>So I think those fairytale creatures have a ton of personality and thus, you know, a bunch of humor about them. And there’s a slapstick element to some of them as well.</p><p><strong>How has the classic <em>Fable</em> morality system changed?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> To take it right back to the start, morality was always such an important part of the original trilogy. Even the box art was really about that dichotomy of good and evil. So we’ve talked about morality a great deal on this project. I think that original trilogy is inextricably linked with the concept of good and evil—but I think morality in video games has moved on in the intervening period.</p><p>How we think about morality in the world today has really informed how we wanted to represent it as a game system in this game. That’s to say: there is no objective good, there is no objective evil. Really it’s just about people’s subjective opinions and what they choose to value in someone else when they make that judgment.</p><p>So, as you saw in Developer_Direct, our version of morality isn’t a sliding scale—we’ve chosen to anchor this around the actions you do, and specifically the things you do in Albion that are witnessed by at least one other person. So, if the things you do are seen by one or more people, you’ll start to earn a reputation for that thing. Obviously, we always use the chicken kicking example, because kicking chickens is classic <em>Fable</em>.</p><p>So if a person sees you kicking a chicken, you will start to get a reputation as a ‘Chicken Chaser’—and if enough people see you do it, or you do it a lot, that reputation will become one of the things you’re known for in that settlement. And people will react to you based on what they think about that particular reputation.</p><p>But, crucially, different people will view that reputation in different ways. Kicking chickens isn’t objectively good or objectively evil in a way everybody will agree on—it comes down to the unique worldview of the NPC what they think of you because of it.</p><p>The same applies for being generous, or being a bigamist, or being a thief, and so on. There are a significant number of these reputations that you can get—you have a word cloud of reputations in every settlement, and they can be different from place to place. It means you can create completely different identities in all the different settlements by being a different person and behaving in different ways.</p><p>That word cloud is how people see you in that particular settlement, and therefore it defines how they react to you in every way they can react—and these peasants are not backwards in telling you what they think as you walk around. That ranges from catcalling you in the street, how likely they are to be romanced by you, if you can marry them, it can even affect prices in shops. There’s a whole systemic trickle-down effect of your reputations to your experience in that particular settlement.</p><p>It’s a more potential-filled system for you to go play with, because you are juggling the things you do, and you’re juggling who sees you do it. You’re deciding whether you’re OK with walking around the town with people thinking that you’re that.</p><p>And if you’re not, then there are things you can go and do about that to redress the balance—or you could just pay the Town Crier to start shouting about a new reputation to overwrite one of the old ones…</p><p>It’s why we say our game will never judge you, but the people of Albion will. Sometimes people have said, ‘Well, that’s the same thing, surely, isn’t it?’ But in a diegetic way, it’s really not, because different people in Albion will have different perspectives on the things you’ve done, which again kind of mirrors the real world.</p><p><strong>The Living Population of NPCs is a fascinating addition—what does that offer the player?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> The Living Population is our cast of over 1,000 NPCs, each with roles, personalities and routines. That whole concept of persistent NPCs, each of whom is unique in a whole bunch of ways that you can go and interact with and mess about with, is incredibly complex.</p><p>When you start working on it, you realize that every settlement has to have enough houses with enough beds, for everyone in the settlement to go and sleep in at the end of the day. It was a fun day when we explained that particular requirement to our environment art team [laughs], but they rose to the challenge like they do with everything.</p><p>In games, you don’t normally have to connect the dots quite so precisely. You know, you’re just building a nice-looking town. But in <em>Fable</em> it also has to be a functional town.</p><p>As an example, early in development we couldn’t work out why one town was so empty during the day. And when we zoomed out into debug mode, it was because NPCs were getting up to go to work, but they lived too far away from their jobs. So, they started walking to work, but didn’t get there before their schedule told them to turn around to go back to bed.</p><p>It’s required a lot of working through, but it pays off because, honestly, as you play the game, you get to know the names of the individual NPCs. You get to know what they like, what they’re looking for in a partner, where they live, where they work, all that kind of cool stuff. It’s an extra dimension to traditional NPCs.</p><p><strong>Does the Living Population tie into the main quest?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> Tying the main quest and the Living Population together in a really overt way didn’t seem like the right way to go, so we’ve deliberately linked them in the lightest possible fashion. You know, there are some times when characters in the main quest will reference your reputations, or the things you’ve done previously—but we never want to force a player to have to go and interact with those things in order to progress the main quest.</p><p>We know there are some players—we call them ‘Bards’—who are just going to play through the main story. They’re going to start at the start, and they’re going to get to the end, and that’s going to be their experience. That’s entirely fine, that’s a totally respectable way to play.</p><p>But there are some players, who we call ‘Architects’, who we know are going to go and mess around with the systems and just see where they can push them, see what they can achieve with it, and we want them to have the freedom to do that at any point as well.</p><p><strong>British humor is a big part of this game—and we’ve seen British comedians in the cast. Can you tell us more about the comedic side?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> British humour manifests in lots of different ways throughout the game. I think the Living Population are really funny because they react to you in a very dry, British way. And yes, it’s in the story and the characters you’ll meet along the way.</p><p>We have an <a title="Companies > amazing [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/amazing">amazing</a> cast in this game—and we’ll talk more about the cast in future. Again, that’s in keeping with the original <em>Fable</em> games. If you go back and read their cast list, it’s a who’s-who. And we felt, OK, that is a challenge for us—we need to go and do something similar. We’ve got a sensational cast of characters that you’ll meet in the main story.</p><p>We were inspired by the incredibly rich variety of British comedies that have been around over the last 20 years like ‘Peep Show,’ ‘The IT Crowd’ and so many others. We started with ‘The Office’, which again started out as quintessentially British, but also travels really, really well. Not just that IP, but a lot of the techniques and the devices that it’s popularized, you know. It’s that really grounded, awkward style of humour which really appeals to us. And the actors who have been in a lot of these shows—and indeed some of whom are in our game—they’re known all over the world.</p><p>The other cool thing about The Office is something we’ve kind of nicked. You’ve maybe seen in our trailers that we have a sort of mockumentary interview style. I think a lot of people assume we just did that for those trailers, but it’s actually a device we use throughout the game.</p><p>I’ve never seen it in games before, but it allows you a way to really neatly tell a joke or drop a little bit of character detail in a way that would feel really clunky in a dialogue, but suddenly feels entirely natural when you do it to ‘camera’.</p><p><strong>There’s lots more we haven’t seen here—can you tease what else we might learn about before the game arrives?</strong></p><p><strong>Fulton:</strong> So one element that we deliberately didn’t touch on much in Developer_Direct is the main story, beyond the opening few quests. There’s also the cast I mentioned. And there’s a lot of choice and consequence that happens all the way through.</p><p>But honestly, Developer_Direct for us is more about answering a bunch of questions we know people have of a game that we’ve been silent about for so long. This was the opportunity for the team who are making the game to talk about it and answer some of the questions we know fans have been asking.</p><p>Character customization is one that we were delighted to clear up. That’s something that we’ve been sitting on for years now, but it’s great to be able to tell fans that, of course, we have character customization. In <em>Fable</em>, you can be the hero you want to be in every sense.</p><p>As you heard in Developer_Direct, we launch in the autumn and before that we’ll be talking more about our cast, more about our story, and we can’t wait to go deeper into gameplay aspects like combat, progression, weapons, exploration, the social and economic sims and all that good stuff. We’ve got lots more to share…</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/fable-launches-this-fall-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>While Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon games (the series is so large that it's hard to see how it wouldn't be), it does develop other games from time to time. That said, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/pokemon-developer-game-freak-announces-beast-of-reincarnation-for" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3606a6f8-a353-44c5-bc83-19ef23e07cc0" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Beast of Reincarnation, the studio's upcoming post-apocalyptic action role-playing game</a>, is a big swing even by the studio's standards. After seeing the game in action during today's Xbox Developer Direct, we got a much clearer vision of what to expect when it launches this summer.</p><p>Set in Japan in the year 4026, Game Freak describes the game as a "one-person one-dog action RPG." The person and dog in question are named Emma and Koo, respectively, and they live in a time where the human population has been decimated by a parasitic plant called "blight." Somehow, Emma is able to seal that blight within her body, so she's known as a Sealer. Unfortunately, this is an ability people fear, causing her to live in isolation from the remains of society.</p>

<p>After forming a bond with Koo, a magical white dog with a tail made of vines and branches, Emma is told (by the a hologram of perhaps the most cyberpunk-looking guy of all time) to defeat the titular beast of reincarnation to save the Capital. To do so, she'll have to defeat "malefacts," corrupt fusions of animals and blight. I assume "malefact" is pronounced less like "male fact" more like "artifact," but given that the word was only provided in the Japanese speakers' subtitles, this is just a guess. Extremely powerful malefacts, known as Nushi, are the bosses of this world. They can create blighted forests full of enemies and obstacles players will have to overcome before facing off against the deadly beasts.</p><p>Emma is particularly suited to this task thanks to her ability to absorb and dispel blight, but also because of her trusty sword, magic abilities, and vinelike hair. Her sword is her main weapon in combat, and can be upgraded with spirit stones to get special effects when she parries. She and Koo can also use Blooming Arts, powerful magic moves that slow time and allow them to harm or hinder foes. Each character also has a skill tree, and the abilities from one character impacts the other's; the developers also hint that the two will unlock more powers as their bond deepens. Finally, Emma's hair can be used in various ways for platforming, like as a bridge that extends forward over gaps or as a long stilt-like extension of Emma's leg.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo will also have to face golems – robots with corrupted human souls – and meet other human characters, like Brad, Kagura, and the mysterious swordswoman Kunai. The dystopian elements are a bit on the nose, but game looks beautiful, especially for a studio that's been criticized for the poor technical performance of recent Pokémon games. It helps that this game, at the time of writing, is not coming to Switch or Switch 2, and is instead launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. We're excited to check it out when it hits shelves this summer.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/pokemon-developers-beast-of-reincarnation-a-post-apocalyptic]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A release window for Fable has just been announced at the Xbox Developer Direct.</p>
<p>Following a new gameplay deep dive, it was revealed Fable will be releasing in Autumn 2026 on the Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>
<p>In addition, Playground Games presented a bunch of info about its first open world RPG. Apparently being packed with not only British humour, but also chickens and more, you start off in Fable as a child and the first hero in Albion in a generation.</p>
<p>Tragedy strikes as the village is turned to stone (including your nan), thus kicking off your adventure. Multiple regions in Fable were briefly shown off, including Bowerstone! This classic Fable city is returning in ample size, which is very exciting.</p>

<p>Strength, Skill, and Will returns at the core of the combat system, including a variety of weapon types that'll let you engage in fights the way you desire. Ranged and magic attacks are back too, filling distinct purposes in clashes with a range of new and returning enemy types.</p><p>Yes, you can marry people and have kids too, just like in the older games. You can buy houses and businesses too and horde your wealth. This is powered by what Playground is dubbing the Living Population system. There are more than 1,000 of them, they can all be spoken and interacted with, and their lives are impacted by your actions.</p>
<p>This ties into a reputation system, as well as a morality system too. Instead of a black-and-white morality system, this new Fable appears to be taking a more complicated approach to the actions you take. So if you're rich and buy lots of stuff, some folks will dig that and others certainly won't.</p>
<p>You can also kill Dave, played by Richard Ayoade, after he turns into a giant. His corpse will stick around in the world permanently, and will bring down house prices in the area. His sister also won't like you!</p>

            <p>It's a big day for Xbox fans, with Microsoft finally offering a closer look at some of its most anticipated titles, courtesy of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-2026-everything-announced">first Developer Direct of the year.</a> And that began with a fresh peek at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, bringing word of a 19th May release date on PC and Xbox, with a PS5 launch coming later this year.</p>
<p>For this latest entry in the world-hopping racing series, developer Playground Games is shifting the action to Japan, with the studio calling Forza Horizon 6's open-world map  the "largest" it's created for the series so far. It's said to reflect the country's diversity with areas both rural and urban, modern and traditional. It's also described as being "full of verticality", featuring roads inspired by the likes of C1 Loop, Gingko Avenue, and mountain passes including Mount Haruna and Bandai-Azuma.</p>

<p>It also features <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>'s "biggest urban area yet", with Tokyo City said to be five times larger than anything seen in the series so far. It also includes multiple districts, each with their own identity. And as players explore the world, they'll be able to collect cars, houses, landmarks, and mascots, all tracked in their Adventure Journal.</p><p>In terms of progression, players start Forza Horizon 6 as tourists who, after passing qualifiers, will slowly rise through the ranks by completing races in faster cars and unlocking new wristbands. In order to move up, they'll need to participate in "spectacular" events, including classic showcase events and "thrilling" new Rush obstacles courses. And once they've finally unlocked their gold wristband, they'll gain access to Legend Island, featuring exclusive events, tracks, and areas to explore.</p>
<p>Playground says Forza Horizon 6 will feature over 550 cars at launch - ranging from classic cars to the series' latest cover vehicle, the GR GT - bringing new body kits, new Forza Aero, and the ability to paint liveries on windows. The studio also says it's better balanced its roster across all performance classes, from D to the new R Class, which is designed for track-focused cars. There's also talk of better vehicle audio and improvements to how cars are affected by the world - including new cosmetic tire wear.</p>
<p>Cars, once acquired, can be stored in Forza Horizon 6's new customisable garages (available at every player house), which can be freely decorated and have space for multiple cars. This latest game also marks the debut of The Estate, a huge mountain valley expanse where players can freely build and decorate their own abode - which is permanent and visitable by friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of pals, players can now attend open-world car meets, where they're able to show off cars and characters, download tunes and liveries, or buy copies of any car they see. And from here, they can set out to explore the world with others, playing street races or new nighttime Touge battles, which see players racing down mountain passes. Other new social events include Horizon Time Attack Circuits - accessed seamlessly as part of the world, with no loading or matchmaking.</p><p>And that's almost everything announced so far, with Playground wrapping things with a few words on accessibility features, all of which will be carried over from previous games. That's on top of a few new additions, including a customisable high-contrast mode, a proximity radar, and auto-drive for those wanting to sit back and soak up the sights without touching the wheel.</p>
<p>So to recap: Forza Horizon 6 launches 19th May on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass, with a Playstation 5 release due later this year.</p>

		<p>Tim Schafer bust into the Developer Direct stream to show off a bit of pottery-making, and talk about their latest Amnesia Fortnight project, turned into a full and broader project. Kiln is all about creating stuff, and then using that stuff to smash your enemies. </p>
<p>Kiln is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC and Xbox Game Pass this spring.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kiln is all in on the top-down 3D brawler aesthetic for its battling, but it starts with creating a pot to anthropomorphise and then send into the fray. You create the shapes, whether with a pottery wheel or just a ball of clay, attack handles, spouts and more, and then transform that into a create or sorts, as your spirit inhabits it. There’s sponges, shapers and straight edge tools, and even just your hands. Each pot needs to be able to roll, punch, jump, and more, and the game has to dynamically figure out how the moves will work. There’s then special attacks like cups sprouting popcorn, plates flinging pies.</p>
<p>Quench is the main game mode, a 4v4 battle mode, where you team needs to carry water into enemy territory and quench their rival furnace. Larger pots will have greater carrying capacity, but be slower to move, so you need to balance your team.</p>

<p>Success earns you XP and chips to spend back in the hub area, where you can spend them on more creative options.</p>
<p>What’s curious is that this is actualy a fairly old game idea for Double Fine. Yes, it came out of an Amnesia Fortnight project, but it was all the way back in 2017! Check that game out:</p>
<p><iframe title="Kiln  [Amnesia Fortnight 2017]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVJCxk5VDvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Really interesting to see Double Fine bring an idea like this back and develop it further. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/get-a-long-look-at-game-freaks-beast-of-reincarnation-coming-out-this-summer/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Game Freak has shared a lot about their upcoming action RPG Beast of Reincarnation, coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC, and Day One on Xbox Game Pass this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 4026, the game features Emma the Sealer, an outcast from society for being a Blighted One, and her giant wolf buddy Koo. They have to journey across a wasteland where this blight has caused unnatural growths to spread, battling robots and monsters along the way. All we can say is that they had better not even do a fake-out death for Koo, or we’ll be very, very angry.</p>
<p>Emma is infused by the Blight in an interesting way, able to sprout vines from her hair, while Koo also has foliage growing on their back. They battle against ‘malefacts’ who also have these nature-based powers, with Emma able to defeat and then seal their essence within herself. There’s also Golems, the mechanical bodies inhabited by human minds that transferred themselves millennia ago.</p>
<p>The combat looks pretty engaging, with Emma landing blows and parrying incoming attacks, building up to be able to freeze the action and then unleash an ability from Koo. Both Emma and Koo have separate skill trees. There’s different approaches you could take, like fighting exclusively from long range, using stealth, or having Koo ead in to strike first.</p>

<p>The Pokémon developer is getting much more ambitious with their other projects, with Beast of Reincarnation really pushing what they look to achieve with their games on a visual level, and it’s building around demanding, technical combat, which is very much in vogue these days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As promised, during today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong> event, <strong>Playground Games</strong> showed off <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, giving us our first look at the latest entry in the series as it drives across the ocean to Japan. After its <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">new island setting leaked</a>, so <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-reveals-may-19-launch-date/">did its release date</a></strong>, which was <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">corroborated by the very reliable Dealabs</a> just hours ahead of today's show, and is confirmed to be <strong>May 19, 2026,</strong> for <strong>PC and Xbox Series X/S</strong>. As for <strong>PS5</strong> players, it's not launching day-and-date, but will arrive sometime "<em>later this year</em>," when the PS5 version is ready. </p>



<p>What didn't leak, thankfully for Xbox and Playground, was the gameplay showcase we got, which, you may not be surprised to learn, was incredibly impressive. The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 event was opened with Forza Horizon 6, with design director <strong>Torben Ellert</strong> diving into one of the game's key differences from Forza Horizon 5. Instead of starting the game as a superstar of the Horizon festival, you start as a nobody - a tourist in Japan that begins by entering the festival at the bottom tier, eventually working your way up to 'Superstar' status.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s a slightly different approach compared with previous Horizon games; in </em><em>Horizon 4</em>, you’re rising through the ranks in the UK, and in <em>Horizon 5’</em>s Mexico, you’re at the apex of the career you built in the epilogue of the previous game," an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">Xbox Wire blog post reads</a>, regarding the shift in starting position. "<em></em><em>Horizon 6</em> almost feels like a fresh start, and one designed to appeal not just to car enthusiasts, but anyone with a big goal."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Playground describes Japan as the largest map ever in Forza Horizon history, with more verticality, and the largest urban district ever included in a Forza Horizon game. It's "<em>a world where every road leads to discovery</em>," Playground proclaims.</p>



<p>Beyond the map, the roster of cars available at launch is also the biggest roster included in a Forza Horizon game from day one, with <strong>550 cars included at launch</strong>. The roster has also been overhauled to include a better balance across the roster.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of updates to how you build out your garage and home, with a full mountain valley for you to populate with garages and buildings to show off to your friends. Your friends will also be able to help you populate that valley, as building is now an entirely multiplayer experience in Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>There are plenty of more features yet to be shown in Forza Horizon 6, but thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer, since we know we'll get the chance to play it ourselves on Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming <strong>May 19, 2026</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Double Fine Reveals ‘Kiln’ Almost 10 Years After First Announcement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/double-fine-reveal-kiln-10-years-after-announcement/</link>
            <guid>1413505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Double Fine has taken to the (virtual) stage at the Xbox Developer Direct showcase to reveal Kiln, a unique multiplayer, team-based party brawler, <strong>almost a decade </strong>after it was announced. The game first surfaced in 2017, emerging from Double Fine’s ‘Amnesia Fortnight’ event, an annual, two-week game jam that spawns prototype game ideas.</p>



<p>It has remained silent, aside from some prototype images appearing online years ago, until now. During the recent Xbox Dev Direct, Double Fine finally revealed the physics-based, destruction-laden brawler.</p>



<h2 id="h-kiln-ten-years-in-the-making">Kiln – Ten Years in the Making</h2>



<p>If you try to find any information online about Kiln, you’ll find a blurb penned by Double Fine in April 2017:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kiln is a multiplayer, team-based brawler by Derek Brand with a focus on creating unique player sculpted characters featuring crazy physics-based animation and destruction. In Kiln you play as a Mountain Spirit, supernatural beings forever at war on the summit. You’ll use an ancient pottery wheel to create warrior golems called Vessels, inhabiting them and enabling you to interact with the physical realm to do battle. </p>



<p>Created during the match, extremely diverse character shapes and sizes are possible each exhibiting unique attributes and controls that leverage the possibilities in procedural animation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also in 2017 that Double Fine revealed the developers responsible for shaping the early game:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All of this was <strong>re</strong>shared by Double Fine during today’s announcement.</p>



<p>Today, during the Xbox Developer Direct, we saw how that game has evolved over the last decade. </p>



<p>The trailer opened up with Tim Schafer, the head of the studio at Double Fine, working on some pottery. That’s basically the core concept of Kiln. Players take clay characters and shape them into whatever they can imagine, taking them into destructive environments and smashing each other to pieces.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>You take your pottery mechanisms, craft ‘pots’, and take those ceramic imaginations into multiplayer battles across entertaining, engaging maps built with the ‘spirit of creativity’.</p>



<p>Double Fine confirmed that Kiln is coming Spring 2026, and a closed beta will come soon.</p>

            <guid>1413502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Beast of Reincarnation’s release window has been confirmed during the latest Xbox Developer Direct 2026, with the game releasing in Summer, 2026.</p>







<p>The upcoming souls-like RPG is being developed by none other than Game Freak, the masters behind the ever-popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-is-coming-to-hytale-through-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon series</a>. It’s fair to say it’s a harsh departure from their usual titles, but judging from the gameplay showcased, there’s a lot to be excited about.</p>



<h2 id="h-beast-of-reincarnation-releases-summer-2026">Beast of Reincarnation Releases Summer, 2026</h2>



<p>It’s not just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-confirmed-has-4-day-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a> that takes place in Japan, as Beast of Reincarnation is also heading there, but with more of a post-apocalyptic twist. The footage showcases a deeper look at the nation, which has been ruined by a strange blight and plagued by monstrous beasts.</p>



<p>The gameplay is described as a ‘one-person, one-dog experience,’ and it’s clear that the protagonist’s wolf companion, Koo, will play a large part in the experience. Together, you’ll explore the ruins of Japan and hunt down Malefacts in an effort to cleanse the blight from the world. </p>



<p>And there’s good news for PlayStation fans out there, as it was confirmed that Beast of Reincarnation will release on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation concurrently—no delay like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 6 launches May 19 for Xbox Series and PC, later in 2026 for PS5]]></title>
            <link>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/forza-horizon-6-launches-may-19-for-xbox-series-and-pc-later-in-2026-for-ps5</link>
            <guid>1413493</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>The Start</strong></p><p>You start <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> not as a professional driver, but as a tourist, with a dream to one day attend the Horizon Festival in Japan. It’s a slightly different approach compared with previous <em>Horizon</em> games; in <em>Horizon 4</em>, you’re rising through the ranks in the UK, and in <em>Horizon 5</em>‘s Mexico, you’re at the apex of the career you built in the epilogue of the previous game. <em>Horizon 6</em> almost feels like a fresh start, and one designed to appeal not just to car enthusiasts, but anyone with a big goal.</p><p>“Ultimately, I think it really boils down to the fact that so many of us love that idea of going to a place that you don’t know, a place that you’re eager to discover,” Playground Games design director Torben Ellert says. “You have this motivation to go to Japan with the Horizon Festival, but you’re only attending as a fan, with a dream to take part in it. That felt like a great way to frame up that big open-door experience and explore the question of ‘what would it take for you to drop everything to fly to the other side of the world to pursue your dream?’</p><p>“Somehow, it felt right in this game to just put you on the ground—like you just got off the plane, you’ve got a couple of friends that share your dream and know the surroundings. It’s a notional projection of yourself in the game, and the thrill of arriving in a new place full of opportunities.”</p><p><strong>The Country</strong></p><p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> takes us to a new destination for the series—the beautiful mountains and urban spaces of Japan. It’s the team’s most impressive destination yet—breathtaking mountain vistas and passes, neon-soaked city plazas and brooding dockland strips—masterfully designed. However, the goal wasn’t to accurately recreate Japan’s roads and spaces mile for mile, but to capture the essence of the place in a smoother, condensed reality.</p><p>“It’s easy to think of an authentic space as a recreation of a place, but it’s less about that accuracy, and more about the feel of it,” Ellert explains. “If you think about driving in Tokyo, for example, what does that look like? What are the things that make it feel like this place? You’d see it in the distance from the freeways, before passing through the suburbs, then suddenly you’re in downtown, surrounded by skyscrapers.</p><p>“It’s about looking at roads, references, thinking about what you see in each place and how it feels when you turn a corner. You don’t recreate every corner—you recreate the experience of having something revealed when you get there.</p><p>“Filtered through the lens of being a <em>Horizon</em> game, which is a big open world with its consequence-free traversal, we had to find that balance between what it feels like to be there, but also the fun of a <em>Horizon</em> game where you can jump in a hypercar, absolutely spin it off a cliff and earn points for doing that.”</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s sprawling, impressive map is separated into distinct districts, instantly recognizable as soon as you approach. The suburbs are dotted on the outskirts of Tokyo; narrow, undulating streets with telephone wires sweeping overhead, connecting clusters of modest homes.</p><p>Tokyo also has a docklands district, an industrial space piled high with huge cranes and colossal freighters, and there’s a delightful dichotomy between the looming, brutalist architecture built for tiny, bubbly city cars to zip around in.</p><p>There’s also the iconic downtown area, where you’ll see Shibuya Crossing, Ginko Avenue and Tokyo Tower—breathtaking landmarks bound together by dense urban streets, clever shortcuts and hidden paths, but all designed to support <em>Horizon</em>‘s typically fast gameplay.</p><p>“The combination of enormous verticality, glass, neon signs, adverts for all manners of things, with Tokyo we’ve created this ultra-high-density space unlike anything we’ve made before,” Ellert adds. “It’s the most visually, radically different space we’ve ever built for a <em>Horizon</em> game.”</p><p><strong>The Culture</strong></p><p>You won’t end up in Japan alone—two of your close friends are coming to experience this <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,831 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> with you. Jordy is a passionate motorsports enthusiast, while Mei is an experienced Japanese car builder, and it’s her character that adds an insider’s perspective to your journey through Japan. That insider perspective was mirrored in the real world by Playground Games’ Cultural Consultant Kyoko Yamashita.</p><p>“One thing that surfaced when our team travelled to Japan was how valuable it is to have someone there who knows the place, who can help you navigate some of the things that even a well-researched tourist might not know,” Ellert explains. “It’s one thing to understand it from your perspective, but that inside perspective is so important when recreating a space.”</p><p><strong>The Journal</strong></p><p>The team knew it wanted to continue the established wristband progression system from previous <em>Horizon</em> games—where players rise through the ranks of the Horizon Festival to unlock better cars and higher caliber races. This time around, with this new setting, Playground Games wanted to introduce another way to progress, one that gives explorers a real goal to chew on, and one that felt intrinsically tied to Japanese culture. Enter: the Collection Journal—a new feature inspired by Japan’s rich stamp collecting history, that lets players build a digital collection of mementos discovered throughout Japan.</p><p>“We wanted this archetypically Japanese experience, but delivered in a structured way,” Ellert says. “When you discover points of interest, that goes into your Journal, and it generates progression towards your rank in the Horizon Festival and your general progression in Japan.”</p><p>The Journal adds a new level of value to exploration in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, linking back to that player freedom that Ellert mentioned earlier, and how these games are built for adventurers, not just petrol heads. It’s also a deeply customizable experience—you can take photos of murals, landmarks, and other notable spots, and save them in your journal, adding a personal flair to your adventure.</p><p>“It’s a visual representation of your journey,” Ellert adds. “It’s a collection of your own specific experiences in Japan.”</p><p><strong>The Estate</strong></p><p>Similar to previous <em>Horizon</em> games, there are eight player houses that you can unlock throughout Japan, which serve as fast travel points, a customization space, and all come with garages where you’ll be able to fully decorate the space and display several vehicles per home. One notable addition to <em>Horizon 6</em> however is The Estate, a much larger piece of land that you can acquire and build pretty much whatever you’d like on. This space is yours to expand however you wish, and it’s also deeply inspired by that same attention to Japanese culture.</p><p>The Estate is grounded in an idea in Japan called Akiya, which is basically an abandoned piece of property in rural Japan. These homes are often passed down through families, and as the cost of demolishing the building is often more than just leaving it, these buildings can sit and fall into disrepair.</p><p>“The Estate is inspired by this—it’s an old property that belonged to Mei’s family, and as you’ve travelled to Japan together, she’s asked you to help fix it up,” Ellert tells us. “Being responsible for an Akiya is really rooted in community, you take on the job of refurbishing somewhere that’s useful and meaningful to the people around you.”</p><p>In practice, The Estate is a flat area of land where you can build anything you want—a mountain hideaway, a personalized track for friends—the only real constraint is that the items will cost in-game currency. When you build something, you pay a few credits to put it down—credits you earn in other activities across the game world—and you get the credits back if you delete something.</p><p>“It creates this sense of connection for us that you’ve worked to get these credits by taking part in something,” Ellert adds. “Winning races, delivering tofu, exploring the world, there’s all sorts of things you can do to generate in-game credits.” The result is a little slice of Japan that isn’t just built by you, but earned by you.</p><p><strong>Car Meets</strong></p><p>With the aim of authentically creating a racing experience that reflects informal gatherings as well as professionally organized events, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> introduces Car Meets, a feature also grounded in Japanese car culture. These meets are inspired by the Daikoku car meet—a world-renowned, mostly spontaneous meeting place and sacred ground for car enthusiasts. There are no official events, no entry requirement, and it’s always open.</p><p>There are three locations in-game where permanent Car Meets take place. One is at the Horizon Festival, another is towards The Alps at the Okuibuki parking area, and the third is of course, at Daikoku itself. Here, players can roll up, meet other real players, check out their cars, download custom paint jobs and designs, and even purchase their own version of a car they like. It’s a seamless social space that you can enter alone or with a party of friends, and a neat way to really recreate that sense of community within <em>Horizon 6</em>.</p><p><strong>The Cars</strong></p><p>While <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is built to give players more freedom than ever before in how to progress and where they spend their time, the team is still here to serve absolute excellence when it comes to the vehicle roster. There are around 550 different cars at launch to collect in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, including the newly-revealed <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> cover cars, the 2025 GR GT Prototype and the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser.</p><p>The cover cars come to life beautifully in the <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> key art, also revealed at Developer_Direct. The artwork was inspired by the idea of Japan as a land of contrasts; urban, rural, modern, traditional—elements that are reflected through the use of mixed media, paper texture and color, according to Ellert. The visual style was also heavily influenced by the traditional Japanese ink style paintings known as Sumi-E. The <em>Forza</em> team consulted with a <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Artist to ensure the spirit of this artistic style was captured—and collaborated with Toyota to ensure the details on both the 2025 Land Cruiser, and the brand-new 2025 GR GT Prototype are fully representative of what players experience both in-game, and in real life.</p><p>“The 2025 GR GT Prototype is really special to us because it’s our hero cover car, but it’s also a car that you drive as part of what we call the Initial Experience,” Ellert adds. “It’s the first 10 minutes of the game where you get to drive the car, almost as a prelude. You get to do some off-roading in The Alps, race the Shinkansen (bullet train), and get a taste of what’s to come.</p><p>“Then, we take that all away and say, ‘well that’s about the festival, and you’re not in the festival’, this brief experience with the 2025 GR GT Prototype is aspirational, almost like a dream, and it gives you that aspiration to go out and earn that car yourself because it really is an <a title="Companies > amazing [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/amazing">amazing</a> thing.”</p><p>One final note that Torben does leave on, is what cars have grown to mean to everyone today. While illustrious supercars may be reserved for a minority (or something to be authentically experienced inside a <em>Forza Horizon</em> game), cars are a commonplace item in so many lives and rarely purchased without thought, even by those that wouldn’t consider themselves an enthusiast.</p><p>“[Cars] are often the most expensive things that many of us will own. They are the most engineered things that many of us will own,” Ellert adds. “They are brash, they’re loud, they’re beautiful, they appear in fashion and fame, and they’re associated with celebrity, freedom, and the ability to go wherever you want to go.”</p><p>“And ultimately, that is what <em>Horizon</em> games are for me. They’re about freedom, and they’re about fun, and they’re about beauty, and they’re about community. <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is about giving people the ability to go where they want to go in beautiful machines, in a beautiful place, in a fun, approachable game with their friends.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/forza-horizon-6-launches-may-19-for-xbox-series-and-pc-later-in-2026-for-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today’s Xbox Developer Direct kicked off with the first look at gameplay for Forza Horizon 6. We got a look at the game’s cover cars, a breakdown of new customization features, and, of course, a glimpse into how much fun driving across the game’s rendition of Japan could be.&nbsp;</p><p>The campaign sees players begin as a tourist who joins the Horizon festival and climb the ranks, a departure from previous entries where the player is already a relative superstar. You’ll still progress via the established wristband system, but Horizon 6 introduces a new method of progression called the Collection Journal. The Collection Journal is inspired by Japanese stamp collecting and lets players build a digital collection of mementos discovered while exploring. Players can take photos of murals, landmarks, and other scenic sights to save to the journal as well.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/XG1Ll2CVhug?si=UxhcYwsW7n4nhXCE" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XG1Ll2CVhug" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Japan is the series’ biggest map yet. Tokyo alone is the largest city in the series, featuring multiple districts for players to cruise through and recognizable sights, such as Shibuya Crossing, Tokyo Tower, and Ginko Avenue. Playground Games is also striving to accurately represent topographical details, from various countryside to mountains and city streets, to add as much authenticity to the experience as possible. Seasons also return, shifting the environment from winter to spring and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Japanese car culture will be represented in a major way. Cars have no customization options and a fully overhauled roster for improved balancing. More cars will be available at launch than ever before, and new aftermarket cars include rare or unique vehicles to unlock at a bargain. Playground also revealed Forza Horizon 6’s cover cars: the 2025 GR GT Prototype and the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can now build custom structures from any location, and building is now fully multiplayer, allowing friends to concoct creations together. In addition to unlocking player houses for vehicle storage and fast travel, you’ll also unlock a new destination called The Estate. This giant plot of land gives players a blank canvas to build what they want. What begins as a rural section of land can be transformed into mountain hideaways, your own personal race track, a factory complex, and more, based on items purchased using in-game currency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another new feature is Car Meets, inspired by the real-world Daikoku car meet. This social space is always available to join, and it lets players meet up, share custom paint jobs and designs, and purchase their own versions of cars they like.&nbsp;</p><p>New driving features include Auto-drive and proximity radar. In terms of accessibility options, Forza Horizon 6 features a customizable high-contrast mode to help make the game easier to play for the visually impaired.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer ends with a tantalizing tease of a pair of giant robotic feet stepping behind a vehicle that looked suspiciously like a Gundam. Given Forza Horizon’s penchant for crossover content, odds are we’ll be piloting a mobile suit, which is the perfect fit given the setting.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During Xbox's Developer Direct today, Double Fine took a surprise spot on the virtual stage to announce its charming new pottery party game, Kiln.</p><p>Developed as part of Double Fine's internal game jam Amnesia Fortnight, Kiln is a multiplayer party brawler where you build pots and destroy them. Per today's Xbox Developer Direct, the drive behind Kiln is allowing players to build creatively, and then letting them destroy each other's creations. The Quench mode, for example, tasks players with picking up &nbsp;and carrying water to their enemies' kiln, with the goal of dousing it for the win. It's reminiscent of a MOBA in some ways, or Splatoon, or maybe just multiplayer objective-based games in general.&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of options for shaping and sculpting your pottery, with detection tools for identifying specific shapes like bowls or cups. Once they enter the arena, they can run, jump, and attack, and each shape also has different special attacks all their own. Plates can fling a pie, for example. Maps range from dance floors to ancient history, with different lanes and avenues. Some paths might only be accessible for specific shapes, giving a small advantage to the little cups.</p><p>Kiln is set to arrive in spring 2026 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Double Fine plans to host a beta ahead of that launch, with specific details yet to be announced. If you want to sign up for the beta, <a href="https://www.doublefine.com/news/sign-up-for-the-kiln-beta">you can do so at Double Fine's site here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/double-fine-announces-online-multiplayer-pottery-brawler-kiln]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Beast of Reincarnation got a new gameplay presentation at the Xbox Developer Direct, as well as a Summer 2026 release window</p>
<p>The game focuses on Emma and Koo, in a post-apocalyptic 4026 Japan in which a mysterious Blight has taken over much of the world. Emma, being able to absorb this Blight inside herself, plays an important role in defeating the Beast of Reincarnation. Very exciting!</p>
<p>The game shows dynamic movement, powered through the main character Emma's vine hair that can be used to propel her upwards and build makeshift bridges. This is a core part of the plant theme of Beast of Reincarnation, with flora making up much of not only the setting, but being a gameplay focus too. There are also Malefacts, creatures fused from plants and animals.</p>

<p>There is not only Blighted plant life standing in your way, but Golems! These are mechanical bodies which humans transferred their souls into.</p>
<p>The game also features a spin on the typical real-time action RPG with Blooming Arts, which slows down the gameplay and allows you to perform a selection of special attacks. This, as shown in the presentation, allows for a large variety of gameplay styles.</p>
<p>The game can be wishlisted now, and will be available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.

            <guid>1413463</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> is set to launch on 19th May 2026, arriving first for Xbox Series X|S, PC and Xbox Game Pass with an eventual PlayStation 5 release coming at a later point this year, Microsoft has announced alongside a deep dive into the gameplay by Playground games during the Developer Direct stream.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWw-UENvdTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Forza Horizon 6 looks to take the familiar arcade racing format of the series to the next level, thanks in no small part to being fully on this generation, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> was a cross-gen release. The game still takes liberties with reality to create a landmark-filled approximation of Japan, which includes Mount Fuji, Tokyo City, and more rural areas, but the team at Playground Games has brought in consultants to ensure that it’s authentic and not just “postcard tourism” – things like picking 78 as the building number for your first home base, which is lucky in Japanese culture.</p>
<p>Once again the Horizon Festival is at the centre of all the racing that you’re taking on. The journey through the game starts as a tourist to Japan, having to first qualify for the Festival, earning wristbands and taking challenges to prove you’re worthy for the next stage and series of events. There’s a new event here with Horizon Rush, tasking you with weaving through obstacle courses to prove your skills. At the end of the road is&nbsp;Legend Island, an exclusive region of the world that only the pinnacle are able to visit.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seasons will also make a return to Forza Horizon 6, and should be as impactful for the Japanese weather as they were for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> and its wildly different British seasons. Cherry blossoms in the spring are going to be delightful to see, and they’ll respond realistically to passing cars. It’s built around a ton of photogrammetric data capture of the world, providing the foundation for the world – within that, Tokyo City is five times larger than any urban city before, featuring multiple distinct and visually different districts, but there’s also a broad countryside too.</p>

<p>The team has overhauled the car roster to be better balanced, with the hundreds of cars that have new Forza body kits, liveries that extend to the wind screen, but there’s also some unique creations to collect. Oh, and there’s also authentic tyre wear. The Forza Horizon 6 cover star is the Toyota Gazoo Racing GR GT. It’ll sound great, thanks to new environmental audio processing, hours of ambient sound capture from different seasons.</p>
<p>The shared open world returns with thematic open car meets, where you can turn up and show off your car, and even then just buy copies of the cars that you see. That then bleeds into driving and racing together.</p>
<p>Online multiplayer, they promise, will be easier to get into than ever, and more extensive with full collaborative multiplayer world building tools that you can dive into.</p>
<p>The game’s accessibility suite is pushing on with features like proximity radar for competitive racing, auto drive for when you just want to kick back, and a&nbsp;customisable high contrast mode to aid visually.</p>
<p>The key thing that we’ll have to wait and see is how much this game feels like a new step for the series. There was criticism for Forza Horizon 5 that is was often very similar to Horizon 4, in terms of the cars on offer, the overarching progression and the feel, despite having leapt across from Britain to Mexico. We do expect Horizon 6 to still be an evolution of the formula instead of a wholesale reinvention, but hopefully there’s some more distinguishing touches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio recently released a new demo for<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami,</em> an upcoming remake of the original PS3-era <em>Yakuza 3.</em> And a single alleyway in the demo has become the center of an online debate about whether<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> is a visual downgrade when compared to the OG game.</p> <p>On January 21, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3948220/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties_Demo/">Sega released a demo for <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</a> It didn’t take long after the demo’s launch for people to start complaining about the remake. Some aren’t happy that, like in the OG game, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qj4cdi/damn_kiwami_3_is_crazy_faithful_to_yakuza_3/">every character you fight is an expert at blocking.</a> Others claim that the remake’s map is smaller than the original’s and are unhappy about it. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/yakuza-3-remake-backlash-blows-up-again-as-actor-guilty-of-sexual-harassment-stars-in-new-trailer">There’s also the crappy decision by RGG to recast a character with actor Teruyuki Kagawa</a>, a man who has been accused of sexual assault against a hostess in 2019. While he apologized in 2022, people are still upset that he’s included in the remake. But the newest and biggest controversy surrounding <em>Kiwami 3</em> involves an alleyway found in the demo.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/wj9u8chpW5">pic.twitter.com/wj9u8chpW5</a></p> <p>— Yakuza Spain 🐉 (@SpainYakuza) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpainYakuza/status/2014115748491252142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 21, a user on Twitter shared a post comparing an alley in the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> on PS3 with how it looks in the remake’s demo. While the original looks realistic and inviting, the remake’s version looks garish and ugly. However, the original account claimed that the rest of the demo looked better and was on par with recent RGG games. Another user pointed out that the alleyway looks fine when you aren’t inside of it, and <a href="https://x.com/Kami_No_Okami/status/2014382700677706178">someone else suggested it was tied to a technical issue involving the game’s lighting</a>. This is a problem that has plagued past <em>Yakuza/Like a Dragon</em> games, including <em>Pirates in Hawaii.&nbsp;</em></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yakuza Kiwami 3 lighting issues are an auto-exposure bug.</p> <p>When in a dark area, the game brightens to make things easier to see, which overexposes bright areas and makes things look fullbright.</p> <p>The fix is as easy as disabling this, but Pirates in Hawaii had the same issue. <a href="https://t.co/hVu5OaUYzw">pic.twitter.com/hVu5OaUYzw</a></p> <p>— MeovvCAT (@osu_MeovvCAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/osu_MeovvCAT/status/2014364282725474705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That information didn’t stop the original post comparing the old and new game from going viral online, <a href="https://x.com/kitsuneredFES/status/2014250516977492350">leading to more people sharing footage</a> and <a href="https://x.com/exblackwater/status/2014149801554633074">screenshots of the ugly alleyway</a> on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mcyuyh2ylk25">social media sites like Twitter and BlueSky</a> as well as Reddit.</p>

 <p>Thankfully, the playerbase is already fixing the ugly lighting issues in <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/yakuzakiwami3/mods/16">There’s already a mod</a> for the demo online that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qjuwsf/a_quick_original_filter_vs_no_filter_comparison/">apparently removes a visual filter RGG has implemented in the game and in other recent <em>Yakuza</em> titles.</a> And yeah, seeing the game both with and without the filter makes it clear that this isn’t an ugly game. Instead, it seems that the filter, as well as some shading issues, are causing it to look worse than the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> in some specific circumstances. Hopefully the devs add a toggle to remove the filter, but considering they are shipping <em>Kiwami 3</em> with an actor who allegedly sexually assaulted a woman, I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>

<p>During the Developer Direct, Playground Games confirmed that Forza Horizon 6 would launch on PlayStation 5 ‘later this year’, confirming players on the platform will be able to jump in before the end of 2026.</p>



<p>The PS5 launch, therefore, takes place significantly later than Forza Horizon 6 arrives on Xbox Series X|S and PC, though it was already known that the PlayStation launch would not be simultaneous.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial reveal</a> of the game in September, it was stated that due to “the excitement for this franchise on other platforms,” Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are “working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch.”</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6’s arrival on PlayStation continues Microsoft’s growing trend of releasing titles that would have previously been exclusives onto other platforms, following the likes of Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, and Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle, with the likes of Halo making the move later this year.</p>



<p>While it’s not the concrete release date PlayStation gamers will have hoped for, at least players won’t need to wait until 2027 to jump in.</p>
