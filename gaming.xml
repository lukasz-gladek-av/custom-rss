			<p>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-series-creator-reportedly-going-to-netease-while-tencent-is-rumored-to-be-acquiring-a-japanese-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> SEGA three years ago to join NetEase, where he <a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> his own Tokyo-based studio to make global console games.</p>
<p>The game designer was featured in a lengthy interview with Japanese magazine Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> yesterday. Nagoshi talked about various topics, but the most interesting tidbit is arguably that he believes the era where game size is the selling point will soon pass.</p>
<p><em>What I'm making now is an action adventure. After the experimental phase and the phase where the experiments are exhausted, we will move on to the phase of mass-producing assets, but I think it would be good if you thought of it as being on the eve of the mass-production phase. In that sense, it's going well, but in many ways, it's a bit large in scale. In addition, at first glance, the game system is complicated. But I don't want to make it a troublesome game... Well, it's difficult to talk about what I can't say at this point.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I want to make it a game that is satisfying to play, but I don't want it to be a hassle. Even though there aren't many completely new games out there, there are so many titles out there that you can't play them all, including overseas. Looking at the situation, I think the volume of console games in the lives of average game fans may be a bit excessive. There are still many titles out there, but I feel that the era of games where volume is the selling point is about to pass.</em></p>
<p>The interesting thing is that he admits his next game is also going to be large in scale, which isn't surprising given that his last game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, required 45.5 hours just for the main quest, while a completionist playthrough can take an average of 103 hours, according to How Long To Beat.</p>
<p>Anyway, Nagoshi said his team is currently assessing the proper size for this game, though the map they've created is already large - maybe too much.</p>
<p><em>One characteristic that is particularly relevant in overseas markets is that a certain amount of volume is necessary, and although there is a sense that "it has to be at least this much," I think that this is also a kind of fixed idea. So we continue to discuss, "What is the appropriate volume at the time of releasing the game?" I'm currently thinking hard about how to predict or measure that volume and how to arrange the game's density to suit the appropriate volume and size.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We will soon have to enter the mass production phase of assets, so it will soon be time to decide on the final volume estimate, but we are currently thinking about whether this is really good enough. Of course, we have a map, but the one at the current stage is too large. I started by studying existing games and creating a fairly large map. I had already created roads and highways. Now, I'm shrinking it little by little and looking for a good balance for the game.</em></p>
<p>The Yakuza creator also revealed that the team size is around 80. He'd like to share more about the project in the near future, too. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch is among the best ones to date, introducing new options that provide a deeper insight into the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler alongside great visual and performance improvements.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry analyzed the game's PS5 Pro patch, highlighting the new features that it introduces and how it takes advantage of the console's power and features. The patch replaces the standard Performance Mode with a PS5 Pro Enhanced mode that uncaps the framerate so that those with a 120Hz screen with VRR can enjoy a high framerate experience that consistently runs at above 60 FPS, hitting the 100 FPS range rather often.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch, however, is the new Scaling options, which include PSSR anti-aliasing and the TAA option the game has featured since launch. These options, which can be switched on the fly, provide a great insight into the performance cost of the PSSR upscaler, which does a great job enhancing the image quality and the perception of distant detail using the same 1440p base resolution as TAA but does impact performance. In one of the game's most CPU-intensive scenarios, using PSSR over TAA made the game run at 10 frames per second less or more. As such, this essentially confirms the PSSR cost on performance of 2ms every frame that was revealed in the internal documents leaked a few months ago.</p>
<p>Rounding out the improvements the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch brings in its new enhanced mode is the presence of all the image quality features seen in the base game's Quality Mode, including the light ray tracing for the scene-aligned cube maps, which is still not available in the PC version of the game. All of these features make the patch one of the best released to date, enhancing the experience considerably in both image quality and performance over the base model.</p>

<p>Hideaki Itsuno, the name behind the Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma franchises, has a new home. The director has taken up a leadership position at <strong>LightSpeed Studios Japan</strong>, a subsidiary of the giant Tencent.</p>



<p>Itsuno will use all his expertise to develop new AAA action games. Hideaki spoke about his new challenge in a <a href="https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/news/Japan-Game-Development-Studio.html">statement to the press</a>.</p>



<p>“<em>Joining LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS is an exciting new chapter for me.</em> <em>With LightSpeed’s strong development capabilities and global network, I’m looking forward to creating original AAA action games together with the amazing team and building innovative and beautiful experiences for the global community of gamers.</em> <em>We welcome all talented and passionate game developers from around the world to join our vision</em>.”</p>



<p>Based in Osaka and Tokyo, the studio’s idea is to build experiences that reach global audiences. Jerry Chen, president of LightSpeed Studios, had this to say:</p>



<p>“<em>The creation of LightSpeed Japan Studio is a significant step in the expansion of LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS and demonstrates our commitment to bringing the best possible games to our players.</em>”</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the initiative isn’t messing around, signing one of Japan’s leading game developers. Obviously, we don’t have any more details about Hideaki Itsuno’s next adventure. Knowing the director’s style, we can at least hope for addictive combat.</p>

            <p>
In The Valley of the Gods, the promising but now permanently "on hold" adventure from the team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>, had some eye-popping water technology. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew Wilde, who worked on Firewatch at Campo Santo before the team was absorbed into Valve six years ago, has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x">shared</a> a fresh look at In The Valley of the Gods on social media, showing what could have been. 
</p>
<p>
"I do often tend to work on liquidy things," Wilde wrote. "This was the water test we did at Campo Santo pre Valve move." 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage. It shows the water technology that was tested for In The Valley of Gods before Valve acquired the company Campo Santo. Team shelved the game not so long after… <a href="https://t.co/wIs6Im8KYx">pic.twitter.com/wIs6Im8KYx</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1855941378301141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
There is, sadly, absolutely no suggestion we'll see In the Valley of the Gods anytime soon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-review">Firewatch was excellent</a>, and Campo Santo's follow-up - which would have followed a budding filmmaker as she explored 1920s Egypt in search of archeological secrets - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-developer-reveals-next-game-in-the-valley-of-the-gods">looked hugely promising</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But, in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-acquires-firewatch-developer-campo-santo">Valve and the potential to work on Half-Life: Alyx came calling</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-devs-egyptian-adventure-in-the-valley-of-gods-officially-on-hold-at-valve">In The Valley of the Gods was later confirmed to have been shelved indefinitely</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Wilde's reference to working on "liquidy things" is a reference to some of his other work since, such as the impressive water shader technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> that lets you slosh around bottles of beer, as well as the water technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Spent a good chunk of lock-down doing this important work. Boozy liquid shader, now available in the latest update for Half-Life: Alyx <a href="https://t.co/Iw9h98pmEg">pic.twitter.com/Iw9h98pmEg</a></p>— Matthew Wilde (@skilful) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilful/status/1265875309980643329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote></div>

What's next for Wilde and his former Campo Santo colleagues? Well, there's rumblings that there's more from Valve's most famous series on the horizon. Is it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">finally time for Half-Life 3</a>?

<h2 id="h-how-do-perks-and-wildcards-work-in-warzone">How do Perks and Wildcards work in Warzone?</h2>



<p>Warzone has a “Pick 3 System,” which means you can <strong>pick one Perk from each category</strong> (blue, red, and yellow.) You can then pick <strong>one Wildcard</strong> to compliment your loadout. These Perks will drop on the floor so that they can be looted again upon death.</p>



<p>Players will need to choose one Perk for each slot to make a combination of 3. Most of the Perks can be unlocked through leveling up, while the new ones added in Season 1 (Veteran and Reflexes) are unlocked via Season 1 event rewards. There’s no Combat Specialty. Wildcards are also earned through leveling.</p>



<p>There are also lootable Perks in Warzone that players can find to further fortify their loadout. These include four options from the Pick 3 System and two that are exclusive to loot – Shrouded and Irradiated. Lootable Perks will vanish upon death.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-get-specialist-perk-package-in-warzone">Can you get Specialist Perk Package in Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes</strong>, Specialist Perk Package is back in Warzone x Black Ops 6, and it can be found as a <strong>rare loot drop or via the Care Package Killstreak</strong>. It will give the player all 18 Perks plus the two bootable Perks for a total of 20. Upon death, the Specialist Perk Package will drop and can be looted by anyone.</p>

Now, years later, it remains on hold, but one Valve developer has given fans a glimpse at what might have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced during the 2017 Game Awards, In The Valley of Gods is set in Egypt during the late 1920s. It stars Rashida and Zora, a pair of documentary filmmakers who accidentally made it big with a hit movie but have since seen their careers go off a cliff. They reunite years later after receiving information about the lost Tomb of Nefertiti, with a goal of reigniting their careers by documenting their trip to Egypt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve visual effects developer Matt Wilde took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a> to publish a six second water test created by Camp Santo before the studio’s move to Valve. It shows the player character bobbing in impressively realistic water while looking out from inside a cave at the other protagonist from a first-person perspective. “I do often tend to work on liquidy things,” Wilde said.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage.

But yes, developers from the former Campo Santo team have joined other projects at Valve, including Half-Life: Alyx.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So to answer your question as of today, In The Valley of Gods development is on hold — but it certainly feels like a project people can and may return to. And when that happens, we’ll find an exciting way to let fans know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/687440/In_The_Valley_of_Gods/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In The Valley of Gods’ Steam page is still live</a> — with a December 2029 release window.

We probably won't flag up when every single game's soundtrack comes to Nintendo Music, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> is a bit of a favourite round these parts. 
</p>
<p>
So yes, 30 music tracks from Nintendo's seminal Wii launch title are now part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo Music</a>, the company's new soundtrack app which launched last month, as a fresh perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. 
</p>
<p>
More than 82 million people owned a copy of Wii Sports and millions more - friends, siblings, grandparents - played its simple but brilliant motion-controlled takes on tennis, golf and bowling. Also baseball and boxing, but they weren't as good.

These tunes are ingrained in my memory from countless evening sessions playing nine holes of Wii Golf at uni or short matches of Wii Tennis on breaks in the staff room at my student job. There's something about Wii Sports which still stands unmatched - I still dig out the original Wii Sports to play in multiplayer sessions today.

Here's the full list of Wii Sports tracks now included in Nintendo Music. Altogether, these only amount to 18 minutes of music, but many of these classics can be extended to versions lasting up to 60 minutes each for your continued audio pleasure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-rtx-4080/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Running games powered by the Unreal Engine 5.4 smoothly continues to be a challenge even for current high-end GPUs, as an RTX 4080 GPU has trouble running an undemanding fan-made game powered by the engine at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, <a href="https://projectborealis.com/prologue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3</a>, a fan-made project powered by the latest public version of the engine, cannot run at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS Ultra Quality preset even in scenarios where there isn't a lot happening on screen. With other DLSS settings and Frame Generation, performance is considerably better, but this is only making it more clear that a native 4K, 60 FPS experience is not possible on the vast majority of current gaming hardware, although better optimization, which shouldn't be expected for what is essentially a demo of a fan-made project like this, could have improved the situation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3 on Unreal Engine 5.4 | RTX 4080 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 FG" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bs2XrBrpbBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One more thing the video above makes abundantly clear regarding Unreal Engine 5.4 is that, despite performance improvements over past versions, the engine still leaves plenty to be desired in regard to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-performance-improvement-frame-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame time stability</a>, as the stutters are pretty evident at all resolutions. This has been a persistent issue in games powered by Epic's engine for a long while, and there still doesn't seem to be a solution to the problem in sight, although things may improve in the future thanks to the effort of developers well-known for their technical expertise, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>
<p>More information on Unreal Engine 5.4 can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <p>The developers of hero shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> must have dropped a box full of old photographs while clearing the attic, spilling old snapshots of Route 66 onto the floor and getting snared in a nostalgic daze. The game is launching a "Classic" mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.</p>

<p>Blizzard explained the ins and outs of Classic mode in <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/">a rose-tinty post</a>. They also explain that this won't be the only time the mode appears (Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, likes to run limited-time events often). Each time the classic event shows up it will replicate the "heroes and balance from popular moments in the game’s history."</p>
<p>This time that means you can have a team composition of six Torbjorns, the turret-thwacking Swede. Or field a team made entirely of very annoying Genjis, the ninja who I hate. But be warned, this lack of hero limits only lasts the first few days, say Blizzard. "After that, we will enable single hero limits for the remainder of this first Overwatch: Classic event." </p><p>Some things won't be changing, though. The maps that cycle through this mode will be the maps you recognise (Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and so on) but their design will remain as they appear in Overwatch 2. "This includes major reworks for Dorado, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar," say the devs.</p>
<p>The mode will run for the next three weeks, until December 2nd. And it's not related, we're told, to the chin-scratching at the studio regarding another possible 6v6 mode in Overwatch 2. That's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2-may-get-6v6-again-as-blizzard-try-to-bring-back-the-chaotic-over-the-top-variety-of-the-first-game">something separate the studio is thinking about</a>. </p>
<p>Blizzard aren't the first to encourage players to become misty-eyed about a shooter they used to play. Last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> brought back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-season-og-brought-back-its-original-map-last-week-and-a-record-breaking-44m-players-came-with-it">its old map</a>, resulting in record player numbers and likely catching the dollar-sign eyes of every executive in charge of a live service game. But harking back to some "golden age" of your favourite online blastabout is a questionable way to engage with nostalgia, as James learned when he had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> after they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">launched a similar classic mode</a>. As a a kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> holiday it was enjoyable, he said, "but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always <em>that</em> good."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft's shutdown of The Crew has sparked a legal challenge from two fans who have this month filed to begin a class action lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
Online racer The Crew became unplayable and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">removed from owner's accounts</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">Ubisoft pulled the plug on its servers</a> back in March. The game was 10 years old and had been replaced by a successor, but Ubisoft's decision still sparked wider concern among video game fans increasingly concerned about preservation and consumer rights.
</p>
<p>
"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed," the plaintiff's lawyers wrote in the new lawsuit, as first reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action">Polygon</a>.

<p>
"Turns out the pinball manufacturer decided to come into your home, gut the insides of the pinball machine, and remove your ability to play the game that you bought and thought you owned."
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit alleges that its plaintiffs - and likely many others - were unaware that legally they owned only a license to the software, even if they owned a physical copy, and would not have purchased the game if they had been aware of its eventual complete shutdown.
</p>
<p>
Its plaintiffs are now seeking approval for a wider class action lawsuit which could pay out for owners of the game.
</p>
<p>
"We announced on December 14, 2023 that after almost a decade of support, we would be decommissioning The Crew 1 on 31st March 2024," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer earlier this year. (The company has declined to comment on this new legal action.) 
</p>
<p>
"While we understand this may be disappointing for players, it was necessary due to server infrastructure and licensing constraints."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's decision helped spark the Stop Killing Games campaign, which aims to end the practice of publishers "destroying" video games after their sale to customers. 
</p>
<p>
379,280 people have since signed a petition to the EU that calls for measures to ensure games remain playable get legal backing - specifically, that games remain in a working state with an offline mode when publisher support does wind down.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft subsequently committed to providing offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>, which will be playable if (more likely, when) those games also get their servers switched off. 
</p>
<p>
While there's no suggestion game publishers will be required to keep online servers active forever, there does seem to be a greater acknowledgement that consumers lack awareness of what they are acquiring when buying a game. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-warns-customers-theyre-only-buying-a-license-when-paying-for-a-game">Steam now warns customers they're only buying a license when paying for a game</a>, for example, as fresh California legislation requires storefronts to make it clear customers are only buying a license for digital content rather than outright owning it.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">Eurogamer spoke to a group of The Crew fans taking matters into their own hands</a> by attempting to use mods to bring the game back online using private servers.

			<p>The easiest way to describe Redacted is ‘<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a> in a prison’. Whilst it’s true that the two games share many similarities – a Roguelike structure, an isometric viewpoint, and lovely comic book visuals – that lazy comparison does Redacted a disservice. Striking Distance Studios has made its own game, for better and for worse.</p>
<p><iframe title="[REDACTED] Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YyQ44BJSDEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sharing a setting with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/02/callisto-protocol-review-in-progress-is-it-better-than-dead-space/">The Callisto Protocol</a>, Redacted takes you to Black Iron Prison, a state-of-the-art penitentiary placed out of the way on Callisto, Jupiter’s rather chilly moon. The prison has become overrun with hordes of infected inmates, armies of militant mutants, and a conglomeration of other hideous beasties. You take on the role of a hapless prison guard, one who must blast, bash, and bludgeon their way to the last remaining escape pod and thus complete the game. Thing is, this being a Roguelike, you are not going to manage that for around 15 hours. Most of your time will be spent dying, getting incrementally more powerful, attempting another run, and then dying again. You know the drill.</p>


<p>First off, Redacted is gorgeous. The chunky, American comic book inspired visuals are absolutely my cup of tea. Bright, bold, punchy; the denizens of Black Iron are an unmitigated delight to maul and murder. Combat is fast and satisfying; the kick of a shotgun blast as it launches a slobbering zombie into an electric trap is unexpectedly meaty, particularly for a game played from an isometric viewpoint, which can often have a distancing effect on the action. Your prison guard can dash, back attack, and grenade launch in such a responsive and dynamic manner that even Zagreus would be impressed. In short, Redacted plays really nicely. Each self-enclosed arena is a Potpourri of intense chaotic violence that will get your heart pumping and your fingers twiddling with excitement.</p>


<p>Complete a room by killing all the enemies and you’ll be rewarded with a power-up, some of which will offer you a boost for your current run, while others provide you with new abilities, perks, and upgrades that will benefit you through this and every subsequent run. Your standard Roguelike, then.</p>
<p>Death comes frequently in the world of Redacted. A tad too frequently in my humble opinion. This is a <em>hard</em> game, offering a much steeper challenge than Hades. Whilst your prison guard consistently increases in power, the enemies you face match you every step of the way. It often frustratingly feels like you aren’t making much progress, the game cackling in delight as in throws ever more obstacles your way, ensuring you are stuck on the second stage for hours and hours before you finally break through to the next section. Progress can be frustratingly slow and irksome, rather than addictive and compelling.</p>

<p>Missing the iconic Greek gods of Hades, Redacted offers a smart alternative: you aren’t on your own in attempting to reach the last escape pod and other employees and inmates are racing against you. There’s some fabulously over-the-top voiced characters to encounter, though the RPG obsessed super nerd, a lewd dinner lady, and a symbiote infected hapless admin guy, are the stand outs. Your rivals will mock you or occasionally offer you tips during your run, and they’re even able to attack you remotely – adding exploding enemies to a room or foes that have increased freeze damage, that kind of thing. In the reverse, you’ll gather and charge power-ups – input through a QTE – to slow your rivals down, weaken them, or expose vulnerabilities. Catch up with them in an arena and you’ll have an epic boss battle on your hands, survive and you’ll unlock dossiers that will further weaken your rival until they can eventually be defeated.</p>
<p>It’s an addictive gameplay loop, one that will keep you hankering after just one more run, even if the slow progress elsewhere might have you chewing on your controller with rage. Not that that happed to me. Honest.</p>

Put up with the steep difficulty and slow progress and you’ll experience an immensely enjoyable game, one that is cram-packed with slick combat and brilliant characters.	</p></div>

        <p>The servers were taken offline in March, rendering the online-only game unplayable</p>

            <p>"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed". As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action">Polygon</a>, that's an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>. They're suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game's</a> servers, rendering it unplayable.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft pulled the ol’ snippy Johnson on The Crew’s server wires <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">back in March</a>, effectively killing the online-only game. The following month, it started <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">disappearing from owner's</a> Ubisoft Connect libraries. In response, YouTuber Ross Scott started a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">Stop Killing Games</a> initiative, petitioning France's Directorate General For Competition, Consumer Affairs And Fraud Protection (DGCCRF) to investigate.</p>
<p>Ubisoft - perhaps rightly terrified of a protracted skirmish with a man who owns two first names - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">confirmed an offline mode in September</a> for sequels <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a>. The Crew itself, however, remains unplayable. As Polygon note, Ubisoft did offer full refunds to those who had "recently" bought The Crew when they first announced the server shutdown, but since the game came out in 2011, this excluded many.</p>

<p>The lawsuit itself takes the above pinball allusion and runs with it, saying this chillingly paddle-deprived thought experiment is "exactly" what happened with the game’s server shutdowns. Both plaintiffs own physical copies, which the lawsuit says they wouldn’t have bought "on the same terms" (price) knowing the servers could be shuttered, rendering the game unplayable. The lawsuit also cites, among others, several of Ubisoft’s titles that have shut down servers but patched in an offline mode, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-ii">Assassin’s Creed 2</a> and 3. The plaintiffs are seeking "monetary relief and damages for those impacted by the server shutdown".</p><p>In October, Graham wrote about an update to Steam that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-now-warn-customers-at-checkout-that-theyre-only-buying-a-digital-license-to-a-game">warns customers at checkout</a> that they're only buying a digital license to a game. The change, implemented internationally, was in response to new California legislation designed to more clearly inform players that a digital purchase doesn’t necessarily equate to permanent ownership. GOG, who are themselves exempt from the legislation because of their DRM-free offerings, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435">couldn’t resist a cheeky pop</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers who remade <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> are working on a new roguelite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> shooter.

<p>Lots of Rainbow Six style a-breachin' and a-clearin' going on in that trailer there. We see blast charges, silencers, and one player using a big handheld battering ram to bust down a door while another tosses what's probably a flashbang over the threshold. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">Steam page</a> calls it "high-octane tactical combat meets strategic planning" with "tough, unyielding enemies". </p>
<p>It also says maps will be "reshaped" with every playthrough by something called a "Parametric Design System". Big word, that, parametric. Luckily, I am immune to big words. It is a fancy way of saying the maps (a mall, an office, etc) will feature some amount of randomness. But whether that's enemies, layout, objects - or something else - we're not told. Whatever it is, they promise variety, which will be important if we're to be SWATing it through dangerous corridors. Imagine checking the same corner twice, yuck.</p><p>It sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ready-or-not">Ready Or Not</a>, a hardcore tactical co-op shooter that's all about storming rooms full of bad guys with hostages and the like. The multplayer shooter is an interesting route for Crowbar Collective to go following their recreation of Black Mesa, but it also makes some sense, given that the reworked weaponry animations were a big strength of Gordon's Great Gallivant, an adventure Graham called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-review-2">"the most impressive fan game ever made"</a>. Personally, I need a little more than "co-op roguelite shooter" to get excited about guns. But different strokes for militant folks and all that.</p>
<p>Rogue Point is being published by Team 17 and has a loose early access release date of 2025. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>AUKEY has just introduced its new MagFusion GameFrost wireless charger as part of its Omnia-Frez series, bringing some serious heat (rather, the opposite) to the wireless charging category. The company's Omnia-Frez lineup includes three products, but the one we will focus on is the most crucial one, especially for mobile gamers. The <a href="http://cutt.ly/8eHX6nwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUKEY MagFusion GameFrost wireless charger</a> is designed to offer advanced cooling features with MagSafe compatibility and seamless Qi2 support for a wide range of devices. With a price tag of $42.99, the wireless charger delivers excellent value to a specific niche. The company is also offering a 10% launch discount with code <strong>GAMEFROST10</strong>.</p>
<h4>Design: Tough with thoughtful details</h4>
<p>The AUKEY MagFusion GameFrost comes in a minimal package that includes the essentials: the wireless charger itself, a sturdy USB-C to USB-C braided cable in black, and a user manual. The inclusion of the high-quality braided cable is definitely a plus for the accessory, as it will restrict the wires from remaining untangled.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Visually, the MagFusion GameFrost wireless charger from AUKEY features a sleek, circular design with a sturdy aluminum build that gives it a premium feel. We have seen wireless chargers in the past that scream plastic, and considering what you are paying for the charger, it is indeed worth it. The aluminum build also contributes to better build quality and durability that protects the cooling components on the inside. Thanks to the build, it is a bit on the heavier end and if you are pairing it with a 'Pro Max' version of the iPhone, you will feel a massive difference.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The MagFusion GameFrost features a soft-touch finish that protects the device from scratches, and the rubberized edges also keep it secure in place during charging. On the front, you will get three buttons and an LED indicator for temperature monitoring. The design includes a power button that turns wireless charging on or off, a button to adjust the LED light models, and a button that controls the fan's speed so you can choose the settings that best fit your preferences.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h4>Performance: Fast charging with impressive cooling power</h4>
<p>The AUKEY MagFusion GameFrost delivers 15W of fast wireless charging, making it one of the best options for iPhone or Android devices that supports the new Qi2 standard. The versatility of the accessory is quite, as it can accommodate a wide range of devices, making it an ideal choice for households with mixed phone brands.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The MagSafe magnets at the back are quite strong, and you really have to apply some force to get it off, which is a good thing considering it is designed for gamers and their need to keep the phone in their hand while charging. You can most certainly forget that the MagFusion GameFrost will drop on its own. I used the wireless charger over my MagSafe leather case from Otterbox, and it worked flawlessly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Getting to the main selling point of the AUKEY MagFusion GameFrost, the powerful active cooling system will keep your phone's temperature way below room temperature. This means that users who game for long sessions will be glad to know that their devices will be cold to the touch. Based on the LED indicator on the <a href="https://www.aukey.com/discount/GAMEFROST10?redirect=%2Fproducts%2Flc-g10-magfusion-gamefrost-magnetic-wireless-charger-with-active-cooling-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MagFusion GameFrost wireless charger</a>, I was able to go as low as 12 degrees Celsius with the fan speed set on high.</p>
<p>The active cooling system includes three fan modes: slow, medium, and fast, which you can set based on what you are doing on your device. For standard usage, we would recommend slow or medium, but if you are editing a short video or gaming, the fan's fast speed will definitely keep the temperatures stable for extended use.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While the MagFusion GameFrost is good at what it does, the fan is a bit loud, especially when it is set to fast mode, so you will be able to hear the blades running in your sessions. The low and medium settings of the fan are bearable so you would not be too distracted while you game or work.</p>
<h4>Cold to the touch: Reducing temperatures by up to 20 degrees</h4>
<p>AUKEY claims that the MagFusion GameFrost can reduce device temperatures by up to 20 degrees Celsius, which is a game-changer for users who push their phones to the limit. In my experience, the charger effectively dropped my device’s temperature from the high double digits to a comfortable single-digit range. This specific aspect is particularly important for gamers who need their phones to stay cool to avoid thermal throttling, which reduces the device's performance. Furthermore, lower temperatures also contribute to better battery health and slow down the degradation process.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://cutt.ly/8eHX6nwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUKEY MagSafe Fusion GameFrost wireless charger</a> is a great choice for anyone looking to upgrade their charging setup. It is a combination of fast 15W charging, efficient cooling system, and MagSafe compatibility for a wide range of phones. The light modes are for aesthetics, and the three fan settings give users more control over the hardware and its performance.</p>
