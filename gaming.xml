            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the highlights of my writing this year was heading out to meet the team from 10Chambers at the European Unity headquarters, and getting to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/">hands-on with Den of Wolves</a>. This futuristic heist game has a hell of a legacy – 10Chambers’ studio founder Ulf Anderson was the creator of Payday and GTFO – and even in our short time with the game, it was clear that the mix of planning, gunplay and crazy Inception-like sections was looking to be something special. While they’re continuing to work hard on the forthcoming game, 10Chambers are continuing a drip-feed of information, this time showcasing a new trailer, where they let four of the key community members for the game go hands-on. It looks like they had a pretty good time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Community Hands-On Trailer | PC Gaming Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCUnDA8BpIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Robin Björkell, the Communications Director at 10 Chamber said, “I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for Den of Wolves in the trailer – but no. They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer. We invited some of our most loyal fans to come to our office and play the game. This is real footage of them playing the game – not scripted, not us playing. The game does exist – ask them,”</p>
<p>In fact, you can hear from one of them straight away, with RandomKenny, one of the invited players, saying, “Absolutely incredible experience being invited to play Den of Wolves early. Planning and executing how you’re going to tackle heists is super satisfying. I had such a blast playing, and I honestly can’t wait for the game to be released”.</p>
<p>In the trailer, the players can be seen tackling a heist in a previously unseen level inside a robot factory. Inside this gigantic factory, the players face resistance from both human and robotic enemies, all while deploying spider drills to hack vaults full of valuables.</p>

<p>Obviously, the big question remains, just when will Den of Wolves release? The team are remaining tight-lipped despite the huge groundswell of community interest, and it doesn’t look like we’re going to get a set date any time soon.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-458384">{“Source” : “NVIDIA APP”, “B64” : “eyJEUlNBcHBOYW1lIiA6ICIiLCAiRFJTUHJvZmlsZU5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJTaG9ydE5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJDbXNJZCIgOiAwfQ==”}</p>
<p>“Even though we’ve not conducted any closed or public playtests yet, Den of Wolves has over half a million wishlists. We’re so grateful for our community’s support, and we can’t wait to show more details about the game. The reason we’re shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with GTFO, which was delayed multiple times. We don’t think it’s fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out,” says Oscar J-T Holm, co-founder of 10 Chambers.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t get a release date for Den of Wolves set in stone quite yet, here’s hoping that we learn more in early 2026, at least in terms of beta testing or a potential demo.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/haddonfield-heights-multiplayer-map-revealed-for-illfonics-halloween</link>
            <guid>1373605</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>IllFonic released a new trailer for its asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/halloween">Halloween</a>, during today's PC Gaming Show, and it showcases its first map, Haddonfield Heights. Of course, Haddonfield is the fictional Illinois town where killer Michael Myers attempts to kill Laurie Strode in the original 1978 <em>Halloween </em>film, so it's no surprise a map like this is in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Developer-publisher IllFonic and co-publisher Gun Interactive describe Haddonfield Heights as a map nestled beneath the iconic Haddonfield water tower that brings players deep into the heart of the town, "introducing a warm, tight-knit neighborhood that hides terror behind every picket fence and perfectly manicured lawn." It features a cluster of charming homes, plenty of front yards and winding side streets to hide in, and a neighborhood full of nooks and crannies necessary to run from (or stop) Michael.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Haddonfield Heights trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2iqQykoqB8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2iqQykoqB8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As a civilian, you will have to scavenge for supplies, guide residents to safety, and locate a phone to call the police before the time runs out in Haddonfield Heights. And if you're playing as Michael, you can expect to prowl the shadows and use abilities like Shape Jump to traverse through the neighborhood unseen and strike without warning.&nbsp;</p><p>"This neighborhood allowed us to reimage the tension of Haddonfield in a way that feels both intimate and terrifying," IllFonic design director Jordan Mathewson writes in a press release. "We wanted players to feel the comfort of the neighborhood they recognize from the film right before we turn it into a panic. Every hedge, hallway, and backyard was built to heighten suspense and reward clever play, whether you're hunting or being hunted."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A new Den of Wolves gameplay trailer has been revealed at tonight's PC Gaming Show, showcasing fans of 10 Chambers' previous titles tackling a heist within a giant robot factory in the upcoming co-operative FPS.</p>
<p>The trailer, splicing player reactions and gameplay, showcases a little bit of the pre-heist stealth gameplay, as well as live firefights and mechanical Sentinels wiping out the squad. The trailer ends with a call to wishlist the game, with no release date stated.</p>
<p>On the topic of the release date, communications director Robin Björkell and 10 Chambers co-founder Oscar J-T Holm explained why a release date is yet to be provided</p>

<p>Björkell stated: "I've been begging management to give us a release window for Den of Wolves in the trailer - but no. They won't budge. These developers really don't want to make promises they can't keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer. We invited some of our most loyal fans to come to our office and play the game. This is real footage of them playing the game - not scripted, not us playing. The game does exist - ask them"</p><p>Oscar J-T Holm followed up with: "Even though we've not conducted any closed or public playtests yet, Den of Wolves has over half a million wishlists. We're so grateful for our community's support, and we can't wait to show more details about the game. The reason we're shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with GTFO, which was delayed multiple times. We don't think it's fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gtfo-developer-10-chambers-has-a-co-op-heist-fps-in-pre-production">Den of Wolves was first teased in August 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/den-of-wolves">and later revealed in December that same year</a>. Even then, any hint at a release date was dispelled with a "ready when it's ready" approach. It seems those looking for a new heist game will have to wait patiently a little longer.</p>

            <guid>1373587</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Spirit’s rising star (if you don’t count him as arisen yet, anyway), Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets, has penned his name even deeper into the Counter-Strike history books at the Starladder Budapest Major. The young competitor threw out a stunning performance on Train against Team Liquid in the third (ongoing) stage of the Major in Hungary.</p>



<p>The Russian rifler opened up the clash with a pistol ace, setting a dominant tone and sending viewers wild. That performance persisted throughout the unravelling of the map, and by the time the dust had settled, donk had racked up his <strong>best map performance ever </strong>at a CS2 Major.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"></a></figure>







<h2 id="h-a-new-benchmark-for-donk-and-everyone-else">A New Benchmark for Donk – And Everyone Else</h2>



<p>By the end of regulation against Team Liquid, donk had amassed a whopping 30 kills and only 11 deaths, but that’s just where these stunning stats <strong>begin</strong>. His HLTV rating came out at 2.38, the highest of his Major run thus far, and he was considered a huge force of momentum for Team Spirit’s win.</p>



<p>This Train performance surpassed his previous benchmark, which he set on Mirage against Imperial at the Copenhagen Major in 2024.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Donk’s pistol ace in Budapest is an easy notch on his belt, and it’s yet another clipped onto his total run of aces at the Majors he has attended. In Shanghai in 2024, the young competitor put up a massive <strong>four aces in a single tournament</strong>, which included an awe-inspiring 1v5 slam.</p>



<p>Team Spirit closed out the map against Team Liquid with a 13:8 victory, pushing further through the third stage of the Starladder Budapest Major.</p>



<p>For donk, this was more than just another win; it was another career-defining moment that showcases his consistency and ability to deliver. Right now, it’s obvious to see why many regard him as a growing GOAT of Counter-Strike.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#908)—Clues and Answers for Friday, December 5]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-5-908/</link>
            <guid>1373584</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and while that means the weekend is within spitting distance, it also means that you’ve got a whole new NYT Connections puzzle to dominate today. Fortunately, I’ve arrived with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to get the puzzle resolved as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to get the notes and hints you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle without too much fuss.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #908:</p>



<ul>
<li>SORRY</li>



<li>TOUGH</li>



<li>DEAL</li>



<li>BABY</li>



<li>SWEET</li>



<li>STICKY</li>



<li>PILLOW</li>



<li>STORY</li>



<li>MASTERMIND</li>



<li>SMALL</li>



<li>DELICATE</li>



<li>OPERATION</li>



<li>COMPLEX</li>



<li>STATUS</li>



<li>MOUSE TRAP</li>



<li>SITUATION</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of situations or problems that aren’t straightforward.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>These are terms you’d use when describing “how things stand” in a given moment.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are titles you’d recognize from family game nights or childhood play.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – E<em>ach of these words pairs naturally with “talk” to form a familiar expression.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 5:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-5-908">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 5 (#908)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– COMPLEX, DELICATE, STICKY, TOUGH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DEAL, SITUATION, STATUS, STORY</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – MASTERMIND, MOUSE TRAP, OPERATION, SORRY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BABY, PILLOW, SMALL, SWEET</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

While players continue to develop their settlement, story-driven quests, time-sensitive expeditions, and dynamic fog surges can shift entire strategies in a moment.</p><p>The main antagonist is an enigmatic fog, which impacts citizens’ health and morale, and is modeled using custom voxel grid technology, creating dynamic and unpredictable fog shifts. A once-thriving society faced a life-threatening enemy when this mysterious mist swept across the lands, warping their minds and consuming everything. In a desperate attempt for survival, those who still stood fled upwards towards the treetops, and rebuilt their homes above the deadly haze. The game’s heavy atmosphere is paired with ambisonic audio cues that intensify the sense of dread, all woven together by the haunting compositions of legendary musician Akira Yamaoka.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p><em>Neath</em> is a roguelike tactical RPG set in a decaying world shadowed by an irradiated, inverted tower.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/838428/metroid-prime-4-analysis-open-world-nintendo</link>
            <guid>1373539</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is finally out after a long and difficult development — and despite some bright spots, the game really shows its age.</p><p>Nintendo has a long and celebrated history of doing things its own way. During the original Switch era, going back to<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em> in 2017, Nintendo has focused on bringing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/707449/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-design-open-world">open-world style exploration elements</a> to many of its major releases. That strategy has worked very well, breathing new life into storied franchises like <em>Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Mario Kart</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. But it hasn’t quite added the same revolutionary touch to <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p><p>In all of the other games that got the open-world-style treatment, those elements were additive to the experience. Exploring vast stretches of Hyrule in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, for example, inevitably led to some kind of new discovery — a shrine to crack, a korok to uncover, or a treasure to find. We had never seen Hyrule rendered like that on a Nintendo console, and it was neat to traipse about it and take it all in.</p><p>In <em>Beyond</em>, though, that kind of exploration is more of a chore than a treat. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch">In his review</a>, Andrew Webster described the desert hub world Samus travels through as “a bare and boring place.” There are things to discover, but they’re no more than mile markers on a long stretch of desert.</p><p>The problem is that for the type of game <em>Metroid</em> is, free-roaming exploration doesn’t work, or at least not in this execution. In the early hours of <em>Beyond</em>, while zipping across the desert on the extremely cool-looking VI-O-LA bike, I encountered a wrecked structure belching smoke. After taking care of a few enemies, I looked around to see if there was any puzzle to solve or treasure to take, only to find nothing. There seemed to be <em>something</em> higher up that I could interact with, but I couldn’t reach it. So I left.</p><p>A Metroidvania gates progression behind power-ups. When you encounter a roadblock, that’s typically your signal to come back later. That works in a closed environment like the biomes of Viewros, the new planet Samus explores, but it kills momentum in an open world because there’s no guaranteed payoff for your time. It makes the world feel emptier in a way it didn’t for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. In those games, I knew that my noodling would net me something more than bug gunk all over my sleek biker suit power armor. I could probably return to that crash site when I have whatever required power, but I don’t feel compelled to go back.</p><p>I’m also really annoyed with <em>Beyond</em>’s illusion of choice. In your first time zooming across the desert, a colleague named Mackenzie, speaking with an authority that sounds like a message to the player from the developers, says that you can go wherever you want next. But when I did that, I immediately hit a wall of fire I could not pass. It felt like the developers were playing a prank on me, like, “lol, we <em>said</em> you could go anywhere but we really want you to come back when you have the right stuff.” <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> wouldn’t do me like that.</p><p>Another element that demonstrates just how late Nintendo is to the party is the companions. They are all too quick to tell Samus what to do, where to go, and what she’s doing wrong. That kind of guideposting was and still is all the rage in big-budget action-adventure games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14665114/horizon-zero-dawn-review-ps4"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, and it can be helpful when you get stuck. But part of <em>Metroid</em>’s appeal is using your wits and skills to figure shit out on your own.</p><div><p>I don’t need you to show me how to get back to Fury Green. I’ve been there several times already! </p></div><p>All that goes out the window, though, when Mackenzie, your primary companion, chimes in with tips unannounced and unasked for, condescending to both me and Samus. Samus Aran is the baddest bounty hunter this side of Zebes, a fact everyone around her acknowledges except when it’s time for her to do the very things they all rightfully venerate her for. No, Mackenzie, I don’t need you to show me how to get back to Fury Green. I’ve been there several times already!</p><div><p>Nintendo’s biggest mistake with <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, though, is that it feels too much like the original <em>Metroid Prime </em>trilogy. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Nintendo’s other recent major mascot titles is that they all share the same basic structure of their predecessors, but have some new twist that makes the old feel new. With <em>Odyssey</em>, it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Cappy’s transformation powers</a>. In<em> Tears of the Kingdom</em>, it was the Ultrahand powers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115898/tears-of-the-kingdom-physics-gameplay-design-gdc-2024">working in tandem with the physics engine</a> to create <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23734533/zelda-totk-controls-weapons-fuse-rewiring-brain">unique emergent gameplay experiences</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23737921/tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-physics-game-devs-explain/">that felt magical</a>. In <em>Bananza</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">the simplicity of being able to break nearly everything on screen</a> did the same.</p></div><p>Nintendo gave you weird, often simple tools and let you loose on the world, and it resulted in some of the best games the company has ever made. There’s none of that in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>. The psychic powers Samus gets are mere remixes of powers she’s had before. A psychic lasso is just a spicy grapple beam.</p><p><em>Beyond</em> isn’t without merit, because there’s still nothing quite like the <em>Prime</em> brand of 3D exploration. But it seems that eight years and a development reboot should yield something more impressive than this, especially considering the treatment Nintendo has given its other franchises. In <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, the old doesn’t feel new, and the new doesn’t feel good.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/838428/metroid-prime-4-analysis-open-world-nintendo]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you were Senior Floor Manager of Earth, and a weird planet innocently appeared on the fringe of our solar system, what would you do? I would probably not zip out there and plant a factory on that planet, in much the same way that I wouldn’t high-five a bear-shaped shadow on the edge of a campsite. But I am not the modder behind beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> mod Ultracube, who is now part of game developer Dubious Design.</p>
<p>The latter have just announced the very Factorio-esque Substructure, which is being published by Hooded Horse. A new Hooded Horse joint tends to get a certain automatic level of attention round these parts. We’re partial to factory sims, too. Substructure seals the deal by sort of being a horror game as well. I mean, they’re not actually calling it that, but it seems creepy as balls. The trailer below sees whole segments of production line sinking below the surface like Atlantis.</p>

<p>It’s a factory sim in which you slowly colonise the layers of the aforesaid weird planet, constructing new production lines on each level. As players of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> will know, striking the earth tends to make it strike back, but there <em>is</em> a lot of cool stuff down there you can use for upgrades. Please do your best to get hold of that stuff, while avoiding the stuff that has teeth.</p><p>You can expect both the routine smokestacks and industrialised agriculture, which makes for a relatively picturesque factory sim. You can program the elevators, though the press release doesn’t go into details, and there’s co-op too. As you’d expect given the dev’s pedigree, the press release makes a big deal of the mod support. “From day one, add new resources, buildings, or just balance the game as desired!” it trills.</p>
<p>You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3012600/Substructure">Steam</a>. A little more on Dubious Design: they’re based in the UK, and consist of two people. “May the future be dubious,” the developers declare in announcement materials. I like the energy, but I would like the future to at least contain an early access release date.</p>

<p>You're a person in a big spiky car with guns or missiles. The folks you're racemurdering as you drive around are also in big spiky cars with guns or missiles. One of these 15 big spiky cars with upgradeable guns or missiles is a not-quite VW camper van dubbed "Iron Lady". Finally, a chance for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/send-thatcher-back-to-hell-in-this-new-doom-2-mod-today">Margaret Thatcher's evil powers</a> to be used for good.</p>
<p>"By day, the skyline smolders; by night, zombie hordes - the Wasted - flood every avenue and turn them into kill-zones," reads the synopsis. "Your only way out is to win the Carmageddon: a chain of lethal underground races whose champion earns a shot at the last spaceport beyond the mountains."</p>
<p>Making that escape means fighting your way through roguelike runs of car murder, battling through districts bossed by the likes of "corrupted enforcers, supermutated Wasteds, and monstrous war machines". Between runs, you spend beatcoins on building the perfect combo of car, weapon, and perks. There are 13 different kinds of deathbringer, including shotguns, railguns, and lasers if you want to get all fancy. Progression's permanent, and it sounds as if you'll be reincarnated as a slightly stronger driver each time you pop your clogs.</p><p>Having taken in the trailer, it looks like it could offer me the sort of Wreckfesty rush I regularly crave, though that'll largely depend on how satisfying the cars handle and smash together. The weapons'll also need to be sufficiently weighty. As of writing, I've only ever given the demo of 34BigThings's Wipeouty spaceship racer Redout a go, and I recall that not quite scratching my itch as much as its classic inspiration in what was a very limited sample, to be fair.</p>
<p>Rogue Shift's certainly one I'll be keeping an eye on, though, because its premise sounds like it could be killer if executed as well as your average murdercampervan missile barrage.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Outer Worlds 2 Gave Me Exactly What I Wanted From An RPG Inventory System And I Hated It]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641</link>
            <guid>1373527</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I was running around somewhere in Golden Ridge,</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"> <i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i></a><span>’s second major location, when I dared to look up a question that had been tickling the back of my brain for several hours: Does </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> have an inventory carry capacity limit?</span></p> <p><span>I was afraid to learn the answer. The odds that it was what I wanted to hear were not in my favor. What I wanted is practically unheard of in Western-style action role-playing games. But there were encouraging signs from the first dozen or so hours of my initial playthrough that this time might be a rare exception. I’d made it through Paradise Island, the game’s first open area, without sparing a thought about how much loot I was carrying. I couldn’t find the genre-typical “infinite home base storage chest” anywhere on my ship. I scoured the game’s inventory menu for tiny numbers I might have missed with a more casual glance. Nothing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Cautiously, I typed my question into a search engine. And there it was, the answer I hadn’t dared hope for: No, it doesn’t. I could steal as much superfluous crap from the various corpses, human and animal alike, I left in my wake as I wanted; I could stuff my pockets with all the wild plants, spare mechanical bits, and errant severed arms I came across and I’d never have to schlep it all the way back to a settlement or my ship to sell or store everything just to clear some space so I could pick up more junk and do it all over again. I could simply hoard it all, every tiny piece of trash and bulky piece of armor, and never have to worry about weight limits. It was exactly what I wanted. And by the time the credits finally rolled, I had come to hate it.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650644" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650644"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650644">Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In early role-playing video games, inventory limits and encumbrance were necessary due to the limited memory and file sizes of cartridges and discs. Annoying but understandable. But many modern action RPGs still have inventory limits even when they aren’t a technical necessity.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some game designers point to realism as an explanation; as</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-the-kotaku-review-1703766283"> <i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i></a><span> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz told</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/encumbrance-sucks-so-why-is-it-still-so-common/"> <i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, “Having a limit to how much equipment Geralt can carry plays a part in making the character and the world around him more believable.” It’s possible to take this too far, though, as</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-says-it-plans-to-fix-fallout-76-s-item-storage-1830321275"> <i><span>Fallout 76</span></i></a><span> and</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-news-iv-inventory-bag-management-1850722800"> <i><span>Diablo 4</span></i></a> <span>proved with their way-too-small carry capacities. </span><span>No one wants to spend more time rummaging through inventory screens than gleefully chopping off monsters’ heads.</span></p>

 <p><span>The realism argument makes sense, but I’ve never found it especially compelling. I grew up almost exclusively playing point-and-click adventure video games where reading and critical thinking were a major part of the gameplay, and when I finally made the jump to action RPGs, I was immediately taken by them because of how gloriously constant, quick, and varied the dopamine hits were. I didn’t have to wait for the payoff of sometimes tedious puzzles or long-winded interrogations. I could just run around, pick something up, and marvel at the new thing I had, whether it was useful to me or not.</span></p>

 <p><span>I was enamored with these types of games because of how open they were, how few limits there were on what I could do or how I could solve a problem. That’s why I’ve always found inventory limits such a huge point of frustration. It’s not going to break immersion for me if my character has some sort of magical, unspecified access to all their equipment while moving around in the world. Thinking about how much equipment my character could realistically carry and where they would store all of it is not integral to my role-playing experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>If anything, forcing me to stop and manage my inventory is </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> immersion-breaking for the type of gameplay I’m seeking. I’ll only craft something if I can’t find a strong enough stock weapon, and I’ll only visit a vendor if I need to sell something. Games with encumbrance systems always force me to do at least one of those two things. They add busy work without interesting trade-offs. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> let me skip that entirely.</span></p> <p><span>Tim Cain, co-director of the original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-outer-worlds-will-rattle-your-idea-of-a-perfect-pla-1839238442"><i><span>Outer Worlds</span></i></a><span>, which was released in 2019, looks at carrying capacity limits from a more practical perspective. As he told</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-game-designers-handle-the-burden-of-encumbrance"> <i><span>Game Developer</span></i></a><span>, “[Without encumbrance,] You end up with enormous inventory sizes and there’s the issue of well, how do you manage that? And there’s different ways. You can say ‘Well, we’ll limit how much they can pick up,’ but you’ve now done encumbrance. You’ve just given it a hard limit. Or you can say, ‘We’ll break things down into categories or we’ll let things stack,’ but then you’ve just introduced all these extra issues of now you have pages of inventory or categories, or stacks of items.”</span></p> <p><span>Notably, </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> does limit how much stuff a player can carry around with them, but offers unlimited storage on their ship, which is a pretty common compromise for inventory systems in RPGs, but which is still, to my mind, an absolute pain in the ass. I wasn’t the only one relieved to see the sequel ditch it. “</span><span>Honestly it’s kinda a breath of fresh air not having to worry,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og5wps/anyone_else_happy_and_surprised_theres_no/"><span>wrote</span></a><span> one player praising the decision on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og5wps/comment/nle7o49/"><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> subreddit</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650643" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650643"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650643">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Somewhere around three-quarters of the way through </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, a block of text popped up on my screen. My employer, the Earth Directorate, had found a flaw in me. I had used a single heavy machine gun for so long without switching weapons that the game was calling me out via one of its most unique and compelling mechanics: the flaw system, which triggers when you meet certain gameplay conditions and offers you a significant boost in exchange for a permanent debuff. </span></p> <p><span>This time, it offered me a bonus to armor penetration in exchange for losing my second weapon slot, which is, I think, a pretty good deal, but I was annoyed that the game had correctly identified a deep-seated insecurity that I have, which is that, left to my own devices, I am a bad and lazy gamer, so I quickly turned it down and tried unsuccessfully to put it out of my mind.</span></p>

 <p><span>After that, out of spite, I started sneaking around and bopping unsuspecting enemies over the head with a frightfully high-damage telescoping baton that had the added bonus of being topped with the head of the Auntie’s Choice Moon Man mascot to add a bit of whimsy to the proceedings. As much as I hated to admit it, it was pretty fun. And then I started investigating what else I was missing out on.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, my beloved heavy machine gun was pretty good when it came to damage, but its ammo capacity was relatively small. Maybe I could craft a mod that could change that? Once I started interacting with those systems, I finally realized how much I had been floating through the game without really engaging with it and how detrimental that experience had been compared to playing RPGs that imposed limits. I was just running around, picking up stuff I’d never use, and telling myself I’d sort it out later, which I never did.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650647">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>By the time I finished </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, I was carrying 142 weapons, 110 pieces of armor, and 98 helmets. Many of those were duplicates: I had an egregious seven identical copies of a single uniform that I hadn’t worn once. I’d put on a wonderfully daffy-looking helmet and robes I found in a hidden cache on Golden Ridge somewhere around the midpoint of the game and wore them straight through to the end because they were good enough and looking at them made me giggle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I collected the 25 unique tossball cards I needed to get access to a vendor’s exclusive inventory and then didn’t buy any of it because I didn’t want to bother learning what each item could do. Consequently, I never got to experience the admittedly gimmicky but still very cool effect of putting on one of that vendor’s helmets and</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/outer-worlds-2-new-point-of-view-mk2/"> <span>having the game’s graphics turn into pixel art</span></a><span>. Many of the game’s most unique, bizarre, and delightful weapons sat untouched in my inventory because I’d chosen the path of least resistance. It didn’t feel good.</span></p> <p><span>I keep thinking about what my experience playing </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> would have been like if carrying a lot of stuff was a flaw. Maybe the game would tell me I’m a pack-rat, decrease the price vendors are willing to pay me for anything I sell them, and increase the chance of finding weapons and armor with a mod already installed. I’d probably turn it down—and then head off to the nearest shop to sell all my duplicates and finally start thinking about the way I interact with the game again.</span></p>

It’s just really funny how emphatic he is about it.</p> <p>“No, I haven’t sat down to play the games,” he told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/i-havent-sat-down-to-play-the-games-and-i-wont-fallouts-walton-goggins-says-he-not-interested-in-playing-the-rpgs-his-show-is-based-on/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a> ahead of season 2’s release later this month. “And I won’t. I won’t. I won’t play the games. I’m not interested.”</p> <p>He sounds pretty sure.</p> <p>Goggins plays the pre-nuclear holocaust movie star Cooper Howard turned post-apocalyptic Ghoul. Those mutated humans play a huge role in the lore of the Fallout universe. <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/24uIqswESsK1aunG5a2oyS/fallout-76-ghoul-within-release-notes">An update</a> to<em> Fallout 76</em> earlier this year made Ghouls playable in the ongoing survival MMO. An update earlier this week even <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-big-update-new-region-burning-springs-the-ghoul-walton-goggins-amazon-2000630640">added Goggins’ Ghoul</a> as a new character voiced by the <em>Righteous Gemstones</em> co-star himself.</p>

 <p>The actor says he has a good reason for not trudging through hundreds of hours of open-world RPG malarkey. He doesn’t want it to spoil his interpretation of the character and the world he inhabits.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation may have leaked the official release date of Romeo is a Dead Man. The leak comes only a day before the game’s dedicated presentation by the developer.</p>



<p>Revealed during June 2025’s State of Play, the action-packed Romeo is a Dead Man is the next title from Grasshopper Manufacture. Led by No More Heroes creator Suda51, it looks like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romeo-is-a-deadman-avoiding-firm-release-date-because-of-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a wild thrill ride</a>, fitting for the creator and his resume. The bloody action title was met with positive reactions from fans and critics after an initial preview. A presentation regarding the game is set for December 5th, but it seems PlayStation might have leaked one of the big announcements: its release date.</p>







<h2 id="h-romeo-is-a-dead-man-releasing-in-february-playstation-leak-states">Romeo is a Dead Man Releasing in February, PlayStation Leak States</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Romeo is a Dead Man release date leak comes from <strong>PlayStation itself and the PlayStation app</strong>. It was first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1996636997373644861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HazzadorGaming on Twitter/X</a>. When you click on the game on the app, instead of the 2026 or ‘Just Announced’ filler used for the icon, it says <strong>February 11th, 2026</strong>. Furthermore, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official PlayStation store</a> <strong>mentions the date as well</strong>, giving more leeway to it. However, it’s important to note that is is not official yet, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>It’s likely PlayStation jumped the gun on the reveal, which would’ve likely been revealed at the presentation. The ‘Grasshopper Direct’ is only five minutes and solely focused on Romeo is a Dead Man. Regardless, fans will still see new gameplay and such, so not all has been spoiled. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> slowly approaching, hopefully, no other games will get release date leaks. Even still, this does mean that, if true, players can add Romeo is a Dead Man to their 2026 must-plays.</p>

<p><strong>“We are bringing something fresh to the franchise and the racing genre,” </strong>game director Giuseppe Enrico Franchi said. <strong>“Carmageddon means explore, experiment, paint the streets red and crumple up opponents. We want our players to adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on zombie hordes with glee behind the wheel of a killing machine.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Rogue Shift will hit with those who fondly remember the legendary series, and those who are discovering it for the first time – reignited, reinvented and more thrilling than ever.”</strong></p>



<p>While no release date has been announced yet, it was confirmed that the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. It’ll also be available for GeForce NOW subscribers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The legendary Carmageddon engine roars back to life, reimagined for a new era of vehicular combat.</p><p><em>Carmageddon</em> smashes back with brutal roguelite vehicular‑combat mayhem. Adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on post‑apocalyptic zombie hordes. The legacy lives on, reinvented and unforgiving.</p><p><strong>The Long Night</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The year is 2050, and the world you know is a post‑apocalyptic wasteland.</p><p>Hordes of nightmare creatures, the Wasted, lay siege to humanity. Every night, the streets are overrun, forcing everyone to barricade themselves in their skyscraper-homes for <a title="Genres > Survival [489 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>.</p><p>There is just one chance to escape all this: the Carmageddon.</p><p>These deadly races promise power, prestige, and valuable prizes to the participants. Most importantly, the champion wins the right to attempt the perilous journey that leads to the spaceport beyond the mountains. The only one left, the only chance to flee this dying world.</p><p>You enter the <em>Carmageddon</em> as one of countless racers, equipped with little more than a rust bucket, scavenged fuel, and a makeshift weapon. You’ll face off against rival gangs like the Autoscum and other rogues in a fight for survival. Each destruction race is an opportunity to win parts and upgrades, a step towards the ultimate escape.</p><p>As the night descends, the Wasted take the streets, and you with them.</p><p><strong>Drive to Survive</strong></p><p>The original <em>Carmageddon</em> spirit of vehicular mayhem has been refined and redesigned. We looked at the past and the present to create a visceral, fast and accessible form of combat racing.</p><ul><li><strong>15 Upgradeable Vehicles</strong> – FWD, RWD, and AWD, each with unique weight and suspension</li><li><strong><a title="Platforms > Meta [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l‑on‑Metal Car Combat</strong> – Crash, shove, boost and side‑bash rivals</li><li><strong>13 Weapon Classes</strong> – From shotguns to railguns, all fully upgradable</li><li><strong>Over 80 Perks</strong> – Craft outrageous synergies for destruction racing supremacy</li><li><strong>Dynamic Weather and Day‑Night Cycle</strong> – Rain slicks the tarmac, fog shrouds ambushes</li><li><strong>Elite and Boss Events</strong> – Colossal war‑rigs, corrupted Enforcers, and endless zombie hordes</li><li><strong>Extensive Visual Damage Model</strong> – Windshields, hood, doors, bumpers and trunk lid will bend, crumple, hang and detach.</li></ul><p><strong>The Roguelite Campaign</strong></p><p>Every Campaign run offers a unique journey through a randomly generated graph.</p><p>Win Events and smash opponents to gain Credits. Maneuvers such as killing Wasteds, drifts, jumps, and flicks also grant rewards.</p><p>Strategically plan your route so you can reach Shops. In these safe havens you can repair your car, swap weapons, or install one of the 80+ unlockable perks.</p><p>Adapt to the dynamically increasing difficulty and conquer elite events and bosses.</p><p>With branching paths, varied objectives, and ever-changing time-of-day and weather conditions, no two runs are the same.</p><p>But the <em>Carmageddon</em> ain’t over when your vehicle is wrecked. Another driver will step up, and the challenge will resume anew, in a typical roguelite loop. Earn Beatcoins to unlock permanent bonuses and new content between runs in the Black Market. Find synergies between these elements to create the ultimate killing machine: the Carmageddon never ends.</p><p><strong>Opponents</strong></p><p>The Carmageddon hosts a diverse assembly of marauders, rejects, and lowlifes. Some prefer to rush in front of the pack. Others will chase you and try to bash you out of the way. Some will wait for the chance to unload their weapons into your car. Some are more skilled or better prepared than others. You may recognize some familiar names in the crowd.</p><p>Corrupt police forces known as the Enforcers impose their brutal rules on those spared from mutation. The Enforcers will force you off the road to strip your car for spare parts and ammo, if you let them.</p><p>Each area of the city is controlled by a particularly fierce opponent, commonly known as “the Boss”. These are the biggest, baddest, fastest, more armed vehicles that you can find. The rules of the Carmageddon demand that you beat each Boss before advancing to the next stage.</p><p>Every race is a brutal test of skill, demanding you master driving, melee, and ranged attacks against a diverse and unpredictable roster of foes. To do so, you must work on your car, find upgrades and weapons that combine well together, and consistently perform behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>The Wasted</strong></p><p>The Third World War and a series of devastating natural disasters left Earth in ruins. Amidst the chaos, a food supplement called MiVis was introduced to address food shortages, and became a ubiquitous part of daily life.</p><p>However, long-term consumption of MiVis led to a horrific cellular mutation, transforming people into Wasted – monstrous, empty husks consumed by the supplement’s side effects.</p><p>Now, they have become a mass of unsentient, super-aggressive beings that threaten survivors as soon as the sun starts to set.</p><p>A lone Wasted is no match for your chariot of fury. Things start to heat up when more Wasteds show up. Boost into the hordes of humanoid husks swarming the track, parting the waves of Wasted like a Moses on wheels! But be careful not to get stuck in the high tide: too many Wasteds will surround your car and smash it to bits with the remains of their raw hands.</p><p>And then there are Special Wasteds… horrible supermutations of the Wasted, morphed into something even less human.</p><p>They may explode, shoot you from a distance, lunge at your car, or produce even nastier surprises.</p><p>They pose a real danger and tend to show up late at night.</p><p>And then, there’s the ultimate abomination. A creature whispered about, rarely seen; the monster that guards the only mountain pass towards salvation, and your final challenge.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/carmageddon-rogue-shift-launches-in-early-2026-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">announced its upcoming Steam Machine hardware last month</a>, some eagle-eyed gamers may have been surprised to see that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">the official spec sheet</a> lists support for HDMI 2.0 output, rather than the updated, higher-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 standard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/hdmi-2-1-spec-released-ushering-in-new-era-of-dynamic-hdr-video/">introduced in 2017</a>. Now, Valve tells Ars that, while the hardware itself actually supports HDMI 2.1, the company is struggling to offer full support for that standard due to Linux drivers that are “still a work-in-progress on the software side.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/hdmi-forum-to-amd-no-you-cant-make-an-open-source-hdmi-2-1-driver/">we noted last year</a>, the HDMI Forum (which manages the official specifications for HDMI standards) has officially blocked any open source implementation of HDMI 2.1. That means the open source AMD drivers used by SteamOS can’t fully implement certain features that are specific to the updated output standard.</p>
<p>“At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements,” AMD engineer Alex Deucher said at the time.</p>
<h2>Doing what they can</h2>
<p>This situation has caused significant headaches for Valve, which tells Ars it has had to validate the Steam Machine’s HDMI 2.1 hardware via Windows during testing. And when it comes to HDMI performance via SteamOS, a Valve representative tells Ars that “we’ve been working on trying to unblock things there.”</p>
<p>That includes unblocking HDMI 2.0’s resolution and frame-rate limits, which <a href="https://www.extron.com/article/hdmi2faq">max out at 60 Hz for a 4K output</a>, according to the official standard. Valve tells Ars it has been able to increase that limit to the “4K @ 120Hz” listed on the Steam Machine spec sheet, though, thanks to a technique called <a href="https://www.cablematters.com/Blog/HDMI/a-comprehensive-guide-to-chroma-subsampling?srsltid=AfmBOooodBYO5jloAUOgV_BWD8o479zIqMeMVxuI9lO9vsXT29AVrfEW">chroma sub-sampling</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Normally, releasing a game is a cause for celebration for a developer, but two months after launch, Wreckreation studio Three Fields Entertainment is facing some hard times. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-ugcPost-7402348124054376448-Yfpq/">a post from its CEO on LinkedIn</a> (which we learned about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wreckreation-maker-three-fields-entertainment-puts-whole-studio-on-redundancy-notice">thanks to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>), </a>the entire studio's staff is currently "on notice for redundancy."&nbsp;</p><p>"Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career," CEO Fiona Sperry's post reads. "After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy."</p><p>The post goes on to detail the company's financial status. Despite the game being published by THQ Nordic, Sperry claims the studio has had to self-fund "most of this year and all of the post launch content," and after doing so for months, leadership "simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form." As a result, the post is both a public announcement of the redundancies and a call to potential business partners that can help fund the studio as it finds its footing.</p><p>"My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," Sperry's post continues. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team. I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it."</p><p>Three Fields Entertainment was founded in 2014 by former developers of the Burnout series. Since then, it's developed games like Dangerous Golf, Lethal VR, Danger Zone 1 and 2, and Dangerous Driving. Its latest game, Wreckreation, launched on October 28 to a relatively lukewarm response, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/wreckreation/">sitting at a 62 on Metacritic</a>. If you want to check it out for yourself, you can pick it up on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, or PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/wreckreation-studio-three-fields-entertainment-founded-by-former-burnout-devs-puts]]></content:encoded>
