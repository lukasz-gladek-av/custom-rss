<p>PC gaming is outgrowing console gaming when it comes to total number of players.</p>



<p>In the 2025 PC and Console Gaming Report from <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Newzoo</a>, global data indicates that more players started playing games on PC than they did on console. According to the report, PC player numbers rose 3.9% year-over-year (YoY) from 873.5 million to 907.5 million in 2024. Console players growth, on the other hand, while still up, only grew 2.3% from 615.6 million to 629.5 million.</p>



<p>Looking to the future, Newzoo projects that player growth will steadily continue to rise for 2025 and through 2027. It projects that PC numbers will increase to around 930.1 million this year while console players will jump to 653.1 million. By the end of 2027, Newzoo suggests that PC and console player numbers will be around 971.7 million and 698 million, respectively.</p>

<p>Despite PC players growing at a higher rate and there being more of them, console revenue was slightly ahead of PC. In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/console-gaming-revenue-fell-in-2024-thanks-to-premium-game-revenue-dropping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console gaming made $42.8 billion</a> in revenue while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC gaming came</a> in at $37.3 billion. With a total of $80.2 billion for the year, that was a bit less than the $81.9 billion in revenue in 2023. Still, it’s expected that gaming revenue in general will grow in 2025 to $85.2 billion. By 2027, Newzoo expects revenue to surpass $92 billion for the year.</p>



<p>A reason for the increase in overall gaming revenue projections? New hardware. The Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025 and the expected new hardware around 2027 will lead to more gaming purchases for players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/free-to-play-mythic-sci-fi-action-rpg-black-beacon-is-out-now-on-ios-and-android<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Lead a squad of heroes on a journey through time.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Beacon is the newest title from publisher Glohow that recently launched on mobile devices. It’s a mythic sci-fi action RPG with a story that sees you travel through time and visit different eras of history to try to prevent catastrophe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this world, there are mysterious substances known as beacons that seemingly defy logic — they change size, shape, and texture depending on who’s observing them and how they’re observed. What stays consistent is their abyssal black color (which gives the game its name) and the fact that anomalies accompany them wherever they’re found.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/black-beacon-gameplay-1-1743705548457.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout human history, the phenomena these beacons created have been considered miracles or revelations, causing them to be worshipped as sacred objects. Ancient humans embedded them in obelisks, sealed them under temples, or cast them into stained glass frames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the background lore, but the story of Black Beacon picks up with you playing the Seer. You’ve been entrusted with the key to the Library of Babel, which is essentially an endless labyrinth that contains all possible permutations of the past, present, and future. You get a vision of a disastrous future, setting you on your time-traveling path to prevent it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/black-beacon-gameplay-3-1743713753488.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To accomplish that, you’ll need to gather a team of heroes. That starts with Zero and Ereshan, who will join up with you at the beginning of the story. Zero is a mysterious guardian of the Library of Babel who shows little emotion and doesn’t seem to care about worldly events. Ereshan is the granddaughter of the former director of the Library of Babel who was stripped of her inheritance when Zero showed up, leading to loathing that has since cooled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll have the opportunity to add plenty of other characters to your crew, from the affable Nanna to the intimidating Shamash to the elegant Viola. There’s more than 10 characters available at launch, with more to be added in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re able to take three characters into each combat encounter; you only control one at a time, but can switch between them on the fly. Each character’s abilities are on individual cooldowns, so you need to swap them in and out quickly and efficiently to chain their attacks and abilities together in fluid combat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/black-beacon-gameplay-2-1743705859398.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The main story progresses in chapters that are further broken down into several stages, some of which are purely cutscenes while others are combat stages. Both advance the story forward and include full voice acting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you complete stages, you’ll earn rewards that can be used to improve characters or their weapons. Skill books are used to level up characters, and they each have unique abilities you can also level up. Once characters reach a certain level threshold, you’ll need certain items to let them “breakthrough” that threshold and continue gaining levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weapons have a similar system. Each weapon starts with an innate rarity measured in a star level, up to 5 stars. You can level up weapons to a certain threshold, then use items to “breakthrough” that threshold and both power up the weapon and increase its star rating.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/black-beacon-gameplay-4-1743713807419.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can earn more of the items necessary for character and weapon progression outside of the main story in the Resources mode, which you can select from the main menu. You can choose to focus on items to level up, increase skills, or break through thresholds. Whichever version you choose, you’ll get new combat encounters that provide rewards for completion as well as goals specific to that stage, like completing it within a certain amount of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also an EX mode, which basically acts as a tutorial to teach you how to use particular characters and a practice space to get better with them. And if you want to take a break and just hang out with some of the characters in your squad, you can do that too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Beacon is available now for free through the App Store on iOS, Google Play on Android, and through Google Play Games if you prefer to play on a PC client.

Battle your way across China with three new campaigns, commanding the forces of Shu, Wei, and Wu, each with their unique units, technologies, and heroes with devastating abilities. Additionally, explore medieval history on the fringes of China with two new civilizations: the Jurchens and Khitans!</p><p><strong>Five New Civilizations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shu</strong> – Take the reins of the Kingdom of Shu and fulfil Liu Bei’s dream of restoring the Han dynasty. The Shu unique units are the White Feather Guard, an infantryman that slows down units it attacks, and the War Chariot, a vehicle that fires barrages of bolts from a large repeating crossbow.</li><li><strong>Wei</strong> – Step into the shoes of Cao Cao and dominate China with massive cavalry armies and nefarious schemes. The Wei unique units are the Tiger Cavalry, a horseman that levels up as it kills units, and the Xianbei Raider, a cavalry archer that fires storms of arrows into the enemy ranks.</li><li><strong>Wu</strong> – Lead the Sun Clan to glory through infantry and naval prowess. The Wu unique units are the Fire Archer, a ranged soldier that fires incendiary arrows, and the Jian Swordsman, a heavy infantry unit whose shield offers immense protection – until it breaks.</li><li><strong>Jurchens</strong> – Dominate the rugged terrain of northeast China with the skilled hunters, armored cavalry, and gunpowder weaponry of the Great Jin dynasty. The Jurchen unique units are the Iron Pagoda, a cavalryman that occasionally blocks melee attacks, and the Grenadier, a foot soldier who hurls deadly incendiary bombs at his enemies.</li><li><strong>Khitans</strong> – Relive the glory of the Liao dynasty and Kara-Khitai, terrorizing your enemies with mobile hordes and diabolical weapons.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> has had a few crossovers in its time since releasing in 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-indie-megahits-combine-in-vampire-survivors-among-us-dlc-out-later-this-month">like with Among Us</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-is-getting-guns-in-a-new-contra-crossover-gun-focused-dlc-called-operation-guns">Contra of all series</a>, and the one that felt like an inevitability, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-to-get-its-biggest-dlc-yet-an-ode-to-castlevania-with-a-sprawling-new-map">Castlevania</a>. The game's latest collab was just announced at this year's Triple-I showcase, and personally it's a bit of a head scratcher: Square Enix's SaGa series. Referred to as the Emerald Diorama update, specifically because of the most recent entry in the series Emerald Beyond, it was introduced with another lovely animated segment showing off a magical catgirl and a battery-looking robot.

<p>
I'm sure they'll mean something to someone, I've never seen them in my life, but I have fallen in love with them immediately. In terms of new gameplay stuff, this was kept pretty brief, but to summarise, there's 40+ new attacks, 16+ new characters and skins, a 7-biome new stage, and glimmer and showstopper mechanics.

<p>
On top of that, The Coop Update is dropping with this one. No, not co-op, coop! Last month poncle teased this update with a gif of a pixel art chicken being killed in a lovely looking field, and a press release confirmed that this in fact said chicken-themed update. The press release also made note of the fact that it has nothing to do with the very different local co-op mode the game already has, and that poncle are still working on online co-op. Lastly, there's a couple of new adventures, one for the base game, one for the Foscari DLC.
</p>
<p>
If you want more details, unfortunately I don't have them, but it's a free update, and it's out today! It should be noted that poncle have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/529839807839340229?l=english">previously said</a> that this update has delayed some other additions, so if there's something you're expecting, don't fret if it's not there. The developer also noted at the time that cross save progress will be coming with this update, so if you own something other than a PC, you'll be able to switch between platforms now. Neat!

<p>Console gaming revenue fell 3.9% year-over-year (YoY) thanks to a 14% YoY drop by premium paid games. This according to the 2025 PC and Console Gaming Report from Newzoo.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report</a>, which takes gaming data from around the world, Premium Games accounted for $19.9 billion in console gaming revenue in 2024. That was still good for 46% of the $42.8 billion in total revenue for year. However, it was the only business model to see a decrease on the platform.</p>



<p>Microtransactions made up 32% of console gaming revenue, pulling in $13.9 billion for the year. That was a 4.5% increase over 2023’s amount. Following behind were subscriptions, which grew 14.1% YoY with $6.9 billion in revenue. Lastly, DLC made up 5% of the total revenue with $2.2 billion. That 5% is still a 2.5% increase compared to 2023.</p>



<p>As far as what led to the growth in revenue for microtransactions and DLC, the report points to six games. On the microtransaction side, Fortnite, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and NBA 2K25 helped push the total up 4.5%. For DLC, it was Elden Ring, Diablo 4, and Destiny 2 leading the way. </p>



<p>Console gaming revenue came in slightly higher than PC, which pulled in $37.3 billion in 2024. It also saw a different trend as PC gaming revenue saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/">58% attributed to microtransactions</a>. </p>



<p>Newzoo’s projections have console gaming revenue predicted to grow to $47.3 billion in 2025 and all the way to $52.4 billion by 2027.</p>

Will the Vampire Survivors be graced by the presence of a vampire?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/10/starward-industries-disaster-adventure-into-the-fire-has-a-hot-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last year, Starward Industries announced the disaster survival adventure Dante’s Ring, but today the studio has confirmed a renaming of its project alongside a new trailer. Dante’s Ring is no more with that name being replaced by Into The Fire. The name aptly fits the game as you play as a firefighter on the volcanic area of <span>Dante’s Archipelago, with the mission to save as many people as possible while also dealing with demons. Into The Fire will be coming to Steam Early Access later this year.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Into the Fire - Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlbEGWwJap0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Into The Fire’s trailer shows just how high stakes everything is. The game’s fire replicates real fire in the way it quickly spreads and consumes things in its path for fuel. With your limited resources, including a fire axe and water, you will need to think on your feet to figure out the best path forward to save those trapped by the flames, while also dealing with the otherworldly influence of the fiery demons that are thriving in this environment. You will be armed with other unique tools including a shotgun that can extinguish flames. Maybe that will help with the pesky demons too. The terrain is not going to be easy to navigate but you will have different modes of transport including a sled and an acid resistant boat.&nbsp; When not in a disaster zone, you will be monitoring things from the Hub. The Hub is your command centre where you will get information, upgrade gear, and plan the rescues using data including seismographs. It will also be a place to rest and take stock of the events you have come across, peeling back the layers to understand the secrets of Dante’s Archipelago.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/the-invincible-review/">The Invincible Review</a></h2>
<p>Starward Industries last game was The Invincible, and in our review I said, <em>“The Invincible is a novel brought to life, blending its story and stunning visuals with engaging exploration. The Invincible goes back to the roots of sci-fi, offering something both classic and new when it comes to exploring the relationship between humanity and the final frontier.”</em></p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-panic-world">Patrick Recommends: Panic World</h3><figure></figure><p>I'm taking a chance here. Ages ago, I recommended a podcast attached to one of my favorite newsletters, <em>Garbage Day</em>, only for the podcast to <em>immediately </em>announce it was winding down. <em>Panic World</em> is another podcast attached to one of my favorite newsletters, <em>Garbage Day</em>, but it's a <em>new</em> podcast, so fingers crossed.</p><p><em>Garbage Day </em>is a newsletter about the internet, specifically untangling the who/what/where/when/why of the discourse of the moment. It features, by my count, vital reporting and commentary and is now essential reading when it hits my inbox. <em>Panic World</em> is an extension of <em>Garbage Day</em>'s mission, but drills down into specific topics that are probably best understood by listing the episode titles:</p><ul><li>My friend's dad is a Holocaust denier now</li><li>Here's who killed the #MeToo movement</li><li>Who turned Gen Z fascist?</li><li>Can you order a hitman online?</li></ul><p>Every episode is funny, interesting, and insightful. I spent a lot of time online, but thankfully, not enough to understand most of it. <em>Garbage Day </em>helps fill the gaps. Most of the conversations are about the ways society is poisoned and dying, but if we're entering a collapse, at least you wanna understand why it's happening, right?</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-permanent-style-magazine">Rob Recommends: <em>Permanent Style</em> Magazine</h3><figure></figure><p>I was trying on some boots at a shoe store in the Village when a man burst in asking, “Hey you have the <em>Permanent Style </em>print thing? Has that arrived yet?” My salesman indicated a stack of large-format magazines on the counter and the visitor started gushing. “Oh wow, you must have the hook up? Do you know him?”</p><p>“Well, yes, but just to email with occasionally. Professional acquaintance level only, I’m afraid. But obviously, huge fan,” the salesman said.</p><p>“Yeah he’s incredible. I’ve been reading since the start of the blog, basically. Thanks!” He paid for the magazine, and raced back out into the street.</p><p>I ended up seeing that magazine at every store I visited, and before I left I made a point to grab a copy. And let me tell you, it’s one of the most gorgeous and aspirational magazines I’ve ever encountered. Like a Condé publication at their peak, but less tacky. It’s the kind of thing that, maybe in my wildest dreams, <em>Remap </em>could put out one day.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Complete Edition is now available on PlayStation 5 for $99.99. It was published today, following announcements from Naughty Dog that revealed a physical edition will be launching in July.</p>



<p>This is yet another re-release of the franchise that spans just <strong>two games </strong>but has managed to cover more than a decade of entertainment. I’m a massive fan, and this will be an easy purchase. And as you read this, I’m arranging my pre-order for the physical collector’s edition.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-in-the-apocalypse">Back in the Apocalypse</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_complete_ps5_collectors_edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snapshot blog post</a>, Naughty Dog wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Available today on the PlayStation 5 console, The Last of Us Complete allows players to experience both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II Remastered in one package. </p>



<p>The Last of Us Complete makes it easier than ever to experience the full story on PS5, whether you’ve played both entries, just one, or have yet to immerse yourself in the world of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and all of our characters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans with a little more dough in their pockets (and patience) can pre-order The Last of Us Complete Collector’s Edition for $109.99, exclusively from PlayStation. It’s an attractive version of the game that comes with an exclusive steelbook, comics, and lithographic art prints. </p>



<p>You’ll also get a ‘thank you letter’ penned by Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Annoyingly, the Collector’s Edition comes with physical discs <strong>only,</strong> and there’s no indication that it comes with digital ownership codes, which means if you’ve got a Digital Edition console, you’re buying this for the collectables, and those alone aren’t worth $109.99. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">Having made its name with martial arts-based action games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/absolver/" data-ref-id="5000-454945">Absolver</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sifu/" data-ref-id="5000-527647">Sifu</a>, few might have expected Sloclap's next game would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a>, an online five-a-side soccer game. After all, while the beautiful game is a beloved pastime and global phenomenon, its representation in video games has long been dominated by the EA FC series (formerly known as FIFA), to the extent that it becomes difficult to consider an alternative.</p><p dir="ltr">But Rematch has one very key difference that I learned during my visit to the studio's Paris office. Where many soccer sims have you in control of a whole team, changing to players closest to where the ball is, Rematch can be better described as a "soccer-player sim" where, in its third-person perspective, the camera is down at pitch level behind your player for the duration of the six-minute match. That also meant that for this hands-on, I was playing with other journalists as my teammates, just like a real game of soccer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474209-ss_406e8029ffdc787ecd8739694c946dd76c54c100.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474209" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474209-ss_406e8029ffdc787ecd8739694c946dd76c54c100.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474209"></a><figcaption>Rematch is a cooperative game that encourages you to work together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474209-ss_406e8029ffdc787ecd8739694c946dd76c54c100.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In explaining the concept, creative director Pierre Tarno speaks of Rematch less in terms of soccer but rather with reference to other genres, such as a third-person action game or even a third-person shooter, since shooting the ball also involves aiming a crosshair with the right stick and squeezing the right trigger. Yet while it's set 40 years in a much more optimistic future, where AR technology can transform the "cages" you play into different environments--from stadiums to rainforests, underwater, or even outer space--the gameplay remains fundamentally real soccer rather than soccer with over-the-top abilities you might expect from Mario Strikers.</p><p dir="ltr">Matches nonetheless take away certain rules that prevent the pace from ever letting up. For instance, there's no offsides, no fouls, and since the ball bounces off the walls of the cage, no throw-ins or corner kicks. While Tarno does show me an early concept trailer where the team had prototyped the ability for players to wall-run along the cage, this one instance of performing impossible feats was ultimately jettisoned.</p><p dir="ltr">"It strayed too far from a credible football fantasy that we were aiming for," he explains. "Football is a simple game and Rematch is a simple game--it's that choreography of bodies and movements which also creates a link with our previous games, which were more about combat. But fundamentally, Rematch is a game of observation and positioning; it's about being at the right time and in the right dynamic."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474211-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474211-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474211"></a><figcaption>Despite being a simple game, Rematch allows you to pull off complex plays.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474211-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What that meant while playing a match was that I was not only in complete control of my player in terms of where they could move around the pitch, but also being responsible for their positioning in receiving or intercepting the ball. Getting the ball was arguably the trickiest part to master in Rematch. That's because there isn't a pass button--a player either performs a ground kick or a shot that is manually aimed. Their teammate can call for the ball, which draws a line so that the player in possession can tell if they're open, but it all comes down to skill in kicking the ball accurately and the other player being in the right position to receive it.</p><p dir="ltr">An even trickier ability to pull off, but one that looks great when you succeed, are volley actions, which can be executed when a diamond appears around an incoming ball. These require precise positioning and super-responsive reactions, but allow you to instantly pass or shoot the ball as soon as it comes to you. It's also contextual based on the height of the ball, so it could result in a header, but in the best-case scenario, a bicycle kick aimed for the corner of the goal.</p><p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that, only after dabbling with the tutorials before being split up into 4v4 matches, we spent most of our hands-on simply trying to keep possession of the ball rather than pulling off any legendary feats. The difficulty of keeping possession is deliberate in its design, in part to foster team play so that no one will want to hog the ball when it's so easy to get tackled.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474212-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474212-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474212"></a><figcaption>Teammates rotate positions, giving everyone a chance to play offense and defense.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474212-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are nonetheless useful skills for keeping possession, such as tapping A to "push" the ball away from you, on par with a through-ball, so that you're technically not in possession and therefore not vulnerable to a tackle, or you can perform a more showboating rainbow flick over an enemy player. A sprint boost, or "efforts," is also possible, although this extra gauge takes a while to build back up, so you won't get far if you're attempting to make a dash from your goal to the opposing team's by yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Tarno stresses the importance of team play and passing the ball. Successful passes also earn players points along with other actions like intercepts, which total up at the end of a match to determine the team's MVP. "We want players to feel that joy of playing football with friends, which is a really fun and collective experience that's about putting your team first, and how it can be more satisfying and rewarding to serve the perfect assist than to actually score yourself," he explains.</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of team spirit felt even more true in the second half of our hands-on, when we were joined by dev team members so that it becomes an actual five-a-side game, incidentally also increasing the size of the pitch (at launch, there will be three different pitch sizes for 3v3s, 4v4s, and 5v5s, the latter only marginally smaller than the standard 115-by-74 yards of a real soccer pitch). That is to say that even someone who knows the ins and outs of the game over the past few years of development cannot single-handedly carry the team--they are only as strong as the team playing together.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474215-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474215" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474215-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474215"></a><figcaption>You can customize your character in Rematch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474215-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Having run a number of private tests with players who usually play competitive games like Call of Duty and EA FC, the results have been encouraging too. "By the second, third games, when they're in solo queues with randoms, they're passing the ball, they're not dribbling around everyone and trying to be the hero," Tarno says. "I think it's also because many players have played five-a-side, enjoy football, and know that nobody in football actually dribbles the ball everywhere."</p><p dir="ltr">To help dispel any gym class flashbacks of being picked last and stuck in goal, not only do players rotate positions after every goal, but the keeper is actually an attractive role to take in Rematch. Although the idea is that everything comes down to personal skill rather than individual player stats, keepers have some exceptions that allow them to become sweepers, essentially moving beyond the penalty area as an extra defender. They also benefit from having infinite efforts, so they can dash all the way back to their goal when necessary. When I was a keeper at one point, there was also a moment when an opposing player crossed the ball into the penalty box but it appeared as if the ball's position snapped into my hands, suggesting Sloclap is also preventing keepers from having a case of butter fingers, while other players still need to be precisely positioned to receive or intercept the ball.</p><p dir="ltr">What ultimately convinced me that Rematch is going to be special came in our penultimate match when a last-minute equalizer took us into overtime. There are no draws or penalty shoot-outs: just a single overtime match decided by golden goal rules, and it lasts as long as it takes. Our overtime lasted more than twice as long as a normal match length of six minutes, and by the end I realized I was sweating more profusely than I think I ever had in a competitive game, as if I had just been on the pitch for real, running back and forth, yelling at my teammates for the ball or to take the shot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4474204-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474204" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4474204-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474204"></a><figcaption>In Rematch, you aim and kick the ball with controls that emulate firing a gun in shooters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4474204-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's exactly the kind of pressure that Sloclap wants players to feel when playing Rematch. Of course, the studio will also be under pressure when it's released as a paid online title. Arguably, its competition isn't really EA's franchise, which has become predominantly about Ultimate Team, but numerous online free-to-play team multiplayer games. As someone who has Rocket League and Overwatch 2 in his regular rotation, Tarno is only too conscious of the competition out there, but he also asserts, "Even if players say, 'An online game should be free-to-play or it's [dead on arrival],' I don't think that's true. If a game is original, solid, and very reasonably priced, players will get it." Take it from me, the sweat was worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rematch launches on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on June 19. An open beta is running April 18-19.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Thursday, April 3, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement made Microsoft a “<a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priority target</a>” of its call to boycott companies it identifies as complicit in the unlawful occupation of Palestinian land, Israel’s apartheid regime, and the ongoing ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people. A top point in this direct call for nonviolent action: boycott Xbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft joins the list of corporations including SodaStream, Siemens, HP, and Reebok that are targets of the BDS movement's boycott, which aims to maximize consumer pressure on select companies with more narrow, achievable actions. <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft#why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Specifically</a>, BDS asks consumers to boycott “Microsoft's gaming products;” this includes boycotting and uninstalling games published by Xbox subsidiaries such as Bethesda and Activision-Blizzard, as well as major games like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>; not buying Xbox software and hardware; and cancelling Game Pass subscriptions.</p><p>On Friday, the games press largely devoted itself to covering Nintendo's <a href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-preorder-tariff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed Switch 2 pre-orders</a> and the panic surrounding Trump’s announced tariffs, political actions that are already materially impacting consumers. While non-games publication <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dropsite News</a> was among the first to cover the announcement, I felt games publications were slow to pick up the story. When I began writing this piece on Monday, only one major games publication, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPS</a>, had covered the call for boycott. Tech news site <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643670/microsoft-employee-protest-50th-annivesary-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, sister site of Polygon, included mention of the boycott in its coverage of worker protests at Microsoft on April 4, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/554879/bds-palestine-israel-xbox-microsoft-boycott-candy-crush-minecraft-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a> later covered BDS’ call on April 8. On April 9, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/microsoft-fires-employees-protesting-israeli-militarys-use-of-companys-ai-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> also mentioned the boycott while covering the protests at Microsoft, and Paste ran a story on <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/xbox/bds-calls-for-a-boycott-of-xbox-due-to-microsofts-partnership-with-israel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why the boycott will succeed</a>. Various <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spookycutewitch.bsky.social/post/3lmalxpfqi22m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcasters</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3llyy2ty7qk2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streamers</a> have announced publicly they will stop covering Xbox-published games. Critic Kaile Hultner covered the news day-of on their blog <a href="https://noescapevg.com/xbox-has-been-added-to-the-bds-list-so-what-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Escape</a>, adding that they would participate in the boycott. The following day, they <a href="https://noescapevg.com/boycotting-microsoft-by-canceling-your-xbox-game-pass-subscription-will-only-hurt-the-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed up</a> with a post exploring concerns over the call’s potential impact on game developers.&nbsp;</p><p>The relative quiet from the games press was noticeable in part because many games journalists have been vocal about the injustice in Palestine in the past. <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-rami-ismail-arabic-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sites</a> <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/dreams-on-a-pillow-raises-240-000-to-spotlight-two-decades-of-untold-palestinian-history-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/504479/dreams-on-a-pillow-palestinian-1948-nakba-game-funded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widely</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/palestinian-developer-raises-more-than-usd200-000-to-make-dreams-on-a-pillow-a-game-about-the-horrors-of-the-1948-nakba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered</a> Palestinian developer Rasheed Abueideh's fundraiser for his game <em>Dreams on a Pillow</em>; members of the press have spoken freely about their position on the conflict on social media; and in November 2023, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDB_wYdn5f4&amp;t=553s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People Make Games</a> published a widely shared story platforming, among others, Gamespot managing editor Tamoor Hussain.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like the events of the past 18 months, there is a history looming behind all this. In 2021, IGN's parent company took the unprecedented step of <a href="https://noescapevg.com/igns-corporate-nonsense-sucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing</a> a staff-organized <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-help-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">call</a> for fundraising of humanitarian aid to Palestinian relief organizations, later <a href="https://kotaku.com/ign-reposts-yanked-palestinian-aid-article-three-months-1847550324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reposting</a> an edited version. Owner Gamestop removed a similar story from <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/05/16/ign-gamespot-articles-palestinians-israel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer</a>. Reporting on the removals by Imran Khan at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210701011110/https://www.fanbyte.com/trending/ign-parent-company-damages-journalism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fanbyte</a> has since been removed, though so has much of Fanbyte's archive.&nbsp;</p><p>There may well be an understandable fear of reprisal among journalists: from Xbox, from the bosses who pay workers’ checks every month, and even from the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5349472/students-protest-trump-free-speech-arrests-deportation-gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current U.S. administration</a>. But the press should not meet challenging moments with silence.</p><h2><strong>A brief history of the boycott&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>BDS’ call might be particularly challenging in the games space. In games, “boycott” might conjure up aggrieved gamers throwing a fit over <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/520813/boycott_modern_warfare_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking servers</a>, the vitriol of racist influencers signaling their disdain of a game about a Black person, and anonymous social media accounts expressing their ire for <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hogwarts-legacy-boycott-failed-jk-rowling-harry-potter-1778891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cultural production of a British transphobe</a>. In contrast, BDS is a decentralized movement organized from within Palestine and the Palestinian diaspora. It was formed in 2005 with the endorsement of over 200 groups, including worker unions and professional organizations, refugee organizations, and women’s organizations in Palestine. The movement attempts to consolidate the protests of Palestinian civil society into more effective, targeted actions, while calling on international consumers with conscience to participate. Its actions are modeled off South African anti-Apartheid protests.&nbsp;</p><p>BDS creates <a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary targets</a> to maximize the impact of its boycott. Existing primary targets include SodaStream, an Israeli company operating on occupied land with an alleged history of discriminating against Palestinian workers, and Hewlett Packard, which <a href="https://www.whoprofits.org/companies/company/3774?hewlett-packard-enterprise-hpe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provides servers</a> to Israel’s Population Registry that restricts the free movement of Palestinians in their homeland. BDS boycotts have seen several successes over the past 20 years: in 2023, Puma <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/puma-to-end-sponsorship-of-israels-national-football-team-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended its sponsorship</a> of the Israel Football Association, <a href="https://fairsq.org/fifa-has-multiple-obvious-grounds-to-suspend-the-israeli-football-association/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which sponsors teams on occupied land.</a> (Puma claimed the decision was made irrespective of the boycott, though BDS documented its <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/puma-no-longer-sponsors-israel-football-association-new-sponsor-errea-notice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign’s effect</a>.) A boycott of Sabra hummus, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/education/04hummus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original college campus culture war</a>, ended in 2024 following the divestment of Israeli manufacturer Strauss Group (<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/strauss-divests-stake-in-sabra-us-hummus-venture-to-pepsico-for-244-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attributed to a decrease in U.S. sales</a>). The power of the BDS movement's boycott strategy has proven so substantial, in fact, that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pro-palestinian-protest-states-colleges-illegal-bds-1895292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many U.S. states forbid boycotting Israel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft’s elevation to a primary target of the boycott follows new reporting published this year about the company's involvement in the siege on Gaza, which has killed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/23/middleeast/50-000-killed-in-gaza-since-start-of-israel-hamas-war-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 50,000 Palestinians</a> (including 15,613 children under the age of 18). <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> reports Microsoft has “deepened its relationship” with occupation forces, with documents showing that “Microsoft’s products and services, chiefly its Azure cloud computing platform, were used by units across Israel’s air, ground and naval forces, as well as its intelligence directorate” during what <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/19/israels-crime-extermination-acts-genocide-gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2024/gapal1473.doc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UN experts</a> have called acts of genocide.</p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Associated Press</a> reports Azure is being used by the Israeli military to compile and search through information gathered from mass surveillance. The Guardian's report also indicates there are uses of the tech on air-gapped computers. This has all been profitable for the company:&nbsp;internal company data and documents reviewed by AP journalists shows Microsoft entered a three-year, $133 million contract with the Israeli Ministry of Defense in 2021, and The Guardian reports Microsoft&nbsp;has generated $10 million in deals from "engineering support and consultancy services" since 2023.</p><p>This week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644769/microsoft-fires-employee-protestor-war-profiteer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft fired an employee</a> for protesting during the company's anniversary event, while others previously began the <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Azure for Apartheid</a> campaign from within, whose petition BDS urges consumers to sign. In 2024, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/tech/google-fires-employees-protest-israel/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google similarly fired employees</a> who&nbsp;protested the company’s contracts with the Israeli government.</p><h2><strong>A question for games media</strong></h2><p>BDS' call to boycott Xbox is a response to Microsoft’s aiding in and profiting from acts of genocide, and it should be reported as such. I would argue that BDS is significant enough to have warranted prompt, widespread coverage of its announcement among the games press, though I understand the silence may be a symptom of an <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">untenable journalistic landscape</a> rather than apathy or hypocrisy among individuals. But the news here doesn’t end with coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>How should games journalists and critics respond to a call to boycott Xbox? Reviewing an Xbox-published game with a Microsoft-provided press copy doesn’t technically breach the boycott, but could it be seen as promoting sales? Games media includes SEO and commerce writers who make lists of sales that include Xbox games and services, encouraging people to purchase them. Would this work, which buoys many games outlets' finances, work against the Palestinian cause? Would service writers, creating guides and tips for Xbox games, be lending tacit support to purchasing them? Is reporting on release dates and new game announcements from Xbox breaking the spirit of the boycott?&nbsp;</p><p>In interpreting the call to boycott’s application to games media, Carolyn Petit, managing editor at Kotaku, points to a distinction in the aims of critics, journalists, and the enthusiast press. “It’s my feeling that journalistic outlets covering the industry needn’t stop covering Xbox games altogether, but that they do have a responsibility, frequently, to put the games and consoles made and published by Microsoft into a larger context that brings the boycott and the reasons for it to bear. I think it has to be approached rigorously but thoughtfully, in a way that’s clear about who and what it’s targeting.”</p><p>She mentions the newly released <em>South of Midnight. </em>The game’s initial review embargo lifted just before BDS’s call, and it is the first Xbox Game Studios game published during the boycott.&nbsp;</p><p>“I haven’t played it yet but by many accounts it offers a wonderfully rich portrayal of the American South . . . It is a Game Pass game, and the BDS boycott call includes not supporting these kinds of revenue streams for Microsoft, so when mentioning the game’s availability, I’d find it appropriate to remind readers that BDS has called for the boycott, and why, and let readers decide for themselves what choice they wish to make,” Petit says.</p><p>Freelance writer Grace Benfell, who authored Paste's coverage, brings up the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (<a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/palestinian-campaign-academic-and-cultural-boycott-israel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PACBI</a>), which targets academic and cultural institutions. “The [cultural] boycott invites an equivocation between Microsoft and Israel itself, and thus we should treat Microsoft's cultural products as propaganda for as long as the boycott stands. That equivocation is not exact, of course, but it is also useful.”</p><p>Like Petit, Benfell raises concerns about games journalists’ role in the larger games media sphere. “I think it is a reality, despite our best intentions and efforts, that games press is largely an arm of public relations and consumer reporting. That is not always true, of course. But I would consider what exactly we are saying ‘yes’ to now when we agree to review a Microsoft-published game or cover a new <em>Call of Duty</em> event. If our access to a game is predicated through a PR relationship with Microsoft, can the resulting output ever be critical or radical?”</p><p>Benfell emphasizes that, lacking exact guidelines, she would be “hesitant to flatly condemn any critic that covers a Xbox-published game,” but the consideration is vital. My own interpretation of the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi/cultural-boycott-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PACBI guidelines</a> is that it applies to work made with or funded by complicit Israeli cultural institutions, so Xbox-published games would not automatically fall into its scope.</p><h2><strong>A manifesto for games writing during the genocide</strong></h2><p>And this is where my reporting ends, where my journalistic detachment can no longer go. This is where we, where <em>I</em>, must put something on the line. The call to action has arrived to each and every member of the games media, and we must now choose how to respond. And know that when we write about <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em> from now on, we are choosing.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is my stance. I cannot see a way for myself to review or cover boycotted games while maintaining my conviction with the movement for Palestinian liberation. However, liberation won’t be found in the strict adherence to bulleted criteria. It will be found in support of justice. On the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955–1956, Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/publications/autobiography-martin-luther-king-jr/chapter-7-montgomery-movement-begins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “Our concern would not be to put the bus company out of business, but to put justice in business.” King continued, “I came to see that what we were really doing was withdrawing our cooperation from an evil system, rather than merely withdrawing our support from the bus company. The bus company, being an external expression of the system, would naturally suffer, but the basic aim was to refuse to cooperate with evil.”</p><p>We must withdraw our support from the evil system, not merely withdraw our support from Microsoft. As Marina Kittaka wrote in 2020, we must <a href="https://even-kei.medium.com/divest-from-the-video-games-industry-814a1381092d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divest from the video games industry</a>. We must refuse to cooperate with evil.&nbsp;</p><p>But writers, staff and freelance alike, must also pay rent, with different access to the support networks that have historically assisted striking workers or mass protest movements. As a freelancer, I have the freedom to not take up work that contributes to injustice. And as a freelancer, I see less and less work every month without putting this story in my portfolio. So yes, I will continue to edit articles about Xbox release dates when they come my way at the copyediting gig that pays my rent, but I understand myself guilty of breaching the boycott, and it is a contradiction I must live with. Not to excuse away the feeling of guilt under a mantra like "No ethical consumption under capitalism," but to gnaw at me from inside, to fuel me to make a different world beyond games where I do not have to live with this feeling anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be easier to follow our consciences if material conditions changed—but I cannot let capitalism shift responsibility to an amorphous other or a possible future we are all now responsible for. As Ben Ware writes in <em>On Extinction</em>: "If the future is to be salvaged and the dead time of the present to be redeemed, it will only be through the transformative agency of those who have learned how to take political sides.”</p><p>As a critic who works slowly outside of marketing cycles, <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who resists hype</a>, I will continue to be vocal about the iniquity of the games industry and how games are made. I have published criticism over the past 18 months that calls attention to the genocide, and I will continue to. And to ensure to myself and my readers that my writing continues to work towards justice, boycotted games cannot themselves become the <em>subject</em> of my work. Mention is unavoidable if I am to properly offer context of the medium in my criticism, but acknowledgement of the boycott and the cause behind BDS’ call will accompany these references. Unlike a land acknowledgement, though, the content of what follows must be withdrawn from the evil system; it must show others the inevitability of liberation and justice in this world. But how?</p><p>Games journalists and critics are writers of and within empire. Therefore we must make the conditions for revolution inevitable, and we must see the liberation of the Palestinian people within our lifetime. There are many of you who know games are political and feel at a loss for what to do right now in ways greater than interpreting bulleted lists of correct behaviors, who cannot imagine that writing about games could at all align with moving the world towards justice. I am sure I am not the only one who has felt, at times, like my writing cannot do to the world what needs to be done.&nbsp;</p><p>But then I remember what others words have done for me already. In games, the words of <a href="https://www.tier-review.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grace Benfell</a>, <a href="https://noescapevg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaile Hultner</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSl_lMN7-c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Geller</a>, <a href="https://jakesteinberg.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake Steinberg</a>, and, after the first election of Donald Trump, Austin Walker, EIC of the week-old games vertical <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-note-on-trump-waypoint-and-why-we-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waypoint</a>, who wrote how games media could respond to a fascist’s rise to power: “It is also our goal to build a new lexicon inside of the gaming community.

		<p>11 bit studios has announced that its clone-filled survival strategy game The Alters will be releasing on June 13th. It will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. As part of the news, a brand new trailer has been released which gives some more details about the threats that players will face on the dangerous planet.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF48QDkg3Cw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In The Alters there are dangers outside the ship, some of which are invisible, across the various biomes. These can as weird as floating rocks to scenarios that can deal instant death by disintegrating the suit, and other scenarios could see time and space distortions. Night time is even more dangerous due to radiation levels increasing.</p>
<p>In The Alters you are Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant alien planet who simply wants to try and survive and find a way home on his weird ring ship filled with habitable shipping container type things. To do this, he has to create ‘Alters’, essentially clones, of himself. They’re not quite clones as is each able to have distinct character skills and traits. They also have their own personalities. It’s from this that elements of psychological horror and an underlying mystery unfold. This is brought to the player through binary decisions, bringing up the fundamental question “what if?” as you head down deeper and darker paths. Even though biologically, they are all the same, each Alter has their own wants and needs, as well as motivations. Fail to meet their wants and needs, and they will turn on each other making the survival situation more desperate.</p>

			<p>Metroid Prime fans have certainly had the opportunity to practice their patience. Announced shortly after the launch of the Switch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> won’t ultimately arrive until <em>after</em> the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, a wait of over eight years. That said, the game <em>does</em> exist, it <em>is </em>coming this year, and, in fact, I recently got to play it at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can check out my general impressions of the hardware here</a>).</p>
<p>So, is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond locked in or does it manage to miss its target after all this time? Roll on for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmetroidprime44.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond demo on offer at the Nintendo Switch 2 event was relatively brief, essentially consisting of the game’s intro and its first boss battle. The demo opens with Samus touching down in the middle of a pitched battle between the Federation Force and those pesky Space Pirates on the remote planet of Tenmaar. For this section of the game, the usual lonely tone of Metroid games is cast aside in favor of lots of action and general activity, as a larger conflict unfolds all around you.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmetroidprime45.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It should be mentioned, that Nintendo’s main goal with this Metroid Prime 4 demo was seemingly to show off the game’s various control schemes, most notably its new mouse controls. On that front, the news is mostly positive – the mouse aiming felt very responsive, and as I noted in my general overview of the Switch 2, playing with the Joy-Con flipped on its edge feels surprisingly comfortable.</p>
<p>It does feel like some further refinement of Metroid Prime 4’s mouse controls would be warranted though. The game still required the use of some of the right Joy-Con's face buttons for functions like entering the Morph Ball, which means awkwardly picking up the Joy-Con to push a button, before putting it back down to use its mouse functionality again. Perhaps I'll get used to this with more play, but a control scheme that entirely eliminates the use of the face buttons on the Joy-Con you're using as a mouse would be appreciated.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmetroidprime46.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As for what I actually played using those mouse controls, it was basically a straightforward FPS sequence. Blasting away felt good, with lock-on still being available for those who really aren’t good at shooters, but none of it felt particularly innovative. The Space Pirate AI was very simple, with battles essentially feeling like a shooting gallery, complete with occasional “gotcha” moments where a seemingly dead enemy pops up and fires at you. Some simple Morph Ball and scanning sequences didn't really add much to the experience. The climatic boss battle was very much of the "strafe around the baddie and aim at the obvious weak spots" variety.</p>
<p>Of course, I realize I just played the introduction to the game. The platforming, exploration, and puzzle solving the Metroid Prime series is known for is almost certainly coming later, which will hopefully add a level of depth to the gameplay. That said, it is interesting that this is how Nintendo chose to show off Metroid Prime 4 for the first time, and I do wonder if shooting will be more of a core focus this time around.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmetroidprime47.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the visual front, Metroid Prime 4 largely looks like an early-PS4-era shooter in terms of model and environmental complexity, although one that’s much more technically polished than anything that came out back then. Environments looked nice and sharp and the demo I was playing was running at a full 120fps. After a generation of Switch games that often didn’t even consistently hit 30fps, the fluidity on display was certainly impressive and refreshing. Retro Studios’ legacy of wringing maximum performance out of Nintendo hardware continues apace.</p>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></h2>
<p>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will launch on Switch and Switch 2 sometime in 2025. Look for more Wccftech coverage of the game closer to launch.</p>

			<p>Frostpunk and This War of Mine developers 11 bit studios have announced that their new game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/">The Alters</a>, will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on<strong>&nbsp;June 13, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The announcement came during this year's Triple-I Initiative Showcase, along with a brand new release date trailer that shows off more of the new sci-fi game where survival depends on you having to get along with alternate versions of yourself.</p>
<p>The Alters has you step into the shoes of miner Jan Dolski, who unfortunately finds themselves stuck on a hostile alien planet that will kill him if he cannot find a way off the planet in a matter of days.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF48QDkg3Cw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xbox players will also be able to check out The Alters on day one through Xbox Game Pass, as 11 bit studios confirmed today that the game will launch into Xbox's subscription service.</p>
<p>The Alters is a mix of base-building, survival gameplay and the same emotional storytelling that 11 bit studios is already known for, particularly regarding how you'll have to manage the emotions and desires of the cloned versions of yourself you create to aid in the survival effort.</p>
<p>Wccftech also had the chance to speak with the lead designer on The Alters, Rafał Włosek, last May to talk more about the inner workings of the game, how the idea for The Alters came about, and the kinds of choices players can make across the game's story.</p>
<p>"<em>I'm really proud of how our team managed to combine the story, the narrating stories of all the Alters, with the game mechanics and survival mechanics. They all fit together and were built from scratch,</em>" Włosek told Wccftech at the time.</p>
<p>It's exciting to know we're now just weeks away from getting to dig into The Alters for ourselves, and see just how personal the issue of survival can become.</p>

Announced just now at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-triple-i-initiative">Triple-I Initiative</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ikuma-the-frozen-compass">Ikuma - The Frozen Compass</a> is a wintry 3D action adventure in which a tenacious young buck and his dog get stranded on an Arctic island. The key thing to know is that it's a co-op game, a co-op <em>splitscreen</em> game, if you please, which means that you and your friends must decide, right now, which of you will play the dog. 
</p>
<p>
This game is described as "a powerful story of love, loss, and endurance", which doesn't bode brilliantly for the dog, so whoever dons the collar needs to a great tragic actor. I encourage you to spend a few weeks rehearsing the business of lying bloodied in the snow next to a dead yeti, whining heroically at the back of your departing owner, who has decided he's more of a cat person anyway. Come now, let me see your expression of puppy-eyed anguish. There's a nice juicy biscuit in it for you if you can make me cry.

<p>
If you don't have a friend willing to be a dog, the good news is that in Ikuma, you can switch between characters in solo play. Caught between realms, at home in neither: the ultimate nightmare. Each character has unique skills with which to conquer different obstacles. The dog ain't so hot at rowing boats, while the human is less competent at fitting through dog-shaped holes.
</p>
<p>
There appear to be elements of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> here, glinting at us menacingly through the ice. "Use the tools and items you gather on the island to find your way and overcome rough terrain," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728620/IKUMA__The_Frozen_Compass/">explains the Steam page</a>. "Climb, fish, gather resources, do what it takes to get yourself and your companion to safety." You also have to worry about ancient Inuit legends, and the mystery of a lost expedition. "Retrace their steps but beware of what's lurking within the fog that cloaks their path," the Steam page cautions. 
</p>
<p>
Fog, eh? That sounds like the kind of clinging, spectral mist a dog might run barking into, only for the barking to suddenly end in an agonised whimper. How's your abject whimpering? Carnegie Mellon-worthy? Again, you might want to get in some practice. Honestly, I'd love to play the dog but I'm probably going to corpse it and yell something like "oh fuck, a giant werewalrus". 
</p>
<p>
Ikuma - The Frozen Compass will release in 2026. Developers Mooneye Studios are the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/claw-wing-and-swim-through-lost-embers-forgotten-world">Lost Ember</a>, in which you get to play a whole menagerie of critters, from moles to parrots.
