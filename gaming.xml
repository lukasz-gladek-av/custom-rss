			<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> sees <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>‘s long-running real-time strategy series enter a bold new era, winding back the clock by almost two thousand years when compared the most recent entry, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/anno-1800">Anno 1800</a>. This leap back in time offers a whole new setting and aesthetic for the franchise compared to other instalments that have taken place during the late Medieval, Renaissance, and the Industrial Age, as well as those Anno games set in the near and distant future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oVSysv9uH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At its core, Anno 117: Pax Romana offers the same rich, layered web of strategy game mechanics that have been continually tweaked and refined over the years. While dense in certain aspects, the game is far more approachable in comparison to grand strategy epics such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings III</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/Europa-Universalis-V">Europa Universalis V</a>. This is mainly thanks to its scale, tasking players with managing cities rather than globe-spanning empires.</p>


<p>For the first time in the series’ history, Anno offers a story-driven campaign where you choose one of two main characters, playing through a series of quests that serves as an extended tutorial. Set during the Pax Romana – a time of peace of prosperity following bloody campaigns and civil war – you slip into the role of either Macus or Marcia, son and daughter to a governor in Rome’s Egyptian provinces.</p>
<p>Inexperienced but not entirely naïve, they are tasked with rebuilding the lost city of Ambrosia to its former glory (now named Juliana after the wife of the Emperor). It’s a pretty ideal scenario, giving you a fertile patch to plant the seeds of your own soon-to-be bustling metropolis.</p>


<p>While the game’s story features twists, turns, and a growing cast of characters, it never intrudes, allowing players to go at their own pace without piling on urgent tasks or dragging them away from their city-building. There is one exception to this, however, and it’s not too long before you’ll be whisked away from the sunny Latium to the uncharted, and somewhat ominous, wilds of Albion.</p>
<p>It’s here, within a cluster of islands resembling Celtic Britain, that you’ll gain more freedom, learning Anno 117’s advanced systems such as diplomacy, warfare, and establishing trade routes. Again, story elements are there to compliment your learning experience: well-crafted and immersive without hindering gameplay.</p>
<p>Speaking of gameplay, Pax Romana is relatively easy to dive into even if you’re completely new to the genre. The Anno games are best known as city-building sims that have a strong emphasis on trade and economy rather than warfare and real-time battles (though these do play a part in the overall experience). One key element that makes Anno 117 more accessible than menu-loving grand strategy games is being able to see your city fully realised in 3D with workers and citizens all milling around. Instead of viewing a number or a UI icon to denote the grandeur and prestige of a city, you can see it with your own eyes.</p>
<p>Creating a thriving metropolis will take time, however, and plenty of careful planning. With that said, there’s no right or wrong way to play Anno 117. Sure, for competitive players there will always be an optimal path that takes them from a single modest trading port to a sprawling cityscape in the shortest amount of time, but the same amount of satisfaction can be derived from crafting gorgeous cities that can be customised using a suite of clever tools.</p>

<p>For the most part, you’ll be constructing various buildings that each perform their own function. Housing, for instance, adds citizens to your workforce who can also be regularly taxed to bring in a steady income. These workers will man the various production stations you build within your territory, from vineyard farmers to iron miners, transporting these raw materials to other stations where they’ll be processed into goods such as wine and weapons. By producing and trading a growing portfolio of these goods you’ll satisfy the needs of your populace, allowing you to upgrade them to artisans and nobles and thereby unlocking even more building types to construct.</p>
<p>While there is certainly an emphasis on building – and optimising the placement of stations, ports, and warehouses to meet local demands – you’ll also need to juggle affairs from beyond your own borders. While some factions will happily engage in trade, exchange gifts, and form alliances, others are more hostile in their approach. A good governor will know how to balance the economic output of their city with its defences, not just against invading enemies but from fires and disease, too.</p>

<p>Keeping on top of everything requires quick and effective navigation of Anno 117’s various menus which are concise and well-presented. Nothing is hidden away or buried though console players will hit the occasional snag due to the inherent clumsiness of gamepad controls when sifting through multi-layered menus, search bars, and icons to find what they need.</p>
<p>Several hours into the game – once the main events of the campaign have been resolved – players can stay within this sandbox or jump into Anno’s Endless Mode which can be enjoyed either in solo or co-op with the option for 16-player competitive games that divide rival governors into teams of four. This multiplayer offering, combined with a roadmap of upcoming content, and the game’s inherent replayability are all conspiring to eat away the free time of any strategy fan with a taste of Ancient Rome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Leon S. Kennedy is rumored to be the second protagonist of the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem, but until CAPCOM confirms his presence in the next entry in the series, anything seen or heard online should not be believed, according to the game's producer.</p>



<p>In a new interview with<a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/"> Stevivor</a>, Producer Masato Kumazawa addressed the rumors that have been circulating online for a few months, highlighting how <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">any supposed evidence is the result of detective work from players</a> and should not be taken at face value.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation,"</em> Kumazawa-san added. Likewise, the image going around showing Leon with an eye patch, and mentions of an extra DLC costume for the character are all fake, the producer concluded. However, Kumazawa-san didn't not deny the character isn't in, so there's still hope he is as rumored and speculated.</p>



<p>The Resident Evil Requiem producer also commented on the ability to switch between first- and third-person views, as well as the reasoning behind it.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the developer received lots of feedback from players after the release of the third-person view mode for Resident Evil Village, so much so that Kumazawa-san decided to let players choose which one they prefer between first and third-person view. In addition, the implementation of the third-person view allowed the team to&nbsp;<em>"sort of ease the horror"</em>, as many players thought that<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">&nbsp;Resident Evil VII Biohazard</a>&nbsp;was a little too scary with the first-person view only.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems ike fans of the series will have to wait until February 2026 to get their first taste of Resident Evil Requiem. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"So, in terms of a demo play, we actually have no plan for one at the stage. None at all. We just want to focus on finishing off the game,"</em> Kumazawa-san said in regards to a playable demo. With the game launching in a little over three months, chances are slim that plans may change, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-final-demo-availability-extended/">every recent entry in the series</a> getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-chainsaw-demo-new-video-provides-an-out-of-bounds-look-at-the-village/">a demo before launch</a>, there's still the chance for one to launch for Resident Evil Requiem as well.</p>



<p>While I would definitely love to see Leon in Resident Evil Requiem, the idea of having the vulnarable Grace as the only protagonist would be very intriguing, to say the least. When I tried the game a few months ago during Gamescom, I really appreciated what CAPCOM has done with the character, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">and the feeling of helplessness that permeated the demo</a>. If this were also to permeate the combat mechanics, I think it would make for a really different experience.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's UK publishing arm have filed a strategic report for the year ending March 2025 in which they warn that they expect yearly revenue to fall in the current fiscal year, ending March 2026. They attribute this partly to slumping sales of physical copies of games, and more broadly to the fact that people are fixating on a fistful of mega-popular games at the expense of all others, with subscription and streaming services like Microsoft's Game Pass making us all feel less inclined to buy individual new games. Plus ça change.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"The traditional 'full game' model of selling a single £50-60 game to a consumer as a one-time purchase continues to become less ubiquitous, with Multi Game subscription services, long running Games As A Service titles, Free To Play games and Cloud Streaming offers all providing new and attractive ways for consumers to access gaming content," reads <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02409000/filing-history">the report</a>, which was filed on 13th November last week and passed along by <a href="https://www.cityam.com/ubisoft-issues-sales-warning-as-gamers-habits-change/">City AM</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Consumers are playing fewer games, playing them for longer, and as a result, outside of a few notable exceptions, many new games are struggling to stand out and achieve the sales they may once have had, whilst the market is more volatile and the potential for any specific title less predictable as a result," it continues.
</p>
<p>"As a result of a smaller physical new releases schedules in the coming year, Ubisoft Limited expects revenue to fall in FY26."
</p>
<p>All this comes in the context of dramatic wider corporate musical chairs across Ubisoft's international dominions. The company recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">struck a deal with Tencent to carve out a new subsidiary</a>, Vantage Studios, dedicated to the best-selling Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six series.</p><p>The remainder of the company's development studios are being reorganised into "creative houses", with a familiar and worrying emphasis on being "agile" and "focussed". Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">announced layoff plans</a> at The Division developers Massive and Trials developers Redlynx, both of whom fall outside the new Tencent-backed subsidiary.
</p>
<p>More Ubihappenings may be in the offing. A few days ago, the company <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/uh-oh-ubisoft-postpones-its-quarterly-financial-report-at-the-last-minute-and-halts-stock-trading/">postponed the release of their latest half-year earnings report</a> while requesting that European exchange Euronext halt trading of Ubisoft shares and bonds until the report's publication. According to rumour, the company's founding Guillemot family are having a staring match with Tencent about whether they can retain their dominance. Yves Guillemot recently appointed his son Charlie Guillemot as co-chief of Vantage, which feels a bit, you know, Succession-y.</p>
<p>Investors appear cool on the new direction: as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ubisoft-delays-half-year-results-requests-trading-suspension-2025-11-13/">reported by Reuters</a>, Ubisoft's Paris-listed share price was down 49% year-to-date as of 13th November. Me am just humble dormouse guzzling crumbs under the banquet table, with no real understanding of the arcane financial phrases uttered by the courtiers above, but these seem like worrying numbers.
</p>
<p>To return to the broader topic here, games industry bigwigs and assorted wonks have long warned that subscription models and a handful of enduringly popular games are sucking up all the oxygen. Back in 2024, Inflexion's Aaryn Flynn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-new-games-struggle-because-evergreen-hits-like-fortnite-pull-players-towards-them-at-all-times-says-former-bioware-gm">spoke to us at length</a> about how "evergreen" games like Fortnite trample new releases that are still finding their legs. "There's this incredibly thick line now of [yearly revenue], which is games that are five, even 10 years old, like GTA Online, and those games have done so good, and are so exceptional because of the just enormous amount of investment that's been put into them, that they are evergreen," he said. 
</p>
<p>More recently, market research company Circana <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/more-than-60-of-us-game-players-only-buy-two-games-or-fewer-per-year-survey-finds/">shared a survey</a> indicating that the majority of videogame players in the USA only buy one or two games a year.
</p>
<p>Again, me am just brainless sheep pundit nuzzling at King Guillemot's electric fences, but whenever I read reports about the industry being eaten alive by the Steam top 10 most-played, I find it helpful to browse, say, one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-358">our weekend What Are We All Playing articles</a>. I can only marvel at the range of things people say they're playing in those comments threads.</p><p>That's a small and purely anecdotal research sample, of course, but then, I imagine Ubisoft UK's research criteria from the above report are quite selective as well: they need to release games that make many millions of pounds. The fortunes of games from much smaller teams and companies do not, I imagine, enter into their calculus.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/small-content-creator-sues-inkslasher/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-small-content-creator-is-suing-inkslasher-for-allegedly-stealing-her-content.1355452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A small content creator by the name of EvenBadWolves Gaming (real name Elizabeth McAulay) has decided that she will be suing a much larger content creator by the name of InkSlasher for allegedly stealing her content. </p>



<p>In her video, which she uploaded to her YouTube channel, EvenBadWolves Gaming, she releases a side-by-side comparison of both her video and InkSlasher’s, of which she claims over 30 minutes of InkSlasher’s 43-minute video is directly ripped from her video. The side-by-side comparisons show duplicate footage and the same editing style, and, in some cases, the same watermarks.</p>







<p>According to McAulay, her original video took 200 hours to create, so seeing the majority of her content stolen is understandably frustrating. As she explains, such issues are typically swept under the rug by YouTube because of its copyright policies, where counter-notifications make it nearly impossible for smaller creators to obtain justification for their content being stolen.</p>



<p>However, McAulay is a real lawyer, and as such, she has decided to sue InkFlasher for stealing her content. McAulay says she has submitted her case to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia over copyright infringement.</p>



<p>Of course, McAulay says that taking someone to court isn’t cheap, and she was quoted up to $135,000 Australian for the case. <span>McAulay currently has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-big-youtuber-stole-my-video-im-fighting-back" target="_blank">GoFundMe setup</a>&nbsp;to try to</span> raise some of the funds for her case, for which she is seeking $50,000 AUD. Alternatively, you can watch EvenBadWolves Gaming’s video below to help support her.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Since the video was uploaded to YouTube, InkSlasher’s video has mysteriously disappeared from YouTube, and he’s seemingly avoiding discussing the allegations as anything said will likely be used against him in court.</p>

            <p>Sales of the Xbox ROG Ally X have exceeded Asus's expectations, as production ramps up to meet demand.</p>
<p>The Microsoft and Asus handheld collaboration was released last month, and while its tech is impressive it's been criticised for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-rog-ally-handheld-now-available-to-pre-order-but-its-pricier-than-a-home-console">its high price</a> - the premium model is £799, while the basic model is £499.</p>
<p>This doesn't appear to be a deterrent, however, as even the more expensive model is currently in short supply.</p>

<p>Responding to a question during its latest investor call (thanks <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-ally-x-supply-woes-continue-as-asus-admits-demand-exceeded-expectations-we-are-working-with-closely-with-key-component-suppliers-to-ramp-up-production">Windows Central</a>), Asus said: "As many of you know, we introduced the first generation ROG Ally 2-3 years ago as a market pioneer, over the past couple of years this new category, especially, the Windows ecosystem has proven itself highly successful.</p><p>"We believe that we have achieved our original goals of premium positioning, creating a new growth driver in our gaming segment. That's why we released our third-generation ROG Ally last month. It featured deeper collaboration with Xbox. Since its launch, we see the market response for it has been extremely positive, particularly, there has been an appetite for the premium higher-end models, exceeding our expectations. These high-ended variants are currently in short supply. We are working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that exists. Our goal with the ROG Ally is for it to remain a core pillar within the Asus gaming portfolio."</p>
<p>The Xbox ROG Ally X is essentially a handheld gaming PC to rival the Steam Deck, though as per Microsoft's advertising it's also 'an Xbox'. Eurogamer's Tom Orry was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">impressed by the machine</a>, noting: "It's not a true Xbox handheld console, but for a lot of people it's probably a better, more versatile device."</p>
<p>Alex Donaldson, meanwhile, was left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whatever-it-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-makes-me-pine-for-xboxs-distant-heyday">pining for the old days of Xbox and its ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>And while the Xbox handheld rivals the Steam Deck, Valve has since announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-machine-everything-we-know-about-valves-new-console">Steam Machine console</a> - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-xbox-boss-responds-to-valves-new-hardware-fellow-microsoft-employee-jokes-it-looks-like-those-rumoured-series-s-leaks">even Xbox boss Phil Spencer is a fan</a>.</p>

			<p>GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, and the long wait for its release is reportedly going to be well worth it, as other games will require decades to match some of the things Rockstar Games is doing for its game.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz">Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly</a>, who proved in the past to have solid sources for Rockstar news, replied to a fan's question asking about GTA 6 potentially being just a GTA V 2.0. This isn't going to be the case, according to Reilly, as some of the stuff Rockstar Games is doing with GTA 6 is extremely ambitious and will likely be unmatched for almost two decades, as developers may require 15/20 years to do the same things the Grand Theft Auto developer is doing for the next entry in the series.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>lol it definitely isn't GTA V 2.0 and people have no idea what they are talking about.</p><p>Some of the stuff I have heard Rockstar are doing with GTA 6 is super ambitious and it is unlikely any other developer will be able to match what they are doing for 15-20+ years.</p></div>— Reece “Kiwi Talkz” Reilly (@kiwitalkz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kiwitalkz/status/1989106189830168934?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although this statement may sound hyperbolic, there's likely some truth to what Kiwi Talks has heard. <span>While we have seen very little of the game in action, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-patents-revolutionize-open-world-forever/">patents and leaks</a> have highlighted how&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-advanced-ai-dynamic-environments/" target="_blank">GTA 6 is attempting to push the franchise and the open-world genre as a whole forward</a>&nbsp;with some impressive advanced features.</span> </p>



<p>The NPC AI features, in particular, sound extremely interesting, as human NPCs are reportedly going to feature an AIMemory system that will allow them to remember players' actions and decisions, influencing their interactions. Reportedly, NPCs will also be able to smell the player and other NPCs, which is definitely an unusual feature, but one that could further improve immersion, as will dynamic environments, which will be influenced not only by story progression, but also by players' actions.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it will be some time before fans can finally get their hands on GTA 6 to check out these features for themselves. The official release window for the sixth entry in the series has been the subject of several announcements, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">moving from an initial target of Fall 2025 to May 2026</a>, and then being <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">officially adjusted once more to November 2026.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During the monthly Soulframe developer stream, Canadian developer Digital Extremes announced that the <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Founders program</a> will go live on Tuesday, November 25, 2025, coinciding with the twelfth <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-preludes-opens-public-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preludes</a> (Pre-Alpha) update to the game.</p>



<p>Geoff Crookes, Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Founders is the next major step for Soulframe, welcoming anyone to join us in building something truly special. During our Pre-Alpha period, Preludes, we’ve built upon new ideas entirely from scratch and begun to craft a meaningful, strong foundation for a world that offers something important missing from our everyday lives: hope. Soulframe is meant to become a home for redemption, while feeling grounded and patient for everyone who plants their roots here. For those who have long wished to support Soulframe from its roots, this is an invitation to do so from the beginning.</em></p>



<p>Fans will be able to pick between four Founders paths that embody the Virtues of Courage, Spirit, and Grace. There's the path of the brave fighter (Wyld Tethren), willpowered mage (Wyld Oscelda), and rogueish archer (Wyld Sirin). These options are outfitted with an exclusive character Wyld Pact, main weapon and sidearm, armour set, talisman, dye Hues, bird cosmetics, Arcs (premium currency), two extra Preludes invite codes, among other benefits like the “Envoy's Sphere Sword Skin” for use in Warframe.</p>



<p>The ultimate option, the Paragon, includes all the benefits of other Founders' paths in addition to an exclusive Paragon Greatsword and an additional allotment of Arcs (premium currency), Armor Bestitching items, and 10 Preludes invite codes. Lastly, Founders will be able to etch their names in the Eternium Garden, planting their exclusive Founder flora and thus leaving a lasting mark in Soulframe.</p>



<p>The new Preludes update adds a new weapon grip type, and significantly overhauls the onboarding process of new players. When starting the game, they can now discover Grandfa's Hut and test all three starting Pacts there before committing to a Pact and Enclave. Exploration is also going to be a bit easier thanks to clearer marker placements for essential destinations, as well as fast travel with Wevetseeds.</p>



<p>A new elixir called The Cogah can be discovered. Drinking it triggers the ability to challenge the Agari overworld bosses roaming the overworld to a more difficult fight, thus unlocking new rewards. Finally, Digital Extremes is adding new Totems and Runes that can be used to specialize weapon types further.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the near future, players can expect a new mission type called Siege Encounters, which will take place at various enemy-filled forts. The Envoys must force out the Ode occupation, take down sub-bosses waiting within, and bring down the balloon laying claim to the territory. After the completion of a Siege Encounter, the new infamy rating system will be affected depending on how the mission is approached, persisting with the player into the following Siege. </p>



<p>Lastly, Jennifer English (Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3, Latenna in Elden Ring, and Maelle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33) will be joining the Soulframe cast soon as a new character, Alora, the Empress of Eldveil.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem Producer Addresses Leon Kennedy Rumors]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Leon Kennedy has overshadowed all of Resident Evil Requiem’s development so far, as fans are more fixated on the long-term hero either making an appearance or being a playable character. It’s no longer a vocal minority, and Resident Evil Requiem’s producer has commented on the rumors.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the horror series. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-camera-because-resident-evil-7-was-too-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7 Was “Scary,”</a> and Resident Evil 8 did a great job of making a quiet village terrifying. Resident Evil Requiem takes us back to Raccoon City, and everyone wants to know if Leon Kennedy will be there.</p>







<h2 id="h-could-leon-kennedy-be-in-resident-evil-requiem">Could Leon Kennedy Be In Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He has to be, right? Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stevivor</a>, Resident Evil Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa opened up on the upcoming sequel. </p>



<p>It should be noted that Kumazawa’s responses were translated via an interpreter. While we don’t discredit the translator, there’s always the possibility that something was lost in translation. But when asked about the future of Leon Kennedy and the rumors that he might be in Resident Evil Requiem, Kumazawa had a simple response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more detective work [on the part of players]. So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation. There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eye patch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Firstly, at no point did Kumazawa outright say Leon isn’t in the game. He merely stated that speculation is speculation, and AI could be responsible for the leaks. On the other hand, this is the most PR-appropriate answer he could’ve given.</p>







<p>Of course, he’s not going to say if Leon is in RE9 and ruin the surprise. <strong>However, he could certainly shut down any suggestions, and he didn’t outright</strong>. Fake news doesn’t mean no, and how many times have we seen or heard a dev say something isn’t happening, knowing full well it is?</p>



<p>You only have to look at Summer Game Fest 2025, where Capcom fooled everyone by teasing us with future RE9 news, before unveiling the game at the end of the show to fake everyone out!</p>



<p>With news of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-skin-spotted-on-playstation-portugal-pre-order-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Leon Skin Being Spotted On The PlayStation Portugal Pre-Order Page</a>, all signs point toward the legendary character being involved one way or another.</p>



<p>We’ll keep monitoring the situation and checking the latest RE9 leaks. DO you think Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bloodborne has now become even more playable on a wider range of PC configurations thanks to the latest version of the ShadPS4 emulator, now available for download.</p>



<p>Version 0.12.6 of the emulator developed initially by George Moralis, which can now be downloaded as a nightly build <a href="https://shadps4.net/downloads/">using the installer found on the emulator's official website</a>, packs some performance and emulation improvements for select PlayStation 4 exclusives that have yet to officially launch on PC, such as the aforementioned Bloodborne and God of War III Remastered.</p>



<p>FromSoftware's hardcore action role-playing game seems to have benefited the most from the improvements made to the emulator's latest build. As shown in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">Tabeneru</a>, the game's performance on an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU is doubled in some instances over the previous version of the emulator.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the game runs almost flawlessly on an RTX 4080 with none of the frame pacing issues that plague it on PlayStation 5, as shown in another video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>This is great news for most players, but especially for those with mid or low end hardware, as these improvements make it possible for such users to enjoy the game without performance issues, although issues still present (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">some fixable with mods</a>) prevent the game from being perfectly emulated. Still, Steam Deck users can similarly benefit from these improvements, as Bloodborne now runs much better on the handheld system, as showcased in a new video by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>God of War III Remastered, on the other hand, is still not entirely playable due to evident visual glitches in multiple stages, but now the game's epic intro sequence is perfectly emulated, which bodes for the rest of the game getting properly emulated with improved performance down the line. You can check out how the game runs on ShadPS4 0.12.6 in the video below shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alepc7480">Ale PC</a> on YouTube.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new ShadPS4 0.12.6 version also introduces significant performance improvements in other PlayStation 4 exclusives, such as InFAMOUS Second Son, which is sadly still far from being playable, The Last Guardian, and others. You can check out how these games run on the latest version of the emulator in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMESMARKING">GAMESMARK</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-getting-a-brutal-kicking-from-players-over-its-use-of-ai.1355428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> is proving pretty popular with critics. The latest entry in the infinitely-running series is sitting on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">Metascore of 83</a>, with no reviews so far marked as “negative.” The same, however, can not be said of user reviews. At a desultory <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc">Metascore of 1.9</a>, it’s the worst-rated&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> ever.</p>

 <p>A lot of the ire in the Metascore reviews is focused on the game’s “lackluster” multiplayer-only campaign, faulty matchmaking, litany of bugs, and very unfavorable comparisons with <em>Arc Raiders</em>, but the use of AI also comes up a great deal as people vent their frustrations. It was noticed immediately after launch that the latest entry in one of the biggest franchises in the world had used AI-plagiarized art for player banners, calling cards and even artwork within the campaign. <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397">When&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> approached Activision for comment on this</a>, the company seemed entirely nonplussed by the situation, simply stating “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams…”</p>

 <p>“Just pure trash full of ai slop,” says one Metacritic user. “What AI bot did they use to puke up this garbage?” asks another. A third comments, “It’s just another hurriedly rushed AI slop-fest.” One comment that appears to capture the mood of most poetically phrases it, “Unbelievable, abysmal dogshit. Save your money please! The use of AI is just the cherry on top.”</p>

 <p>Of course, user scores do tend to be marked on a binary scale, rather than adopting the full spread of numbers. People tend to leave reviews not out of a sense of civic duty, but rather because they’re either delighted or furious, hence the majority of these scores being a possibly somewhat exaggerated 0. Scattered throughout (albeit very much in the minority), bringing the overall average to 1.9, are 9s and 10s from enthusiasts. It’s obviously not a useful metric of a game’s quality, but it’s certainly a very useful way to see which way a game is being received by the wider public.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, over on Steam, the game is currently sitting on the very low end of “Mixed” reviews, with just 42 percent of reader reviews finding&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> to be positive. (However, that rating drops to “Mostly Negative” when reviews are filtered for English language only. Chinese players seem to be having a better response.) “chatgpt generate me a lackluster campaign with reused assets and cringe worthy dialogue,” reads one popular review. “Activision just pay for art you clearly have money and it won’t look like shit,” says another.</p> <p>It’s something of a relief that the brazen use of AI in games still generates fury like this, players yet to be inoculated to it by its widespread use. Companies are keen to trot out the “But everyone else is doing it!” excuse, like a child caught cheating in a test, but right now this isn’t cutting it with audiences. It seems pretty likely that any major company pledging&nbsp;<em>not</em> to use AI could win enormous favor with players in this climate. It’s probably worth a try!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar Games sent the world into overdrive two years ago with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1. It has amassed countless views, and now it’s been claimed that it’s risen to the top as the number one YouTube trailer without ads.</p>



<p>One day, many from now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> will release. It will be a glorious day, everyone will rejoice in the game’s outrageous content and over-the-top violence, and appreciate that Rockstar Games spent a lot of time crafting a probable masterpiece. The most recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 delay</a> hurts, yes, but we’ll look back on the journey with newfound fondness—particularly Trailer 1.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 set the wheels in motion, and it continues to be watched worldwide.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 has recently passed 269 million views (and counting) on YouTube, making it allegedly the number one YouTube trailer of all time <strong>without ads</strong>.</p>



<p>We have to emphasize this as there are a small handful of worldwide trailers that eclipse this, but do feature YouTube ads. It’s an incredible feat as Rockstar Games could quite easily have monetized this trailer, and still landed themselves a nice, hefty chunk of revenue.</p>



<p>The video also has over 1 million comments! Trailer 2 isn’t doing too badly either, sitting at just under 150 million views at the time of writing.</p>



<p>With another year to go until Grand Theft Auto 6, we’ll keep rewatching Trailer 1 (and Trailer 3), await Trailer 3, and hope for a full gameplay reveal or walkthrough sooner rather than later.</p>

It’s sitting at $40 right now, down from the usual $75, which is a clean 47% cut and even beats the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live">Prime Day</a> offer by another five bucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Break it down, and the value is absurd. Based on <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/?q=final%2520fantasy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HowLongToBeat</a> times, you’re looking at roughly 30 cents per hour of classic Final Fantasy if you work through the whole bundle. </p><div catalogid="f468f4d5-e228-4975-aea6-e336d85547ce" id="224483"><div id="224483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In a market where new releases can run you double this package for a fraction of the content, that’s downright generous. These Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 editions also run perfectly on Switch 2 and PS5, so you’re covered on the hardware front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe you’ve recently discovered Final Fantasy because of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">Magic: The Gathering crossover</a>, and you’re curious where those characters and creatures actually come from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the easiest way to get the full tour. You’re getting the first six games with modern touches like adjustable EXP gain, toggleable encounters, and auto-battle, all of which make these versions the most approachable they’ve ever been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not long ago, the physical edition was one of those almost impossible-to-find collector items. Reprints finally fixed that, and now all six games cost about half the price of a single new release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned, it's the best price ever on this collection, so you're getting the best deal possible (backed up by trusted price trackers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?th=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CamelCamelCamel</a>).</p></div><div catalogid="f468f4d5-e228-4975-aea6-e336d85547ce" id="224484"><div id="224484" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (PS4)</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Should You Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably not. When a deal hits an all-time low during the run up to Black Friday, that’s usually the signal that retailers have already fired their biggest shot for deals like this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This collection doesn’t swing up and down like mainstream blockbusters, and Square Enix hasn’t been in the habit of pushing deeper cuts on it outside the major tentpole events. The last meaningful drop was during Prime Day, and this price already beats that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, physical stock also isn’t guaranteed to sit around forever. This is still a niche collector-leaning release, and once the early Black Friday rush cleans out retailers, you’re at risk of FOMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Black Friday proper knock off another dollar or two? In theory. In practice, retailers use early Black Friday offers to test demand, and if something sells well at an all-time low, they don’t bother dropping it further. So if you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab this set, in my expert opinion, this is the moment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Early Black Friday Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday discounts are already starting to roll in, and we'll see a whole host of sales go officially live in the next few days across retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big new deals include <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6MlA?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$50 off the Meta Quest 3S at Amazon</a>, now $249, or just <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrAgBD?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$329 for the 256GB version with Batman Arkham Shadow included</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The DualSense Edge controller is also down to just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVjGO?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$159.99 at Amazon</a> today as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

<p>"Actually, we tried really hard to implement mouse controls for Nintendo Switch 2. When we did put it in, it confused and convoluted the gameplay and became too complicated. So actually, we are using gyro instead."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you ask us, this is music to our ears. In terms of offering options, yes, it's a shame Capcom couldn't quite make mouse controls work, but we're <em>big</em> fans of gyro aiming, so you can bet we'll be making use of this in the final game. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> both included gyro controls for the Switch, but curiously, Capcom opted to exclude it from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>Kumazawa-san also mentions that Requiem still contains "remaining elements" from when it was initially conceived as an online multiplayer game six years back. He states that this version was fun to play, but "the horror part was very mild", so a decision was made to revert it back to a single-player experience – wise move, indeed.</p>
<p>To potentially assuage fears that Resident Evil might be veering back into the action genre following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, Kumazawa-san also states that the development team "wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part" in Requiem. That's not to say, however, that there won't be at least <em>some</em> action, as he states that "by putting in the action, and making sure the player isn’t thinking about the horror, the next horror part will scare more effectively than non-stop scares".</p>
<p>Fans have long speculated that Resident Evil veteran Leon Kennedy may crop up in Requiem as a second playable character. Capcom has remained tight-lipped on the idea, but it would certainly add more weight to the fact that players will be revisiting Raccoon City and the decimated R.P.D station.</p>

            <p>US Congressman Ro Khanna has responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/1989470230356308349">Taking to social media</a> and responding to a viral post about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">AI calling cards in the recent AAA FPS</a>, Khanna wrote: "We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits. And there should be a tax on mass displacement."</p>
<p>In response to queries to whether AI was explicitly used to create these calling cards, Activision responded late last week with the following statement: "Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios."</p>

<p>These calling cards, as well as the campaign for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, have been met with a negative reception from the wider Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 fanbase, with some shocked at how apparent the use of image generation software appears to be across some portions of the game.</p><p>Ro Khanna, for his part, has been pushing for AI regulation for some time now. <a href="https://khanna.house.gov/media/in-the-news/rep-ro-khanna-what-it-will-take-congress-regulate-ai-privacy-and-social-media">As early as January 2024</a> the congressman was pushing for wider controls for the massive industry, one which is now taking up a vast amount of US growth and investment.</p>
<p>Generative AI use has started to become rather widespread across the video game industry, or at the very least, that's what public statements from developer owners have indicated. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">Square Enix recently noted its intent to replace 70 percent of its QA work with generative AI</a>, while a survey at Tokyo Game Show noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese developers were using AI in some form</a>. It's certainly not isolated to Eastern development either, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-is-leveraging-ai-in-ethical-and-sustainable-ways-says-new-ceo-insisting-human-authorship-is-final">Embracer's CEO acknowledging his company's intent to leverage AI</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft's insistence on AI use as two examples of large Western moves to embrace the tech</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">you can read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, reviewer Jeremy Peel describes it as : "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>

            <p>Shams Jorjani, the CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead, has spoken more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s recent delay, and what it means for the studio.</p>
<p>Jorjani was a guest on The Game Business' YouTube channel recently, where while also discussing topics such as Helldivers 2's Xbox debut, he also addressed the news earlier this month that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Rockstar was delaying the release of GTA 6 from May into November next year</a>. The Arrowhead CEO noted when GTA 6 does materialise, it will "blot out the sun in a way unimaginable" for everyone else in the industry. </p>
<section>
However, for Helldivers 2, this delay will give the team a "stay of execution".</section>

<p>"If it's releasing six months later, then it means that's another six months of uninterrupted work without GTA looming over us," Jorjani laughed when discussing the impact of the delay for Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>"We try to do our planning and not look too much at what else is happening around the time we are releasing stuff," the Arrowhead CEO furthered, "but GTA has obviously been very hard to avoid."</p>
<p>The CEO added he doesn't think a studio would "go out and delay stuff" until it's "sure that the new date is going to stick". While the most recent delay is not GTA 6's first delay, Jorjani said he "<em>thinks</em> this new date's going to stick" (emphasis added on the think).</p>
<p>"So, ask me again in May what we're doing then, because right now I don't think we're doing anything different from November…"</p>
<p>When host Chris Dring noted that for some publishers and developers the GTA 6 delay will be a pivotal moment in their own hypothetical releases, Jorjani said it is all part of existing in the same space as Rockstar's juggernaut franchise.</p><p>"This is why, when I was at Paradox, releasing grand strategy games in Q4 was the best thing ever," he said. "It was crowded as hell for everyone else, but who else is releasing a grand strategy? Releasing in December was great for Paradox, and I think it still is."</p>
<p>He added Paradox, which is known for games such as Victoria 3 and Crusader Kings, never has to worry about the GTAs of this world. The team at Paradox don't have the "same influencers" or "target the same media", he noted. The same can't be said for everyone, though, and for "everyone else, it's going to be terrible" to contend with.</p>

<p>GTA developer Rockstar is currently making additional headlines following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">firing of staff members in a move seen by many as 'union busting'</a>.

<p>Rockstar's controversial dismissal of its employees has since been brought up in UK Parliament, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine urging "Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again"</a>.</p>

			<p>What makes a great gaming mouse? For some, the key feature that answers that question is weight. A heavy mouse can provide a sturdy and satisfying tactile experience during day-to-day work or low-movement gaming sessions, but a lighter mouse can practically disappear to your senses in higher action moments. It can be a major difference for dedicated competitive gamers. It’s also the major selling point of the latest entry into Corsairs growing line of competitively priced and gamer-focused mice – the SABRE v2 Pro Ultralight Wireless Gaming Mouse.</p>
<p>The SABRE v2 comes in at a mere 36 grams. That’s nearly half the weight of most other gaming mice, and it’s immediately noticeable. When the mouse is in my hand, it genuinely feels like there’s nothing there at all – there’s absolutely zero tension on my wrist no matter how fast or frequently I swing the mouse across my desk. Now, I never really thought there was any wrist tension happening with any other mouse I used, but once I held this one and compared it to others, it’s wild how noticeable the difference is.</p>



<p>A lightweight piece of tech can end up feeling cheap in the hands – it’s an experience I’ve had far too often with light and basic Xbox controllers compared to the heftier Elite variants, for example – but the matte-black frame of the SABRE v2 is unmistakably premium, and feels sturdy despite how little it weighs how light it is. Unsurprisingly, this is also a pretty small mouse. As someone with large hands, the ergonomic experience hasn’t been great as a result. While it’s not my preference, I’ve had to adopt a claw-grab at the mouse, or half of my hand would be dragging across my mousemat when I use it. The mouse comes with optional grip-tape to apply to the sides and mouse buttons that improve the hand-feel and security when you’re moving the mouse. They don’t solve the issue of grip comfort or prevent me from clawing at it, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Another major feature of the SABRE v2 mouse is it’s eye-wateringly high 8,000Hz hyper-polling rate. Up to this point, I’d only ever used mice capable of 1,000Hz, and thought that was surely the maximum amount ever needed, but the top tier of gaming mice are all now shooting for eight times that. The polling rate is basically the number of times your mouse talks to your computer while in use, and a higher polling rate means your mouse is checking in more frequently, and at 8,000Hz, it’s specifically checking in about every 0.125 milliseconds. That’s combined with the absurd stats of the included Corsair Marksman S sensor, rocking 33,000 DPI detection, 750 IPS speed, and 50G acceleration. Testing it out in Marvel Rivals and Apex Legends left me astounded. The precision and swiftness of my movements felt noticeably improved, and I struggle to imagine that I’ll go back to gaming at just 1,000Hz after this.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, getting the Corsair SABRE v2 properly set up with your computer to enable that swift gaming capability is a slight headache. There’s zero documentation in the package to guide you through the functionality of the mouse, and while that’s normally not an issue, I desperately needed some explaining for the Corsair SABRE v2 Pro. For one, the mouse does not have Bluetooth connection support, so the only way to use it wirelessly is with the included dongle. That dongle, however, is a small black box that you need to plug a USB-C cable <em>into –&nbsp;</em>it doesn’t plug in by itself. I was in disbelief when I confirmed that the only solution for using this mouse is to plug the lengthy included USB-C charging cable into your PC, then plug the other end of that into said dongle, resulting in a massive bulk of unnecessary cable hanging from wherever you’ve plugged this into.</p>

<p>It’s likely not the biggest issue for many gamers – having the dongle on a cable means it can be placed with line of sight to ensure the best possible connectivity, and when the mouse needs charging, there’s now a USB-C cable right there – but if you’re gaming on the go or bouncing between multiple systems, the dongle not just plugging directly into a port and the mouse lacking Bluetooth makes it less convenient. In my home setup, it was merely only a clunky and baffling set up process.</p>
<p>The CORSAIR Web Hub is a similarly confusing, if well intentioned, piece of the package. Instead of using the Corsair PC software iCue to adjust your Sabre v2 settings, you navigate to a website hub to access that functionality. It’s a brilliantly lightweight solution, but if you use any other products in the Corsair ecosystem that are only compatible with iCue, you’ll need to manually shut off iCue every time you access this portal, then turn it back on when you’re done. You can’t access any of those devices in the web portal, and you can’t access the SABRE v2 in iCue.</p>
<p>There’s so much focus on a tightly competitive and impressively feather-light design for the Corsair SABRE v2, yet that same care or consideration wasn’t put into the ease of use or out-of-box experience for the product. If your only focus is competitive excellence, then this mouse is clearly a top contender. For casual use or compatibility with other Corsair products, though, I’m left wanting a little more from this release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, French developer Spiders has announced that its roleplaying game GreedFall 2: The Dying World received the second major update, and the largest yet, since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-launches-this-summer-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut on Steam Early Access</a>.</p>



<p>To begin with, the developers are introducing Peren, a new, explorable city and region after Olima. Once the capital of the Astrian civilization, it is now ruled by the Merchant Congregation. The city is currently affected by the Malichor epidemic, a mysterious plague rampaging through the whole continent of Gacane. Players will have to be mindful of the many political intrigues they'll find while exploring Peren.</p>



<p>The update also adds a new companion, Till. That will come as a bit of a surprise to those who played the game, as earlier in the story, he was responsible for capturing the player character and forcing them to abandon their native island of Teer Fradee. Till, a former captain of the renowned Coin Guard mercenary guild, now seeks redemption and offers his help to the player. Personality-wise, players will find him to be quiet and gruff. In gameplay terms, he's essentially a tank equipped with heavy armor and a two-handed sword.</p>



<p>Combat was one of the most criticized aspects of GreedFall 2: The Dying World when it first launched on early access, and Spiders is now overhauling it. There are now three different modes that players can select:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical - Maximum control of the battlefield and camera management. Usage of the tactical pause is emphasized.</li>



<li>Focused - Direct action is emphasized, and the AI manages companions. Limited tactical pausing is available.</li>



<li>Hybrid - Balances manual and AI control and offers moderate tactical pause/camera management.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are also three difficulty settings: Tactical mode, Adventure mode, and Story mode.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Additionally, this update introduces new side quests and events, improves the crafting system, overhauls the character creation tool, implements Photo Mode, and adds various “quality of life” improvements and optimizations. If you'd like to check out the new stuff without replaying the initial content, the developers are even offering some ready-to-use save files. More info can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/525357766327405696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on this page</a>.</p>



<p>GreedFall 2: The Dying World has a generic 2026 launch window for version 1.0 (and the console debuts). We'll let you know once the studio narrows it down to a specific date.</p>

How do you Monday, babe? By getting a good night's sleep, rising with the sparrows, eating a wholesome meal, and settling down at your desk with an airy mind and a glad heart? Or do you fester aimlessly till 5 in the morning then immediately watch 30 minutes of neck-sucking, dismemberment and plague because it speaks to your sorely disquieted soul?</p>
<p>There is no time to answer, for I have already embedded the latest talkthrough video for Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco's medieval fantasy action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood Of Dawnwalker</a>, which still looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> plus vampires.

<p>
Quick recap of the premise: The Blood of Dawnwalker sees your charismatically scarred pretty boy Coen searching for his abducted family against a time limit. The game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blood-of-the-dawnwalkers-time-mechanics-are-surprisingly-relaxed-but-the-hero-may-kill-npcs-if-you-let-him-get-thirsty">broken into day-night cycles</a> that are themselves broken into eight periods, with time paused inside each period till you interact with an hourglass icon and bring that period to an end.</p><p>Coen is a regular albeit suspiciously pale and unblinking Joe by day; he'll walk around doing boring human things like interrogating people and making deductions, or hacking monsters up with a sword. By night, he'll kick all that prosaic mortal nonsense to the curb and gain the ability to walk on walls, warp between rooftops, and slice armoured men to ribbons with his bare hands. 
</p>
<p>
The more sentries he leaves in pieces, the more Notorious he may become, and the greater the guard presence in town. You'll also want to feed him blood regularly if you don't want him to suddenly become a spitting, biting dervish at random. At least one of the previous two sentences also describes my cat.
</p>
<p>
This game suggested by the footage above seems fine to me. I mean, I think Coen has all the personality of week-old Coca Cola, but there's an entertaining if confusing range of pantomime British accents among the smallfolk. Cor blimey me old seadog, t'vampire's been at mill. The Blood Of Dawnwalker - which I keep wanting to call Blood Of The Dawnwalker, The Blood Of The Dawnwalker and 2Dawn Or Not 2Walk: That Is The Questing - Bloodlines - will release sometime in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive and Games Workshop surprised many by <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</a> just about six months after the launch of Space Marine 2. It seemed a bit too early, especially with a game that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling gangbusters</a> and would get a lot of post-launch support.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-and-space-marine-3-are-definitely-not-competing-for-resources-dev-insists-while-remaining-coy-about-necrons-in-the-sequel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by IGN</a>, in a recent new episode of <a href="https://warhammertv.com/details/31550?playlist_id=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer TV's Deep Strike show</a> (only available to Warhammer Plus subscribers), Creative Director Oliver Hollis-Leick explained that it's not at all an issue for the development team, and the two projects won't be competing for resources.</p>



<p><em>Announcing a third game doesn’t in any way mean that we’re not going to continue creating content for the existing game. The thing is, the development cycles for these projects are long. For Space Marine 2, it was something like four years. And so, for Space Marine 3, it’s going to be the same.</em></p>



<p><em>We announced it to, in one way, keep people aware of the fact we’re going to continue this, that there’s going to be more coming. But we’re also doing the same thing with DLC. There’s lots already been created and there’s lots more to come. They’re definitely not competing for resources.</em></p>



<p>Saber Interactive has <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously confirmed</a> the following Space Marine 2 content roadmap for 2026:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two new PvE missions</li>



<li>Techmarine class</li>



<li>Techmarine weapon (Omnissiah Axe)</li>



<li>Battle-barge expansion</li>



<li>Stratagems (new battlefield conditions and rewards)</li>



<li>Progression update</li>



<li>New Terminus enemy</li>



<li>Two new PvP arenas</li>



<li>PvP Stratagems</li>



<li>New siege map</li>
</ul>



<p>In the Warhammer TV interview, Hollis-Leick also answered questions about that Necron tease toward the end of Space Marine 2:</p>



<p><em>One of the things about this universe is it’s vast. It’s almost timeless. And so if you go digging deep down below the surface of a planet, you could find all kinds of things. And so finding what appears to be a Necron tomb, or at least Necron technology below the surface of a world, is not an outrageous thing to happen. But also in the narrative, they’re dealing with what seems to be Blackstone-like technology, although it’s never expressly stated. And so that directly links to the Necrons. As to whether we’ll see any more of them, that I cannot say. But it certainly was a nice thing to see at the end of the game there.</em></p>



<p>Oliver Hollis-Leick appeared to confirm that Saber Interactive is looking at a four-year development schedule for Space Marine 3, meaning we could see the game in late 2028, provided there are no delays.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>While last year's Black Ops 6 also was available on Game Pass from launch, it still saw a Steam launch peak of over 300,000 players, almost three times the numbers clocked by its direct sequel. Modern Warfare 3's November 2023 release was also higher, with a launch window peak of 190,000 players.</p><p>The Call of Duty franchise has a rocky history with Steam, with Activision choosing to distribute the game only through its own Battle.net storefront for a number of years, before finally bringing CoD <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-may-be-returning-to-steam-with-modern-warfare-2/1100-6503965/" data-ref-id="1100-6503965">back to Steam in 2022</a>. Since Microsoft's acquisition of Activision, the game's PC audience is further split on PC, with Game Pass presumably making up a decent number of PC players.</p><p>Black Ops 7's lower numbers compared to previous CoD releases on Steam suggest the game is facing some stiff competition from this year's other major releases in the genre. Arc Raiders just released its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-arc-raiders-north-line-update-full-details/1100-6536145/" data-ref-id="1100-6536145">first major update</a>, with players coming together over the weekend for a community event to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-unlocked-new-map-with-lightning-speed/1100-6536244/" data-ref-id="1100-6536244">unlock a new map in record time</a>. Battlefield 6 also continues to go strong, sitting just below Arc Raiders in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> with a weekend peak of almost 300,000 players.</p>

    <article>
      <p>A few weeks back I got a copy of <em>Anno 117</em>, and was <em>really </em>looking forward to playing it. <a href="https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review/" rel="noreferrer">I've been on a city-building</a> and management streak lately, and was excited at the prospect of spending some time with a Roman one that also featured the <em>Anno </em>series' quaint obsession with city-building narrative campaigns.</p><p>So I started it up, dabbled in the sandbox mode for a bit, found out I was probably better off playing the campaign instead (it’s got a gentler, longer tutorial) and settled in for what I <em>thought </em>was going to be a month or two of good times. The game looked great on my new PC, and in terms of city-building it seemed like one of the better ones I've played recently. Its production queues require some tricky planning to get right, and the 4X/RTS stuff layered over the top--like controlling army units, exploring uncharted islands and having diplomatic relations with neighbouring islands--was all pretty interesting.</p><p>Over the weekend, I hit a loading screen (pictured above) I hadn't noticed before and something immediately felt <em>off</em>. The game's other loading screens had also been weird, but I'd assumed that was because they appeared simply unfinished, raw sketches of an idea for an eventual, more-polished loading screen, <a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review/" rel="noreferrer">in much the way many of <em>Civ VII's</em> were at launch</a>. But this one in particular wasn't that; it was clearly AI-generated. People's arms were gone, hands were strange, outfits warped in unnatural ways, the entire composition was wacky. I'm not the only one to have picked up on this, either; after jumping online to see if anyone else had noticed, I found that <em>so many</em> had noticed and posted about it that<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/anno-117-ai-generative-artwork-ubisoft/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Ubisoft had issued a public statement defending it</u></a>:</p><blockquote>This image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process...With Anno 117: Pax Romana being our most ambitious Anno yet, we’ve assembled the largest team of artists ever for the franchise and to help meet the project's unique scope, they use AI tools for iterations, prototyping, and exploration. Every element players will experience in the final game reflects the team’s craft, artistry, and creative vision.</blockquote><p>After reading this I immediately stopped playing, and won't be back. This is 2D art, for a series dating back to the 90s and which has made it through seven previous games using 100% human-made art just fine, and you're telling us that somehow AI is needed <em>now</em>? Are we honestly supposed to take Ubisoft at its word that this dogshit image was the only one? And that it just magically slipped through multiple layers of supervision before appearing in a shipped product?</p><figure><figcaption><span>The full screenshot in question. I've circled the most obvious examples of AI-generated slop, but the more you look, the more you can see. It's incredible that this made it off someone's desktop, let alone into the final release of a commercial video game.</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the above statement Ubisoft<a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>have shown an updated version of the art</u></a>, which will be added to <em>Anno 117's</em> next update, but the public-facing damage has already been done.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-ai-controversy/"> <u>As I've said with <em>The Alters</em> previously</u></a>, once players can see one instance of AI being used, how do we know it hasn't been used throughout?</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-ai-controversy/"><div><p>I’m Getting Real Tired Of Not Being Able To Trust That A Video Game Doesn’t Have AI Crap In It - Aftermath</p><p>It sucks that players are having to scour every asset and line of dialogue</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>And just like I said with <em>The Alters</em>, I'll say again here: the presence of this stuff inside a game (and in such an obvious case) sends a very clear message to your fans and customers that you do not give a shit. You don't care that this technology is threatening art jobs (and beyond), that it's dehumanising the medium, that it's creating slop that makes your own product look like garbage to the degree that it's causing people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ox3p7z/ubisoft_responded_to_accusation_of_ai_art/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>playing what had seemed an otherwise good video game to jump online</u></a> and<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mourinho-disgust?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>re-enact the Jose Mourinho headphones meme</u></a>.</p><p>All of that for a piece of loading screen art!<a href="https://www.artstation.com/karakter/albums/587743?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Something that older games in the series, like 2019's <em>Anno 1800</em>, were especially noted for</u></a>. Gah!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GameStop Will Host a ‘Trade Anything’ Day in December]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-trade-anything-day-coming-december/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamestop-will-host-a-%E2%80%98trade-anything%E2%80%99-day-in-december.1355371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 6, GameStop is hosting a bizarre event dubbed ‘Trade Anything’ Day. This is exactly what it sounds like, with the retailer suggesting that <strong>almost anything </strong>can be exchanged for store credit on that day only. There’s a list of excluded items, like ‘radioactive waste’ or alcohol, but everything else goes – including <strong>taxidermied animals</strong>.</p>



<p>There are a few more catches involved, and nobody knows how much these items will be worth, but it’s certainly a bold attempt to get customers into GameStop stores across the nation.</p>







<h2 id="h-gamestop-trade-anything-day-coming-soon">GameStop ‘Trade Anything’ Day Coming Soon</h2>



<p>GameStop might have opened the door to some truly weird potential this coming Trade Anything Day. On December 6, customers will waltz into GameStop stores with anything they can get their hands on in the hope of securing some store credit.</p>



<p>It’s highly unlikely the average item will be worth much, and there are a lot of caveats tied to the event, but it’s nothing if not a humorous event that’ll get people into the retailer’s stores.</p>



<p>GameStop staff will have the final say on what can be accepted as a trade item, and there’s a pre-defined shipping container that has been handed to stores to determine the maximum size of said items. That stops you from wheeling a refrigerator or something bizarre into the store to trade.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of things that you <strong>can not </strong>trade to GameStop during Trade Anything Day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hazardous waste or material, chemicals, liquids. Lithium ion batteries or items containing lithium ion batteries. Weapons and ammo. Dead or alive animals (Taxidermy items are valid for trade). Alcohol, Tobacco, drugs or pharmaceuticals (legal or not). Computers (such as desktops, laptops, notebooks, all-in-ones, minis, workstations, e-readers, tablets, thin clients, smart displays, virtual reality headsets with built-in processor, interactive flat panel displays with built-in processor) excluding certain MacBooks GameStop normally accepts in trade. Computer peripherals intended for use with a computer and weighing less than 100 pounds (monitors, keyboards/keypads, mice/pointing devices, external hard drives (excluding those normally accepted in trade), facsimile machines, document scanners, printers, 3D printers, label printers, digital picture frames. Small electronic equipment (portable digital music players, VCRs, DVD players, DVRs, digital converter boxes, cable or satellite receivers, projectors including those with DVD player capability). Small scale servers. Televisions. Gift cards and other currency (foreign or domestic). Jewelry. Sexual and explicit items. Items resembling body parts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a hefty list after all, and there are some strange things on there that you <strong>think would </strong>be accepted, like computers, peripherals, and ‘small electronic equipment.’</p>



<p>‘Items resembling body parts’ are also banned from trading, which is understandable.</p>







<p>Do you want to take part in Trade Anything Day? Let me know what you intend to take in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-17-890/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-890-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-november-17.1355368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a new week, and we’re smack-bang in the middle of November. It’s a busy time all around – Thanksgiving is on the horizon, Christmas is just beyond, and Black Friday starts soon. There’s a lot to focus on, but today, let’s start small by smashing this NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to start your week on a high.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-17">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 17)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>

<p>If you’ve played ARC Raiders, you’ve heard about (or seen, or fought…) the Queen. She’s a terrifying enemy with a hulking construct, an immense attack set, and an enormous health pool. Before the Matriarch arrived, she was the game’s apex predator and an aspirational target for talented players worldwide.</p>



<p>In a recent clip uploaded to social media, the Queen was flipped on her head and taken down in the most hilarious, unscripted way by her own kin, a lone Probe looking to ascend to the stars.</p>







<h2 id="h-queen-faces-brilliant-and-unscripted-takedown">Queen Faces Brilliant and Unscripted Takedown</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded to social media by cHipChrome and shared by numerous users, we see a Queen thrown high into the air, flipped onto her belly, and sent crashing back down to Earth because she happened to wander over a Probe that was taking off at that moment.</p>



<p>The Probe, which must have one hell of a jet engine, took the Queen on a partial ascension to the skies, lifting her and bringing her back down again in the most undignified way for an ARC of her stature.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The player who captured the clip could do nothing but stare in awe at the event, which is a perfect representation of how unscripted and unpredictable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/arc-raiders-loaded-pc/">ARC Raiders</a> really is.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has been on the market for almost three weeks, and just yesterday, it managed to hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/">new all-time high</a> peak player count on Steam, securing another lofty height even amid the launches of Black Ops 7 and Escape from Tarkov.</p>







<p>It’s proving to be one of the most genre-disrupting games ever, shattering expectations and standing firm as one of 2025’s most impactful smash hits.</p>



<p>Have you played ARC Raiders yet? Let me know what you’re thinking about it on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Fortnite fans will want to check out <a href="https://amzn.to/4oK9Vcl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's early Black Friday deal</a> on Lego's Peely Bone building set before it disappears.

Not only is the 1,414-piece half-skeleton, half-banana on sale for its lowest price yet, but Lego is retiring this set soon. Peely Bone has largely held its MSRP since launching more than a year ago, so it's nice that Fortnite fans have the opportunity to grab it for less before it's no longer sold at major retailers. Amazon notes this limited-time deal is "selling fast."</p><p>Peely Bone is one of two Lego Fortnite sets from last October's launch lineup that will no longer be produced going forward. The 193-piece Durrr Burger is the other soon-to-be retired Lego Fortnite set. Amazon is all out of Durrr Burgers, but you can still snag one for only $9.40 (was $15) at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Lego+Fortnite+Peely+Bone+Discounted+To+Best+Price+Ever%2C+Retiring+Soon&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-11-16+19%3A39%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-16+19%3A39%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6536261&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Fortnite-tbd-77070%2F6922971258%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-peely-bone-discounted-to-best-price-ever-retiring-soon%2F1100-6536261%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a> or $9.49 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Lego+Fortnite+Peely+Bone+Discounted+To+Best+Price+Ever%2C+Retiring+Soon&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-11-16+19%3A39%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-16+19%3A39%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6536261&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-fortnite-durrr-burger-toy-for-gamers-77070%2F-%2FA-92538478&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-peely-bone-discounted-to-best-price-ever-retiring-soon%2F1100-6536261%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>.</p><div title="[Lego] Fortnite Peely Bone Lego Set Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5012" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Fortnite Peely Bone Lego Set Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible\/dp\/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Lego Fortnite: Peely Bone (1,414 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible\/dp\/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$80 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Peely Bone is the largest Lego Fortnite model from last fall's launch lineup, and it was only recently surpassed by Mecha Team Leader. As shown in the image above, Peely Bone is packaged in a black box, meaning it's a display model designed for adults and experienced builders.</p><p>Peely Bone measures over 14 inches tall with the included, buildable display stand. A Lego Fortnite nameplate attaches to the front of the stand. Along with the figure and stand, you'll piece together impressively detailed replicas of the Peely Pick Pickaxe and Paint Launcher weapons as well as a detachable Banana Bag Back Bling. You can move Peely's arms and wrists to create different poses.</p><p>Outside of Mecha Team Leader--the only other black-box Fortnite set--the 1,414-piece Peely Bone model has the most complex build process. The half-skeleton, half-banana frame makes each side of the build a unique and rewarding process. It's one of the most interesting Lego figures/statues I've built over the past few years. Plus, the finished model looks fantastic. The newer Mecha Team Leader model is a fun and challenging project, but I still think Peely Bone is the best Lego Fortnite model yet. And one of the best licensed video game builds, period.</p><p>If you register Peely Bone or one of the other original four Fortnite sets to your Lego account, you will receive a code to unlock the Operation Brite Starter Pack in the video game.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blast-r6-munich-major-champions-m80/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/m80-crowned-champions-at-blast-r6-munich-major-2025.1355278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The BLAST R6 Munich Major concluded in dramatic fashion in Germany, with M80 devastating Team Falcons with a 3-1 finish during the Grand Final. The victory secured M80 a massive $250,000 cut of the prize pool <strong>and </strong>direct qualification for next year’s Six Invitational tournament, the biggest event in Rainbow Six esports.</p>



<p>M80 commanded control of the final fixture, with Team Falcons firing back on just one map, and even that was a close finish that went down to the final round as a decider.</p>



<h2 id="h-m80-secures-top-spot-in-munich">M80 Secures Top Spot in Munich</h2>



<p>This is a monumental moment for North America as M80 stands up and collects a Major trophy in the Rainbow Six Siege esports scene. Team Falcons put up one hell of a fight and had a stellar run, but M80 proved to be the rock that broke open the hull of Falcons.</p>



<p>M80 has ticked a major box and qualified for the Six Invitational, which is the most important event in the Rainbow Six space. The Six Invitational will be held in Paris, France, and it will feature a multi-million-dollar prize pool.</p>



<p>This is now an even more insane record for M80’s Fabian ‘<strong>Fabian</strong>‘ Hällsten, a 31-year-old competitor-turned-coach who has achieved a stunning number of accolades in his many years in the Rainbow Six space:</p>



<ul>
<li>Six Invitational 2018</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2019</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2023</li>



<li>Dreamhack Winter 2018</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 1</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 2</li>



<li>Six Major Paris 2018</li>



<li>South Korean League 2024</li>



<li>North American League 2025</li>



<li><strong>Munich Major 2025</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>In 2023, Fabian also coached G2 Esports to success at the Six Invitational, but in 2025, a drastically poor finish left the veteran so far down the leaderboard, he might as well have not bothered attending the tournament.</p>



<p>Will 2026 bring about a redemption tale for Fabian? It also has the potential for M80 to give it a solid run and end up higher than ever before, a seventh-place finish.</p>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in 2024, when the M80 crew, then playing under the beastcoast banner, beat BTS in a dramatic grand final that blew the roof off the venue. This event told a similar story.</p>

              <p>It typically takes over $500 to get flagship features from premium noise-canceling headphones and Apple’s AirPods Max sit at $549 with no discounts in sight. For way less money, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones deliver comparable spatial audio, adaptive noise cancellation, and 24-hour battery life. The good news is that they <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/">just dropped to $298 on Amazon right now, down from the usual $429</a>. That’s a new all-time low and nearly half the price of AirPods Max which make these the obvious choice if you want premium features without the Apple tax.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spatial Audio That Works</h2>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra uses Bose’s I<strong>mmersive Audio technology to create spatial sound</strong> that feels like it’s coming from around you instead of directly into your ears. That works across any audio source, from streaming music to podcasts to movies, and doesn’t require special encoding like some competing spatial audio systems. CustomTune technology analyzes your ear shape and automatically adjusts the sound profile, so you get audio tuned specifically to how your ears receive sound.</p>
<p><strong>Three listening modes</strong> let you determine exactly how much of the outside world you want to hear. Quiet Mode gives you full active noise cancellation, shutting out ambient sound almost entirely for your next flight or a moment of focus in a noisy space. Aware Mode pipes in the outside audio so that you can hear flight announcements or converse with people without removing the headphones. Immersion Mode blends noise cancellation with spatial audio for the most immersive way of listening-although it eats more battery than the other modes do.</p>



<p>The microphone system focuses on your voice while filtering background noise and creates phone calls clearer than ever on any Bose headphones. Multiple mics work in concert to isolate your voice from wind, traffic, or crowded spaces, and people on the other end hear you without the competing noise drowning you out. It matters far more than it sounds like it would, since most pairs of headphones focus on music playback and treat call quality as an afterthought.</p>



<p>Comfort design employs soft ear cushions that seal around your ears without creating pressure points, and weight distribution on the headband falls evenly across the top of your head. You can wear these for hours without that hot, squeezed feeling some over-ear headphones create. Materials feel premium but not fragile, with metal reinforcements in stress points and cushions that keep their shape over time.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches 24 hours with standard listening or 18 hours with Immersive Audio mode active</strong>. That is good for several days of commuting or a number of long flights before you need to recharge. A 15-minute quick charge adds 2.5 hours of listening time, meaning even if you forget to charge them overnight, a quick top-up while you’re getting ready in the morning should give you enough juice for the day. The <strong>USB-C charging port</strong> uses the same cable that most modern devices use, so you won’t need any Bose-specific chargers when traveling.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth 5.3 provides stable connections up to 30 feet</strong> from your device with lower latency than older Bluetooth versions. You can walk around your house or office without your phone in your pocket, and the connection stays solid without dropouts or stuttering. <em>SimpleSync</em> lets you pair these headphones with Bose smart soundbars to watch TV at your own volume, not blasting sound through speakers and annoying roommates or family.</p>
<p>The <strong>foldable design collapses into a travel case that’s included in the box</strong>, and protects the headphones during transport without adding too much bulk to your bag. It holds the headphones securely in, with a pocket for the charging cable to keep everything organized rather than loose cables tangling with other gear. The hinges feel solid, not wobbly or creaky, which is important since these are the parts most likely to break on foldable headphones.</p>
<p>For $298, you’re getting flagship-level noise cancellation, spatial audio, premium build quality, and 24-hour battery life for roughly half of what Apple asks for similar features.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-just-hit-another-all-time-high-even-as-black-ops-7-and-tarkov-launch.1355245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders, the exhilarating extraction shooter from Embark Studios, is still going from strength to strength. Today, the title hit a new all-time high player count on Steam, pushing ever higher and continuing to hold a solid bar for the genre. As time goes on, ARC Raiders is only getting stronger, even with the arrival of Black Ops 7 <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Not only that, but ARC Raiders maintains a phenomenal track record in terms of user ratings, boasting a score of 88% on Steam from more than 100,000 reviews.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-won-t-slow-down">ARC Raiders Won’t Slow Down</h2>



<p>There’s no stopping ARC Raiders. It was thought that the 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov might halt ARC Raiders where it stands, but even that wasn’t enough to pull hundreds of thousands of players out of Embark’s all-new extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the game recorded a peak player count of 481,966 users, a new high and a stunning figure for any extraction shooter. By numbers, ARC Raiders is the most popular and successful extraction shooter ever made, and it’s <strong>dominating </strong>the genre.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As this article was written, ARC Raiders was the third-most popular game on Steam, beaten only by Valve’s titans, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2. It has topped Call of Duty, Battlefield 6, Marvel Rivals, PUBG, and Where Winds Meet this weekend with ease. </p>







<p>There’s plenty in the pipeline for ARC Raiders. Embark Studios has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">promised a hefty roadmap</a> for the title, which already covers November and December. Next month, we’ll get the Cold Snap update, which brings new map conditions, a new legendary weapon, a fresh Raider Deck, and <strong>much more</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>I spent the better part of<a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-luke-plunkett-leave-too-damn-long-goodbye-rip-1850630211?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>ten years covering board games at Kotaku</u></a>, even if it had never been a lifelong passion; I didn't really get into it until my 30s!</p><p>Beginning with accessible, licensed stuff that some friends had started picking up around 2010--like <em>Wings of War</em>, <em>X-Wing </em>and <em>Game of Thrones--</em>throughout the rest of that decade board games became everything to me. I played review copies for work, covered the industry at the same time, then I played them at home with my family and at <em>other </em>homes with my friends.<a href="https://stonehandgames.com/the-great-air-race/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I even spent five years working on my own game</u></a>, which came heartbreakingly close to major international publishing deals at least <em>three </em>times before sadly going nowhere.</p><figure><figcaption><span>That's me and my buddy Sam demoing our game, 'The Great Air Race', at PAX AU in 2019</span></figcaption></figure><p>For ten years I couldn't go a week without talking about a board game, at home or at work. Then along came 2020. The pandemic made life hard for everyone,<a href="https://kotaku.com/board-games-are-having-a-bad-time-1842653367?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>but it made things <em>especially </em>hard for board games, throwing the manufacturing and shipping of their big boxes and plastic parts into turmoil</u></a>. The industry is still reeling five years later, as tariffs and uncertainty over international postage continue to make things tough for publishers and creators alike.</p><p>At a personal level, Covid's impact on board games ended up deeply affecting me as well. An explosion in the cost of making and shipping games not only sent many companies bust, but left those remaining extremely reluctant to ship review copies all the way to Australia. Throw in price increases from an inflationary crisis that made <em>buying </em>games difficult, and a loss of most of my industry contacts when I left Kotaku, and over the course of 2020 I went from someone who played a ton of board games to someone who was playing almost none.</p><p>Which, whatever, if I lose some free board games waaahhh, boohoo, but it helped change me from someone who had been playing a lot of board games with a crew--made up mostly of old friends I'd played football with in the 2000s--to someone who was now never playing them and rarely seeing them. No more nights at home poking at a game for review, no more afternoons at a friend's house with their latest ill-advised Kickstarter purchase. Even our ritual weekends away, which we'd tried to have at least once a year, were gone, a victim of not just everything above but an insane price increase on holiday accommodation in Australia; a house we booked for $450 for a whole weekend in 2019 was, by 2023, charging $1400 for the same weekend.</p><p>Joni Mitchell nailed it with 'You don't know what you've got til it's gone', because I'd taken that decade of good times for granted, and now that they were gone there was basically a big hole in my heart, one that's sat gaping and maw-like as I've spent nearly every waking moment since 2023 either working here or at the other jobs I have to do because all of them combined still don't pay what my old job did. Don't get me wrong,<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"> <u>I'm immensely proud of everything we've built here</u></a>, but also, all work and no play has taken its toll.</p><p>Luckily (?), I wasn't alone in feeling this. If I wasn't seeing the boys, the other boys weren't seeing the boys either, and so in an effort to try to fill the hole that been in <em>all </em>our hearts, two weeks ago one of us booked some accommodation and the five of us headed off to the beautiful Lake Crackenback in the Snowy Mountains for four days of nothing but board games. Well, board games and some drinking. And let me tell you, it was life-changing.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Panoramic views of snow-capped mountains sure beats playing on my kitchen table, that's for sure</span></figcaption></figure><p>We fucking <em>crushed </em>the brief. I played 15 different games over those four days, nearly all of them new (or at least new to me), and in spending that much time over a table with old friends, laughing and plotting and laughing some more, it reminded me of just how special board games can be, how they're able to do things that go beyond just running through some rules and moving some pieces around.</p><p>I played an entire campaign of <em>Forgotten Waters</em>, which is basically a pirate RPG with enough guardrails that five grown men who had maybe had a few too many drinks could play without rolling dice or arguing about rules. We won after <em>seven hours </em>of play by driving a trident through a witch's heart, but not before one of us had been beaten unconscious and had his pants stolen by dolphins. I played <em>Return To Dark Tower</em>, which also had a story (driven by an iPad), but whose details I never bothered with because it also has a giant mechanised tower looming over the middle of the board that <em>shoots miniature skulls at people</em>.</p><p>I played <em>Indiana Jones: Sands of Adventure</em>, a family board game with a card-battling feature that feels weirdly like an actual Indiana Jones fight scene. I played <em>No Thanks</em>, a card game where you're spared from doing the worst thing possible because the person taking their turn before you had to do it first. I played <em>Archaeology</em>, where selling artifacts to distant museums is fine, I guess, because the practice has had so many edges sanded off to make it a card game that it's a blast.</p><p>I played <em>The Grizzled</em>, a beautiful card game about how hard it is to keep you and your friends alive during the First World War, which was if nothing else faithful to its theme. I played <em>Game of Thrones</em>, a game I've played so many times<a href="https://kotaku.com/i-am-a-terrible-winner-at-game-of-thrones-1677851052?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I don't want to write anything more about it</u></a>. I played <em>Raiders of the North Sea</em>, which might be<a href="https://kotaku.com/raiders-of-the-north-sea-the-kotaku-review-1822100886?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the most perfectly-designed board game ever made</u></a>.</p><p>I played <em>Courtisans</em>, a game about intrigue and secrecy that might have the most beautiful cards I have ever held, or will ever hold. I played <em>Lord Of The Rings: The Trick Game</em>, which I hated every second of, but will remember forever because of how beautiful the artists made every hobbit.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Raiders of the North Sea!</span></figcaption></figure><p>And then finally, on the last night, I played <em>Racoon Tycoon</em>, a game about industrialising a land inhabited only by animals, where doing things like sending cute cats with hats off to build railroads is just a normal thing that happens. Between some heated auctions, a vibrant marketplace system and constant five-beers-in deliberations on just <em>why </em>these animals were industrialising, it was one of the funniest nights of board gaming I've had in my life.</p><p>Of course we didn't <em>just </em>play board games; we also went to a distillery and ordered a tray of schnapps that was so big it came out on a modified ski, and the staff rang a giant cowbell when they delivered it to our table. I went for some lovely walks around an alpine lake, and both cooked and ate some great food. It was an A+ time from beginning to end.</p><p>After two years of relentless work with few breaks I <em>really </em>needed it, if nothing else than for the time away from a computer. But the thing that's stuck with me the most since getting home was just how good it was to be playing board games again. There's just something about sharing a table with friends, talking about the game but also everything else, that I struggle to fit into my life elsewhere.</p><p>Where else can you backstab one of your best friends and have everyone laugh about it, or feel your phone buzz under the table to read a text message from someone <em>else </em>across the table, telling you to murder someone <em>else </em>at the table? There's an accessible pleasure to being able to just sit down and play a game at the same time as someone is explaining the rules to you as you go, and there's something wonderful about the tactile experience of holding some glossy cards, moving some beautiful miniatures across a table just to annoy someone sitting next to you or...having a huge plastic tower shoot skulls at you.</p><p>Man, how I missed all this! And yes, this is now the point where I acknowledge that most of the things that contributed to my board gaming drought are still very much around; they're still expensive, accommodation is still unaffordable, I'm still working 2.5 jobs, seven days a week,<a href="https://triton-noir.com/pages/the-triton-noir-adventure-is-over?srsltid=AfmBOop3eIY1lZDGRH9A00ywqJrJfMYc0Fd_W27aCN--KZ8ybMWm1cu8&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>and one of my favourite board game studios shut down only a few weeks ago</u></a>, citing the same pressures that have been stalking the industry since 2020. I didn't spend four days in the mountains then come home to find everything magically better again.</p><p>But I did get to spend those four days in the mountains. And, however briefly, got to remember that board games fucking <em>rule</em>.</p><figure><div></div></figure>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-484-piece-lego-brick-box-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-50-off-this-creativity-essential-2000644683</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-484-piece-lego-brick-box-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-50-off-this-creativity-essential.1355233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO sets that use specific instructions look great on shelves but they don’t teach kids how to build from imagination. A classic brick box gives them raw materials and lets them figure out what to make instead of just following steps to recreate someone else’s design. This medium brick box includes 484 pieces in 35 different colors with wheels, windows, eyes, and a green baseplate for building whatever comes to mind. It <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/">drops to just $17 on Amazon, down from the usual $34</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low for a set this size with this much variety,</strong> and it’s the kind of price that makes stocking up for birthdays or holidays affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great for Creativity</h2>
<p>The 484-piece count gives kids enough bricks to<strong> create multiple creations at once</strong> instead of constantly tearing things apart to make something new. You get 35 different colors, which sounds excessive until you realize that having color variety lets kids create more realistic builds where different parts of a structure actually look distinct. The included 18 tires with wheel rims mean vehicles become an obvious building option and the windows plus toy eyes add character to buildings and creatures.</p>
<p>The green baseplate measures <strong>over three inches long and six inches wide</strong>, and provides a stable foundation for constructions that would otherwise topple over on a table. Baseplates matter more than most people realize, since they let kids build upward without having to worry about stability, and the green color works for grass, fields, parks, or any outdoor scene. If you grab more than one set, you can stick multiple baseplates together, creating larger building surfaces for ambitious projects.</p>



<p>Cross-compatibility with all LEGO construction sets means <strong>these bricks work with any other LEGO pieces you already own</strong>. Kids can mix this classic collection with themed sets like City, Friends, or Creator to expand their options without worrying about pieces not fitting together. This is across decades of LEGO production, so even vintage bricks from the 80s or 90s snap together perfectly with these new pieces.</p>



<p>The<strong> large plastic storage container serves as organization when play is over</strong>, keeping bricks contained instead of scattered across the floor, just waiting to ambush bare feet. There’s a handle for easy transport, which is conducive to kids taking their LEGO collection to friends’ houses or on trips without dumping loose bricks into a backpack. Of course, proper storage extends the life of the set, as pieces stay together and don’t get lost in couch cushions or vacuumed up by accident.</p>
<p>The builds, such as trains, cars, and tiger figures, will inspire kids when they don’t know what to do or need ideas. You can find simple building ideas in the included instructions or online, but the whole point is adapting those ideas into original creations. A basic train design becomes a starting point for adding cargo cars, passenger sections, or fantasy elements like wings or laser cannons. The tiger figure teaches how to use specific pieces for eyes and features, then kids apply that knowledge to building their own animals or creatures.</p>
<p><strong>The age range is from 4 to 99</strong> which reflects both young kids just learning to build and adults who still enjoy creative construction. Younger children focus on simpler builds and color sorting, whereas older kids create complex structures with moving parts or detailed scenes. Adults use them for desk decorations, stress relief, or collaborative building sessions with their kids.</p>
<p>At $17 for 484 pieces with specialty elements like wheels, windows, and a baseplate, <strong>you’re paying about 3.5 cents per brick</strong>. That’s exceptional value for real LEGO, particularly given that themed sets often ring in at 10 to 15 cents per piece.</p>

Switch 2 players will also be able to play Red Dead Redemption with Joy-Con 2 mouse controls.</p><p>If you're buying RDR to play on the original Switch, you should know it's still a pretty impressive port from a technical perspective. It runs at a stable 30fps in handheld and docked modes with 720p and 1080p resolution, respectively.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption is a spaghetti western that nails the mythic appeal of being a cowboy. The game doesn't stray far from the open-world template that Rockstar perfected with its previous GTA releases. You have the freedom to explore, cause trouble, and complete quests provided by the large cast of memorable characters.</p><p>John Marston's journey across the sprawling expanses of the American Wild West and Mexico to bury his blood-stained past and protect his family is a memorable one.</p><p>Along with the base game, this edition of RDR comes with Undead Nightmare, a horror-themed adventure in which the world around you has been transformed into an apocalyptic landscape overrun with zombies. Undead Nightmare was originally released as a standalone expansion, but these days it's bundled with the base game on modern platforms.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo\/dp\/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy for Nintendo Switch</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo\/dp\/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$20 (was $30)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you also want to explore the city streets of the modern age, check out Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition for only $20 (was $30).

The Definitive Edition launched in rough shape, but all three games are much better these days thanks to multiple patches and a significant overhaul last fall.</p><p>When you pop in the game card for the first time, you will be prompted to download roughly GTA: Vice City from the eShop (roughly 9GB). San Andreas and GTA III are stored on the card. The digital version of the trilogy from the eShop, for reference, is 25.4GB.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><h3>Nintendo Switch 1/2 Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h3><p>Along with deals on the pair of Rockstar Games titles, Amazon has deals on a bunch of other Switch and Switch 2 games.
