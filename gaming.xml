            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a preview of an upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. This more experimental spin-off of a Secret Lair, which quietly launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in December</a>, is continuing its eclectic streak with some new psychedelic land cards.</p>

<h2>The Secret Lair Chaos Vault 2025 Drop</h2>

<p>IN an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast briefly restates the intention of the Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. They are designed to be unexpected. Sales launching at unexpected times to selling unexpected items. The post also confirms an email list for updates on future Chaos Vault drops.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-basic-land-cards.jpg?itok=d_h9_YkZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-basic-land-cards.jpg?itok=JUXqkmW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post continues with a preview of the drop. Starting "sometime next week" the next drop will feature new basic land cards. These land cards showcase a vibrant art style with abstract, rainbow-like colors by artist Scott Balmer. They look more like background vignettes to a prog-rock album than a fantasy landscape.</p>

<p>If you are worried about cost, this latest Chaos Vault drop will try something different. Buying this Chaos Vault drop will get you ten copies of each basic land card by popular demand. That is fifty cards in total as part of this drop. In keeping with the chaotic nature of these drops, there is no current listed price.</p>

It features several pieces of artwork by Rhonda Libbey, Heikala, Ashley Mackenzie, and kelogsloops. The artwork moves back and forth between watercolor vignettes, cozy anime imagery, and impressionistic koi ponds.</p>

<p>This promise of experimentality is in keeping with the first Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. That drop, titled the Fairest Drop of All, had several cards in the style of art deco title plates. One card was illustrated in full profile. If this is maintained, Chaos Vault could serve as an outlet for alternative artists and to entice players with more eclectic taste.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-rumored-to-also-get-gears-of-war-hellblade-ii-and-age-of-mythology-from-microsoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PS5 users might be treated to a full wave of Xbox games in 2025 as Microsoft continues its third-party push. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle by MachineGames is coming in Spring 2025, and DOOM: The Dark Ages will be available on PS5 at launch, but there's a lot more coming from Microsoft-owned studios.</p>
<p>Earlier today, insider Nate the Hate <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the latest rumors he heard from his industry sources. According to him, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo The Master Chief Collection will be released sometime this year for Sony's PlayStation 5 and even for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> having heard the same rumors about these games making the jump to other consoles. He also added a few more titles that are reportedly being prepared for a PS5 debut: Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Age of Mythology, and even Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The latter in particular would mark the arrival of one of the most iconic Xbox franchises on its main console rival. Sure, it's a very old game at this point (the Ultimate Edition remaster launched in 2015), but it could be a sign that more games in the franchise originally created by Epic and now handled by The Coalition could be ported. After all, there have been rumors of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-collection-rumored-to-be-coming-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War Collection</a> for years.</p>
<p>The announcement of the other two would definitely be easier to handle for Xbox fans. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a great game in its own right</a> (albeit far too similar to the first installment), but it's also a niche title that could certainly use all the sales it can get. The same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology Retold</a> (which, however, still isn't available on Xbox consoles, either).</p>
<p>By the way, Corden even said these games could be released on the Nintendo Switch 2 as well as the PS5. Personally, I do have some doubts regarding Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, as that is a rather heavy game that might be really challenging to port onto a platform that is rumored to be quite a bit weaker than the Xbox Series S.</p>

In the podcast episode, Stiller implies they were working on <em>Severance </em>before the streamer’s existence was publicly announced, as he described the early experience as “developing this show for a platform that didn’t exist yet.” What we didn’t know at the time the series order made news is that Apple wasn’t convinced Scott should be Mark, and a year went by with no new developments on the show because they were trying to figure out how to get Apple on board with Scott starring.</p><p> “There was a long process of talking about other ideas. But, really, I was not going to do the show if [Scott] wasn’t going to do it. I kept saying that to them, and they were like, ‘Okay, maybe you’ll think of this actor. Maybe you’ll think of that actor,’” Stiller recalls. </p><p>Stiller was confused as to why the bigwigs at Apple were dragging their feet on accepting Scott, but changed their minds once they saw Scott read for the part. Taking it all in stride, Scott humbly admits his star power might not have been enough for the Apple head honchos. “I understood why they were feeling this way because, the first time I read this script, my first instinct was: ‘There’s no way I’m going to end up doing this. This is too good,’” Scott explains. “If I was Apple, I would likely be wanting a giant star to play this role.”</p><p>Since Apple came to their senses, Scott has gone on to garner an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe nomination for Beat Actor in a Television Series — Drama for his impeccable portrayal of Mark on <em>Severance. </em>Apple were saved from themselves, and we all have Stiller and his year-long persistence to thank for it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-fans-are-doing-a-gta-6-and-losing-their-minds-over-hidden-half-life-3-clues-they-desperately-want-to-be-real<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life fans have waited years for Valve to do… something <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-3">Half-Life 3</a> related. That’s nothing new. But recent weeks have seen a step up in the hunt for clues, with some believing Valve has already started an elaborate alternate reality game (ARG) that will lead to the dramatic confirmation that Half-Life 3 is finally on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This next level obsession, which GTA 6 fans will find instantly familiar, was kickstarted by Mike Shapiro, the voice actor behind Half-Life's mysterious G-Man. Late last year, in full G-Man mode, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-rumors-ramp-up-after-g-man-voice-actor-issues-cryptic-tweet-his-first-in-years">Shapiro published a cryptic tweet teasing some sort of news for 2025 alongside the tags #Valve, #Halflife, #GMan, and #2025</a>. It was Shapiro’s first non-reply tweet since he congratulated Valve on the success of VR exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx"><u>Half-Life: Alyx</u></a> back in December 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was enough to send the rumor-mill into overdrive, but since then all sorts of wild theories have emerged within the Half-Life community. Some who have analyzed Shapiro’s tweet to within an inch of its life believe he has started an ARG for Half-Life 3, connecting the dots in such a way to lead them to the ultimate prize in video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life fans obsess about numbers. Valve, famously, can’t count to three. But can it count to 197? It turns out that Shapiro’s X/Twitter post contained images of the cover art of his new song, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tYRar01hCM?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Long Dog</a>. Buried within this image is the number 197. Bizarre!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/longdog-1736528102368.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">197! What does it mean? Image credit: Mike Shapiro - Topic / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Long Dog is three minutes and 17 seconds long, aka 197 seconds long, because of course it is. Oh, and it came out 197 days after his previous song, Magnetic North. Weird!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s where the Half-Life community really steps up to the plate. Some fans theorize 197 is a reference to gold, or, more specifically, its stable isotope 197Au. This is Half-Life, after all! What’s gold got to do with anything? GoldSrc, pronounced "Gold Source,” is the original Half-Life engine. Eventually it was replaced by the Source engine, but the link is clear. Oh yeah, gold only has a single stable isotope, which means 197Au is the only gold isotope with no half-life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plot thickens. 197 appears three times in relation to Shapiro: in the cover art of his song, in the length of the song, and in the days after the release of his previous song. Three times! Could 197 hint at a date? Some think so. Perhaps it’s July 19?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we move on to fellow Valve game Counter-Strike 2, and what some believe to be hints at Half-Life 3 in the game. Remember we told you Shapiro’s song is called Best Long Dog? Valve renamed the Popdog hallway in map de_train to "Longdog."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot more to this apparent ARG, including even more numbers and people drawing lines in the snow. But the long and short of it is that Shapiro’s tweet, combied with changes to Counter-Strike 2, mysterious references to a dog and the number 197 are fuelling one of the most popcorn-worthy community obsessions since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">GTA 6 fans started analyzing phases of the moon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1hy21ov/weve_lost_our_collective_minds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor emsollas summed up the sentiment</a>. "I think we’re so starved with real information on our beloved HL3 (or even the notion of Episode 3) that we’re literally seeing signs where there are none," they said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes Shapiro’s post is definitely leading, and there maybe something coming. But breaking down every bit of info and finding the 197 and trying to connect it is just... lunacy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Half-Life 3 does not exist, despite the story ending on a cliffhanger with 2007’s Half-Life 2 Episode 2.

You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character.

There’s multiple collaboration events, free recruitment opportunities, a new version of a popular character, new story content, and in-person experiences.</p>If you haven’t checked out Goddess of Victory: Nikke yet, it’s a free-to-play sci-fi RPG shooter from developer Shift Up that’s available for download on iOS, Android, and PC. You’re in charge of a group of android soldiers called Nikke and lead them in a fierce battle to reclaim the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures.<p data-cy="paragraph">The game has been a resounding success, recently celebrating its second anniversary as well as reaching 45 million downloads worldwide. Throughout its two years, it has collaborated with several renowned IPs, including Neon Genesis Evangelion, Chainsaw Man, Nier: Automata, Re:Zero Starting Life in Another World, and Dave the Diver. That tradition continues in 2025, with Shift Up recently announcing a collaboration with Stellar Blade as well as a second collaboration with Evangelion.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/45m-celebratory-1920x1080-en-1735928143021.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stellar Blade collab will unite two popular games developed by Shift Up. Stellar Blade is an action-adventure game available on PS5 that shares a similar setting with Goddess of Victory: Nikke. You play as Eve, and your mission is to reclaim Earth from monsters called Naytibas after humans lost their battle against them and were forced to flee the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Evangelion collab arrives in February and will feature loads of new content. It will add two brand-new recruitable SSR characters, named Asuka: WILLE and Rei Ayanami (Tentative Name), and Sakura will be a free-to-obtain collaboration character. Plus, there will be new collaboration character costumes (including free-to-obtain costumes), a new 3D event map, new collaboration event storyline, and a new bullet hell minigame.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These two collabs are the biggest events on the horizon, but they’re not the only updates to come to Goddess of Victory: Nikke. Things got started on the first day of the year, with the addition of a new recruitable version of Rapi, the game’s heroine. Called Rapi: Red Hood, she’s an awakened form of Rapi who has taken on the power of another strong Nikke called Red Hood. The new version of Rapi is an SSR Nikke, the highest rarity in the game. Rapi’s upgraded variant was also accompanied by new events that delve deeper into her story for the first time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The start of the new year has also brought events that reward players with free chances to recruit characters. With the new events and story content, you can earn more than 100 recruitment opportunities in all. That gives newcomers or players who haven’t played in a while a chance to jump in and hit the ground running. Plus, the recruitment banner featuring popular character Scarlet: Black Shadow from last year’s New Year event will make a return.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/rewards-1735928173140.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new year celebrations have also been happening in the real world, and that will continue with a pair of live concerts in Japan and South Korea.

It’ll then move on to Kyung Hee University Grand Peace Palace in Seoul, South Korea on February 15.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/concert-kv-en-1735928267895.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For tickets and more information, you can visit the official websites for the <a href="https://nikke-concert.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese concert</u></a> and the <a href="https://nikke-concert.kr/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Korean concert</u></a>.

                <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is looking for feedback from players as it proposes a new rule revolving around in-game currencies and transactions that would allow the current Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and the protections it grants to consumers, to apply to certain video game companies.</p><p dir="ltr">Historically, the EFTA has been used to protect consumers from unauthorized transactions and requires financial institutions to fix errors and investigate and correct illicit transactions. The CFPB wants some of those same rules to apply to game companies whose products resemble "consumer asset accounts" that allow for converting in-game currency or goods into real money.</p><p dir="ltr">Under that interpretation, new regulations would apply to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> (which allows users to convert Robux into US dollars) and not games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, where in-game currency and goods can be purchased but can't be converted into real cash or exchanged between players. It would also likely apply to platforms like Steam, where users can sell in-game goods like weapon skins and other cosmetics for cash.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the distinction, the CFPB is asking players more broadly to share their experiences when it comes to purchasing digital goods and services in-game. It's asking for players to share their stories about issues they've encountered when using in-game currency, the kind of help (or lack thereof) they've received when something has gone wrong, and what protections they would like to see when it comes to protecting their in-game transactions and accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every year, Americans spend billions of dollars on video games and virtual worlds," the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/lfg-looking-for-gamers-cfpb-wants-to-hear-about-your-video-game-loot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CFPB writes</a> in its call for feedback and input from gamers. "A large portion of those expenses are purchases of gaming currency that is stored on a player's account and used for in-game transactions, like buying goods and services and person-to-person ("P2P") transfers. As detailed in our report on the financial risks of video games and virtual worlds, the ways in which these gaming currencies and accounts work is evolving rapidly, including to function more and more like banking and payment systems."</p><p dir="ltr">The CFPB goes on to state that gaming companies currently operate on the idea of "buyer beware," where users who run into issues converting currency, have their accounts hacked, or have their virtual goods stolen receive little to no help from game companies themselves. Those who encounter issues often have their refunds denied, may be banned from the game associated with their account, or are lost in customer service "doom loops" as they try to find answers, according to the CFPB.</p><p dir="ltr">"The proposed interpretive rule clarifies that gaming companies that are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act could violate federal consumer financial law if they fail to address problems gamers have with their accounts," the CFPB writes. "The CFPB invites the public, including gamers, to provide comments and stories to our proposal."</p><p dir="ltr">The public will have until March 31 to submit a comment by emailing the CFPB.</p><p dir="ltr">"Your contributions will help us shed light on features in the gaming industry that increasingly resemble traditional banking and payment options," the CFPB writes.</p>

		<p>Now I am not going to suggest the people behind these leaks are making stuff up, but at this point, almost any Xbox exclusive title seems likely to come to PS5. Microsoft has broken the barrier and with PS5 sales massively outstripping Xbox sales throwing a bunch of older games to hungry PS5 players is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Two reliable sources – NateTheHate and Windows Central’s Jez Corden – have been posting about the games in question.</p>
<p>“So, games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025 beyond the obvious include Flight Simulator, which will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/07/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” states Nate on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">podcast.</a></p>


<p>If you are reeling from the idea of Halo on PlayStation, he also suggests that the rumoured Gears of War collection will also come to PS5.</p>
<p>Jez has confirmed he had also heard about Flight Simulator and Halo, and<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo"> adds</a> “I’ve heard that also Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 this year, although I’m unsure if that includes the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are already set to land on PS5 this year.</p>
<p>It’s not all one way though, Nate also suggests that Final Fantasy VII Remake will land on&nbsp; Xbox this year with Rebirth following in 2026.</p>

However, back in 2010, we did get just such a game. </p><p><em>Transformers: War for Cybertron </em>is a third-person action shooter that lets you play through both sides of the civil war on the robotic planet of Cybertron. One campaign is focused on the Autobots and the other tells the story of the Decepticons. And don’t expect Earth or humans in this game, as it’s all about the bloody civil war that, eventually, leads to the fall of Cybertron (good name for a sequel) and the exodus of the Transformers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>War for Cybertron</em></a></span> and its sequel, <em>Fall of Cybertron</em>, play like most other third-person action shooters of the day, complete with the <em>Gears of War</em>-inspired “Hold this button to look at something cool happening” feature. But that’s fine, because instead of boring soldiers shooting people, you get to play as giant transforming robots with silly names who use big guns to destroy other robots, and ayou can become a car or hover tank, too. </p><p><em>War </em>and <em>Fall </em>both know that people want action and sci-fi nonsense in a <em>Transformers </em>game, make the right call in giving you plenty of that. Also, I hope you like different-colored metal corridors filled with nameless robot drones who you blast away over and over again, because that’s mostly what you do in these games. That may not sound great, but because it’s covered in <em>Transformers </em>lore, characters, and weirdness, it still ends up being a lot of fun. And unlike most other third-person corridor shooters of the era, you can transform into a car or a hover tank whenever you want. While in either form you can move faster and gain access to more powerful weapons. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They truly are more than meets than eye. </a></span></p><p>What’s wild to me is that I’m not a <em>Transformers </em>fan and I still enjoyed going back and replaying <em>War for Cybertron</em> earlier this week. If you <em>are</em> a <em>Transformers</em> fan, I expect you’ll get even more out of all the characters and lore shoved into these action-packed shooters. </p><h2 id="h62719"><a id=""></a><em>War for Cybertron</em> deserves a second life</h2><p>So how do you play <em>War for Cybertron</em> and its sequel in 2025? It ain’t easy. The games were pulled from digital storefronts years ago once Activision’s licensing deals expired, so you can’t just buy them on Steam. You can find used Xbox 360 copies floating around on eBay and other sites for under $30, but you’ll need an Xbox 360 console to play them, as none of the games are backward compatible. </p><p>There are other ways to find these games and play them on PC; perhaps you might check out some large archive of content on the internet. Once you get your PC version (I’m not asking how), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can use this tiny tool</a></span> to unlock the framerate and play <em>War for Cybertron</em> at 120 FPS. </p><p>It’s a shame that Microsoft and Activision haven’t cut a deal with Hasbro to remaster or at the very least port these <em>Transformers </em>games to modern hardware so more people can play them. We know Hasbro wants these games made available again, so it seems like it comes down to Activision. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571">The publisher claimed in 2023</a></span> that despite comments from Hasbro, it still had access to original code for the games. Over a year later, nothing has manifested and it’s still hard as heck to play these popular <em>Transformers </em>games. Which is a shame. </p><p>While we’ve continued to receive smaller <em>Transformers </em>games over the years, it’s been far too long since the last big-budget game based on the franchise hit store shelves. Hasbro and the other companies involved should work out a deal and get the <em>Cybertron </em>titles back on digital stores in 2025, giving <em>Transformers </em>fans who missed out a chance to play these fantastic games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft will launch Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025, according to a recent report, and that might not be all.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateTheHate</a> revealed this on his podcast recently, adding that Final Fantasy VII Remake is coming to Xbox as well in 2025. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central reporter Jez Corden</a> corroborated this and said, "Microsoft isn't stopping there." Corden reported that Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Age of Mythology, and Gears of War Ultimate Edition are scheduled to come to PS5 this year. Whether or not they show up on Nintendo Switch 2, however, wasn't mentioned in the report.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1877777878630183001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge recently said</a> that he was "willing to bet" that Microsoft would have some Xbox games "ready for the Switch 2."</p><p>Of course, plans can change at any moment, for any number of reasons, so while these reports claim to have accurate information, nothing is locked down for sure. GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>This report comes not long after an analyst said they expect 2025 to be the year that Microsoft begins to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-may-bring-all-their-big-games-to-ps5-analyst-says/1100-6528617/" data-ref-id="1100-6528617">"all their big games" to PS5.</a> None of this should be terribly surprising, though, as Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer himself has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-any-xbox-game-could-come-to-ps5-but-not-every-one-will/1100-6521148/" data-ref-id="1100-6521148">any Xbox game could come to PS5.</a></p><p>One of the next big Xbox games to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches for PS5 in Spring 2025. Beyond this, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">ongoing rumors of a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster project that could launch on PS5.</a> Looking further out, experts have said that the Halo franchise changing engines to Unreal would make it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">theoretically easier to bring the series to PlayStation.</a></p><p>In May, it was reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">mandating increasing margins at all divisions, including Xbox</a>. At the time, it was reported that Microsoft might look to release even more of its first-party games on PlayStation to help increase revenue. There is said to be an internal plan within Microsoft called "Latitude" that is focused on formulating plans to bring more first-party Xbox games to rival systems.</p><p>In other Xbox news, Microsoft is holding the next Xbox Developer Direct event on January 23, and the broadcast will feature a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-this-month-teases-brand-new-game/1100-6528709/" data-ref-id="1100-6528709">"brand-new" game. </a></p>

                <p>To counter fan harassment of its employees, from voice actors to developers, Square Enix has implemented a new Group Customer Harassment Policy. The new policy states and defines "customer harassment" of employees whether it's through violence, defamation, intimidation, or other means. Failing to respect these policies can result in Square Enix rescinding players' abilities to use its products.</p><p>"Such actions do not only prevent our employees and partners from engaging in their work with a sense of security but also causes disruptions to other customers," <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/customer_harassment_policy.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the policy reads</a>. "Square Enix will not tolerate harassment and will take action as necessary."</p><p>The policy does not give examples of harassment, but it's become clear within the gaming community why this inevitably had to be done: toxic fan behavior.</p><p>It's something the company has been dealing with for years. Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki Yoshida has addressed abuse against the game's developers on multiple occasions.</p><p>"I mean, I can take it, even though it doesn't make it less bad, but staff members will feel really down after getting those words when they gave their absolute best into trying to create something where everyone can enjoy," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-naoki-yoshida-addresses-verbal-abuse-from-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> in 2022. "This may end up making them no longer create things that are fun from there on."</p><p>Just last year, Wuk Lamat voice actor Sena Bryer was sent transphobic threats following the Dawntrail expansion. Yoshida continued saying he took those attacks personally.</p><p>"She worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all," added Yoshida. "It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p><p>Square Enix also reserves the right to cease providing support services or products to harassers and may go as far as to protect employees through legal action or even criminal proceedings.</p>

While the gaming world waits for Nintendo to finally reveal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, the rumours continue to swirl. And a reliable leaker has now claimed Microsoft will be a "very big supporter" of the console, bringing two major Xbox series to Switch 2 this year, including Halo.
</p>
<p>
That's according to podcaster NateTheHate (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-is-reportedly-getting-two-major-xbox-games-including-halo/">VGC</a>), who notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">broke the news</a> Microsoft was planning to make some of its first-party titles multiplatform early last year. That, of course, proved to be true; <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Grounded, and Pentiment are now available on PS5, with the latter two also on Switch.
</p>
<p>
NateTheHate now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">reports</a> Microsoft's multiplatform strategy will expand to Switch 2, and that the company will be a "very big supporter", releasing two Xbox titles on the platform - Flight Simulator and Halo: The Masterchief Collection - in 2025. It's also claimed both will launch for PS5, joining the other Xbox first-party games - namely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 - already confirmed for Sony's machine.
</p>

<p>
NateTheHate adds Microsoft will additionally be "porting and patching [its] current Switch line-up" for Switch 2, introducing the likes of 4K support, and that he "wouldn't be surprised if Sea of Thieves, maybe Hi-fi Rush, also find their way over." Last year, it was claimed Hi-Fi Rush would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-will-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-report">skip the current version of Switch in favour of Switch 2</a>, although that was before Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">closure of developer Tango Gameworks</a> and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">subsquent purchase</a> by Krafton.
</p><p>
As for other, non-Microsoft Switch 2 releases, NateTheHate says Square Enix is bringing Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth to Nintendo's machine as well as Xbox Series X/S, with Remake reportedly arriving this year and Rebirth in 2026. That's not especially surprising to hear, of course, given Square Enix last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">confirmed it was "aggressively pursuing" a new multiplatform strategy</a> amid reports that Rebirth underperformed on PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, before all this can happen, Nintendo needs to formally unveil Switch 2 - although by the time it finally does so, there might not be a whole lot left we don't already know. Numerous Switch 2 reports and leaks have surfaced in recent weeks, purportedly showing off everything from the machine's form factor to its logo. And while Nintendo did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">briefly break its silence</a> earlier today amid the swirl of reports, all we know for certain is that Switch 2 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">officially unveiled before 31st March</a>, when the company's current financial year comes to a close.

But the role splits into two: some are main tank protectors, others are off-tank supporters, who run into a team fight hoping their healers are paying attention. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’</a></span> Vanguards similarly fall into several different archetypes, and each has a niche they occupy. But who is the best? While it can depend on the situation, a few heroes are more versatile than others, letting us love them more. Here’s our ranking of the eight tanks that are in the game now. We’ll update this ranking when the Thing is added later in Season 1.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-recommend-id="image://06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-recommend-id="image://06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As far as Vanguards go, I consider myself a Captain America main. Because I’ve spent a decent amount of time wielding his vibranium shield I’m confident in saying that America’s Ass is easily the worst tank in the game that I keep using because I haven’t found another character I gel with. When Steve pops off, it feels incredibly satisfying—more often than not you jump into a fight, slap someone around for a little bit, then jump out as your health rapidly deteriorates. Cap is one of the most disruptive heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it’s hard to get that much value out of him when his melee-based kit lacks that certain punch you need to make the most of his dives. If his attacks were a little more powerful and he could reliably get kills, he could be a contender, but right now, he serves as little more than a distraction while other heroes pull off more impressive plays.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-recommend-id="image://789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-recommend-id="image://789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Master of Magnetism is one of the more methodical Vanguards in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Sure, his slower kit isn’t as exciting as barreling through enemy teams as Thor, or setting up an ambush as Doctor Strange—hence his lower place in this list—but if you need someone to exert enormous amounts of pressure onto an enemy team and stop your team from getting dived on, Magneto’s an excellent pick. His shield-based moveset is all about absorbing damage and throwing it right back at the enemy team. He requires more patience than other tanks on the roster, but in the right hands, he’s a fortified frontline fighter.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-recommend-id="image://828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-recommend-id="image://828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On his face, the Hulk can come off like a gimmick character, clearly taking a page from <em>Overwatch</em>’s book. Like D.Va in Blizzard’s shooter, the Hulk has two forms, one much weaker with only a pistol to pester enemies until he can return to his massive, more impactful form. Despite this, The Hulk is an effective dive hero with good crowd control, mobility, and ways to convert damage into power, and he has better damage output than Captain America, so you can actually reliably smash your way through a team fight. His Super Hulk ultimate is an incredible survival tool that heals you to a whopping 1500 health, and altogether he’s just a really bulky brawler that can wreck shop when you know how best to cycle your abilities. However, Hulk’s team-up abilities make him one of the most desirable off tank picks with certain teammates. Pairing Hulk with Doctor Strange and Iron Man gives the two sarcastic geniuses an incredible damage boost that can make even half a team a force to be reckoned with. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-recommend-id="image://0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-recommend-id="image://0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the more entertaining spins <em>Marvel Rivals </em>puts on <em>Overwatch </em>archetypes is making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span> the equivalent of the robot-piloting hamster, Wrecking Ball. The symbiote-journalist duo is all about swinging into the battlefield, causing a bunch of chaos, and then feeding on all the incoming damage to get a second wind. He’s got great crowd control as he slows enemy movement, and can disrupt an enemy team formation better than most other heroes on the roster. Admittedly, he is one of the more independent tanks, and doesn’t have much in the way of supportive abilities to help his team, lacking something like Magneto or Hulk’s shields, but that mostly means you need a good team comp to compliment him when he swings into battle. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-recommend-id="image://fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-recommend-id="image://fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Peni Parker is an absolute menace on defensive maps. Her mine-based kit allows her to set up traps, claim space, and has enemy teams walking on eggshells as they try to push onto an objective and avoid her explosive traps. Her abilities are less useful when you’re pushing toward an objective yourself, but her mech is powerful enough to handle scraps and push alongside more brawl-based heroes. While she may be a bit situational, Peni is easily one of the best Vanguards in the game for holding an objective and countering teams that carelessly dive on a point. Also, setting up mines in front of the enemy spawn and blowing up half their team never gets old.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-recommend-id="image://ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-recommend-id="image://ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The God of Thunder is easily the best off tank in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. His mobility attacks let him dive in and out of fights easily, but they also double as a means to isolate and assassinate enemies, even as they’re grouped up. Thor’s entire kit feeds into itself, gaining power, health, and a stronger transformative state just by smartly utilizing all of his abilities. Where some tanks are more slow-paced, rewarded for intellectual play and setup, Thor is an unstoppable force, encouraged to stay in the brawl and reliably deal some of the most devastating attacks with short universal cooldowns. The catch being all of this is powered by a unique passive called Thorforce, required to pull off some of Thor’s most impressive abilities. Managing those mechanics is the difference between getting shredded immediately and swiftly taking out the enemy supports and cutting your foes off at the knees.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-recommend-id="image://2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-recommend-id="image://2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy’s talking tree is one of the more straightforward Vanguards in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but Groot is also one of the most reliable at what he does. He uses his branch-like limbs to build walls anywhere on the map. This can be a defensive measure, but it’s also an excellent way to stall enemies from reaching an objective. Toss those suckers up in front of an enemy spawn door and it will take them at least a few seconds to shoot their way through. Not to mention his ultimate ability has some of the best crowd control, as he groups enemies together and sets them up for a quick and easy wipe. Groot is just good at getting in the way, and when the enemy team finally does make its way to him, he’s a strong brawler who can become near-invincible when Rocket is riding on his shoulder and pumping him full of health. Groot is the platonic ideal of a defensive tank, and I’m always thrilled to see one on my team.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-recommend-id="image://d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-recommend-id="image://d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stephen Strange is easily the Vanguard who has gotten the most buzz since <em>Marvel Rivals</em> was in beta, largely because his portal ability led to some hilarious viral moments of tricking foes into walking off the side of the map out of spawn. But that’s a microcosm of what makes him a compelling tank, because the experimentation he allows is unmatched by almost any other character in the roster.</p><p>Baseline, Doctor Strange is one of the most effective defensive heroes because his shield is a big Reinhardt-style wall that can protect multiple heroes at once. But after you pair that with the sorcerer’s flight-based mobility, his possibilities as a shutdown character make him an excellent counter to some of the greatest threats in the game. Is your enemy’s Hela about to unleash a devastating ultimate on your team? Fly up in her face, throw up your shield, and give your team a chance to take cover before she can rain damage down on you. Is the enemy team putting too much pressure on your team to successfully get out of spawn? Throw up a portal and ambush them from behind. And yes, a well-placed portal can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-doctor-strange-portal-combo-exploit-kills-1851723986&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-doctor-strange-portal-combo-exploit-kills-1851723986">play incredible mind games with the enemy team</a></span>, tricking them into walking off into a chasm, or forcing them into a loop by placing both ends of the portal in front of their spawn room doors.</p><p>Doctor Strange is the kind of hero you need to keep a game like <em>Marvel Rivals </em>interesting.

NateTheHate also said on his podcast that he would expect to see a recently rumored remaster of <em>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion </em>be released simultaneously on other platforms this year, as well as any anthology collection of remastered <em>Gears of War</em> games, should one actually turn out to exist (<em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, a prequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hy741m/natethehate_gears_of_war_eday_might_come_out_this/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hy741m/natethehate_gears_of_war_eday_might_come_out_this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is rumored</a></span> to launch as early as the end of 2025). </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549">Late last year</a></span>, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said it hadn’t been decided if the next <em>Halo</em> game would be a multiplatform release, but that there were “no red lines” anymore when it came to the exclusivity of the company’s first-party library. Microsoft began this shift a year ago by bringing <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Pentiment</em>, and <em>Grounded</em> to other platforms, and has already confirmed its big Xbox exclusive of 2024, <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, will come to PS5 less than six months after release.<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>are also already confirmed to be coming day-and-date to Sony’s console in 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
