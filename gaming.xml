		<p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind Games have revealed A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a quiet and sneaky horror game that’s set to release for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91zi75E_SA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can get a feel of from the trailer, every moment in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be about trying to survive and navigate the world while staying as quiet as possible. You’ll also note the need to use an asthma pump and a handheld noise meter. Of course, this is animated as opposed to gameplay, but it’s indicative of the elements you’ll need to juggle. The game will follow an original story, casting players as a young women struggling to evade the nightmare monsters, as well as overcoming family conflicts and inner fears in this spin-off from the popular film franchise.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this reveal has come at the exact right time, just a week or so ahead of the theatrical release of A Quiet Place: Day One.</p>


<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is in development by Stormind Games, who are best known for the psychological horror <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/19/remothered-broken-porcelain-review/">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and Tormented Fathers, as well as action RPG Batora: Lost Haven. From the trailer, this would be a big step up for the studio, but they’re leaning into the right ideas and tropes that will fit well with a video game – here’s hoping for some Alien: Isolation vibes.</p>
<p>What’s not immediately is how this relates to the A Quiet Place game that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/a-quiet-place-video-game-2022-trailer/">first confirmed to be in development back in 2021</a>. That game was also to be published by Saber, but had developers iLLOGIKA and EP1T0ME attached. Certainly Saber has held onto the video game license while being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/14/embracer-has-officially-sold-off-saber-interactive/">sold off by Embracer</a>, but this game is from a different developer. We’ve asked for clarity on this point.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-pits-you-against-the-movies-monsters-this-year.903327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quiet-place-road-ahead-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind have announced&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em>, a game based on the popular movie franchise. It's launching later this year.</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine if you've seen the movies,&nbsp;<em>The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>will task you with sneaking through a variety of environments while trying not to make any noise.</p>
<p>The story told here will be entirely new, so you won't be retreading the events of either of the already-released movie installments, nor will you be playing an adaptation of the upcoming prequel&nbsp;<em>Day One</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-monster.jpg?itok=qsI48I5i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-monster.jpg?itok=PluGyxh6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ever wondered how you'd do against the monsters of&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place</em>? Well, wonder no more.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since the monsters of&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place&nbsp;</em>aren't exactly known for being pushovers, it doesn't sound like you'll be able to engage in any form of combat in Stormind's game.</p>
<p>Rather, you'll be sneaking around each environment, scavenging for tools and distracting the monsters to help you pass by unnoticed. If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em>Outlast</em>, then you'll know what kind of ballpark you're in here.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a sense of what kind of journey you're in for. Suffice it to say that if you're looking for&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>-style action horror shenanigans, you ain't gonna find them here.</p>

<p>Developer Stormind Games has a history with horror. Although the studio's most recent game is 2022's&nbsp;<em>Batora: Lost Haven</em>, it's also known for psychological horror jaunts&nbsp;<em>Remothered: Tormented Fathers&nbsp;</em>and its followup&nbsp;<i>Broken Porcelain</i>.</p>
<p><em>Tormented Fathers&nbsp;</em>met with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/5495/remothered-tormented-fathers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">broadly positive reviews</a> on its release back in 2018, but&nbsp;<em>Broken Porcelain</em>'s reception was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/10349/remothered-broken-porcelain" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decidedly more frosty</a> a couple of years later. Our own reviewer rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/remothered-tormented-fathers-review-twisted-experience">enjoyed</a> both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/remothered-broken-porcelain-review">games</a>, though.</p>
<p>At any rate,&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2233120/A_Quiet_Place_The_Road_Ahead/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009366/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead/9NZLPG7P5KSS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> sometime this year.

            <p>Nintendo has announced the date and time for its next Direct showcase.</p>
<p>Those wanting to hear more about what the Mario maker has in store over the coming months can tune in on 18th June, at 3pm. The Direct will be available to watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kX3BkD5PVUM">Nintendo's YouTube channels</a>.</p>
<p>The company has not laid out specifics for what we can expect during tomorrow's broadcast, merely stating it will be "focused on Nintendo Switch games coming in the second half of 2024" and "there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation".</p>

<p> Back in May, Nintendo officially discussed what the world has dubbed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> for the first time, stating it would make an announcement within this fiscal year, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">not during its June presentation</a>.</p> <div>

        <p>And why early access was so important.</p>

Baldur's Gate 3 will receive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">official mod support in a forthcoming patch</a>, which Larian CEO Swen Vincke said will be a handover moment to players.

</p>
<p>
Speaking at BAFTA's An Evening with Baldur's Gate 3 after the game received multiple wins at this year's awards, Vincke discussed development of the game and Larian's long term support.
</p>
<p>
"One of the big things for us, and the one that we're really working towards now, is the ability for players to mod [Baldur's Gate 3] themselves, because then they will be able to make their own things," said Vincke. "And I think that will be the point where we're going to say 'ok, now it's yours fully'."

</figure>
<p>
He admitted the team hasn't finished development of mod support yet and that it's been "hard trying to make that work". The release of the update, though, won't mark the end of support entirely, but "you will see the level of support diminished to really critical bug fixes" and for now "we're still working as if the game was just out".
</p>
<p>
When asked if he was looking forward to this "final handover moment", Vincke replied with an emphatic "yes". 
</p>
<p>
"We're working on our new thing, we're super excited about the new games," he continued. "We're creative spirits also, we don't want to keep on doing the same thing, we really want to move forward and do new things."
</p>
<p>
We know already it's likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developers-next-game-likely-early-access-launch-too">Larian's next game will also be released in early access</a>, as director of publishing Michael Douse previously stated.

</p>
<p>
Vincke spoke further at BAFTA about the importance of early access for Baldur's Gate 3's development.
</p>
<p>
"The biggest thing that came out was it allowed us to course correct," said Vincke. "There were mistakes that we were making and the players were telling us 'this is a mistake, you shouldn't be doing this'.
</p>
<p>
"We try to listen and do as much as we can, where we think it makes a lot of sense. So that I think was instrumental in BG3's success."
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SA902342.png?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>BAFTA/Dan Fearon</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But how do developers know what feedback is actually useful? "A lot of it is on gut feeling," said Vincke, admitting some elements can be analysed through data. "At the end of the day it's really how do I feel like a player about the game. I think if you do it any other way, you will just be paralysed, you won't be able to do anything. If you're going to try to do it by committee, then it's just going to be the most mediocre things that you can have. You have to follow your gut and say 'what game do you want to play?' And then it actually comes very easy, you just have to hope that that's the game that other people want to play also."
</p>
<p>
He added: "You also have to take into account there are many, many people in the universe with many many opinions. So it's impossible to cater to everyone. You don't necessarily always have to listen to the majority if you really believe in what's inside of the game."
</p>
<p>
So is early access the future of game development? At the least, Vincke said he would "heartily recommend it", but admitted four years of early access was "actually quite long" as players can get tired over that time. 
</p>
<p>
He continued: "You really shouldn't approach it with the attitude 'oh it's just early access'. There are players playing this that care. So you should treat them with respect."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">Baldur's Gate 3 won five awards at this year's BAFTAs</a>, including Best Game. A recording of An Evening with Baldur's Gate 3 will soon be up on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@bafta">BAFTA YouTube channel</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">Larian recently opened a new studio in Poland</a> as development on its next project ramps up.

            <p>Fallout has seen a renewed spike in popularity following the release of Amazon's TV adaptation. However, despite this, Bethesda doesn't feel under pressure to rush a new game out to placate fans.</p>
<p>Speaking with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Todd Howard acknowledged that the Fallout series is probably at its most popular, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">franchise boasting some record player numbers over recent months</a>. Howard went on to state the studio gives "a lot of thought to franchise management" when questioned specifically about the future of Fallout as a whole.</p>
<p>"I spend a lot of time thinking about franchises I love... so, for us, it is sort of game planning out - number one, making sure Fallout is relevant in the world, and well, I think, clearly it is," the studio exec said. </p>

</figure>
<p>"People are hungry for even more. We've never stopped doing Fallout work. A lot of that work goes on, obviously, in Fallout 76." At this point, he mentioned its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-skyline-valley-update-strikes-right-at-the-heart-of-what-you-love-about-single-player-fallout">new Skyline Valley update</a>, saying the team is "really excited with where that game is at".</p>
<p>But, what about other Fallout games in the future? "Obviously, I can't talk about those right now," Howard said. "But, I would say rushing through them or 'we need to get stuff out that is different than the work we're doing in 76', you know, we don't feel like we need to rush any of that."</p>
<p>Howard believes Amazon's Fallout TV show fills a gap for the series' fanbase "in terms of the franchise and storytelling". He said he still understands the community's "desire for a new mainline single-player game", but noted "those things take time".</p>
<p>Said Howard: "I don't think it's bad for people to miss things, as well... we just want to get it right and make sure that everything we're doing in a franchise - whether it's Elder Scrolls or Fallout or now Starfield - that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loves these franchises as much as we do."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>The developer said his preference is often to hold things back for as long as possible, saying his "perfect scenario for games" is to "announce them and get them out as quickly as possible" - a point he has made before.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the studio's Elder Scrolls 6 reveal in 2018. However, according to Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">Elder Scrolls 6 was only announced when it was because "the pitchforks and torches were out"</a>. Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wishes he had announced The Elder Scrolls 6 differently</a>.</p>
<p>"I probably would've announced it more casually" today, Howard said in August, admitting he had "asked [himself] a lot" if he regrets revealing the game when he did.</p>
<p>That being said, The Elder Scrolls 6 still looks to be Bethesda's next big RPG release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">Fallout 5 is also confirmed</a>, but won't arrive until afterwards.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in his conversation with MrMattyPlays, Howard confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Starfield will be getting at least one more expansion after Shattered Space</a> releases later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-%E2%80%93-get-in-the-zone.903312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-get-in-zone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> has had a long journey to get to where it is today. It’s a project that’s been in limbo for over a decade since it was originally announced in 2010. It’s been canceled multiple times, and the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine didn’t help.</p>
<p>But we’re closer to it coming out since the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-still-rough-but-promising">last time we saw it at Gamescom</a>, and I was lucky enough to try a demo of the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days, and it was a surreal experience that immersed me into its world.</p>
<p>The demo introduced me to the protagonist, a man on the mission who acts as if he has nothing left to lose. Despite any warnings, he needs to dive deeper into the Zone to learn more about some artifact, and that’s where our story begins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At its core, <em>Stalker 2 </em>is an immersive first-person shooter, and it leans into supernatural horror elements. I started off with a pistol and knife, and I had to scavenge for any other equipment and ammo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game started me in the Zone, a place suffering from the aftermath of a second alternate-history Chornobyl disaster. The local wildlife has been irradiated and irreversibly mutated, and I ran into a few of these creatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course, the real monster in any of these sorts of stories is our fellow man. Some military group is also looking for the same artifact my character is learning about, leading to some gunfights in dark places.</p>

<p>Overall, the gunplay here feels a little bit floaty and weightless, which is at odds with the rest of the movement. Running and turning felt a little heavy and intentional, inherently slowing down the general pace of the game. But when the guns feel a bit like peashooters, the experience doesn’t quite mesh well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2</em> seems like the sort of game that will really encourage exploring and looting anything that isn’t nailed to the ground. Ammo was scarce, and I found lots of new weapons to switch to just by searching enemy bodies or rundown homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of story and dialog though, I was mostly hooked into the mystery of the world and the protagonist. I haven’t seen much of the other <em>Stalker </em>games, so I’m likely missing some context. But considering the franchise has been quiet for a couple years, I’m likely not the only person who could experience it for the first time through <em>Stalker 2</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s something eerie in the air in the Zone. The protagonist wants to keep digging deeper into it to figure out the secret behind some weird artifact he found, despite someone else telling him to leave before things get worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But is it the Zone itself that’s somehow getting worse? Are the other soldiers going to be the problem? It always feels like something is lurking in the shadows, making the atmosphere tense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it’s hard to say how <em>Stalker 2</em> will shake out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-release-date-revealed-and-pre-orders-available-now">when it releases on Sept. 5</a>, I think there’s enough here to keep me interested in seeing more. It has an interesting narrative hook with a compelling setting, and there’s a dystopic open world to explore.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-is-coming-2026/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a new filing spotted <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bankier</a>, CI Games is working on a sequel for Lords of the Fallen, due for release in 2026.</p>



<p>All of the information from the filing has been translated from a Polish version. So, it does warn that it “may contain certain discrepancies.”</p>



<p>Via translation, the new filing does not confirm a concrete release date. However, it does mention that CI Games signed a contract with Epic Games for the exclusive rights to release it on PC. </p>



<p>These rights appear to extend “for the entire product life cycle,” implying the sequel will not come to Steam. The first Lords of the Fallen was available on Windows.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Lords of the Fallen sequel, currently going by Project 3, will also be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S platforms. </p>



<p>Versions of the game for PlayStation and Xbox are “currently in development.” So, these ports might be available at launch, like its predecessor.</p>



<p>The previous Lords of the Fallen game launched in 2023 to mixed fan reviews on both Steam and Metacritic. Publisher CI Games faced layoffs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-publisher-ci-games-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in January 2024</a>, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-developer-ci-games-lays-off-30-more-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another round of layoffs</a> in May 2024.</p>



<p>However, the developers did muster <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final update</a> on Lords of the Fallen 2023 last April, titled Master of Fate. This major update introduced new questlines, skills, improved balancing, and more.</p>

"While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close. It's getting close."</p><p>This likely comes as welcome news to fans of the soulslike genre created by Miyazaki and FromSoftware, who seemingly have games even better than Elden Ring to look forward to in the future.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close. It's getting close.</p></div><p>Miyazaki didn't share what elements were missing from Elden Ring, because "it's hard to say without giving spoilers for [his] next idea or [FromSoftware's] next games," but did say the slightly tragic reality that he never gets to experience the wonder of his own games is one thing holding him back.</p><p>"I think one thing that's not necessarily missing, but makes it difficult to achieve my ideal, is that when I play it, I know everything's going to happen," Miyazaki said. "I already know everything that's going on. So in terms of enjoying the game from a player's perspective, I'd love to not know that, and for somebody else to make my ideal fantasy game, please, if possible. Then I can enjoy it just as a player."</p><p>Players will get to experience that feeling once again when Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion launches on June 21, 2024.</p><p>Just like previous FromSoftware games Dark Souls and Bloodborne, however, accessing the DLC isn't as simple as selecting it on a menu, as players must tick off a handful of obscure feats beforehand, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">including beating an optional boss</a>. Thankfully, IGN has a guide on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">how to prepare for the Shadow of Erdtree DLC</a> if you need to scramble ahead of the expansion's release.

Many fans are therefore waiting with bated breath for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-and-new-trailer">release of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, which will likely add hundreds, if not thousands, of new secrets and story threads to be discovered. Beware of spoilers online, however, as FromSoftware has issued a heads up to players after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-asks-elden-ring-players-not-to-spoil-shadow-of-the-erdtree-as-dlc-details-leak-online">major story details leaked ahead of launch</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">In our 10/10 review of the base game</a>, IGN said: "Elden Ring is a massive iteration on what FromSoftware began with the Souls series, bringing its relentlessly challenging combat to an incredible open world that gives us the freedom to choose our own path."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Just like previous FromSoftware games Dark Souls and Bloodborne, however, accessing the DLC isn't as simple as selecting it on a menu, as players must tick off a handful of obscure feats beforehand, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">including beating an optional boss</a>.

		<p>Pieces Interactive, the studio behind this year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">Alone in the Dark</a> remake, has been closed by Embracer Group.</p>
<p>The news comes from a statement posted to the Pieces Interactive website, saying “Thanks for playing with us” and that “Our last release was the reimagining of Alone in the Dark.”</p>


<p>Unfortunately for Pieces Interactive, while it had grand ambitions to emulate the Resident Evil remake revival and brought in some popular actors to lend their performance and likenesses, Alone in the Dark failed to meet expectations, both in terms of critical reception and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/24/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-reboots-both-underperform-for-embracer/">“softer than expected” sales</a> after the game’s eventual March 2024 release. The studio has already been hit with layoffs a month later, but is now being completely closed by Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, Pieces produced a number of original games, such as Puzzlegeddon, Fret Nice and Leviathan Warships, and work-for-hire games that included <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/06/03/magicka-2-review/">Magicka 2</a>. The studio was acquired by Embracer in 2017 and initially worked on expansions for Titan Quest – Ragnarök and Atlantis – before getting the opportunity to reimagine survival horror classic Alone in the Dark.</p>

<p>They join the long list of studios closed by Embracer Group over the last year – 44 studios have closed including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/11/free-radical-design-shutdown-timesplitters-cancelled/">Free Radical Design</a>, Onoma and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-shut-down/">Volition</a> – amid layoffs that have affected over 4,500 employees. Embracer has also sold off studios and sub-groups, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/14/embracer-has-officially-sold-off-saber-interactive/">Saber Interactive</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">Gearbox</a>, and announced a plan to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/22/embracer-group-plans-to-split-into-three-separate-companies/"> split into three separate entities</a>.</p>

(Given FromSoft has acknowledged there are leaks, it would suggest there’s some validity to the claims.) After a certain amount of goading, the anon account uploaded a better quality, much longer video of what they purport to be the final boss fight. Although adds, “My friend sux so I have no idea. He told me this was the final boss, but it wouldn’t surprise me if he missed something.”</p><p>Elsewhere the same account has posted three-minute videos of significant fights with named characters in the subject lines, thus removing surprises even for those who don’t click past the spoiler warnings on the clips. (I don’t know a thing about <em>Elden Ring</em>, and so don’t mind at all that I’ve seen this stuff, if you were worrying. It might as well be in Klingon.)</p><p>So, be warned. A lot more of this will start to appear as Friday approaches, so if you’re looking to truly protect yourself, just set up a VPN that blocks all web traffic but for <em>Kotaku</em>.

<p>Saber Interactive has just released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91zi75E_SA8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a> for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, which included a release window for 2024.</p>



<p>The new game, based on the popular A Quiet Place horror film series, will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>The trailer features first-person exploration gameplay, ending with a jump scare. It also states that the footage was captured in-engine.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91zi75E_SA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer description says that “the road ahead is paved with sound decisions.” This play on words could simply refer to survival mechanics, or possibly that player decisions can impact the story. </p>



<p>Developer Stormind Games, mentioned at the beginning of the trailer, did work on the choice-driven adventure Batora: Lost Haven.</p>



<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead also has an <a href="https://aquietplace.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> with further details. It confirms players will “strive for silence when hiding from, and sneaking by, horrific creatures who hunt using only sound.”</p>



<p>It also reveals that this will be a new story set in the universe established by A Quiet Place, rather than a direct adaptation. The plot will center on “a young survivor trying to navigate the new, eerily tranquil, post-apocalyptic landscape.”</p>



<p>It may also have open world elements, since players can “discover your own path through the world by observing your environment and leveraging the tools in your surroundings.”</p>

                <p>So far, 2024 has been a brutal year for the video game industry, and it's not showing any signs of letting up. Now, Galvanic Games, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizard-with-a-gun-launches-a-day-early-to-avoid-clash-with-diablo-4s-steam-debut/1100-6518427/" data-ref-id="1100-6518427">Wizard with a Gun</a>, is the latest studio to shut down.</p><p>Galvanic Games founder and president Patrick Morgan shared the news on social media. And he noted that despite the fact that Wizard with a Gun was well-received, the game's sales weren't high enough to save the studio.</p><p>"It is with a heavy heart that I announce the closure of Galvanic Games," wrote Morgan. "Despite the promising start of Wizard with a Gun, sales are not strong enough to sustain our studio. The last year has been particularly tough for games. While we had numerous encouraging conversations at DICE and GDC, the process of signing new projects, in a good year, takes longer than the runway we had left."</p><p>Morgan also included a link back to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207451502972477440/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio's LinkedIn page</a>, in order to help some of his now former employees find work elsewhere in the gaming industry. But with so many people across the industry already looking for work in the wake of multiple closures, many of those ex-employees are now facing an uncertain future.</p><p>This year has already seen the closures of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-partnered-studio-from-ex-cod-devs-has-closed/1100-6521774/" data-ref-id="1100-6521774">Deviation Games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/firewall-ultra-developer-closes-down-after-eight-years-due-to-lack-of-vr-support/1100-6520087/" data-ref-id="1100-6520087">First Contact Entertainment</a>, Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Games</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-cause-developer-closing-two-studios-including-one-thats-only-been-open-since-october/1100-6523899/" data-ref-id="1100-6523899">Avalanche Studio Group</a>'s New York and Montreal studios. That's not even including the large number of layoffs that have hit everyone from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parent-company-to-cancel-games-and-lay-off-5-of-staff/1100-6522706/" data-ref-id="1100-6522706">Take-Two</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">Sony and EA</a>--and the year is not even halfway over yet. </p>

                <p>Ten years ago this month, the retro side-scrolling action game Shovel Knight made its debut. To celebrate the anniversary, Yacht Club Games live-streamed an event that featured two big announcements. The first was a new definitive version of the game, Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX. And the second piece of news was confirmation that a Shovel Knight sequel is also in development.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbpEXPSvFtc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cbpEXPSvFtc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Shovel of Hope DX is coming to Steam, and it features a number of enhancements that weren't present in the original Shovel Knight. To start, gamers can choose between 20 playable characters, from Shovel Knight and Shield Knight to their adversary, the Enchantress. Those aren't simply cosmetic changes, as each character has their own abilities and play styles. The game is also adding a rewind function, as well as 300 cheats that can be applied for a unique gameplay experience.</p><p>Additionally, Shovel of Hope DX will include Challenge Stages, Custom Knight, and the Battle Ghost Arena, as well full Stereoscopic 3D. Online and local multiplayer options are also supported.</p><p>As for the sequel, Sean Velasco, a designer for Yacht Club Games, said that it will feature "groundbreaking innovative gameplay mechanics," before adding that it will bring Shovel Knight "into an entirely new dimension of gaming." Velasco also hinted that clues have been left in previous Yacht Club Games titles that will shed some light on the Shovel Knight sequel.</p><p>Neither the Shovel Knight sequel nor Shovel of Hope DX have release dates yet. However, Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX can be added to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2661310/Shovel_Knight_Shovel_of_Hope_DX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">your wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>Back in 2021, Saber Interactive announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-quiet-place-is-becoming-a-single-player-story-driven-horror-adventure-game/1100-6497384/" data-ref-id="1100-6497384">making a video game based on the film series A Quiet Place</a>, and now the game has been officially unveiled. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a new atmospheric horror game from Stormind Games and Saber, and it's set for release in 2024.</p><p>The eerie announcement trailer shows that the game follows the formula of the film series, which is that players must remain quiet to prevent the aliens from detecting them. The Road Ahead is set for release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Road Ahead doesn't re-tell the story of A Quiet Place or A Quiet Place 2 (or the upcoming prequel Day One) but instead tells an original story inspired by the movie series. Players take on the role of a young survivor attempting to make their way through a very scary post-apocalyptic world.</p><p>Stormind Games previously made Batora: Lost Haven and the Remothered series. Back in the 2021 announcement, Saber said it was partnering with the developers iLLOGIKA and EP1T0ME on a game based on A Quiet Place. So it's not immediately clear if this is that game or something else.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320010-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4320010" data-ratio="0.55685618729097" data-width="1196" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320010-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4320010"></a><figcaption>A scene from The Road Ahead</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320010-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.04am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320013-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.10am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320014-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.16am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320015-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.25am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320016-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.31am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4320013,1300-4320014,1300-4320015,1300-4320016" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4320013-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.10am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4320014-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.16am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4320015-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.25am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4320016-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.31am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320013-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.10am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320014-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.16am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320015-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.25am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320016-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.31am.png"></figure><p>As for the film series, the prequel, Day One, releases in theaters later this month.

<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">At this point in time, <em>Destiny 2</em> has absolutely no shortage of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-raids-in-release-order-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raids</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-dungeons-in-release-order-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons</a> to choose from, with more being added to the mix on a seasonal basis. It’s easy to forget, then, that there’s a <em>third</em> important category of challenging content in this game, too: Exotic missions.</p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Note that I’m not referring to Exotic <em>quests</em> here: we’ve got too many of those to keep track of in the first place. No, our topic for the day is specifically Exotic <em>missions</em>. The type of stuff that was praised even during <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s many lulls in content and popularity; those missions that, once upon a time, weren’t even <em>announced</em> in the first place.</p> <p data-characters="150" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">So, from those legends onward, here’s the full and comprehensive list of <em>all</em> of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Exotic missions in the order of their release!</p>
 <h2 id="h-all-destiny-2-exotic-missions-in-the-order-of-release" data-injectable="false">All Destiny 2 Exotic missions in the order of release</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-1-the-whisper-july-2018-original-april-2024-reprised" data-injectable="false">#1: The Whisper – July 2018 (Original) / April 2024 (Reprised)</h3> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">The ultimate blueprint that all the other Exotic missions are compared with, The Whisper came about mostly as a surprise in the early years of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s lifecycle. Basically, it all began with a mysterious anomaly appearing on the now-sunset Io, and what came about as a result was a remarkably creepy and parkour-heavy adventure. Its reward? A Taken combination of the Black Spindle and the Black Hammer sniper rifles from the first <em>Destiny</em>. Good times!</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-2-zero-hour-march-2019-original-may-2024-reprised" data-injectable="false">#2: Zero Hour – March 2019 (Original) / May 2024 (Reprised)</h3> <p data-characters="556" data-current-count="856" data-injectable="true">Zero Hour was the second standalone Exotic mission released for <em>Destiny 2</em>, and it leaned even more heavily into its maze-like structure than the Whisper, which made it a fair bit more challenging on your first try. It, too, was a time-limited ordeal you see. Zero Hour was (and still is) quite special due to its setting – the Tower itself – its penchant to keep players coming back for more – the unique cosmetic rewards – and the coveted Outbreak Perfected. Oh, and TR3VR, too, the loveable bot. You’ll meet <em>him</em> soon enough.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-3-the-other-side-june-2019" data-injectable="false">#3: The Other Side – June 2019</h3> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">While The Other Side wasn’t quite as iconic as The Whisper and Zero Hour, few things ever were in the context of <em>Destiny</em>. It’s a solid mission, regardless: under the tutelage of the now-deceased Emperor Calus, Guardians dive headfirst into the Ascendant Plane to extract none other than the Bad Juju pulse rifle. Cool! What’s not so cool is that The Other Side is no longer playable, as of <em>Beyond Light</em>‘s sunsetting spree.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-4-harbinger-november-2020" data-injectable="false">#4: Harbinger – November 2020</h3> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">The Harbinger was initially supposed to be a <em>secret</em> Exotic mission tucked away in one of the most often overlooked places in the European Dead Zone region, though it didn’t take long for players to suss it out. Its reward? The fabled Hawkmoon handcannon, courtesy of the Crow’s slow climb upwards following his <em>Forsaken</em>-era misadventures. The Harbinger is currently sadly unavailable.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-5-presage-february-2021" data-injectable="false">#5: Presage – February 2021</h3> <p data-characters="526" data-current-count="826" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny</em> doesn’t often foray into full-fledged horror territory, but when it does, you know it’s the real deal. Presage came about as a celebration of this niche, pitting players against one of the first in-game realizations of Darkness proper. The result is an impeccably grim atmosphere with appropriately disturbing lore, and the delightfully chunky Dead Man’s Tale lever-action scout rifle. Just a joy to play all around, though the lack of unique enemy encounters does diminish the experience a tiny bit.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-6-a-hollow-coronation-august-2021" data-injectable="false">#6: A Hollow Coronation – August 2021</h3> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="742" data-injectable="true">Released as part of the Season of the Lost, A Hollow Coronation was a deep dive into the lore of Queen Mara, Uldren Sov, and his Light-infused alter ego, the Crow. This was a solid enough showing, though the mission itself couldn’t really hold a candle to the true greats of this category, such as The Whisper and Zero Hour. Still, it’s a bit of a shame that the Hollow Coronation is no longer playable, as of the <em>Witch Queen</em> DLC.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-7-parasitic-pilgrimage-february-2022" data-injectable="false">#7: Parasitic Pilgrimage – February 2022</h3> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="true">The Parasitic Pilgrimage mission is no secret, unlike some other Exotic missions on this list, but it sure is a must-play for anyone unfamiliar with the depths of Hive lore. Parasitic Pilgrimage is all about shoving Savathûn’s Worm into the deviously powerful Parasite grenade launcher. Along the way, you get to learn some tidbits about the sorry creature, its history, and the history of the Queen of Lies itself. Good fun, overall.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-8-vox-obscura-february-2022" data-injectable="false">#8: Vox Obscura – February 2022</h3> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">While many seasonal Exotic missions did get seemingly permanently taken out of the equation as years went by, some of the notable highlights – like the Vox Obscura mission – have been shoved back into the game via the Exotic mission rotator. Good thing, too, because Vox Obscura is a high-octane romp directly through the Emperor Calus’ loyalist Cabal to take down a dangerous Psion commander smack-dab in the middle of a heavily protected operating base. Tank combat on the face of Mars? Yes, please.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-9-operation-seraph-s-shield-december-2022" data-injectable="false">#9: Operation: Seraph’s Shield – December 2022</h3> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="true">Operation: Seraph’s Shield is one of the few previously-sunset Exotic missions that have been re-released in an updated format. Is it a party trick? The unique Revision Zero Exotic pulse rifle has several different upgrades you need to work through by playing Seraph’s Shield. The mission is, therefore, uniquely suited to repeat playthroughs, taking players through almost half a dozen unique combat encounters and puzzle rooms in one go. Solid stuff, albeit hardly revolutionary.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-10-what-remains-february-2023" data-injectable="false">#10: What Remains – February 2023</h3> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">A <em>Lightfall</em> Exotic quest, What Remains is a visually striking mission that takes players on a mad dash through the Black Garden itself. Though it’s not mechanically challenging in the same way that secret Exotic missions were, What Remains is absolutely beautiful and memorable throughout, being one of the relatively few highlights to have come out of the <em>Lightfall</em> DLC proper. Your reward for its completion? The hard-hitting Deterministic Chaos machine gun and oodles of Vex/Black Garden lore. Who could complain?</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-11-the-variable-avalon-february-2023" data-injectable="false">#11: The Variable (Avalon) – February 2023</h3> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true">The Variable is, arguably, one of the hardest Exotic missions we’ve seen yet, featuring the Vex Network and the appropriately voxelated Vexcalibur glaive as its reward. Neon-laden and about as punishing as it gets in the Master version, The Variable pulls no punches in any category, with challenging parkour sections and an extremely aggressive version of Brakion waiting for you at the very end. Great fun on your first go, though you may be hard-pressed to go back for more when all is said and done.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dorje Bellbrook</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-12-starcrossed-november-2023" data-injectable="false">#12: Starcrossed – November 2023</h3> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="801" data-injectable="true">The second Exotic mission set in the Black Garden, Starcrossed plays host to the admittedly middling Wish-Keeper Exotic bow. This mission is a part of the ongoing Exotic mission rotator that’s available in <em>Destiny 2</em> since Season 22, but its reliance on long-range combat and punishing encounters means most players aren’t itching at the bits to replay it. It’s a solid offering, to be sure, but even I have to admit it doesn’t come even close to the heights of, say, Zero Hour.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-13-wild-card-june-2024" data-injectable="false">#13: Wild Card – June 2024</h3> <p data-characters="597" data-current-count="897" data-injectable="true">One of the newest and most narrative-heavy Exotic missions to date, Wild Card takes you on a delightful little side-adventure during the bigger <em>Final Shape</em> story. During it, you’ll set up camp with the Crow and Cayde-6, dwell a bit on what this entire schtick means, and do some skeet shooting. The mission is unlike any other in <em>Destiny 2</em> due to its several time-skips, where the overworld changes and delivers new encounters during each of these intermissions even though you’re, technically, just playing this one mission in one go. Your reward? The awesome Still Hunt sniper rifle.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-14-dual-destiny-june-2024" data-injectable="false">#14: Dual Destiny – June 2024</h3> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="875" data-injectable="true">Yet <em>another</em> unique Exotic mission released as part of <em>The Final Shape</em>, Dual Destiny is a secret side-activity that’s purpose-built specifically for <em>two</em> players, which is quite uncommon in <em>Destiny 2</em>. Consider it a mini-raid, really, as it requires some very good communication and coordination to get through all the puzzles. Not everyone’s been a fan of Dual Destiny’s precedent-breaking approach to the battle-tested Exotic mission formula, but it’s good fun regardless, and the reward – the Exotic Class Item – is well worth the trouble!</p>

			<p>The Chinese Room are probably best known for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/09/20/dear-esther-landmark-edition-retells-the-birth-of-a-genre/">Dear Esther</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/12/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review/">Everybody’s Gone To The Rapture</a>, a pair of games where you gently wander through the countryside and gradually uncover a deep mystery as you go. Still Wakes the Deep is the polar opposite of that game, a tense, cramped horror title that will have you on the edge of your seat.</p>
<p><iframe title="STILL WAKES THE DEEP | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmLNTFofED8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s December 1975 and the decorations are up on the Beira D, an oil rig off the coast of Scotland. Our character, Cameron “Caz” McLeary, is not in a festive mood, though. Before he arrived on the rig something happened back on the mainland and it has now caught up with him, the police are here and he is about to be fired. As if Caz’s day couldn’t get any worse, a huge explosion then rips through the oil rig as some mysterious monster is released by the drilling.</p>


<p>The story feels like a mashup of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Rising">Deep Rising</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/26/dead-space-remake-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc/">Dead Space</a> and a prime time ITV drama – the last point mainly because all the cast are from northern England or Scotland, which makes the game seem genuinely authentic to the setting and time period. The flashbacks to a story on the mainland which really could have been lifted from a TV show. It also helps that the characters talk like real people and that means a lot of cussing, there’s more C-bombs ten minutes of Still Wakes the Deep than in the whole of Bulletstorm.</p>


<p>The game is totally linear, guiding you from one location to another as the story plays out and rather surprisingly there’s a touch of Uncharted in the mix as you clamber around the wrecked rig, albeit in first person. Caz has to hang from the ceiling, slide through tight gaps and make leaps of faith, many of which require a quick presses of a secondary button to stop him from falling to his death. There are a few puzzles alongside, but these a really simple and I think this actually adds to the game – having a “search and collect four gubbins in different areas to fix a whatsit” type of quest would have really broken the tension, while the simple solutions here mean you can keep on moving along with the story.</p>
<p>While some crew have survived the event, there are other things on board with a number of stealth sections where you must avoid some of the best designed monsters since Dead Space. They are truly nasty, eldritch horror creatures that bring forth screams from the depths of hell as they try and find where you are hiding. You can’t hide forever, though, and other parts of the game have you being chased by creatures and racing along obstacle laden paths, or swimming through flooded corridors desperately searching for pockets of air.</p>

<p>It is never boring, but it does feel like things have been padded out to reach a 6-7 hour playtime. I’ve never been on an exploding oil rig and I am sure the many tasks you have to perform to stop it from sinking are accurate, but after four hours of clambering around and turning on pumps and winches, it does start to remind you are playing a video game and break the otherwise superb atmosphere.</p>
<p>To say the game looks good would be a understatement. Built in Unreal Engine 5, Still Wakes the Deep is almost photorealistic at times and has some simply fantastic lighting. The sound design is also excellent with thumps and bangs raising the tension, while the monsters are deliciously wet and squelchy and talk directly to you while they are hunting – they are not afraid of good cuss word either.</p>
<p>While Still Wakes the Deep is much more than a ‘walking simulator’, this is very much story with a game built around it. The graphics and sound generate an amazing atmosphere drenched in tension and while all the cast put in superb performances, Alan Newman as Caz should be picking up all the awards. The script really does feel like it has been pulled from a high quality drama and doesn’t feel like a video game at all. It’s the small things, like when a character is shouting instructions at Caz from a distance and asks him to make some signal, any sort of signal, to show he understands, Caz flips him the bird. It’s exactly what I would have expected his character to do.</p>

<p>So much work has gone in to the game to create the tense atmosphere it’s a shame there are two glaring issues which really drag you back to reality. The first is loading sections – moving between interior and exterior has the screen fading to black and a very short break while the game loads which is just long enough to break the atmosphere. The second is running, as Caz will briefly flail his arms in front of the screen like he is voguing at high speed before settling down to pump his arms in a weird jog. It just looks a bit silly and completely at odds with the gruff oil rig worker character.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Treat Still Wakes the Deep like a Netflix mini series and you will have a whale of a time. Its excellent script, acting, and atmosphere make it just as good to passively watch as to actively play, so grab your partner, turn off the lights and binge it over a few evenings. 	</p></div>

<p>Per EA's 2024 <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/f0be0a59-dd50-4247-b36e-0513336b6c1f.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement</a>, Wilson's total earnings for the fiscal year come to $25.64 million, which is spread across salary, stock awards, and "non-equity incentive plan compensation".</p>
<p>Collectively, EA's NEOs raked in $60.06 million for the fiscal year, with EA entertainment and technology head Laura Miele bringing in $12.1 million as the company's second-highest NEO earner.</p>

Back in February, the studio announced it would let go <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">around 5% of its workforce</a>, which means hundreds of staffers found themselves out of a job earlier this year.</p>
<p>Among those layoffs were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-developer-respawn-hit-by-layoffs-among-cuts-at-electronic-arts">several employees</a> at&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>developer Respawn, and a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS in development at the studio was also canceled.</p>
<p>When combined with EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-announces-strong-financial-results-as-ea-sports-fc-and-madden-revenue">assessment in January</a> that its financial performance for the third quarter of the fiscal year was "strong", awarding this much money to executives while also letting hundreds of employees go is not a great look, to say the least.</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, the Proxy Statement praises Wilson for a year of "record high talent retention" and "strong talent attraction". Somehow, I think the hundreds of employees let go this year would probably beg to differ.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-star-wars-jedi-survivor-2024.jpg?itok=ZUzFgbMd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-star-wars-jedi-survivor-2024.jpg?itok=6Wqe2Fgn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA's 2024 fiscal year also included hits like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The layoffs at EA came during a particularly difficult year for the gaming industry, which also saw a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">number</a> of other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs">studios</a>, both <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-layoffs-targets-20-of-workforce-resulting-in-1100-jobs-lost">big</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs">small</a>, either <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition">closing</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">downsizing</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the total number of layoffs in 2024 has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">already surpassed that of 2023</a>, however, that wave is showing no signs of slowing down, and it's likely that more big studios like EA will be letting employees go before the year is through.</p>
<p>Of course, this is the same company that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-layoffs-share-buyback">recently announced a new share buyback scheme</a> to cheer up its shareholders, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised at the exorbitant incomes of its C-suite. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Publisher Saber Interactive has today given us a look at the upcoming release, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. 
</p>
<p>
This narrative-driven horror game is inspired by the film series, which includes two John Krasinski-directed releases as well as an upcoming prequel spin-off. </p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-is-a-new-single-player-story-driven-horror-game-based-on-the-film">first announced to be in the pipeline back in 2021</a>, however at this time all we had was a logo and the promise of an original story and gameplay that "captures the compelling suspense, emotion and drama for which the series is famous".</p>

<p>
Saber says the upcoming game, which is being developed by Stormind Games, is designed for fans of the films and horror. "Experience the journey of a young woman struggling to endure not only the nightmarish creatures of the apocalypse, but also the anguish of interpersonal family conflicts and her own inner fears," reads the official blurb. 
</p>
<p>
"With nothing more than your wits and the simple tools you can scavenge, you'll have to overcome the many treacherous challenges and obstacles that lay ahead, all while trying to survive an ever-present threat of the unknown enemies."
</p>
<p>
You can see how it looks in the trailer below:

<p>
As you would expect given its inspiration, silence will play a key part in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. Saber warns that even a single noise can be all it takes to give away your position. So, to put it <em>Bluntly</em>, tread cautiously.
</p>
<p>
On its release later this year (exact date TBC), A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be available across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Those interested can add it to their wishlists now. 
</p>
<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is one of several projects still in the works from Saber after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-confirms-a-number-of-titles-still-in-development-following-todays-embracer-sale">publisher was sold by Embracer earlier this year</a>. Other upcoming releases include Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-park-survival-will-revisit-locations-from-1993-film-but-also-introduce-new-ones">Jurassic Park: Survival</a>.

					<p>A key ingredient to a successful horror story is a good setting and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, which takes place on a massive deep sea oil rig off the coast of Scotland, has a pretty killer one. The game also has a critically acclaimed, if somewhat divisive, creative team behind it in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Chinese Room</a>, the British developer behind past indie hits such as Dear Esther and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.</p>
<p>In other words, Still Wakes the Deep would seem to have quite a bit going for it at first glance. So, does the game successfully tap into its unique setting? Or does it come up dry when it comes to terror?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFstillwakesthedeep3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Set in 1975, Still Wakes the Deep places the player in the boots and slicker of Caz McLeary, a rough-and-tumble Scot who’s shipped off to the isolated North Sea oil rig Beira D after getting into a wee bit of trouble on the mainland. In fact, he seems to have gotten into <em>more</em> trouble and is about to be fired when the rig strikes… something… mysterious at the bottom of the ocean. The exact nature of what besets the rig is never really explained, but suffice to say, it’s soon overgrown with fleshy mind-altering growths, and the crew begins to transform into Lovecraftian tentacled monstrosities straight out of John Carpenter’s The Thing. Caz must find a way to escape the rapidly deteriorating rig while thoughts of the wife and children he left behind frequently intrude on these thoughts.</p>
<p>Given some of the past games The Chinese Room and director Dan Pinchbeck have worked on, you may be expecting Still Wakes the Deep to offer up a deep level of characterization, interesting twists, and/or narrative tricks, but it… never really does. For the most part, this is a straightforward, point-to-point, event-driven story. Go activate the lifeboats! Oh, they’re damaged? Go find the chopper! Oh, it crashed? Go fix the generators… and so on and so forth. Caz has a somewhat sketchy past, but it isn’t really particularly unique or surprising. The game occasionally offers a brief flashback to his life before coming to the rig and I kept expecting them to reveal something more juicy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFstillwakesthedeep4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, the oil rig setting remains interesting, and all the characters mercilessly ragging on each other in their oatmeal-thick Scottish accents is fun (I think this game may set the record for most uses of the c-word). And yeah, without giving anything away, the game’s final moments will likely tug at your heartstrings, particularly if you’re a dad. That said, overall, I’ll admit I was expecting a bit more from Still Wake the Deep’s narrative.</p>
<p>Still Wake the Deep’s story not being particularly memorable would be a big issue if it were like some of The Chinese Room’s past games, as the studio has, fairly or not, become somewhat synonymous with the “walking simulator” genre. Games like Dear Esther were pretty much <em>all about</em> exploration and story, but that isn’t really the case with The Chinese Room’s latest.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFstillwakesthedeep5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Still Wakes the Deep is more about the moment-to-moment action, and while you’ll be doing more than just walking, things are still relatively simple mechanically as you won’t be wielding any weapons, tools, or inventory items. The game takes place entirely in first person, with Caz running and jumping around the rig to get where he’s going and escape pursuers. The right shoulder button is used to grip onto things (ladders, ledges, etc.), and occasionally, you’ll need to quickly press the left trigger to regain your grip on something. Various levers, valves, and other devices can be interacted with via a combination of button presses and directional inputs. Simple stealth sections ask you to get by tentacled beasties by crouching and sneaking and tossing loose items as distractions. Occasionally, you’ll have to put out a fire with a nearby extinguisher, and later in the game, a fair amount of swimming is foisted on you.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFstillwakesthedeep7-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And that’s really it in terms of gameplay. First-person platforming is never going to be <em>ideal</em>, but, for the most part, the game’s controls feel good enough. The stealth mechanics are very limited, but so are the enemies you face – simply scoot from one bit of cover to the next when they’re not looking and you’ll be fine. Unfortunately, things do fall apart a bit when it comes to the underwater swimming sections, which can be disorienting and a bit frustrating.</p>
<p>While Still Wakes the Deep takes place on a large oil rig, don’t expect any sort of Metroidvania-style level design here. The game confines you to a very linear path, with boxes, rubble, fires, and an endless succession of locked doors keeping you from straying. And really, there’s no need to explore anyway, as the game doesn’t have any ammo, healing items, collectibles, or even much in the way of journals or other bits of supplementary info to find.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFstillwakesthedeep6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Finding your route forward can be occasionally frustrating, but usually not, as the game’s devs <em>very</em> clearly signpost where you’re supposed to go. I usually find the debate about “yellow paint” a bit overblown – I think it’s a perfectly legitimate mechanic used sparingly, but Still Wakes the Deep <em>doesn’t</em> use it sparingly. Sometimes, the game almost feels like a parody, a worst-case scenario for people who complain about yellow paint online. I think the makers of Still Wakes the Deep may realize they’ve gone a bit overboard because PR made sure to tell me there will be an update that adds the option to remove much of the yellow paint. That might reduce the razzing this game will get online, but I’m not sure how playable it will be without it. The fact is, this game was clearly designed around the yellow paint, so simply letting people turn it off might not actually improve the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFstillwakesthedeep8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The overuse of yellow aside, this is a solid, but not remarkable-looking, game. There are some visually striking moments when things really go to hell late in the game, but for the most part, this looks like a pretty standard last-gen game despite being built on Unreal Engine 5. Speaking of UE5, the performance issues common to many games built on the engine are also present here. The game’s Fidelity mode feels unplayably sluggish (and I’m usually not a stickler about 30fps gaming) and while Performance mode feels better, it has its share of hiccups.</p>
<p>Despite my complaints in the previous paragraphs, there’s no denying Still Wakes the Deep delivers a good amount of excitement, whether you’re clinging to the underside of the rig in the midst of a raging storm or dashing through ruined corridors with a tentacled beastie on your tail. That said, the extreme linearity of the game ultimately gives the proceedings a straightforward rollercoaster-like feel. Without any player choice or strategy in the mix, there just isn’t all that much tension. And hey, once you’ve seen one writhing mass of flesh and tentacles, you’ve kinda seen them all.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Still Wakes the Deep PS5 4K Gameplay - Performance Mode" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LU5KUmuqrvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like a rollercoaster, this particular ride is also over rather quickly. I rolled credits in around 4 to 5 hours and there isn’t much built-in incentive to play through again, making Still Wakes the Deep’s $35 asking price a bit hard to swallow. While some may be willing to ship off again just to re-experience the ride, I have a feeling most will opt to remain on dry land.</p>
<p><em>This review was based on a PS5 copy of Still Wakes the Deep provided by publisher Secret Mode. </em></p>

					
					

<p>While Still Wakes the Deep offers up its fair share of thrills, railroad-style level design, a short runtime, and a surprisingly superficial story result in an experience that may entertain in the moment, but will likely be forgotten rather quickly. Still Wakes the Deep may well float your boat at a discount, but there are better, scarier fish in the sea.</p>

<p>It is presently unclear whether there's a direct relation between this game and the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-game-in-development-at-illogika-due-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> A Quiet Place horror adventure game in development at ILLOGIKA. The most likely scenario is that Saber Interactive switched development to Stormind Games.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24178745/house-dragon-season-2-premiere-review-episode-1</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/house-of-the-dragon-leaves-no-room-for-theories-%E2%80%94-they%E2%80%99re-all-doomed.903201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24178745/house-dragon-season-2-premiere-review-episode-1<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YKXfUB">The season 2 premiere of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> does viewers a kindness. Instead of following up on nearly every thread from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419108/house-dragon-aemond-lucerys-vhagar-battle">season 1 finale</a>, “A Son for a Son” mainly concerns itself with one: the shocking death of young Lucerys and his dragon Arrax at the hands of his <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419041/house-dragon-aemond-targaryen-death-dragon-sapphire-eye-villain-meaning">uncle Aemond</a>. Perhaps it’s strange to call this grim opening “kind,” but in doing this the show is able to lead with feelings, not lore or politicking, although there’s plenty of that, too. Mostly, it’s a story about everyone realizing they started a war, and kind of regretting it. </p>
<p id="ciYgmh">This is in spite of <em>Dragon</em>’s opening moments on the Wall, hundreds of miles away from King’s Landing, where the bulk of the episode takes place. In this first scene, Jacaerys “Jace” Velaryon (Harry Collett) meets with Cregan Stark (Tom Taylor) to see what men of the Night’s Watch will join his mother Rhaenyra’s cause in the coming civil war. Cregan acquiesces, but not before musing a bit about the Wall and its purpose. The Night’s Watch in this show is not a dead-end job, as it is in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, but a noble calling, and its members remember what the Wall is for, at least symbolically: keeping Death itself at bay, with a line that even dragons fear to cross. </p>
<p id="w341LW">With this callback, <em>House of the Dragon</em> reminds viewers of its mission, and how it differs from <em>Game of Thrones</em>:<em> </em>This is not a show about existential threats. This is a more contained story, about the small and often petty grievances, misunderstandings, and ambitions of a small group of people painfully aware of history’s weight, or desperate to slip its bonds. </p>

<p id="2955cT">To that end, “A Son for a Son” is about the many players in King’s Landing and beyond feebly fretting over how to avert open war, or fiending for it. Young Aegon, the new king, wants to be a kind and magnanimous ruler, but is checked by his Hand, Otto Hightower, who reminds him that his every word sets a precedent. His brother Aemond knows that no amount of goodwill the young king is able to curry will dissuade those who back Rhaenyra’s claim to the throne, and craves action. Rhaenyra herself has withdrawn in grief, seeking the remains of her son and his dragon, while those in her circle — like her husband/uncle, Daemon — impatiently prowl in their chambers, eager to assert the justness of their cause to the denizens of the realm. </p>
<p id="XkE36y">But scale is not the only way <em>House of the Dragon</em> differentiates itself from its predecessor. What makes it such a fascinating spinoff series is its source material, and how its showrunners have chosen to adapt it. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23057740/read-fire-blood-house-of-the-dragon"><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> is not a novel</a>; it’s an in-universe historical account, complete with differing perspectives on pivotal events. Showrunner Ryan Condal and <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s writing staff have decided to leverage this aspect of Martin’s work as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review">a source of dramatic irony</a>. As <em>Game of Thrones</em> and A Song of Ice and Fire used sheer distance and time separating characters to engineer tragic arcs, <em>House of the Dragon</em> finds moments of imprecision or chaos to lean on character flaws and introduce uncertainty. Do two characters <em>actually</em> understand one another? Why would they? Why wouldn’t they? </p>

<p id="h7NhKP"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23942690">The final act of “A Son for a Son” hinges</a> on such a moment of uncertainty, as Daemon (Matt Smith), unwilling to let Lucerys’ death go unanswered, hires a ratcatcher to assassinate Aemond in his bed. But he is careless, arrogant, simply interested in a blood debt being paid, and his brief instructions reflect that. Someone else dies as a result, and the course of history shifts again. </p>
<p id="78bm0h">It’s all so human, so <em>trivial</em>, the lapses in judgment or thoughtless acts that turn the gears of power and sweep up countless lives in their wake. <em>House of the Dragon</em> feels built to ruminate on these moments, to leave the viewer bitterly wondering how simply things could have gone another way, if not a better one. <em>Game of Thrones</em>, in its adaptation of an unfinished work and grander storytelling priorities, rarely felt this top-to-bottom reminiscent of Greek tragedy. But in <em>House of the Dragon</em>, fate itself lurks in the halls of King’s Landing. The Iron Throne will rust. People will make terrible choices that will tear through the lives of innocent people. But we will also see, with terrible clarity, the very moments those people nearly chose differently. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/alone-in-the-dark-2024-developer-pieces-interactive-shut-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The <a href="https://www.piecesinteractive.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> for developer Pieces Interactive reveals that Alone in the Dark 2024 reimagining was their “last release,” confirming the studio will shut down.</p>



<p>The site also posted an image citing the studio’s years of activity lasting from 2007 to 2024. This included the message “thanks for playing with us.”</p>



<p>However, the page does not give an official statement regarding the shutdown itself. Instead, it mentions its long history of clients, titles, and the Embracer Group acquisition.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Besides Alone in the Dark, fans will recognize Pieces Interactive for their work on the Titan Quest and Magicka series.</p>



<p>The studio’s take on Alone in the Dark launched in March 2024 to solid reviews. It started with Mostly Positive on Steam, and still has a user score of 7.5 on Metacritic.</p>



<p>However, just one month ago, Embracer Group said that Pieces Interactive’s Alone in the Dark title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-says-alone-in-the-dark-failed-to-meet-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to meet expectations</a>, which may have contributed to getting shut down. </p>



<p>In an earnings report, Embracer stated the game had a “mixed reception from critics and ultimately performed below management expectations.”</p>



<p>Embracer Group also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alone-in-the-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-lays-off-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off employees</a> at Pieces Interactive in April 2024. This occurred around the same time that Embracer split into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three different companies</a>. </p>



<p>Embracer did not give an immediate statement after laying off staff at Pieces Interactive in April, nor about the developer getting shut down this month.</p>

                <p>With a well-received TV adaptation leading to a resurgence in popularity for Fallout video games, 2024 has been a pretty good year so far for Bethesda. Now that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fallout-season-2-release-date-trailers-news/2900-5269/" data-ref-id="2900-5269">second season of Fallout has been greenlit</a>, the expectation for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> is higher than ever, but Bethesda's Todd Howard says that there are no plans to rush out a new mainline Fallout game just yet. Thanks to the ongoing popularity of Fallout 76--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-skyline-valley-expansion-has-arrived-check-out-the-patch-notes/1100-6524268/" data-ref-id="1100-6524268">new DLC for the game has launched</a>--the company plans to bring the franchise back in a more meaningful way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2ew8LQFGNWU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"For other Fallout games in the future, you know obviously I can't talk about those right now but I would say sort of rushing through them or we need to get stuff out that is different than the work we're doing in 76, you know we don't feel like we need to rush any of that you know right now," Howard said in an interview with MrMattyPlays. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling. [I] totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game. Look, those things take time. I don't think it's bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we're doing in a franchise, whether it's Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p>It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fallout-games-are-being-planned-todd-howard-says/1100-6523813/" data-ref-id="1100-6523813">new Fallout games are being planned</a>, but in a previous interview, Howard said that these will take a "good five-ish years" to still be made. Another fascinating tidbit from the interview was that Bethesda has no plans currently to bring the modernized versions of Fallout 1 and 2 to console, and looking to the stars, the company is planning to release annual expansions for Starfield that will answer some of the game's biggest mysteries.</p><p>"We want to, more or less. How long that continues? Hopefully for a very long time, but that's what we're planning for," Howard explained. "The one after this, there will be another one. and I don't know that our goal is to answer every question we sort of look at it and say 'Hey what's what's a good angle,' what do we want to add to the game as far as an experience or a tone, or those kinds of things, if that makes sense."</p><p>Starfield's first big expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-gets-a-trippy-trailer-new-content-launching-today/1100-6524080/" data-ref-id="1100-6524080">Shattered Space</a>, launches later this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-june-update-adds-new-missions-bounty-scanning-and-creation-kit-but-no-vehicles/1100-6524109/" data-ref-id="1100-6524109">The game's big June update</a> added new missions, a new bounty-scanning mechanic, and opened up the Starfield Creation Kit to all modders, although some players are upset that the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-is-charging-7-for-a-new-starfield-mission-and-players-are-upset/1100-6524221/" data-ref-id="1100-6524221">Track Alliance missions cost $7 to access</a>.</p>

        <p>The reimagining of the 1992 survival horror title released just last March and didn't meet sales expectations</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Embracer has reportedly shut down Pieces Interactive, the studio behind the recently released Alone in the Dark.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-shuts-down-alone-in-the-dark-developer-pieces-interactive">IGN</a>, the <a href="https://www.piecesinteractive.se/">studio's website</a> now shows an image of its logo and the text: "2007 - 2024, Thanks for playing with us."</p>
<p>A couple of paragraphs also go through the studio's history, saying: "Pieces Interactive released over ten titles on PC, console and mobile since 2007," and finishing on: "Our last release was the reimagining of Alone in the Dark."</p>
<p>Pieces Interactive was acquired by Embracer in 2017, and reports of layoffs at the <a href="https://x.com/HelenaEHHansen/status/1782781965885722950">company emerged on social media mid-April</a>.</p>
<p>Its version of 1992 survival horror classic Alone in the Dark released last March and didn't reach Embracer's sales expectations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracers-lars-wingefors-on-the-brutal-truth-of-the-aaa-market#:~:text=%22Whatever%20you%20produce,get%20those%20right.%22">Talking to us last month, CEO Lars Wingefors said</a>: "I believe Alone in the Dark was a quality product, and [the developers] went all in to deliver on that. It's very unfortunate to see that it didn't catch enough consumers out there willing to engage again in that IP and product. It's just a brutal truth. It was a big investment and, ultimately, we need to get those right."</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> reached out to Embracer for more information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-is-a-narrative-driven-first-person-survival-horror-title-launching-later-this-year/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-is-a-narrative-driven-first-person-survival-horror-title-launching-later-this-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="328" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Publisher Saber Interactive has announced that <em>A Quiet Place: The Road</em> <em>Ahead</em> will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year. The game takes the cinematic universe from the films you know and love and crafts a narrative-driven adventure you’ll need to play through from an intense first-person perspective. </p> <p data-characters="523" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Developed by Stormind Games, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead takes what makes the franchise so fascinating and terrifying and brings it to PC and consoles where it can achieve the same levels of thrill and horror. It’s a first-person game driven by an intense story that sees a young woman faced with the reality that she’s going to have to venture forth into the world from her place of safety and somehow avoid the fast-paced monsters that have all but wiped out humanity and react to even the slightest sound. </p>
 <h2 id="h-embrace-silence-in-a-brand-new-a-quiet-place-story-in-a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead" data-injectable="false">Embrace silence in a brand new <em>A Quiet Place</em> story in <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> </h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true"><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> is a new story within the<em> A Quiet Place</em> universe that sees people try to cope with the new threat that suddenly lands on Earth. These monsters are well-armored and incredibly fast. They can’t see, but they react to any sound, quickly seek it out, and put a stop to it by breaking whatever is making it, including people. </p>
 <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false">Much like in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-alien-isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien Isolation</a></em> and the <em>A Quiet Place</em> franchise as a whole, you’ll be sneaking past the giant predatory creatures and causing distractions to draw them away from you or where you want to go. A single noise could give you away, and if you’ve seen either of the movies, you know that spells doom for you. </p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">To progress, you’ve got to work with the things you find in the environment. The game isn’t about beating the aliens, it’s about living to sneak under the next car or into the next building. Having watched the movies and adored them, I can’t wait to see how the tension translates into a game that puts you right in the heart of the most pulse-pounding bits of the action. </p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">The game’s <a href="https://youtu.be/91zi75E_SA8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer looks interesting</a>, and I can’t wait to experience the blend of survival and hide-and-seek gameplay combined with sections that force you out of your comfort zone to the point that it feels like you’re about to die. If done well, <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> could be a fitting follow-up to <em>Alien Isolation</em>. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="false">The <em>A Quiet Place</em> universe is absolutely terrifying. Earth is living through a quiet apocalypse, with survivors unable to make a sound lest they give themselves away and be killed by one of the aliens lurking somewhere in the distance. No part of this timeline is easy to live through, and being trapped by one of the creatures, having them hunt around the environment looking for somethign scuttling nearby, is honestly one of my worst nightmares. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-of-vegapunks%E2%80%99-revelations-in-his-final-speech-in-one-piece.903183/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-of-vegapunks-revelations-in-his-final-speech-in-one-piece/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-of-vegapunks-revelations-in-his-final-speech-in-one-piece<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="414" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It is common knowledge that Dr. Vegapunk is the brightest mind in the entire <em>One Piece</em> universe. At least, no one has topped his genius yet. Unfortunately, possessing knowledge isn’t always a welcomed notion in the eyes of the World Government, and Dr. Vegapunk may have become too smart for his own good. If you don’t understand what I mean, be warned. You will likely get spoiled if you read further.</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Fans have been questioning Dr. Vegapunk’s alignment since his introduction to the series. He seems to be villainous due to his allegiance to the World Government, yet so many good characters speak fondly of him. It turns out the mad genius is just a seeker of truth and knowledge. </p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">With the World Government hunting his behind, he didn’t want his accumulated knowledge to be buried with him. The moment his heart stopped beating, a pre-recorded video feed was broadcast across the globe. Here’s everything he revealed, solving <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-mysteries-in-one-piece-that-still-have-no-clear-answers/">some of the series’ great mysteries</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MangaPlus</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-world-of-one-piece-is-sinking" data-injectable="false">The world of One Piece is sinking</h2> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">According to Dr. Vegapunk, the world of <em>One Piece</em> is slowly sinking. Interestingly, this revelation doesn’t come as much of a surprise. There have been signs and hints even during the earlier arcs of the series, with the most obvious one being Water 7. After all, a good portion of the Capital of Water has already sunk under the sea. However, Dr. Vegapunk’s first revelation doesn’t stop there.</p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">The genius scientist predicted that the world would experience gargantuan earthquakes, raising the sea level by a meter. And he was spot on. The more surprising piece of information, however, is that these earthquakes aren’t a natural phenomenon. They are man-made, which leads to the next revelation and will be expounded on the last one.</p> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MangaPlus</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-dr-vegapunk-s-two-sins" data-injectable="false">Dr. Vegapunk’s two sins</h2> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">During the video feed, Dr. Vegapunk confesses to two sins he apparently committed. The first one is creating an eternal source of energy, the Mother Flame. The second one is digging deep into the Void Century — the history that the World Government is strenuously trying to bury.</p> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="846" data-injectable="true">Dr. Vegapunk’s motivation for his inventions has always been for the betterment of the world’s denizens. He wanted an energy source that could fuel every corner of the world. The manifestation of his hard work and research is the Mother Flame — a flame that never goes out. However, a piece of the said flame has been stolen and utilized to activate an Ancient Weapon to wipe out Lulusia. The manga already revealed that the culprit behind both instances is the World Government. Nonetheless, Dr. Vegapunk blamed himself for the loss of so many lives.</p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">As for this second sin, it is much simpler. He confesses to studying the incomplete records of the Void Century, which are primarily from what is left of the research of the archaeologists of Ohara. But despite his limited information, Dr. Vegapunk has learned enough to shake the world.</p> <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MangaPlus</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-the-truth-behind-void-century" data-injectable="false">The truth behind Void Century</h2> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">The main culprit behind the exploits done in the Void Century is the ever-so-enigmatic Joyboy. Dr. Vegapunk reveals that Joyboy was born in an era wherein technology was more advanced. Like the Sun God himself, Joyboy possessed the ability to stretch and contract his body. But most importantly, Joyboy was the very first person to be called a pirate.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true">While Joyboy’s goals are unknown, his enemies are known to be called the Alliance. This alliance ultimately became the Celestial Dragons that would establish the world government. The two sides fought harshly, ending with Joyboy’s defeat. That is also when the Void Century ended. Then, it all connects to his first two revelations.</p>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">While the battle between Joyboy and the Alliance came to an end, the aftermath of their battle is still visible to the present world of <em>One Piece</em>. Dr. Vegapunk proceeds to explain that the world during Joyboy’s time wasn’t as watery as the present. Since then, the world has sunk 200 meters. The current geography is nothing more than a few pieces of a continent from long ago. Furthermore, there may have been a number of sunk, unknown continents. </p>
 <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">The sudden rise of sea level is a hypothesis that Dr. Vegapunk already proved. Despite suffering defeat, Joyboy left the three Ancient Weapons for the future. Even though Dr. Vegapunk did not expound on this topic further, we, the readers, are already aware of their existence. Pluton remains in Wano while Poseidon is Princess Shirahoshi. That only leaves Uranus. With the stolen Mother Flame as fuel, Imu activated Uranus and obliterated Lulusia, which then led to the one-meter increase in sea level.</p>
 <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="151" data-injectable="false">Alas, Dr. Vegapunk would have made another important revelation relating to the Will of D. Unfortunately, his feed was cut off before the grand reveal.</p>

<p>Heading over to the official Pieces Interactive <a href="https://www.piecesinteractive.se/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, at time of writing, simply displays a graphic which shows the studio's logo, as well as the text "2007-2024" and "Thanks For Playing With Us".</p>
<p>The studio then points to the work it's done over the years, including original titles like&nbsp;<em>Leviathan Warships&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Robo Surf</em>, as well as "work for hire" games like&nbsp;<em>Magicka 2&nbsp;</em>and several of its DLCs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alone-in-the-dark-pieces-interactive-gameplay.jpg?itok=7rmdzuK4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alone-in-the-dark-pieces-interactive-gameplay.jpg?itok=E50y_Wip 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>developer Pieces Interactive is apparently no more.</figcaption></figure><p>Pieces Interactive goes on to say that its "last release" was this year's&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>"reimagining".</p>
<p>Over on his LinkedIn page, character artist Gustav Pethrus <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208340178204078081/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirms</a> that Pieces Interactive has been shut down and that he's looking for new work as a result.</p>
<p>Poignantly, Pieces Interactive's last post on X before <a href="https://x.com/PiecesInt/status/1802612988286804218" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sharing the shutdown notice</a> was a <a href="https://x.com/PiecesInt/status/1770814977005293983" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message</a> entreating fans to "enjoy" the&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<p>The writing has probably been on the wall for Pieces Interactive since&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark</em>'s release, unfortunately; earlier this year, when Embracer Group released its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-70-projects">yearly financial statement</a>, it admitted that&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark</em>, as well as a number of other titles, had underperformed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alone-in-the-dark-pieces-interactive-emily.jpg?itok=bto6QtS1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alone-in-the-dark-pieces-interactive-emily.jpg?itok=5HgDfdi6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>didn't do well enough to save Pieces Interactive, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer Group hasn't released exact sales figures for the game, but it didn't just underperform commercially.&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>also <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16050/alone-in-the-dark-2024-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">received middling reviews on release</a>, with reviewers frequently pointing to its lack of polish and innovation as major drawbacks.</p>
<p>Not everyone felt that way, though. Our very own Tyler rather enjoyed the game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/alone-in-dark-review-southern-gothic-hospitality">awarding it an 8.0 in his review</a> and citing its "foreboding" atmosphere and "challenging" gameplay as highlights.</p>
<p>Pieces Interactive's closure seems to be part of a wide-ranging restructuring effort at parent company Embracer Group (which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">soon split into three separate entities</a>). Although CEO Lars Wingefors told investors in April that the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-ceo-says-restructuring-is-over-no-other-studios-for-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restructuring was over</a>, it seems that doesn't mean Embracer is done closing studios.</p>
<p>The company's restructuring effort has also seen studios like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/probable-images-of-free-radicals-timesplitters-game-revealed-after-studio-closure-by"><em>TimeSplitters</em>&nbsp;studio Free Radical</a> closed down, as well as the sale of entities like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-publisher-take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-new-borderlands-in">Gearbox</a>.</p>

            <p>
Todd Howard has shared more about Bethesda's future DLC plans for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, the Bethesda exec spoke about the studio's "annual story expansion" approach. When further asked about his comment and whether Bethesda was taking this approach with Starfield, Howard replied: "I would say we want to, more or less, yeah. How long that continues? Hopefully a very long time." </p>
<p>He then added the studio was already "planning for the one after this", confirming "there will be another one" after Shattered Space.</p>

</figure>
<p>
Howard went on to say he didn't believe the goal of these expansions was to "answer every question" in Starfield. "We sort of look at it and say, 'Hey, what's a good angle? What do we want to add to the game as far as an experience or a tone or those kinds of things', if that makes sense," he said, but refrained from adding more. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the interview, Howard said Starfield has 14 million players with an average play time of 40 hours. He also said development on Shattered Space started back in September, when Starfield first launched. </p>
<p>Since then, the studio has introduced a number of updates, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-fans-arent-happy-bethesdas-charging-6-for-a-single-creation-mission">game's Creations storefront</a>.</p> <div>

We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-starfields-shattered-space-expansion-but-still-no-release-date">first proper look at Starfield's Shattered Space expansion</a> earlier this month, when Bethesda released a space-horror flavoured trailer during the Xbox showcase. You can check it out in the video above.
</p>
<p>
Shattered Space will offer a fresh mystery involving the snake-loving House Va'ruun, at some point later in 2024.
