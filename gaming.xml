<p>Compared to the GameCube and PS2 release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> — which was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pac-man-world-2-is-getting-the-re-pac-treatment">announced last week in the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> — looks pretty darn good. And just in case you've forgotten what the game looked like on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pac-man_world_2">GameCube</a> (or PS2), then Bandai Namco has you covered.</p>
<p>The publisher put out a comparison video for its upcoming remaster of the 2002 platformer, and it's not until you see the two versions side-by-side that you realise just how much work has been put into the 2025 release.</p>
<p>It almost looks like an entirely different game, with environments enhanced and sometimes "redrawn" to add more textures and depth. All things modern consoles are much more capable of handling.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest glow-up of them all comes from the water level, which looks lovely in Re-Pac. Hey, those original water visuals are still pretty good for 2002, though!</p>

<p>Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac launches on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>. It's coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2, but the latter will be a Game-Key Card release.</p>

		<p>To All Beavers of Slatsville Who May Have Been Affected by Recent Events:</p><p>It has come to my attention that the past several months have been difficult for our <em>Timberborn </em>settlement, and some of you have not felt seen by the management of Slatsville. This could not be further from the truth, but words are cheap and actions speak louder so as your manager I am personally extending this apology.</p><p>I am sorry. I need to do better and I will do better, and that process starts with taking accountability.</p><p>I am sorry that I did not notice the food warehouses and water tanks were slowly emptying well before the Cycle 4 Drought. I am sorry that apparently my first response to learning of the resulting food shortage was that “this will self-correct, don’t worry about it.” While true, obviously a devastating famine is not the mechanism by which any of us would like to handle these issues.</p><p>I regret that the Great Reservoir I built to address future drought issues was overtopped by the radioactive runoff of the Cycle 7 Badtide which killed all our crops and forests and led to the Second Great Famine of Cycle 8.&nbsp;</p><p>I do feel I must point out, purely for the sake of fairness, that this led to meaningful reforms and an attempt to prevent recurrences of this issue. The flood and famine prompted construction of the Badtide Diversion Runoff Channel so that never again would our drinking water and arable farmland be inundated by radioactive floodwaters.</p><p>However, the fact that the Great Badtide Diversion Runoff Channel did not have enough capacity to channel all the runoff into the river was regrettable. As was the backwash of radioactive waste that flooded the Industrial Canyon District as well as most of our farmland (again). I have heard your stories and felt your pain over this incident. But all this was also completely unforeseeable, and I am comforted by the fact that nobody could have prevented this disaster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>During a recent concert, pop star and former <em>American Idol</em> judge Katy Perry was asked by a fan in the audience to sing the Simlish version of “Last Friday Night” as it appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-3-sucks-1826683414"><em>The Sims 3</em></a>‘s DLC “<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-is-now-making-video-games-5876893">Katy Perry’s Sweet Treats.</a>” And the singer obliged, singing a good chunk of the song live in front of a lot of people who were likely confused as to why Perry was suddenly singing in gibberish.</p> <p>Released in 2009, Maxis and EA’s <em>The Sims 3</em> was a massive hit and received plenty of post-launch DLC and updates, as is the case with nearly every major <em>Sims</em> game. One of these DLCs was a <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sims_3:_Katy_Perry%27s_Sweet_Treats">2012 Stuff Pack that was themed entirely around Katy Perry</a>. It added new clothes, hairstyles, in-game items, and locations to <em>The Sims 3.</em> It also included a new in-game song: A version of “Last Friday Night” sung in Simlish (the franchise’s made-up language) by Katy Perry. It was a pretty popular pack, and her Simlish rendition of the pop hit became a bit of a viral meme back in the day. Fast forward to August 6 of this year when–as seen in a video posted on Twitter–Perry was handed a piece of paper at a concert that contained the lyrics to that Simlish version of the song.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry’s tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night 😭 <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p> <p>— Fadi ¹⁴³ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Oh no, I shouldn’t do this…” Perry joked as she walked up to some fans who appeared to be signaling for attention and requesting her to sing the Simlish pop song. She then added, “Let’s just go to the chorus,” likely not wanting to perform the entire song in Simlish during a live concert. To Perry’s credit, she sang the strange version of the song using the provided lyrics, despite being unable to read the small text properly without her reading glasses.</p> <p>After singing, she shouted out, “I’m sorry, you had to be there, 2009 and 10.” Which is funny, but also inaccurate, Katy Perry. You performed the Simlish version of “Last Friday Night” in 2012. There’s even a video of you singing it in a recording booth for EA! Speaking of, let’s end this blog with that video. Roll that footage!</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katy Perry - Last Friday Night in Simlish" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxyW6AJ-yIk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Will We See a Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition This November?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-this-november/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In November, Fallout 4 will celebrate its tenth anniversary, having been released way back in 2015. As the best-selling game in the series (provided you don’t count the tens of millions of players passing through Fallout 76), it’s well placed to receive an Anniversary Edition. As we all know, Bethesda Game Studios loves any reason to re-release an old game.</p>



<p>However, the current-gen update introduced last year and already a busy slate at Bethesda Game Studios might have nipped any chance of Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition surfacing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-boston">Back to Boston</h2>



<p>Fallout 4 was released by Bethesda Game Studios on November 10, 2025, which means we’re mere months away from the game’s tenth anniversary. It’s one heck of a milestone, and as it’s still one of the most popular games in the series, particularly amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the modding community</a>, could we see it get a little more love this year from Bethesda?</p>



<p>Fans are hopeful that <strong>something </strong>will drop to celebrate the game’s milestone, but let’s be honest, it’ll probably be some kind of crossover bundle or event released in Fallout 76, which is where Bethesda’s sole focus sits right now for the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>In 2017, Fallout 4 received a Game of the Year Edition, bundled with every one of the game’s stellar expansions and smaller pieces of downloadable content. Last year, shortly after the award-winning Fallout TV show debuted, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fix-fallout-4-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 current-gen upgrade</a> was released, adding more content to the game and bringing it up to spec.</p>



<p>That’s enough to assume that there <strong>won’t </strong>be a re-release of Fallout 4, as it’s safe to say that there’s no appetite for anyone to purchase the game <strong>again </strong>unless there is a strong incentive to do so.</p>



<p>As a die-hard Fallout fan, I’d buy it just to own it. In any case, it’s the kind of thing that might launch on the Game Pass service, just like Oblivion Remastered did, which scrubs away <strong>even more </strong>sales (unless they rely heavily on other platforms).</p>



<p>They’re busy, similar products already exist, and there’s probably no real appetite for it. I think November will come and go without anything more than a fancy graphic released by Bethesda Game Studios to celebrate the milestone.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about potentially getting a Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<section><p>Clair Obscur isn’t like the other turn-based RPGs--at least, that’s what the worst fans want you to think.</p></section>

                <p>When I first saw it at the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase, I was surprised to see a game from a French developer with the photorealism of Western RPGs and mechanical stylings of Japanese ones. Its polished, cinematic trailer gave the impression of a AAA game, even though I'd never even heard of Sandfall Interactive at the time.</p><p>Clair Obscur moved mountains. Despite its launch on the same weekend as Oblivion Remastered, it sold 500,000 copies within 24 hours and 1 million after three days. It's still maintaining the discourse and curiosity of the games community months later--something that you'd think only a title from a more experienced studio could do. It's all for good reason, of course--it's a great game. We even rated it a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/">Clair Obscur review</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>In many ways, its critical and commercial triumph has been encouraging. We <em>should </em>have a wide range of RPGs made by people from different backgrounds, and we <em>should </em>have more turn-based RPGs. However, Clair Obscur's success also magnified criticisms of Japanese turn-based games, only some of which are deserved. Finally, the haters said, a turn-based RPG that is actually good--as if those don't already exist.</p><p>It raises the question: Why do people think Clair Obscur is "better" than Japanese RPGs that feature similar stories and layered, turn-based gameplay? It may not do anything revolutionary, but somehow wrapping the same ideas into a Westernized package makes that easy to overlook.</p><h2>A genre by any other name</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545875" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545875"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy 16 moves away from turn-based combat in favor of fast-paced real-time action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg"></figure><p>It's not radical to claim that turn-based RPGs, like Clair Obscur, were popularized through Japanese developers like Square Enix. So much so, in fact, that the term JRPG became synonymous with turn-based games that often featured anime-style art. However, JRPG really means just what it reads: a Japanese RPG. The term JRPG became a hot topic after <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/if-developers-dont-like-the-term-jrpg-what-do-we-use-instead/" rel="nofollow ">FF16 director Naoki Yoshida</a> admitted he viewed it as "a discriminatory term" when he first heard it. After all, it others Japanese RPGs from the rest of the genre.</p><p>Favoritism towards Western games shows in the sales. Persona 5, which was enough to break Persona (and, arguably, Shin Megami Tensei in general) out of cult classic status, took over three years to reach <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2019/12/persona-5-worldwide-shipments-top-3-2-million-persona-5-royal-japanese-shipments-top-400000">3.2 million copies</a> sold across PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. And yet despite its critical acclaim and connection to a larger series, it took nine years and two distinct versions of Persona 5 for the game to reach <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1735796959343190092" rel="nofollow ">over 10 million copies</a> sold--that's a much slower rate than Clair Obscur.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload, the highly anticipated remake of Persona 3, sold <a href="https://www.sakuraindex.jp/press-releases/persona-3-reload-sales-reach-22-million-worldwide/" rel="nofollow ">1 million copies</a> in over a week, making it the fastest selling Atlus title ever released. And yet, Clair Obscur did that in just half a day. Toyo Securities estimated Final Fantasy 16 hit about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analyst-apologises-for-mistakenly-claiming-final-fantasy-16-sold-35m-copies" rel="nofollow ">3.5 million sales</a> in March, nearly two years after the cinematic AAA title was released. Last we heard, Clair Obscur reached 3.3 million just 33 days after its release (wild coincidence, we know).This isn't just a turn-based RPG bias, either. Baldur's Gate 3 sold over 2.5 million copies in early access before its official launch, and over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed" rel="nofollow ">15 million copies</a> total after one year. And yet, the critically acclaimed but more stylized grid-based RPG, Fire Emblem: Three Houses, sits at just over 4 million units sold--and it's currently the best selling title in the long-running series.</p><p>Sure, it's not <em>all </em>JRPGs. Elden Ring is created by Japanese developer FromSoftware and technically could be classified as a Japanese RPG, but has managed to sell over <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/we-are-profoundly-thankful-for-your-lasting-devotion-elden-ring-celebrates-30-million-copies-sold-just-a-month-before-elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow ">30 million copies</a> worldwide. Yet somehow, I don't think it'd do as well if it forced you to play as a spiky-haired dude with a sword, or an anime babe.</p><h2>Xenoblade vs. Clair Obscur</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545881"></a><figcaption>Xenoblade 3 digs into the story behind each character in a way that feels natural, even without the one-on-one bonding in games like Persona 5 or Fire Emblem.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg"></figure><p>Xenoblade Chronicles 3, my 2022 Game of the Year, has a few things in common with Sandfall Interactive's hit. The chemistry between characters, emotional cutscenes and storytelling, and highly customizable combat made it one of my favorite RPGs in recent memory, and those are all things that make Clair Obscur great, too.</p><p>Xenoblade 3 features a cast from two opposing sides, their factions locked in constant war to fuel the lifeforces of entire colonies. Each generation of soldiers "hatches" into the world as a prepubescent child and lives up to 10 Terms, with each Term roughly translating to a year of life. If you happen to survive the full 10 Terms, you're rewarded with a ceremony that frees your soul from the cycle of rebirth. Mio, one of the main characters, is on her 10th term and nearing the end of her lifespan.</p><p>Like the premise suggests, grief over friends lost too early (like the protagonist's childhood friend, Joran) and anxiety about the finiteness of life (like with Mio) are two main themes that Xenoblade 3 shares with Clair Obscur. It doesn't explore these ideas through blocks of exposition, but with cinematics, starting with a lengthy opening that introduces us to our main characters. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-masters-of-war/1900-6417921/">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 review</a>, we praised many of the same elements that made Clair Obscur a success.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4545886" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4545886"></a><figcaption>Xenoblade 3 is a JRPG that uses this wild setup instead of the typical turn-based combat that the genre is known for. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg"></figure><p>Clair Obscur's Act 1 hooked me with its rich worldbuilding and emotional stakes right away. Gustave, our first playable character, says goodbye to his estranged sweetheart during the annual "Gommage," the time of year when everyone of a certain age fades into smoke and petals. Clair Obscur's is a society where death is predictable and coming closer every year. It strikes early with the reality of how short the average lifespan is, how many children are prematurely orphaned, and similar sadnesses that define life in the fictional French-inspired city of Lumiere.</p><p>These are heavy themes. It doesn't feel like we're playing pretend when we experience these stories of sacrifice and loss. Xenoblade 3 and similarly styled Japanese RPGs also explore these, yet seem to have a hard time getting the mainstream audience to take them seriously.</p><h2>The problem with anime</h2><p>Many Japanese games feature animated graphics like we see in anime, which are Japanese cartoons. Japan uses anime-style drawings for visual instructions, advertisements, and more outside of the typical children's TV show. Japanese developers often adapt the same art style into their games, and unwittingly, attract the same xenophobia foreigners have toward anime. It may be difficult to imagine in today's culture where <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/why-is-anime-cool-now/" rel="nofollow ">anime is now cool</a>, but old fans from the ‘90s and early 2000s remember an era where liking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-did-anime-go-from-nerdy-cringey-mainstream-deepa-d-souza/" rel="nofollow ">anime was "cringey."</a></p><p>When it comes to anime-style games, the internet is quick to point out any <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/357204-xenoblade-chronicles-3/80068225?page=3">unnecessary sexualization</a> and overused archetypes. These criticisms aren't limited to turn-based games, but also action RPGs, visual novels, and really anything that comes out of Japan. Despite similar issues arising in Western games, these conversations feel more intensified with Japanese titles, and ultimately give them a bad name.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545893" data-ratio="0.56338028169014" data-width="1420" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545893"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy 7 Remake has its emotional moments in its storytelling, though you'd have trouble believing it with the memes out there.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg"></figure><p>Common tropes and portrayals in Japanese media are a tougher sell for western audiences that aren't used to them. They laugh at unrealistic behavior like "anime grunts" in Final Fantasy games. (Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a big offender, enough that someone made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpEd2yK8KzQ">movie-length compilation of anime grunts</a> just from the cutscenes.) Others question the absurdity of how often <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/j2pgy2/how_common_is_the_teenagers_killing_god_trope/" rel="nofollow ">high schoolers are fighting god</a> or <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-child-soldiers-such-a-popular-concept-in-manga-anime" rel="nofollow ">fighting wars with neighboring countries</a>. Tropes like that <em>can </em>work with the right implementation, and lean into the tastes of people already used to anime games and shows--but if you're not already on board, the themes can be lost in translation.</p><p>Even Clair Obscur game director Guillaume Broche senses that there's some kind of prejudice against Japanese RPGs. He didn't point to a particular reason, but he addressed it in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-says-turn-based-rpgs-are-selling-better-lately-but-the-prejudice-is-still-there/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>.</p><p>"Personally speaking, I think Japanese turn-based RPGs were super popular up until the Xbox 360 era. But around the time open-world games started getting more popular through gaming media, [JRPGs] started being considered 'uncool'," said Broche. "While they do still sell a large number of copies, with the Persona series as a prime example, I feel like the prejudice against turn-based RPGs isn’t completely gone."</p><p>In Xenoblade 3, some characters have more out-there qualities, such as cat ears, wings, gray skin, or glowing veins--but none of these are used to fetishize them. And while you could argue that stereotypes like the hotheaded, brawny guy and calculating, studious tactician are present, they never feel particularly trite like they may in a C-grade harem anime. But, because of these quirks and the larger stigma, nobody talks about Xenoblade 3 the way they do Clair Obscur. Part of this could be Clair Obscur's presentation, which leaned more into Western aesthetics and had the benefit of being a debut game without specific expectations. Meanwhile, Xenoblade Chronicle 3's marketing focused on it being part of an established series, and showcased chaotic combat (not turn-based) that didn't fully reflect the actual experience. Perhaps all these had a small hand in why it was forgotten, despite its impressive cinematics and compelling story of grief.</p><h2>Japanese-inspired</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545877" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545877"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy X is an inspiration to many modern RPGs, including Clair Obscur.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg"></figure><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17041-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-celebrating-turn-based-games-classic-rpg-influences-in-making-something-new" rel="nofollow ">RPG Site</a>, Sandfall Interactive co-founder and Expedition 33 producer François Meurisse spoke about his and Broche‘s shared love for JRPGs. Meurisse cited Final Fantasy X and Persona 5 as the team's biggest influences--FFX for its story and P5 for its gameplay. It bears noting that both of these are Japanese games.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-x-review/1900-2832771/">Final Fantasy X</a> launched in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and later came to other consoles as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, starting with the Japan-exclusive launch for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013. Our original PS2 review gave it 9.3/10, admitting it used "typical role-playing game clichés" but also, in most cases, "cleverly avoids whatever expectations you may have for it." (Like with Clair Obscur, Xenoblade 3 fans also draw connections between the two.)</p><p>Tidus, FFX's protagonist, is part of a team of guardians escorting Yuna, a Summoner who can command superpowered creatures at will, on a journey to defeat the godlike being destroying their world. There's only so much I can give away without spoilers, but FFX features similar turn-based combat and themes of sacrifice. During the mission, Tidus finds out a concerning truth that forces him to accept a major loss for the betterment of their world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545876"></a><figcaption>Persona 5's stylish UI and camerawork helps combat feel satisfying and cinematic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, Persona 5 is now considered the industry standard for turn-based games and proves that the battle system is alive and well--not just found in Clair Obscur. While the exact details differ between the games, Shin Megami Tensei and spin-offs like Persona use a turn-based system that empowers players to stack buffs and trigger combos to hit harder and faster. Atlus' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metaphor-refantazio-review-everybody-wants-to-rule-the-world/1900-6418297/">Metaphor Refantazio</a>, which we gave a 10/0 last year in our review, also builds on this turn-based system.</p><p>The Persona series first reached "cult classic" status with Persona 3, which launched about six years after FFX in North America and overlaps with the same themes in Clair Obscur. Like Clair Obscur, Persona 3 is very much about death and is the most heavy-handed Persona game when it comes to portraying it. One of its biggest mottos is "memento mori," the Latin phrase for "remember you will die," and your party members summon their Personas by taking an evoker (read: pistol) to the head. That's all without spoilers for the story, which the community still remembers as a tearjerker that challenges us to think about how we view death.</p><p>Persona 3 was the first Persona game to focus on building relationships with teammates plus potential romances, a popular enough mechanic to make it into Persona 4 and Persona 5. Clair Obscur also does this with its characters, although you can max out relationship levels with all characters without worrying about choosing one over the other. Persona 3 still attracts criticism for its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/ouydha/persona_3s_pacing_made_me_end_up_not_caring_about/" rel="nofollow ">pacing</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/s38rrr/persona_3_is_a_clunky_frustrating_and_repetitive/" rel="nofollow ">repetitiveness</a>, but the crazy thing is that's something people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1ku8iv4/is_clair_obscur_repetitive_or_is_that_the_standard/" rel="nofollow ">complaining about even in Clair Obscur</a>.</p><p>For every success that takes inspiration from FFX and P5, only a few reach enough people to be as talked about as Clair Obscur, even if they receive recognition from critics, awards shows, and their cult followings. I can compare games like Scarlet Nexus, Sea of Stars, and Octopath Traveller 2 all day and still not address what seems to be the real problem: Japanese versus Western tastes.</p><h2>A cultural divide in media</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545879" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545879"></a><figcaption>The Hundred Line Defense Academy is one of the recent releases from Too Kyo Games, a Japanese studio created by Danganronpa and Zero Escape developers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg"></figure><p>Clair Obscur is from France, which generally falls under the umbrella of the "West" that includes Western Europe, North America, and Australia. Its killer mimes may be foreign to me as an American, but the photorealistic, live action presentation matches what many of us are used to in the States.</p><p>Anime is becoming more popular in the U.S., but it's still not the norm. Right now on Netflix Japan, the<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/japan/tv" rel="nofollow "> top 10 shows</a> are almost exclusively anime with the exception of Their Marriage (the Japanese title "Shiawase na Kekkon" roughly translates to "Happy Marriage"). The U.S. is the opposite. Our<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/united-states/tv" rel="nofollow "> top 10 Netflix shows</a> are all live action except for the My Melody &amp; Kuromi series (which is, unsurprisingly, also the one I most want to watch).</p><p>And get this—Clair Obscur is actually not selling that well in Japan. According to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/famitsu-sales-4-21-25-5-4-25">Gematsu</a>, the Japanese are busy with Spike Chunsoft's The Hundred Line: Defense Academy while we're still arguing about which Clair Obscur ending is best. The Hundred Line Defense Academy launched on the same day as Clair Obscur and sold nearly three times the amount of copies. So there's something to be said about the opposite, too. Japanese people like Japanese games, and Westerners like Western games.</p><h2>Why Clair Obscur?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545878" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545878"></a><figcaption>Clair Obscur Act 1 crew is best crew in my humble opinion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg"></figure><p>To its credit, Clair Obscur is well-worth celebrating. It gets a lot right, such as how it tastefully incorporates French aesthetics into its main city and weaves its influences through smaller means, like dialogue and cinematography pulled straight from French cinema. However, if we're talking about the other things that made it successful--like storytelling, exploration, and combat--there are many other games that came before it that do those equally well. If anything, Clair Obscur's biggest strength is that it takes the best features from the last decade's best RPGs and implements them in a way that appeals to a larger crowd. But we ought to show respect for the games that came before, even if they are about cartoon orphans fighting big squids.</p><p>Clair Obscur is still one of the best games I've played this year. I just think we should have a more open mind toward "anime games" because they have many of the same things we love, even if they don't have those hi-fi graphics.</p>

<p>The old description spoke about several elements that were known in the Horizon universe, including “colossal machines” and “mechanimals”. The new description has removed these words and mentions of an advanced technology. Now, it mentions “overcoming the challenges of survival” and carving a place for yourself in this “unforgiving land”. </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Old:</strong> “In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals.“</p>



<p><strong>New:</strong> “Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land.“</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="h-key-art-changed">Key Art Changed</h4>



<p>The previous key art for the Light of Moitram featured a woman who resembled someone that players would know very well from the Horizon series, Aloy. The red-haired girl was seen looking over a world filled with creatures similar to those in the popular PlayStation series. Now, the woman has been replaced by two robotic creatures, one that looks like a penguin and the other like a dog. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-gameplay-screenshots">New Gameplay Screenshots</h4>



<p>Many of the screenshots that made Light of Motiram appear more like a Horizon clone have been removed. Some new screenshots have been added, which feature the game’s open world instead. All imagery of the robots that looked similar to the ones in PlayStation’s Horizon series was removed. </p>

<h4 id="h-release-window-added">Release Window Added</h4>



<p>Light of Motiram now has a release window, the Steam page states that the game is now scheduled to release in Q4 2027. </p>



<p>In the lawsuit, Sony has alleged that Tencent has created a “slavish clone” of Horizon with Light of Motiram, which copies elements such as gameplay, story themes, and artistic elements, among others. Sony also stated that Tencent had approached them to collaborate on a new Horizon game. </p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation’s Horizon franchise <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-horizon-franchise-has-sold-38-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 38 million copies</a>. What are your thoughts on the changes Tencent made to Light of Motiram? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced a new product line for young children called My Mario, which will be released on August 26, available only in Nintendo stores in Japan at the moment. The My Mario series includes fun toys, books, games, and more, all featuring Mario and his friends, with more items being added down the line. What's more, it will feature what appears to be the spiritual successor to a delightful "game" from the past.</p><p>Nintendo gave a sneak preview of some of the times that will be readily available: a set of wooden blocks shaped like Mario, Luigi, and other familiar items from Mario's world. What makes these blocks interesting is that they also work as Amiibo figures, so kids can use them in certain Nintendo Switch games to unlock extra features or characters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546514-img_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546514" data-ratio="0.37230989956958" data-width="4182" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546514-img_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546514"></a><figcaption>It's a Mario block party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546514-img_03.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546515-img_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546516-img_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546517-img_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546518-img_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546515,1300-4546516,1300-4546517,1300-4546518" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4546515-img_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4546516-img_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4546517-img_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4546518-img_03.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546515-img_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546516-img_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546517-img_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546518-img_03.jpg"></figure><p>Another product in the series is a board book called Hello, Mario! which is designed for parents and kids to read together. The book has fun parts that children can touch and move, like opening Mario's mouth or turning his face. There will also be a free app for smartphones and a game for the Nintendo Switch that lets kids play by pulling or turning Mario's face on the screen. If you're old enough, you may remember being able to do something similar on Super Mario 64's home screen.</p><p>This sort of initiative reflects what Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto has been planning for some time, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-reveals-how-mickey-mouse-inspired-the-series-evolution/1100-6482395/" data-ref-id="1100-6482395">Mario appearing in product lines where you'd also see a character like Mickey Mouse</a>.</p><p>To go along with the toys and games, Nintendo will also release short stop-motion videos that will be posted on the official My Mario website and other channels. The series will also include clothing, plush toys, and other fun items. Starting next year, some My Mario products will be sold outside Japan as well.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-tiny-bookshop-switch-the-epitome-of-cosy-perfect-for-bookworms.1265868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you’re a self-proclaimed bookworm like me, then chances are you’ve probably fantasised about packing everything away, moving to a quaint seaside town, and starting up a cute little bookshop (<em>don’t worry, NL, I’m not going anywhere!</em>). Well, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>, that's exactly the pitch. Developed by neoludic games, this is the epitome of ‘cosy’; a tranquil experience that demands little of you, yet offers oodles of satisfaction as you watch your numbers gradually tick up.</p>
<p>Within the town of Bookstonbury (chortle!), you’re provided with a selection of locations in which to sell your books, including (but not limited to) a beach front, a café, and, depending on the day of the week, a flea market. You’re then tasked with filling your bookshelves with titles, and providing a nice variety is the key to success. I went one step further and put all the kids' books at the bottom, so the little ones can reach them.</p>
<p>You can boost your chances of selling books within a particular genre by decking out your shop with items. A skull will get folks interested in the crime genre, while a typewriter might inspire those more interested in classic fiction. You can go one step further and add signs, plants, tables, or even completely repaint the exterior. One quick note, though: it would be nice if the game added in some touchscreen controls for those portable sessions. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but something for the future, perhaps.</p>
<p>Generally, your days progress automatically, with customers trickling in and cute little speech bubbles popping up to demonstrate their actions within the store. Occasionally, however, someone will ask for help. At this point, you’re given a brief description of what kind of book they’re after, and it’s up to you to scan through your shelves and find the right fit. What’s great is that all of the books are real, so you’ve got your Stephen Kings, your Bill Brysons, your Agatha Christies… As a horror fan, I was delighted to see deep cuts like John Langan’s <strong>The Fisherman</strong> represented (a great Lovecraftian folk tale, by the way).</p>
<p>Sometimes, you simply won’t have anything to satisfy your customers’ needs (this is exacerbated if your other patrons have already stripped your shelves clean), and it can be a little heartbreaking when that happens. Generally, though, each day will complete with just a bit more money in your pocket, and this then allows you to purchase more stock and more trinkets, thus fuelling even more successful ventures later down the road.</p>
<p>Tiny Bookshop is a fun little experience whether you’re into reading or not, but I think it’s clear that those who can’t leave the house without a paperback will get a lot more out of it. I adore the stylised visuals, the catchy, laid-back tunes, and the satisfying loop that each day brings to the table. I often found myself going to put the game down before stopping myself to see what might happen the next day. Kind of like a great book.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has released a teaser for their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> card game. While the English-language release is just a few months away, the studio already has plans for the second set, <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>.</p>



<p>In an official press release from Riot Games, they provided a few crumbs of information on <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>. This will be the second set released after the <em>Riftbound Origins</em> set, which is scheduled for release in English in October.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-promo-artwork-man-with-deck-of-cards.jpg?itok=ft9WI3hZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-promo-artwork-man-with-deck-of-cards.jpg?itok=LMNUvefx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The press release contained the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Once <em>Riftboundʼs</em> origin story is told, itʼs time to become Spritiforged. This dynamic second set&nbsp;<br>
introduces new champions to the game, like Ezreal, Fiora, Irelia, Lucian, and Rumble. Spiritforged&nbsp;<br>
features 200+ new cards, two new Champion Decks you can pick up and play right out of the box,&nbsp;<br>
and a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Riftbound: Spiritforged launches in December 2025 for China and February 2026 in English</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Riftbound</em> is Riot's attempt to bring the deep lore and iconic characters from <em>League of Legends</em> into the TCG space. The game aims to bring in both tabletop veterans and new players with a mix of accessible and deep gameplay. A gameplay mix that, according <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-mixes-fast-gameplay-consistent-resource-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to our preview</a>, appears to be on the right track. The game will support 1v1, 2v2, and 4-player free-for-all formats.</p>

<p>The <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> teaser does demonstrate Riot's commitment to supporting their TCG game. It is a space that has been heavily dominated for decades by the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>. But more recent competition, <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, has shown a place can be made in that space with the right amount of appeal and gameplay polish.</p>

<p>The teaser does invite some questions. The set will feature two premade Champion Decks. Who will be featured in those decks? How will the game's champions be represented in this new TCG format? Only time will tell.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-online-trailer-players-growth-release-date-2000616669</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-online-just-won%E2%80%99t-stop-adding-new-players.1265862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The sun just refuses to set on <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>. Even with<em> GTA 6</em> delayed into next year, the current entry’s multiplayer mode is seeing an surprising surge in new and returning players. Rockstar Games’ parent company, Take-Two, just revealed the 12-year-old spin-off is 50 percent more popular than it was last year.</p> <p>“During the quarter, engagement for <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>&nbsp;benefited from the record-setting launch of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> Trailer 2 and the successful release of the ‘<em>Money Fronts</em>‘ Summer content pack, which culminated in higher than expected recurrent consumer spending growth,” the company announced in its quarterly earnings report this week. “We are pleased that new player accounts<em>&nbsp;</em>for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>grew over 50 percent year-over-year.”</p> <p>Every company that delays one of the most anticipated releases of all-time by more than six months should be so lucky. At this rate, Rockstar could push back the release of <em>GTA 6</em> from May to October 2026 and see <em>GTA Online</em> potentially double in popularity in just two years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-future-updates-gta6-take-two-ceo-support-1851763665">merely by dropping new trailers for the sequel</a>.</p>

 <p>I guess all of those people still buying <em>GTA V</em> each month are for real. The game was the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k">ninth best-selling game of the year so far in June</a>. That was up from being the 15th best-selling overall in 2024. Even if that number eventually comes down by the end of 2025, it would still be incredible if<em> GTA V</em> sold&nbsp;<em>just as well</em> as it had the year prior after more than a decade of being out in the wild.</p> <p>No wonder Rockstar has been content to take its time with the sequel while everyone else selling games on consoles battles to convince <em>GTA Online</em> fans to take a chance on buying something new. Shutting <em>GTA Online</em> down for good would be terrible for Take-Two’s shareholders but it <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-selling-games-2024-hogwarts-legacy-dragon-ball-1851746095">might spread the wealth around a bit</a> and give great games from other studios a better shot at getting recognized. Or all of those people would just go play <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> instead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Going up to the great big pasture in the sky.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grass Wonder, one of the real-life racehorses that inspired a character in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a>, passed away on August 8 at age 30, prompting an outpouring of condolences from fans of Cygames’ anime horse-girl franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The stallion Grass Wonder is one of the real-life Japanese racehorses Cygames turned into a character for its Umamusume: Pretty Derby anime and games. As all Umamusume’s characters are anime girls with equine ears and tails, Grass Wonder also got a sex change. In the Umamusume universe, Grass Wonder is a friendly but determined girl who grew up in America but loves Japanese culture, echoing how the real horse was American-bred but trained in Japan. The character’s light brown hair with a white dot at the front mimics the horse’s chestnut coat with a white star marking.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/08/grass-wonder-1754672021724.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grass Wonder has passed away aged 30. Image credit: Big Red Farm.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The real Grass Wonder is known for winning Arima Kinen, one of Japan’s prestigious Grade 1 races, twice. During his four-year career (1997-2000), he placed first in nine out of 15 races. At the time, Grass Wonder was matched against fellow racehorse Special Week (resulting in a tense <a href="https://youtu.be/cptKFbDoEqY?si=QGM7eJaojt5v7MIG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>photo finish back in 1999</u></a>), and this rivalry is portrayed in the Umamusume: Pretty Derby anime. After retiring from racing in 2000, Grass Wonder went on to sire four champions including Screen Hero and Earnestly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the <a href="https://www.bigredfarm.jp/post/%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC-%E6%AD%BB%E5%8E%BB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official obituary</u></a> from Big Red Farm, where Grass Wonder lived out his twilight years, the former champion racehorse was in good health until he started to decline yesterday evening. He passed away from age-related multiple organ failure at the age of 30, an impressive age for a racehorse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the news about the real Grass Wonder going to the great big pasture in the sky, Umamusume’s <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official X account</u></a> posted: “On August 8, we received the news that Grass Wonder, one of the horses that served as inspiration for a character in our franchise, has passed away. We would like to extend our condolences to all related parties, and pray for the repose of this champion horse’s soul.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans also posted messages of condolences, with many hoping that Grass Wonder was now in a place where there are plenty of dandelions (his favorite food). “The last horse from the strongest generation has set off on his final journey… Thank you Grass Wonder,” one commenter <a href="https://x.com/rUdtTauYetz6ouj/status/1953774418229879163" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted.</u></a> Another <a href="https://x.com/yaya777season2/status/1953792038161272978" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> that although they feel sad when the real horse behind a character passes away, the horses will keep on shining forever in the world of Umamusume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By coincidence, Rena Maeda, who voices Grass Wonder in Umamusume: Pretty Derby, posted on X yesterday about her experience visiting the racehorse in real life. She said she intends to go back and see him again, although sadly she won’t get the chance.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>海外のトレーナーさんたちが2018年のこのポストを見つけてくれている！ありがと！</p><p>Trainers from overseas are watching this post!

But don't sleep on this patch's best, most important feature: the ability for your character to lean back against a wall and look brooding or nonchalant, just like you've always wished they could.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, but seriously! WoW's latest patch, 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, adds a brand new emote to the game: /lean. It does exactly what it sounds like. Your character leans back, either relaxing against whatever wall or support is behind them or, if there's nothing, will just sort of lean in mid-air awkwardly. It's a fairly small addition, but players are already having a lot of fun with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkln6i/rating_each_lean_emote/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One player has shared tier rankings</a> of each race and gender's unique /lean emote, ranging from Blood and Void elves up in S-tier for having perfectly sassy leans, all the way down to D-tier which contains gnome males, draenei females, goblins and dracthyr of both genders, and several more, all of whom apparently have stiff and uninteresting poses. Another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj7rz7/lots_of_hold_stuff_in_your_hand_toys_working_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovered that you can hold in-game toys in your hands</a> in ways that play nicely with the /lean emote, giving your character a casual way to check a compass or sip a beer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/08/wowscrnshot-080825-111103-1754669902060.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">WoW's latest patch, 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, adds a brand new emote to the game: /lean.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silly as this is, players are really digging it. It's a fun little bit of flavor, especially for those who use World of Warcraft as a role-play space. I've already run into a bunch of players just casually leaning in capital cities while AFK, and I'm looking forward to using my C-tier tauren female emote in the new raid to lean on the aggressively purple walls while my raid leader explains mechanics for the 17th time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's latest patch, Ghost of K'aresh, is out now, and the new raid, Manaforge Omega, will open on Tuesday next week. The patch has had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-players-say-newest-patch-has-a-lot-of-weird-bugs-including-one-thats-turning-everyones-banks-german">sliiiightly buggy start</a>, but Blizzard is actively working to clean things up.

Launched to huge fanfare in 2023, Bethesda's big sci-fi hope landed to a mixed reception from players — who have since gone on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-design-director-addresses-fan-concern-as-starfield-dlc-shattered-space-plunges-to-mostly-negative-steam-review-rating">complain about the game's disappointing first expansion</a> and lack of substantial ongoing support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, one bright spot on the horizon appears to be signs of Bethesda finally adding the highly-requested ability to travel in your spaceship from one planet to another — rather than what happens now, as you load up a loading screen to enter orbit, and from there load up another loading screen to get to where you're going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fragments of code uncovered by Starfield fans now suggest Bethesda has a more streamlined experience in the works, though potentially still with some caveats. While you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, fans say it looks like you won't be able to fly all the way between systems. Oh, and you also won't be able to fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-and-valve-will-kill-steam-for-chromebooks-experiment-in-january-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Bad news if you're one of the handful of people using Steam to play games on a Chromebook: Google and Valve are preparing to end support for the still-in-beta ChromeOS version of Steam on January 1, 2026, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/07/steam-chromebook-2026/">according to 9to5Google</a>. Steam can still be installed on Chromebooks, but it now comes with a notice announcing the end of support.</p>
<p>“The Steam for Chromebook Beta program will conclude on January 1st, 2026," reads the notification. "After this date, games installed as part of the Beta will no longer be available to play on your device. We appreciate your participation in and contribution to learnings from the beta program, which will inform the future of Chromebook gaming.”</p>
<p>Steam originally launched on Chromebooks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/steam-on-chromebooks-is-ready-for-testing-comes-with-steep-requirements/">in early 2022</a> as an alpha that ran on just a handful of newer and higher-specced devices with Intel chips inside. A beta version <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/steam-on-chromebooks-enters-beta-adds-amd-support/">arrived later that year</a>, with reduced system requirements and support for AMD CPUs and GPUs. Between then and now, neither Google nor Valve had said much about it.</p>
<p>The Steam beta was one component of a "gaming Chromebook" push that Google made in 2022 and 2023. It saw the release of laptops with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/stadias-dead-but-new-chromebooks-keep-googles-cloud-gaming-dreams-alive/">better hardware and high-refresh-rate screens</a> and optimized versions of GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Google had reportedly been working to add Steam support to ChromeOS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/report-google-wants-to-bring-the-steam-game-store-to-chrome-os/">since at least 2020</a>.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of players have jumped in, which has led to some massive queue times, but not everyone of these players is a Battlefield veteran. The beta is full of players who are simply looking for a new first-person shooter or dipping their toes into Battlefield to see if they like the experience or not.</p><p>If you're one of those new players or a player returning to the franchise after a long hiatus, you might be confused about the different game modes available in Battlefield 6. There are four game mode options, but the game doesn't explain them too well in the menus.

While you can hop into each one and see how the game mode works for yourself first-hand, it's always better to have a little bit of knowledge beforehand.</p><p>Below, we'll summarize each game mode, including its goal, how to win, and the playstyles it caters to.</p><h3 id="Conquest">Conquest</h3><p>Conquest is the bread-and-butter game mode of the Battlefield franchise. It's what the franchise has become known for over the years, and it works very similarly to how it has in the past in Battlefield 6.</p><p>The mode sees two teams, each of which can be made up of as many as 32 players, spawn on opposite ends of a large-scale map. Starting at each team's base are a variety of vehicles, including tanks, helicopters, off-road SUVs, and more. The vehicles available are dependent on the map you're playing. In addition to the vehicles, six flags are spread out across the map, labeled A through F. Each team will begin near either the A or F flag, and the flags need to be captured by standing in their zones, which are indicated by lines on the ground.</p><p>The overall goal of Conquest is to capture as many flags as possible and eliminate enemies as they try to take your team's flags or defend their own. Points are earned by capturing more flags and keeping them under your team's control for longer periods of time. You can capture an enemy team's flag by standing on its zone for roughly one to two minutes, but the enemy team can also do the same to your flags.</p><p>As the match proceeds, you'll see the score bar at the top of your screen fluctuate. Each team starts with 1,000 points, and those points get depleted the less flag control you have. Eventually, a team will reach zero points, and the first team to do that has lost the match. So, in a nutshell, Conquest is about holding flags for longer so you can deplete the other team's points.</p><p>When you die in Conquest, you have to wait for a few seconds to respawn. Your spawn point can be on one of your squad's locations or at one of your team's active flags. Every person is grouped into a squad of four, and coordination with your squad is key so you know where to push on the map.</p><p>A Conquest match can take anywhere from 20-30 minutes in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Closed_Weapon_Conquest">Closed Weapon Conquest</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545961" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545961"></a><figcaption>Closed Weapon Conquest forces you to use only weapons from your class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png"></figure><p>This game mode is exactly like the base Conquest mode, but every player is locked to the weapon of their chosen class. So, for example, if you choose the Assault class, you can only use an assault rifle, as that's the signature weapon of that class. If you go with the Engineer class, you're locked to SMGs, Support is locked to LMGs, and Recon is locked to snipers.</p><p>Of course, you're also able to pull out your secondary weapons and gadgets as well. This means Assault class players can pick between their rifle, pistol, and two gadget weapons that can be a shotgun, DMR, carbine, or explosive sidearm.</p><p>The point of Closed Weapon Conquest is for players to use their class the way it was intended in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Breakthrough">Breakthrough</h3><p>Breakthrough is another classic Battlefield game mode, and matches in this mode can take the longest out of any other. It also takes place on large-scale maps with teams of 30+ players. However, Breakthrough assigns teams one of two roles: Attackers or Defenders.</p><p>The team of Attackers' job is to push their forces forward on the map, capturing objectives along the way and continually pushing the enemy team back. The Attackers succeed if they push all the way up the map, reaching the enemy's team base within a certain timeframe.</p><p>Speaking of the enemy team, that's where the Defenders come in. The Defenders' sole goal is to stop the Attackers from pushing up on the map and capturing objectives. Defenders often hold specific positions that make it difficult for the Attackers to get around them and push up the map. However, if Defenders aren't coordinated, Attackers can bust through their defenses and make it very tough to stop them as they keep moving forward.</p><p>Breakthrough matches can take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to complete in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Domination">Domination</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545964" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545964"></a><figcaption>Fighting over the B flag in Domination is crucial</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png"></figure><p>Last up, we have Domination. If you're coming from Call of Duty, then this is the exact same game mode you know and love. It's also very similar to Strongholds from Halo, but the scoring works slightly differently.</p><p>In Domination, you're playing a scaled-down version of Conquest. The maps take place in the same locations, but the playable areas are cut off due to only three flags being available to capture (A, B, C). Teams spawn in on either A or C and must fight over the B flag while also trying to capture the enemy's spawn flag and defend their own.</p><p>Two teams, which are made up of eight players each, start at zero points in Domination and must try to earn 200 to be declared the winner. Teams score by owning at least one flag, but you score more points the more flags you have. So, if a team has two flags, they'll score points at a faster rate compared to the team that just has one flag. If you don't own any flags, you don't score at all.</p><p>Spawning is immediate in Domination, and you don't get to choose where you spawn, like in Conquest. This makes matches a little more chaotic, and they tend to finish much quicker than any other game mode. Domination is perfect for players who seek quicker action and fewer players to deal with on the map. The mode also doesn't feature any vehicles.</p><p>And that does it for all of the current game modes in Battlefield 6. As we said before, more are coming with the full launch in October, so we'll update this guide with those modes when they are released.

The last few years have seen it delve into making inventive and stylish takes on licensed properties, such as the strategy title <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/john-wick-hex/john-wick-hex-review-a-slow-motion-ballet-of-blood">John Wick Hex</a> (which was delisted last month), the visual novel puzzle title <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/tron-identity/grid-based-decision-making">Tron: Identity</a>, and 2025’s Tron: Catalyst, a top-down action game. Bithell Games has also published titles from its label developer Lunar Division: The Banished Vault and the upcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350750/Amberspire/">Amberspire</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/08/volume-john-wick-hex-studio-bithell-games-loses-majority-of-staff-to-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

Bithell Games, the studio behind the acclaimed likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thomas-was-alone">Thomas Was Alone</a>, John Wick Hex, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a>, has announced job cuts impacting the "majority" of its full-time employees.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">statement announcing the news</a> on social media, studio founder Mike Bithell explained the company had been unable to secure a new larger scale project, meaning eleven jobs are now being made redundant. "This," he noted, "constitutes the majority of our full-time staff".
</p>
<p>
"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025," Bithell wrote. "We've fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance pay."
</p>
<p>
"It's important to state that this was an incredible team of exceptionally talented people. If you're a developer reading this, and you're hiring; anyone among those affected would be a great addition to your studio, please reach out if we can help to put you in touch."
</p>
<p>
Bithell concluded by noting the news will not affect the availability of the studio's existing self-published games, nor will it impact any ongoing support for those titles. "We are incredibly grateful for our audience," he added, "and hope that your interest in our work follows individual team members as they head into other roles."
</p>
<p>
"Bethel Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less."
</p>
<p>
Layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">continue to blight the games industry</a>, with <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">tens of thousands of workers</a> - across both major publishers and smaller studios - having lost their jobs in the last few years. In July alone, Microsoft laid off more than 9,000 employees, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">significantly impacting staff and studios across its Xbox division</a>, and that was followed by job cuts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-goes-independent-to-continue-focus-on-original-projects">Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassive-games-delays-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020-following-layoffs">The Dark Pictures Anthology studio Supermassive Games</a>.

Leadbetter stated that IGN offered to sell back its shares to him—a welcome message given that he'd been looking to buy them back for "many years." The purchase was assisted by investment from Gamer Network founder Rupert Loman.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"All aspects of Digital Foundry going forward are actually decided by us, the team, which is something we've never really managed to have before," said Leadbetter.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/let%E2%80%99s-remember-some-good-video-game-boats.1265796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What began as Aftermath’s unofficial Boat Day has evolved into Aftermath’s unofficial Boat Week. With Riley freshly off a boat and me in the general proximity of many, we figured it’s finally time to fulfill one of the site’s original purposes: to serve as a repository for Riley’s countless stories from his various times at sea. Also, secondarily, to talk about video games.</p><p>On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, Riley and I are joined by Chris “Peg Leg” Person to discuss boats, boating, and a flotilla of related matters. First we talk about Riley’s recent voyage, which involved <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading<em> Moby Dick</em> as quickly as possible while on a boat</a>. Why? Riley enjoys punishing himself, I guess. Then Riley regales us with tales of the time he lived on a boat during his youth, up to and including his convoluted waste disposal process.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to a boat-related news item at the opposite end of the wealth spectrum: Gabe Newell, billionaire co-founder of Valve, recently <a href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased a yacht company</a>. Why are rich people so obsessed with big boats? Listen to find out. Lastly, we list the best boats in video games, including the GOAT boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy a boat and go bow-to-bow with Gabe Newell’s yacht armada – or at least start a band and call it Gabe Newell’s Yacht Armada.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Riley, given that you’ve lived on a boat and you have this fascination with them, do you generally enjoy boats in games, or are you kinda whatever about them?</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I’m trying to think of games with good boats. I was actually just thinking about the game <em>Dredge</em>, which I bought forever ago and haven’t played. I should finally play that game.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong><em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em> is a pretty good one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Oh yeah, I met the kid at Mystic Seaport who performs sea shanties and gives little presentations – “songs of land and sea” – and I was talking to them, and I asked them “Oh my gosh, did the sea shanty trend reinvent your career?” And they were like “No! But thanks to the soundtrack of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, little kids are always asking me to play these incredibly obscure songs, and I’m like ‘How on Earth do you know about this deep cut sea shanty?’”&nbsp;</p><p>Then this other kid there who also did sea shanties started praising and praising the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> soundtracks, and then I told them I was a games journalist, and they were like “Oh wow.” I was telling them about the whole <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft split up</a> thing, and they were like “That sucks.” But anyway yeah, apparently <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is reinventing interest in sea shanties. Screw you, TikTok.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Alright so, other good video game boats. I put together a list. I’m gonna just take it from the top: The boat in <em>Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em>. Do we think it’s a good boat or a bad boat, because obviously it’s also a character. But as a boat, as a craft, what do we think?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s pretty agile given its circumstances. The problem with that isn’t the boat; the problem is that the Triforce quest near the end sucks, if I remember correctly. It’s not that the traversal was bad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think also that for all the openness <em>Wind Waker</em> brought to the table relative to other games at the time, the exploration was underdeveloped.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, it was pretty sparse.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think the promise of that game was greater than what it delivered, at least in the sailing and exploring department. Still a great game!</p><p>Next boat: <em>Sid Meier’s Pirates</em>. Probably my favorite boat-based game. I love <em>Sid Meier’s Pirates</em>.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> My sister and I had a pirate game as kids that I keep trying to hunt down, and I’m 90 percent sure that’s the one it was. But you know when you’re trying to find a game from your childhood and you just type words to look at pictures, and you’re like “At some point this picture will emotionally resonate with me, and I’ll be like ‘That was the game’?”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> When I was looking up games for this list, I scrolled past some screenshots of <em>Pirates</em>, and it had that effect that some older games have on you where you’re like “Man, my brain up-rezzed that game so much.” Now I see actual screenshots, and it looks… not bad, but very quaint. The boats are far less realistic-looking than I remember them being.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong><em>Sea Of Thieves</em> is probably the best boat game, generally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, that seems to be the consensus pick.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> For as cartoonish as it is, people are like “Yeah, but it does feel like you’re on a boat.” The boat stuff is really good, and it does have those moments of panic where you have the bucket, you’re shit’s sinking, and you have to plug it up. That always feels very nice.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s also about the boat a lot of the time. It’s about sailing, which a lot of these games aren’t – or they partially are, but they don’t consider the boat to be a physical object or space. They think of it as a vehicle, as opposed to a thing with its own needs and its own unique characteristics. That makes <em>Sea Of Thieves</em> really cool.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> And people will fuck up your boat. They aggressively love fucking up your boat.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong><em>Sea Of Thieves</em> I think is one of those games that’s become sort of a fixture, albeit in its own niche, and as a result does not get the credit it deserves – especially because it came out in a way where it wasn’t fully baked yet. It was a little bit sparse as a game. It didn’t review super well. But it has been improved tremendously over the years and still has an active community. It’s a really cool thing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon"><h3>Good For Digital Foundry</h3></a><p>'We answer to nobody but you, the audience'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/pc-desk-floor"><h3>Wait, Are We Not All Keeping Our PCs On Top Of Our Desks</h3></a><p>Why would you put one of the most expensive things you own on the floor where your feet go</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.

              <p>Big news, everyone! Capcom has heard all your pleading and begging and has finally announced a brand new <a href="https://kotaku.com/exoprimal-dino-crisis-reboot-sequel-dinosaur-shooter-ca-1849066060"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>…merchandise lottery event. Wait, is that not what all you fans have been clamoring for over the last 20 years? Oh…well, uh, this is almost as good as a new game, right?</p> <p>On August 8, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-official-dino-crisis-merchandises-revealed-by-capcom-japan.1265337/">as first spotted by ResetEra users</a>, Capcom announced a new merch event themed around its classic survival horror series, <em>Dino Crisis.</em> The event runs from now until September 12 and features a variety of <a href="https://capcom-capkujionline.com/lp/DINO_CRISIS/">new <em>Dino Crisis</em> merchandise</a>, including desk mats, sweaters, keychains, and stickers. You can’t just buy this stuff directly, though. Instead, Capcom is operating this merch event like a raffle or lottery. Each <em>Dino Crisis</em> item in the event has a rarity scale. For example, the sweater has a 1-in-100 chance of shipping. You can purchase one or more “tickets” for 880 Yen (about $6 USD) and then Capcom ships out however many items you ordered, and you hope you got lucky enough to get some of the rarer ones, like the desk mat, which has a 3-in-100 chance of arriving at your doorstep.</p> <figure><figcaption>Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p>This new merch sale is the latest example of Capcom remembering <em>Dino Crisis,</em> but not actually announcing a new game or even teasing a hypothetical remake or fancy remaster. In 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768">Capcom asked fans what dormant franchises they would like revived</a>. One of the options was <em>Dino Crisis</em>, and the internet screamed loudly, “That one please!” That same year, <em>Dino Crisis</em> arrived on GOG with a few appreciated improvements. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-siren-ps2-horror-ps-plus-games-october-2024-1851669030">It was also released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4</a> as part of Sony’s PS Plus Premium retro library, complete with new trophies. And now we have this new merch sale.</p> <p>So it’s clear Capcom remembers that it owns<em> Dino Crisis.</em> That’s an important first step toward getting a new game or sequel. Of course, when or if that will ever happen remains to be seen. But at least you can (sort of) buy a cool <em>Dino Crisis</em> sweater right now? That’s neat.</p>

            <p>If I went to hell, I can't imagine the first thing on my mind would be trying to pull off a bank job with a crew of fellow damned souls. However, in freshly announced tactical RPG Thousand Hells: The Underworld Heists, that's the sort thing you'll be doing, with plenty of choice and consequence if things go pear-shaped.</p>
<p>Thousand Hells is the latest cool thing from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/six-ages">Six Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King of Dragon Pass</a> devs A Sharp. While they're working with Kitfox Games as publisher again, there's plenty of different stuff going on, including a move away from world of Glorantha as a setting. That's in favour of fantasy pastures new, inspired by myths of the ancient proto-Indo-European, Norse, and Mesopotamian varieties. Oh, and a dash of Hieronymus Bosch's lovely paintings.

<p>"I’d like to push procedural storytelling in a new direction, both in how the quests are generated and with the narrative game that lets you use your team’s traits to resolve situations by making story choices, not just dice rolls," A Sharp founder David Dunham said of the game. "And it’s fun to see the system that Robin Laws and I designed put to use by other writers."</p>
<p>Thousand Hells revolves around four heroes making the toasty jaunt to hell, each of these folks being "procedurally generated with fears, desires and personalities". Once there, your job is to pull together a team with different skills and a set of temperaments that won't result in blowups midway through the "trials of the underworlds" you'll be trying to overcome. There's a "mysterious ambassador" you're contracted to do it all for, which doesn't sound ominous whatsoever.</p>

<p>The stakes, if it wasn't clear, are high. "Use the strengths of your party in over 200 unique dynamic narrative encounters," reads the game's blurb. "Skills will change depending on your team’s successes and failures. Avoid combat by sending your bard to calm the nerves of bandits. Hire a demonologist to communicate with a possessed book. Take the risk and reap the rewards, otherwise you’ll end up with a broken arm, or worse."</p>
<p>Sounds like a game that might be my cup of tea, provided I can still hold said cup of tea after I've had these things my hands are attached to violently wrenched out of place and put in casts. In all seriousness, any game that has four different types of mastermind and art as surreally majestic as this is well worth a look.</p>
