            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>I’m starting to feel nervous about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>Let me explain. During the most recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct</a>, the long-gestating game finally received a release date for <strong>4th December 2025</strong> on Switch and Switch 2. That’s not all, though; the accompanying trailer also revealed that Samus would now be rocking her very own <strong>Akira</strong>-inspired motorbike called Vi-O-La.</p>
<p>After a handful of environmental shots to set the mood, the trailer showcased a series of close-ups of Samus revving up Vi-O-La before storming off into a vast desert landscape at speeds that would make Captain Falcon break out his best <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/miyagi-PudZiAbQDUEik">Mr. Miyagi nod of approval</a>.</p>

<p>I couldn’t quite gather my thoughts when I watched the trailer for the first time, but after a second viewing, a comparison entered my mind that I’ve not been able to shake ever since: Metroid Prime 4 reminds me of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/gears_5">Gears 5</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I know the two games probably aren’t even remotely comparable on the surface, but Gears 5 actually delivered fans their own sense of whiplash when it delivered its take on the open world back in 2019 (which came, curiously, mere months after development on Metroid Prime 4 was completely restarted under Retro Studios).</p>
<p>Following a fairly linear prologue sequence, Gears 5 revamps the series' structure by offering up a vast open space that can be traversed via a wind-powered vehicle called 'The Skiff'. Essentially, key locations are be scattered throughout the world and you have to hop in your Skiff to make your way from one to the other.</p>

<p>So it wasn't an open world in the sense that, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3</a> is. Yes, you can "go anywhere", as the saying goes, but it was more or less a means of reaching your intended destination, with little in between. These destinations then provide the 'traditional' Gears of War experience that fans are accustomed to. Nevertheless, it gave the game a real sense of scale, far more so than any of the previous entries, and I appreciated it for that.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Gears 5 is <em>not</em> Metroid Prime 4. The latter is the next mainline entry in a series that, in both 2D and 3D, has famously focused on dense, interconnected environments that can be wholly explored on foot (with the odd elevator here and there, of course) – this, along with a similar approach in <strong>Castlevania</strong>, led to the coining of the term 'Metroidvania'. The minor exception here is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3</a> which featured multiple planets, but the sequences in which Samus would travel from one to the other was essentially just an elaborate elevator cutscene.</p>
<p>So while open spaces worked in Gears 5, I'm not sure yet if the same can be said for Metroid Prime 4. It’s still early days of course (yes, even after eight years of waiting), but the short gameplay segment in the recent trailer did enough to convince me that Retro's latest effort is taking more than a few cues from Gears 5. You can see key locations off in the distance, but bar a few pesky enemies, the more immediate surroundings look pretty barren.</p>
<figure><a title="Prime 4 / Gears 5 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e5808101e1fb/prime-4-gears-5-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I really want Metroid Prime 4 to try something new; it’s been eighteen years since the last mainline Prime game, so I’m not going to be satisfied with “more of the same” in this instance. But I also don’t want Metroid to lose what makes it, well… <em>Metroid</em>. What a conundrum. We’ve only got about two-and-a-half months to go until its release, so hopefully Nintendo will share a bit more information in that time and assuage my fears.</p>
<p>At the very least, we know the company is able to pull off some pretty amazing open worlds with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>; my guess is they won't let Retro Studios deliver anything less than spectacular. Here's hoping, anyway.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/survios-debuts-new-alien-rogue-incursion-%E2%80%93-part-one-evolved-edition-launch-trailer-adds-xbox-series-x-s-version.1299420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One was first released by developer Survios towards the end of 2024 on PlayStation VR2 and PCVR, before arriving on Meta Quest in February 2025. Now, it's making the jump out of VR headsets, with its new <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-announced-no-vr-headset-needed/">Evolved Edition</a> version arriving on PC, PlayStation 5, and, as was just announced, Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>The Evolved Edition will arrive on all three platforms at the end of the month on September 30, 2025, and ahead of that release, Survios has debuted a new launch trailer showing off more gameplay of the new version and announcing its Xbox release.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5, Xbox, &amp; PC Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TF79l6It5fo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As we near the Evolved Edition's release, we get closer to the one-year mark of Part One's initial launch, with no word on how Part Two is coming along. Interestingly, players who were there for Part One right at launch didn't even know it was the first of two parts. Survios only broke the news when the game launched, claiming it was always the plan to tell Alien: Rogue Incursion's story in two parts.</p>



<p>Survios also <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-evolved-edition-gameplay-release-date-ps5-pc/">confirmed to Wccftech earlier this year</a> that, while those players who expected to get a game that was part one-of-one when they bought it in December 2024 wait for Part Two, if they want to try out the Evolved Edition to enjoy the experience again without the hassle of the headset, they'll have to purchase the game again. At the time of this writing, if you bought the VR version, you don't get the Evolved Edition as a free update, nor is there a discounted upgrade path. You'll just have to grab it again at $39.99.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate, but hopefully, whenever Part Two rolls around, the flat-screen version and VR version are released as a package, so there's no need for these multiple iterations.  </p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> died <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-protocols-western-release-has-been-cancelled-and-its-japanese-servers-will-shut-down-early-next-year">last year</a>? And remember how it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance">brought back to life only a few months later</a> as Blue Protocol: Star Resonance? It's not often that such a turnaround happens, so you have to count your blessings when they do. And now, almost a year on from that, following a recent beta test, this retitled version of the game has a release date.
</p>
<p>
It's not very far away either, having been scheduled for an October 9th launch. This announcement came with a beta test recap music video, which feels like a first of some kind, and possibly for good reason. The music video features the game's official English theme song, "Starlight Over Asterleeds~星々が輝く場所~," and it's got a strange energy to it, like it came from an anime that was incredibly popular in 2013 due to a perfect set of circumstances, but has had zero longevity because of a severe like of substance. A bit mean perhaps, it's just when your lyrics include the lines "We won't back down!" and "The stars are singing with our soul," you might want to think about a rewrite.

<p>
If you have zero clue about what Blue Protocol is, or just forget after it was initially cancelled, it is an MMORPG in a self-described "anime-styled fantasy world." Taking a look at the gameplay, to be honest it mostly looks like if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> were an MMO. That's fine, that'll be somebody's something! The issue I'm facing is that outside of the game making it very clear you get to make your very own anime hero, it's not very clear what you'll be doing.
</p><p>
Yes, there'll be raids, sure, there'll be social features, but details on the actual world and story are pretty scant. Perhaps that really is secondary to being a fantasy anime character, though to be quite honest, you're pretty spoiled for choice on that front these days. At the very least, I'll be curious to see how it's received, especially in light of its death and rebirth.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Borderlands 4 is out in the wild, and while it's enjoyed some <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">commercial</a> success right at launch, its launch has also been a bit of a mess with technical issues galore. That's unfortunately not uncommon for major triple-A releases, but what hasn't been improving the situation is how Gearbox boss, Randy Pitchford, has been responding to it.</p>



<p>Pitchford has a history of making comments online to players that don't always go over so well, and we don't have to turn the clock back too far to remember the last time his comments caused a stir with Borderlands 4. Last time, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">about the game's price</a>. This time, he's telling <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">"<em>4K stubborn</em>"</a> players that it's actually their fault that the game his studio released isn't running very well.</p>



<p>Most studios, when they launch a big game that has technical issues, put their heads down and get on with fixing it, and that's what Gearbox is doing, but most studios also don't have to deal with their boss going online and making players even more upset about the whole situation. It's not what anyone on the Gearbox team had in mind for launch, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-feels-bad-for-borderlands-4-devs-who-are-just-trying-really-hard-to-make-players-happy-as-randy-pitchford-fights-back-against-performance-criticism/">Gamesradar</a>, it has Baldur's Gate 3's publishing director, Michael Douse, feeling bad for the rest of the team trying to get the game fixed, and ensure that players have the best experience possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Just lock Randy in a cupboard for 6 months,</em>" Douse commented on X (formerly Twitter). When some responded that Pitchford is better off not being cut off, and that they prefer his honesty over an corporate-approved message, Douse agreed, but clarified, "<em>I feel bad for his teams who are just trying really hard to make players happy</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the one hand, Pitchford's brand of unmitigated honesty stands out because it's not what you hear from almost anyone else in the industry. Game development is hard, and Pitchford telling players to do it themselves if they think it's so easy isn't exactly an unfair response. Even the biggest studio with the biggest team is going to miss major and minor technical problems. It's not easy work, and players are often too quick to forget that.</p>



<p>But it's not like Borderlands 4 just has a few frame rate problems, and players are spending their hard-earned money on a game that should at least run without crashing. It's getting fixed, and that's great, but that doesn't take the sting away from knowing you've spent money on something broken. Though, as Pitchford has told players who have an issue with it, they can "<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510"><em>Please get a refund from Steam</em>"</a> if they want.</p>

                <p>A movie based on EA's The Sims is in the works, with Oscar-winner Margot Robbie's production company, LuckyChap, attached. Prolific Hollywood producer Roy Lee is involved as well, and now he's shared some further insight into what fans can expect from the video game movie.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-lego-movie" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, Lee said he expects the movie to be "unique." He said it's similar to The Lego Movie, in that when it was announced, people wondered how it would translate to the big screen. People didn't understand until they saw it, Lee said, and a similar thing could happen for The Sims movie.</p><p>Lee produced The Lego Movie as well, along with Robbie's blockbuster hit Barbie. "[Audiences] were probably wondering, 'What could a Barbie movie be?' Somewhere in between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be," he said.</p><p>There is no word yet on who may star in The Sims 4 movie. Some may recall that plans were first unveiled to make a Sims movie back in 2007 at Fox, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/may/28/sim-ply-unfilmable-inside-the-sims-movie-that-never-was" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it didn't come together for a variety of reasons.</a></p><p>The Sims movie is in production for Amazon MGM Studios, with Kate Herron (Loki) attached to direct and co-write with Briony Redman (Doctor Who).

<figure><a title="MvC: Fighting Collection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/943fe902c6a0b/mvc-fighting-collection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> has sold a total of 1 million copies since its launch in September 2024 (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collections-impressive-sales-show-fans-are-hungry-for-more">Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>Announced via social media, the translated post reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection global sales surpass 1 million copies!</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you, we have achieved global sales of 1 million copies!</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued support for this title!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's an impressive result for Capcom, but it seems almost guaranteed that we won't get a brand new entry in the series – at least not any time soon.</p>
<p>The reason for this, of course, is that Marvel is now collaborating with Sony on the new PS5 / PC title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, with acclaimed developer Arc System Works (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>) at the helm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6ePAJ6dxYWY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea9hzlomt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePAJ6dxYWY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's not out of the question that we might see a new MvC in the future, but with Marvel Tōkon launching in 2026, we reckon Capcom might be more inclined to create a new entry in the Capcom vs. SNK series.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a> director Hideaki Itsuno recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/capcom-vs-snk-2-director-really-wants-to-make-a-third-entry">stated his desire to make a third game</a>, and said he would do so if Capcom and SNK licensed it to his new studio, Lightspeed Japan Studio.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update-adds-new-dualsense-pairing-option-power-saver-mode.1299312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> system software update is set to go live in a few hours, introducing features that beta testers have been able to try out for a few months.</p>



<p>As confirmed today, the next big system software update will roll out tomorrow, September 17. Once the update is live, the system will download it automatically. If not, the download and installation process can be started manually by going into the Settings menu, then picking System, System Software, System Software Update, and Settings.</p>



<p>The biggest additions of the upcoming new PlayStation 5 system software update are Power Saver mode and a new DualSense pairing option that allows users to pair the controller with multiple devices. Power Saver mode, which can be enabled via the Settings, System, Power Saving, and Use Power Saver menu options, will be further supported down the line with updates to already available games such as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Demon's Souls, while the soon-to-be-released Ghost of Yotei will support it at launch. This rather interesting reveal seems to support the idea that this new <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver profile is targeting the specifications of the rumored PlayStation handheld system</a> that is supposedly releasing alongside the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>While Power Saver mode is an option that few are likely to use for the time being, the new PlayStation 5 system software update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-beta-program-ps5-pro-dualsense-pairing-update/">DualSense pairing option</a> is surely going to see wider usage, especially for those who use the controller on PC. Once the update is live, it will be possible to register up to four devices simultaneously and switch between them directly from the controller.</p>



<p>More information on the next PlayStation 5 system software update rolling out tomorrow can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">Official PlayStation Blog.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wreckreation Release Date Puts the Car in Carnage Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckreation-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckreation-release-date-puts-the-car-in-carnage-next-month.1299309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Three Fields Entertainment have announced the release date for vehicular destruction sandbox&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>, and it's causing some serious car-nage next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will land on PC and current-gen consoles (but no Nintendo Switch 2, unfortunately) on October 28th. It'll let you - and, optionally, your friends - loose in MixWorld, a "400 square kilometer racing realm that is yours to create, shape - and wreck".</p>

<p>As the title suggests,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is built mainly around its core arcade racing loop, which combines high-speed racing and driving with&nbsp;<em>Burnout</em>-style crashes and stunts. If you're still waiting for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>to come out of Early Access</a>, this one should do more than just tide you over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=izuzCDGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=1HDUGAN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>brings vehicular chaos in October.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's main attraction, however, is the aforementioned MixWorld, where you can place whatever crazy loops, ramps, and pipes your brain can conjure, before tasking your friends to take on your impossible gauntlet.</p>

<p>As THQ Nordic and Three Fields say,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>'s MixWorld will offer you the chance to "build roads on and off-road", as well as "out to sea or up in the sky", so if you love to spend hours with&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>&nbsp;players' racing creations,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is for you.</p>

<p>You can also customize your vehicle, as well as the gameplay challenges you're asking players to complete. Even time of day, weather conditions, and whether there's any traffic on the road can be customized and controlled.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will play like (as well as seeing some pretty gnarly crashes), then you can check out the game's release date announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594040/Wreckreation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005975/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wreckreation/9n0llb6pg0r4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 28th. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things THQ Nordic-related.</p>

              <p><span>Blizzard finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-skins-crossover-mercy-genji-joker-2000625739"><span>unveiled the five </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>collaboration skins</span></a><span> it’s bringing to </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> yesterday, and as </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans tend to do, they had a pretty wide spread of reactions. When you have 44 heroes, it’s impossible to spread love across them equally, and it can get pretty irritating if your favorite never seems to get any love in the form of skins and other cosmetics. It’s especially grating when </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>seems to favor a specific handful of characters with each event or collaboration. While support hero Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>the face of this issue</span></a><span>, wasn’t included in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>skins, the collaboration still hasn’t gone over well with some fans who feel that heroes like Genji and Mercy are getting preferential treatment, or are disappointed that some seemingly obvious crossovers didn’t manifest.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">drew junkrat skull and dva oracle earlier cause I'm hyped for the collab hehe ⚡<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OverwatchFanart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OverwatchFanart</a>​ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Persona5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Persona5</a>​ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a> <a href="https://t.co/6XOAOfgPgl">pic.twitter.com/6XOAOfgPgl</a></p> <p>— Souda (@lemonsoudaa) <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonsoudaa/status/1967625308129112547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Surprisingly, the most contentious skin in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>event seems to be Genji as Ryuji. Genji makes a lot of sense for the collaboration, given that he’s one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s Japanese heroes, and his katana would make him a pretty natural fit for someone like Yusuke, who also uses a sword in the RPGs. Ryuji, however, is a bit of an odd pick. The track star is the tank of </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s team, and uses blunt melee weapons in fights, such as bats and pipes. When Genji wears the skin based on the Phantom Thief, his katana is replaced by Ryuji’s base lead pipe, which, yeah, I mean, that’s a melee weapon, I guess, but you don’t slash people with a pipe the same way Genji does when he uses his katana in his ultimate attack.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The choice is even more questionable considering that some fans feel Junkrat, the grenade-launching DPS hero and often forgotten member of the original roster, would have made a better fit, and had been speculating and hoping that he would get the Ryuji treatment. He has Ryuji’s blonde hair, the two have both suffered leg injuries that leave them with a distinct limp, and Ryuji is often a goofy comic relief character whose mannerisms would have worked well in a Junkrat highlight intro.</span></p>

D.Va pilots a mech because she was a pro gamer who uses her transferable skills to defend South Korea, so the comparisons are pretty apparent, especially because Futaba also pilots her own Persona like a mech.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nioh-3-is-changing-the-game-with-ninja-style-and-the-distinctive-mist-system-ign-first</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-nioh-3-is-changing-the-game-with-ninja-style-and-the-distinctive-mist-system-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1299291/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the charms of the Warring States Soulslike series Nioh is its plethora of playstyles. So far in the series, we've seen weapons including swords that ooze Samurai Style, ninja-like sickle and chains, and even unusual choices like tonfa. Each weapon also has high, medium and low stances that players switch between in order to best face an enemy, all working together to create the sort of action that the series is known for. Add a variety of skills on top and you get a wide range of RPG builds that act as one of the draws for the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nioh 3, the long-awaited return to the series, features a more advanced combat system composed of Samurai Style, whose combat is similar to what we expect from a Nioh game, as well as Ninja Style, which lets players fight with swift movements. Players can switch between the two with a single button, and doing so causes your weapons, armor and even usable skills to change, giving you the feeling of using two builds at the same time. It quite literally doubles the game's charm as both an action title and an RPG.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Style even changes how your character looks as you ninja run and more. During character creation, you create looks for both Samurai and Ninja Styles.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ninja Style even changes how your character looks as you ninja run and more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While we've fought as a samurai until now in the Nioh series, it has been possible to use a ninja-like combat style. So why fully split gameplay into these two styles in the newest title? When we ask Nioh 3 General Producer Fumihiko Yasuda about why they added Ninja Style, he explains, "We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continues, "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer. That's why we've added this style."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a kind of new action meant to feel like a step forward, Ninja Style really does play and look quite different from Samurai Style. Samurai Style consists of the kind of steady, block-focused combat we've come to expect from the Nioh series. When in it, you can change between weapon stances as you always have, and you can use Ki Pulse after attacking, a stamina recovery technique the series is known for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pressing a button after attacking while in Ninja Style will allow you to use Mist, creating a clone as you move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, Ninja Style involves quick, evasion-focused combat. Weapon stances don't exist in this style, but ninjutsu are available to use in their place. Ki Pulse also becomes replaced with a new action, Mist.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mist creates a clone after attacking as you move quickly, allowing you to get behind an enemy (where your attacks deal more damage). Though this Mist action does allow for a swift and stylish form of combat, some people do seem disappointed that it takes away their ability to use Ki Pulse as they always could. Using it becomes second nature to an experienced Nioh player, likely in part because it also links to dispelling special zones created by enemies known as yokai realms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why make it so that Ki Pulse is only available in Samurai Style? According to producer Kohei Shibata, this was done to clearly distinguish between the feeling of being a samurai versus a ninja through these styles. Ki Pulse is known as Zanshin in Japanese, a term related to kendo and swordsmanship that refers to a state of mind that prevents one from being open to an attack after striking. Shibata says that the way this manifests in-game, where you carefully manage your ki as you fight, is its way of incorporating a samurai's style of fighting that draws on both stillness and motion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A black aura will sometimes appear on the ground while fighting an enemy. This is a yokai realm, an area that will reduce your Ki recovery speed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Giving Ninja Style Ki Pulse as well resulted in an issue where the tempo of its combat resembled Samurai Style,” says Shibata. “For ninja, we wanted players to use Mist, an action that makes use of the style's mobility, when they would normally use Ki Pulse. The stance system also comes from sword kata, or forms, and it seemed wrong to apply that to ninja. That's why the same button activates both Mist and Ki Pulse. We wanted to create distinct styles of movement and combat, and that's why we made the decision to not give ninja Ki Pulse." </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"There is a skill that allows you to dispel yokai realms by using Mist in Ninja Style."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shibata adds, "There is a skill that allows you to dispel yokai realms by using Mist in Ninja Style." So while players won't be able to dispel them at first with Ninja Style, it will become possible as you progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also ask Yasuda why the decision was made to limit Ki Pulse to Samurai Style. He replies, "Though Ki Pulse is a trademark mechanic in the Nioh series, we couldn't simply reuse it. We needed something ninja-like that would stand out. Part of why Ninja Style has the Mist action is because Samurai Style has Ki Pulse. The style didn't have Mist at first, but it was created in order to give it a play style just as distinctive as Ki Pulse."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/n1-1757980540586.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While the original name for Ki Pulse comes from a kendo term, Mist, or Kasumi in Japanese, is meant to bring to mind the speed and cloning abilities of a ninja. "I promise we didn't take it from Dead or Alive's Kasumi," Yasuda said with a laugh, referring to the name of a ninja character from the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Dead or Alive references would be a bit too much to expect in Nioh 3, Ninja Gaiden 4 is in development. Could we see some elements from that series in the game? We ask Yasuda if we'll be able to use Ninja Gaiden-like techniques such as Izuna Drop. He responds promisingly, saying that "We'll look into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy." That said, it could be possible that such techniques or abilities are different from what we've seen in Ninja Gaiden.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/n2-1757980620187.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"There have already been Ninja Gaiden references in the Nioh series, such as in DLC,” says Yasuda. “This time we've gone so far as to add Ninja Style, and I think that players will be excited to see some of its elements given that Ninja Gaiden 4 is on the horizon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We expect these to be more like Easter eggs, so there's no telling if we'll be getting any major news announcements in the future about Ninja Gaiden elements in the game. They may even be put into the final game as surprises, so we're looking forward to checking the final game with a fine-tooth comb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look out for more exclusive Nioh 3 coverage during this month's IGN First, including our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-exclusive-takeda-shingen-boss-reveal-gameplay-ign-first">exclusive boss battle</a> featuring the Tiger of Kai, Takeda Shingen! </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Yuichi Shigeta is a freelance writer for IGN Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has confirmed the Xbox Game Pass September 2025 Wave 1 lineup of titles, which is headlined by beloved indie game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades">Hades</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, available today, is Roadcraft, where you operate a fleet of authentic construction vehicles to restore roads and repair bridges. It's available on Xbox Game Pass Standard and Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomorrow, September 17, brings a flurry of titles to Xbox Game Pass Standard subscribers, which Ultimate owners will already have access to. These include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (the one from 2023, not 2011), roguelite tabletop-style role-player For the King 2, and the Game Preview version of city builder Overthrown.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also available tomorrow, September 17, is Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, a single-player survival shooter spin-off. It's available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a day later, September 18 brings the Xbox Series X/S version of Frostpunk 2 to Game Pass Ultimate, after its previous release on PC. This post-apocalyptic snow-ridden survival game is perfect for the chillier and, frankly, more depressing months. It's twinned with open-world physics sandbox Wobbly Life, which arrives for PC and Xbox Series X/S on the same day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month's main attraction, Hades, turns up at the end of this week on September 19. Hades will likely need little introduction, though if you're yet to play this godly roguelike, the game's upcoming fifth anniversary will see it join Xbox Game Pass across Standard, PC and Ultimate tiers.

                <p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has announced that the game will leave early access and launch its 1.0 version in 2026. Additionally, the studio teased that while the bulk of the team is working on updates, improvements, and more content for Palworld, the company also has smaller teams at work on new games.</p><h2><strong>Cleanup</strong></h2><p>Palworld 1.0 isn't launching sooner because Pocketpair is spending time now working on "cleanup" for the existing game.</p><p>"Beyond just adding new content, there is a lot of clean up that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game," the developer said. "We think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>📢About Palworld Ver. 1.0</p><p>Hello everyone.<br>Palworld will officially release (Ver. 1.0) in 2026.</p><p>We are currently developing a massive amount of content for this milestone, and also planning some surprises for the rest of 2025.</p><p>Please watch the video below for more details: <a href="https://t.co/rpP5gmLtjs" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/rpP5gmLtjs</a></p></div>  — Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1967755319418724713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Pocketpair will remain mostly quiet for the remainder of 2025 as these efforts are underway, the studio said, while also cautioning fans that the Winter 2025 update won't be as big as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-palworld-update-feybreak-is-arriving-on-december-23/1100-6528456/" data-ref-id="1100-6528456">Feybreak update in December 2024.</a></p><p>The studio went on to say that it has a "few surprises" planned for the Winter 2025 update for Palworld and that people should know that Pocketpair is "not slowing down or scaling back--quite the opposite."</p><h2><strong>Palworld 1.0</strong></h2><p>For the 1.0 release of Palworld, Pocketpair said fans can expect a "truly massive amount of content," and it's going to take time to get it all ready for release.</p><p>"Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end," the developer said, adding that it will reveal sneak peeks at some of the 1.0 content relatively soon.</p><p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20current%20state,closer%20to%20the%20official%20release.%E2%80%9D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Palworld Steam early access FAQ</a> states that the price of the game might increase before 1.0. Right now, Palworld is discounted from $30 to $22.50, a deal that runs through September 22.</p><h2>New games</h2><p>Pocketpair's biggest and best-known game is, of course, Palworld, and the company plans to continue to grow and evolve the game over time. Simultaneously, the studio is plotting what may come next.</p><p>"As the company grows, we continue to experiment with other ideas for games," the developer said. There are "several smaller teams" inside Pocketpair working on new game ideas that "hopefully" turn into read products, the developer said, adding that more information about these efforts will come soon.</p><p>This is separate from Pocketpair's new Pocketpair Publishing division that seeks to help fund and market games from other studios.</p><h2><strong>Palworld history</strong></h2><p>Palworld launched in January 2024 for Xbox and PC, quickly becoming a massive hit, thanks in part to its inclusion with Xbox Game Pass. The game was a fast success, reaching millions of sales and installs, but the launch was marred with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-plagiarism-accusations-palworld-ceo-asks-people-to-stop-harassing-devs/1100-6520522/" data-ref-id="1100-6520522">controversy over plagiarism claims and other concerns.</a> The game bears a striking resemblance to Pokemon, and The Pokemon Company and Nintendo teamed up to sue Pocketpair, not for copyright infringement as some expected, but rather patent infringement claims.</p><p>Pocketpair subsequently made big changes to Palworld, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">removing Pal Spheres</a>--monster-catching items that were very similar to Poke Balls--and the ability to glide with a Pal. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">Speaking about the ongoing lawsuit</a> earlier this year, community manager John Buckley said it was a "very depressing day" for the studio when it got sued.</p><p>Palworld later launched on PS5 in September 2024 and came to Mac in March 2025. Pocketpair would also go on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">partner with Sony for Palworld merch.</a></p>

                <p>KPop Demon Hunters, the hit animated film from Sony Pictures, is reportedly making its way into Fortnite, according to well-known leakers SpushFNBR and Loolo. The film, which combines KPop stardom with supernatural action, follows a fictional girl group called Huntr/x--idols by day, demon slayers by night. With songs performed by real-world KPop artists, the movie quickly became a cultural phenomenon, dominating music charts and becoming the most-watched original film in Netflix history.</p><p>While Epic Games has yet to confirm the crossover, the most likely additions to the game could be new dance emotes based on the film's choreographed musical numbers. Maybe even throw in some of The Saja Boys' Soda Pop routine, as it went viral over the summer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568922" data-ratio="0.41875" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568922"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Netflix</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg"></figure><p>Character skins based on the three members of Huntr/x are also a strong possibility. In the film, Rumi, Zoey, and Mira all have distinctive fashion and stylized weapons. Fortnite could easily include their fits from the introductory number "Done, Done, Done" to their more detailed outfits like they had in "Golden" (see above).</p><p>This potential collaboration would add KPop Demon Hunters to Fortnite's growing list of music-related crossovers. Previous collaborations have included in-game concerts and cosmetics featuring artists like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sabrina-carpenter-is-inspiring-fortnite-players-to-dance-not-fight/1100-6530729/" data-ref-id="1100-6530729">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, Ariana Grande, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-will-exclusively-debut-the-weeknds-new-popular-music-video/1100-6521121/" data-ref-id="1100-6521121">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bts-concert-kicks-off-in-fortnite-tonight/1100-6482420/" data-ref-id="1100-6482420">KPop group BTS</a>. Given the global success of the film and the ongoing popularity of KPop--and the mega success of the movie--this crossover could become one of Fortnite's most popular music-themed events yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Pocketpair has announced that its hit creature-catching open-world survival game,<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/02/22/what-is-palworld-the-new-pokemon-with-guns-survival-game-everyones-playing" target="_blank">&nbsp;Palworld,&nbsp;</a>is finally launching out of Early Access and into version 1.0 in 2026. Palworld has been available in Early Access since January 2024, and centers on catching Pokémon-esque critters called Pals, which you can equip with guns to battle other monsters while aiding players in farming and crafting.&nbsp;</p><p>In a developer update video, Pocketpair promises that a “massive amount of content” is being planned for the 1.0 update. However, the studio also acknowledges it wants to clean up Palworld’s remaining technical bugs before it hits 1.0. &nbsp;</p><p>As such, the studio says the rest of 2025 will be “a little quiet from us” as it focuses on preparing the game for its full launch. Because cleaning up the game will be its primary focus, Pocketpair says its Winter update won’t be as big as last year’s Feybreak Island was, but stresses development will not slow down or scale back when it launches in full.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVIBHP37eM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVIBHP37eM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The 1.0 announcement comes amidst an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-sue-palworld-developer-pocketpair">ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo</a>, which began last September. The lawsuit, filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, accuses Pocketpair of infringing on several patent rights.</p><p>Pocketpair publicly shared three specific patents from the lawsuit on its <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">website</a>, revealing they were registered after Palworld’s EA launch and were likely done to target the game specifically. These patents cover systems for capturing characters in a virtual space, an aiming system for deploying capture items, and rideable characters. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company seek payments of 5 million yen (plus late payment damages) each. Pocketpair stated it aimed to “assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p>

Build A Rocket Boy's game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">launched to major criticism due to its glitches and bugs</a>, not to mention shallow gameplay. Yet with his face on the game's cover art, Hernandez is intrinsically linked to the game.
</p>
<p>
"It's a difficult thing to spend two-and-a-half years on a project that you’re really proud of and you're proud of your contribution to it," said Hernandez on the latest <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/mindseye-actor-alex-hernandez-thought-might-never-work-in-a-game-again-after-disastrous-launch/">FRVR Podcast</a>. "And I only had positive experiences working on it. The people I was working with, I was proud for them, of them, I wanted it to be a success for them just as much for myself."

He continued: "Just the response… I was like, 'I might never work in a game again'. Because one of the caveats of being the face on the box is that people, rightly or wrongly, will associate all of their opinions and, more importantly their emotions, about this game with my face," he said.
</p>
<p>
Still, Hernandez admits players are entitled to their opinions on the game, despite being on the receiving end of extreme vitriol.
</p>
<p>
"Gamers are a unique species, and I am one of them, where the attachment to the experience and the product is so strong, the feelings are so strong," he said, "and the internet is an anonymous place where people will share things they would never share to your face, ever, even if they actually hated it… they just wouldn't look you in the face and say, 'everyone who worked on this game deserved to die. This is f**king awful, these guys are idiots'. No one would ever say that to your face. And, I think, at the same time, you're entitled to that."
</p>
<p>
Previously, Hernandez provided the voice and likeness for Lincoln Clay in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>, another game with a poor reception at launch. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm not a superstitious man, but I can't help but have some kind of Spidey Sense, like, 'Is it just me?' Do I have like the opposite of the golden touch, like the sh*t-brown touch, everything I touch turns to poop?" he joked.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-layoffs-build-a-rocket-boy-releases-mindseye-update-4-and-promises-its-committed-to-enhancing-the-gameplay-experience">Build A Rocket Boy has continued to update the game since</a>, and promised it's "committed" to enhancing the gameplay experience.
</p>
<p>
Still, the disastrous launch has put the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launch-what-we-didnt-hope-for-says-io-interactive-ceo-as-publishing-future-in-question">future of publisher IOI Partners into question</a>. "So, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> will publish our own games internally," said IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak. "IOI Partners? That remains to be seen."
</p>
<p>"Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">MindsEye review</a>.</p>

			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/16/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the second half of September 2025, and following up from the first half, it's even more strong indie titles with Hades and Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor among the over a dozen games being added, starting today.</p>



<p>Hades re-enters the subscription service just ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-launches-on-pc-and-nintendo-switch-this-month/">Hades II launching into 1.0 on September 25</a>, giving players a chance to dive back into the first game before the first sequel that developer Supergiant has ever made hits its full release.</p>



<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the Deep Rock Galactic spin-off auto-shooter from Funday Games that's published by Ghost Ship's publishing arm. Like Hades II, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-releases-out-of-early-access-in-september/">Survivor is launching out of early access</a> this month, and it'll be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>



<p>Other notable titles coming for the rest of the month include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Frostpunk 2, Visions of Mana, and Sworn. There's also a game preview for Endless Legends II that'll be available on PC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the rest of the month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Roadcraft - September 16 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>For the King II - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Overthrown (Game Preview) - September 17 - Xbox Series X/S</li>

<li>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light - September 30 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>
</ul>



<p>And, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This time, it's a swell of Ninja Gaiden titles, with Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge all leaving the service, alongside Terra Invicta. They'll all be gone as of September 30, 2025.</p>
