		<p>Hello User and welcome to your new Internet experience. Before you embark on this amazing journey please scan your face, a government issued ID, your birth certificate and provide payment details. Do not worry, all of this personal information will be completely safe. There has never been a breach of personal data in the history of the Internet, and your identity will not be compromised.</p>
<p>What can we show you today, User? I see that you have selected content labelled as “not safe for work”. Do you have all of the required ID and face scans to validate your age? Yes, we know you provided it earlier, but think of the Internet like a vast shopping centre where every cashier will need to check your information. Don’t worry, it is all legitimate and safe, a process managed by global partners. It should be no problem for you to let everyone know what kind of things you are into.</p>
<div id="attachment_462166"><p id="caption-attachment-462166">We might be due another UK-themed Not Tonight –&nbsp;Image credit: PanicBarn,<br>No More Robots</p></div>
<p>Excellent, your ID all checks out, User. However, I am sorry to say that you cannot access the content you requested. Yes, you have the funds to purchase this legitimate content, but your payment processor has deemed the topics contained within this media unacceptable and has requested it be removed from sale. User, you do not need to know why a corporation that is not even based in your geographic area can make this decision for you. It is for your own good. There is plenty of other content you can view instead across the excellent world wide web.</p>
<p>When we say world wide web, we mean to say websites and services that are permitted by your Internet Service Provider and government legislation. Gone are the days where you would have to endlessly click on different websites with their own content and ideas. Today, we have made your Internet experience much more convenient, directing you to the same few websites to meet all of your content and shopping needs. You won’t need to worry about visiting those smaller sites ever again, when we can provide you with the latest information on a more curated selection of platforms. You can see everyone’s creativity and permitted ideas in one place!</p>

<div id="attachment_462164"><p id="caption-attachment-462164">Is Zane even old enough to use the new Internet? –&nbsp;Image credit: Tendershoot, No More Robots</p></div>
<p>We appreciate everyone on the Internet, but some content is just better for you. Do not worry too much about things being produced by smaller creators, or historically marginalised groups, we will give you so much approved content that you will come to appreciate ignoring them. Most importantly, your children will also be kept completely safe from interacting with undesirable content and ideas.</p>
<p>So again, User, welcome to the Internet. A place of freedom*, creativity*, learning*, and connection*.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KRAFTON, the publisher that has more recently been in the news due to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">messy back-and-forth</a> with the co-founders of Unknown Worlds, who allege that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">KRAFTON delayed Subnautica 2 to avoid paying a $250 million bonus</a> to the Unknown Worlds team, is back in the news for a different reason today, a studio acquisition. Eleventh Hour Games, the team behind Last Epoch, has just been acquired by KRAFTON.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/last-epoch-qa-on-runemaster-class-1-0-launch-and-advantages-over-diablo-iv/">Eleventh Hour Games</a> (EHG) was founded back in 2017, with chief executive officer Judd Cobler going to Reddit to find people with game development experience to make what would become Last Epoch. A 2018 Kickstarter raised enough funds to get the studio going, and on April 30, 2019, it launched into Early Access on Steam. It didn't hit its <a href="https://wccftech.com/last-epoch-shows-off-unique-trade-system-ahead-of-1-0-launch/">1.0 launch</a> until just last year, February 21, 2024, and according to a <a href="https://press.krafton.com/KRAFTON-Acquires-Eleventh-Hour-Games-Creators-of-Last-Epoch">press release</a> for its acquisition by KRAFTON, Last Epoch has sold 3 million copies since last February.</p>



<p>"<em>Through this acquisition, KRAFTON aims to secure a competitive franchise IP in the Action RPG genre and further strengthen its position in the global market," </em>writes KRAFTON. "<em>The deal provides EHG with the resources and infrastructure to better serve its community, ensuring that Last Epoch</em> <em>continues to evolve and meet the expectations of its growing player base. The acquisition will also enable EHG to scale development across console platforms and expand seasonal content pipelines, setting the stage for long-term franchise development. KRAFTON will support EHG’s live service roadmap, team expansion, and international publishing, while allowing the studio to retain full leadership and creative autonomy</em>."</p>



<p>KRAFTON's head of corporate development, Maria Park, added that the publisher is "<em>thrilled to welcome Eleventh Hour Games into the KRAFTON family,"</em> and that EHG's "<em>rise from a grassroots studio to a globally renowned ARPG developer is nothing short of remarkable."</em> Park also claims that this acquisition "<em>reaffirms our unwavering passion for great games and the teams that build them. We will always stand behind developers who put players first,"</em> which is difficult to see as anything but a snide shot towards the Subnautica 2 co-founders. </p>



<p>On the other side of the aisle, for Eleventh Hour Games, Cobler adds that this acquisition is "<em>a dream come true</em>" for the studio, and that KRAFTON's "<em>deep-rooted passion for ARPGs aligns perfectly with our mission."</em> </p>



<p>"<em>With KRAFTON's support, EHG is poised to elevate the </em><em>Last Epoch</em> franchise to even greater heights. As a studio built from players of the genre, we couldn’t be more excited for its future."</p>



<p>Due to the ongoing legal battle between KRAFTON and Unknown Worlds, it's difficult to take any of these statements at face value when we see how that relationship has eroded in the last four years. Unknown Worlds co-founder Charlie Cleveland also said that Unknown Worlds and KRAFTON were "<em>aligned</em>" in their goals when <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">KRAFTON's acquisition of Unknown Worlds was announced</a>. But, according to Cleveland and the rest of the co-founders, KRAFTON's attitude towards the studio turned on a dime within the last year. </p>



<p>Hopefully, today's statements remain true for Eleventh Hour Games and KRAFTON in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hot off the release of The Alters, 11 Bit Studios has announced the long-awaited console release date for its difficult city-builder survival simulation title, Frostpunk 2. The game took home the award for Best Sim/Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2024, and now it will be made available for a wider audience this September.</p><p>Frostpunk 2 puts you in the shoes of "The Steward," the leader of New London in a wintry apocalypse set 30 years after the first title, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/frostpunk/b/pc/archive/2018/04/23/frostpunk-review-a-frigid-unrelenting-survival-success.aspx">earned an 8.75 out of 10</a> from <em>Game Informer </em>when it was released in 2018. Throughout the campaign, players must manage a much larger city and its resources and people, making near-impossible decisions along the way to ensure the populace's survival.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>11 Bit claims to have implemented many lessons from its console port of the first Frostpunk, which arrived in 2019, a year and a half after the PC version launched. The circular interface has been fine-tuned to allow for the intricate keyboard controls to translate even better on gamepad. Players will be able to use controller bumpers to cycle between districts and access a dynamic radial menu for actions involving resource piles. For those on PC who would like to use gamepad controls, the PC version will receive a free update adding this control scheme as an option.</p><p>"Initially, we tried to carry over as many interface solutions as possible," production coordinator Igor Skibinski said in a press release. "But the two games differ so much in terms of gameplay that we had to adapt and rework those systems over time. Still, our main focus was to make interaction with the game feel seamless – so players never have to think about how to play while they're playing. Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex strategy games can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles."</p><p>Additionally, 11 Bit Studios partnered with Skybound Games to create two premium physical editions to accompany the digital release. The Icebreaker Edition includes the full game on disc, a pop-up diorama of New London, a digital novella called <em>Warm Flesh</em>, and a digital artbook that chronicles the creation of Frostpunk 2's world. The Whiteout Edition includes all of the Icebreaker Edition content, plus a multi-layered shadow box with integrated LED lighting, a Deluxe Edition upgrade that grants access to three upcoming DLC releases, a metal-and-enamel keychain, two New London art postcards, Frostpunk-themed stickers, and one of two possible embroidered faction patches. The Icebreaker Edition will be $50, while the Whiteout Edition retails for $100.</p><p>Frostpunk 2 arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) on September 18. Although&nbsp;<em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>was shut down during the time when we would have otherwise reviewed it, we came away from a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2024/05/27/breaking-the-ice">2024 hands-on session with very positive impressions</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/25/frostpunk-2-arrives-on-consoles-in-september]]></content:encoded>

<p>Plants vs Zombies 'Reloaded' was previously registered as a trademark in Brazil, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1902169093538521453?">as spotted by Gematsu in March</a>, but according to Dealabs the developers at PopCap want to dub it something a bit more in-line with what the series is about. Thus: Replanted. 
</p>
<p>Plants vs Zombies has proven exceptionally popular over the years. The original game was an instant classic, winning over huge numbers of people with its quirky take on the tower defence genre. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-review">In the original 2009 Eurogamer review</a> (good times), Christian Donlan stated the game was: "An effortlessly streamlined take on tower defence games, enemies march across the screen from right to left, sticking to polite rows, and it's up to the player to place the various weapons required to slow their progress and finish them off."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-reloaded-release-date-rumoured-for-october-launch]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hmmm, we've heard this one before</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario RPG Kissing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4fe6194595fe8/super-mario-rpg-kissing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's official, folks — Mario and Peach are <em>not</em> in a relationship. Nintendo said it, so it <em>must</em> be true.</p>
<p>A few days ago, on the Nintendo Today! App, the Big N dropped this major bombshell on the world, revealing that the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and the Italian plumber are simply "good friends". We missed the initial post, but thankfully, <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122">KirPinkFury</a> has us covered.</p>
<p>So, wait, is this despite the fact Peach has kissed Mario multiple times and baked multiple cakes for him? We know both of these acts <em>are</em> platonic (cheek kissing, baking), but... okay.</p>

<p>This all sounds a little familiar, right? Another darling Nintendo couple, Zelda and Link, are frequently under the microscope from fans. Are they in a relationship? Aren't they?</p>
<p>Zelda's voice actor, Patricia Summerset, once said "I know that [Link and Zelda] are in a relationship with each other" in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/patricia-summersett-interview-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">TheGamer</a> as part of a wider conversation about enjoying the ambiguity of their relationship, before putting out a <a href="https://x.com/Summersett_/status/1660696953712197635">statement a few days later saying</a> that her words do "not imply" that the duo are in love.</p>
<p>Really, though, all of this is up to fan interpretation. If Mario and Peach want some privacy, that's great. Nintendo can insist the pair aren't a couple — and maybe that's the case. To be fair, Peach <em>did</em> turn down Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Next thing Nintendo will be telling us is that Donkey Kong doesn't love bananas.</p>
<p><em>Let us know in the comments whether you believe Nintendo is telling the truth.</em><em><br></em></p></section>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will add its highly-requested two-player mode next week on July 30, 2025, with Patch 1.02, and while the introduction of duo expeditions remains the highlight for the update, FromSoftware is also adding a few key quality-of-life and UI improvements in the patch, like better filtering options for relics.</p>



<p>FromSoftware's co-operative multiplayer roguelike action game has gone better than anyone might've expected when the game was first announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">The Game Awards 2024</a>. In its launch month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-topped-us-sales-charts-may-2025/">topping sales charts in the US</a> and breaking into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">top five on more global charts</a>.  It stayed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">top-10 for US game sales for June</a>, and remained <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">one of the top-15 best-selling games globally</a>. </p>



<p>The introduction of a duos mode, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">something players have requested</a> since FromSoftware tested the game's servers in an open beta (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-mods-framerate-two-player-mode-easier-solo/">already implemented themselves through mods</a>) is sure to give the community a boost, and might even convince some players who have been on the fence to finally pick it up, knowing that they can hop in with the one other friend they have, and no longer be handicapped by being unable to find a third friend to play with. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It'll be interesting to see where Nightreign stands when we get a look at sales and engagement charts for July halfway through next month. Even though this update is coming right at the end of the month, it has approximately two days to make a significant impact.</p>



<p>FromSoftware also recently celebrated Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">surpassing 5 million units sold since it launched in May</a>, a huge milestone for the company's first major foray into multiplayer and the first time it has adapted one of its major narrative and action-driven Souls games into an online multiplayer experience. </p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how FromSoftware's second foray into turning elements players recognize from its single-player games into a multiplayer experience goes when <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> arrives as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced when you can expect the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>duos update to land, and it's not too far away at all, so get ready to revisit Limveld with your buddy.</p>

<p><i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>'s duos mode was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">revealed in early June</a>, but now, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the date on which you'll be able to tackle Limveld's dangers with just one other person: July 30th.</p>

<p>The ability to play in a duo will be added as part of patch 1.02, which will also bring new ways to sort relics, hopefully making organizing your favorite loadouts a little easier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-tower.jpg?itok=LdljaS4A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-tower.jpg?itok=NrplKzA7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s duos mode is coming very soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was released back in late May, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassing over two million sales</a> on its first day of release. At launch, the game only supported solo play or squads of three, and players quickly began requesting a duo mode, which FromSoftware was evidently happy to implement.</p>

<p>After release,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update" rel="nofollow">new superpowered versions</a> of the Nightlord bosses to take on, plus new quality-of-life improvements and more.</p>

<p>News of the duos update's release date comes shortly after&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">reached five million sales</a>&nbsp;earlier this week, with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC currently sitting at ten million. Those are some pretty encouraging numbers for Bandai Namco, I'm sure.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>that sees players descending on a randomly-generated map in order to kill minibosses, loot gear, and get strong enough to take on a boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>The game is one of two major multiplayer-oriented titles in FromSoftware's slate for the next couple of years; the other is&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game</a> set to launch sometime next year.</p>

This year, the lineup became even more powerful and spec-packed while still retaining the low-profile and portable 14-inch design that initially drew us to it.

It’s not particularly tough to find a gaming laptop with these specs.

                <p>A two-player mode is making its debut in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> next week, allowing duos to run together without seeking a third player.</p><p>From Software has announced that a duos mode will be added to Elden Ring Nightreign on July 30 alongside update 1.02, which is aimed at providing a variety of other quality-of-life improvements. Full patch notes haven't been revealed yet.</p><p>The highly requested feature will be a game-changer for some folks looking to tackle the challenges in Limveld. When Elden Ring Nightreign first launched, players were forced to enter matches solo or in a group of three, the latter of which forced duo partners to team up with a random third player or seek out an additional person to join up.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/" data-ref-id="1100-6531963">A mod</a> released just weeks after Elden Ring: Nightreign launched allowed PC players to run duos, but players on other platforms remained out of luck. So, it's great news that everyone will finally be able to run matches with a team size of their choosing.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign director, Junya Ishizaki, initially told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> the game's focus on three-player matches "was largely a game-balancing decision, rather than a game-design decision." Later, he admitted in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">separate interview</a> that a two-player mode was "simply something that was overlooked during development" before stating the team was looking into it.</p><p>This new addition couldn't come at a better time, either, as Elden Ring Nightreign recently crossed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">5 million units shipped</a>. This comes along with news that the original Elden Ring has sold over 30 million copies alone, making the franchise From Software's most commercially successful ever.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MindsEye GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The post begins as follows:</p><p>"Dear community, it’s been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we’re grateful for your support and detailed feedback. Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game.</p><p>In June, we committed to delivering a great experience for all players. Since then, we’ve released three updates, each addressing bug fixes and performance improvements across all devices, driven by your reports and suggestions. We hope you’re starting to see the impact of these changes, and we’re committed to building on this progress. Moving forward, updates may be less frequent, but with the aim for each to bring more meaningful changes."</p><p>The rest of the post vaguely outlines the next few months of fixes. First though, Build A Rocket Boy issued a delay to its Hitman crossover, which was originally intended to land in July. The team didn't provide a firm date, or even commit to a window--just saying that it has been pushed back and that it looks forward to "delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right."</p><p>Looking forward, August will bring MindsEye's fourth significant performance update to both PC and consoles. This patch will also bring features requested by the community, including skippable cutscenes and instant access to user-generated content on PC.</p><p>In September, MindsEye is set to receive another major update across all systems, once again bolstering performance and providing vaguely worded "gameplay improvements, alongside a number of enhancements to core gameplay mechanics."</p><p>Beyond that, MindsEye and Build A Rocket Boy's future remains uncertain. The studio was almost immediately rocked by news of layoffs following the game's turbulent June launch, when it was plagued by technical bugs and visual glitches that inspired a lot of frustration and mockery online. GameSpot's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">MindsEye review</a> called it a "stringent and relentlessly dull video game," awarding the game a 3/10 while somehow avoiding most of its technical blemishes.</p>

			<p>New details on CD Projekt Red's mysterious Project Hadar emerged online today thanks to a new job ad discovered online.</p>



<p>As spotted by<a href="https://tech4gamers.com/cdpr-project-hadar-action-rpg-melee-combat/"> Tech4Gamers</a>, CD Projekt Red is looking to hire a Senior Gameplay Designer specifically for the development of Project Hadar, a new IP from the studio, with at least 5 years of experience in the RPG/action titles with melee-oriented combat, suggesting the game will have a major focus on close range combat. The rest of the required qualifications don't reveal anything new about this game, such as experience in working with Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5, as the studio announced a while back that Epic's engine would power its future projects.</p>



<p>Project Hadar is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-3-witcher-projects-new-ip-in-development-cd-projekt-red/">many projects</a> in development at CD Projekt Red, which include a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, currently known as Project Orion, and the next entry in The Witcher series, The Witcher 4. Revealed last year during The Game Awards show, the next entry in the series, which will star Ciri in place of Geralt of Rivia, is being made with a console-first approach and will take<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/"> full advantage of the generational shift </a>since The Witcher 3. How this will be achieved remains to be seen, but if the tech demo shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">last month</a> is of any indication, it definitely looks like CD Projekt Red will have no trouble surpassing anything it has released so far.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, VShojo, the VTuber talent agency that claims to put "talent first," came under fire as its biggest talent, Ironmouse, alleged that the company had failed to pay her a "significant sum" of money, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitchs-biggest-vtuber-quits-agency-alleging-missing-charity-funds-of-over-500000/1100-6533329/" data-ref-id="1100-6533329">failing to donate</a> more than $515,000 that she had raised for the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Now, after a mass exodus of its talent that saw VShojo without a single remaining VTuber on its books, the CEO has admitted to spending those funds to try to keep the company afloat.</p><p>In a statement posted to the <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VShojo X account </a>on July 24, CEO Justin Ignacio has admitted that he has "mismanaged the company into the situation you're all witnessing." Ignacio goes on to confirm that VShojo has been facing financial difficulties in recent months, and that despite raising "around $11 million" to pursue a "talent-first" approach, the company eventually ran out of money. Ignacio says that "some of the money was raised in connection with talent activity," and claims that he later learned that it was intended for a charitable initiative. He continues, "We were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all our expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts."</p><p>However, <a href="https://t.co/TJZBz8jga5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">users on X</a> have pointed out <a href="https://t.co/sxmoBNqh8G" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">several instances</a> where Ignacio acknowledged Ironmouse's charity streams at the time, and allege that he did not "later learn" this fact at all, but was aware for the duration of VShojo's struggles. As a response to the situation, <a href="https://x.com/RimaEvenstar/status/1948526128391721036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch has removed the "GunRun" global emote</a> that was dedicated to Ignacio.</p><p>As Ignacio confirmed that "VShojo is shutting down," some former talents are taking this as a sign that the nondisclosure agreements that they signed are no longer valid. Several VTubers have spoken out and alleged that the company had "<a href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">predatory contracts</a>," and claiming that they are owed merch and sponsorship funds from "<a href="https://t.co/NyQZbKvso1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">years ago</a>."</p><p>In line with discovering that the funds she raised had not been donated to the Immune Deficiency Foundation, Ironmouse launched her own <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiltify campaign</a> to raise money for the charity. At the time of writing, it has surpassed $1.25 million raised in just three days.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy has delayed its previously announced Hitman mission, as it continues to issue fixes to the game.</p>
<p>In a new post, Build A Rocket Boy apologised that its Hitman crossover mission with publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> would no longer be releasing in July as once planned. Rather, the studio has moved this release back to an unspecified date down the line. "We look forward to delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right and will provide further updates as soon as we're able," it wrote.</p>
<p>What Build A Rocket Boy does have planned for the coming months, though, is two more updates promising yet more performance improvements. In August, the studio will also introduce skippable cutscenes.</p>

<p>"It's been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we're grateful for your support and detailed feedback," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">the team wrote on reddit</a>. "Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game."</p>
<p>Since this post has gone live, many on the game's Discord are now lamenting the lack of a clear roadmap for MindsEye and content in general.</p>
<p>"Confirmation that Hitman is delayed is good and all, but there's no substantial content or really anything to bring people back until after September," a user wrote. "What's the point of the premium pass or getting a deluxe edition if we don't get the promised content," one user added (to which another replied with simply: "Cash grabbing punks.")</p>
<p>Another commenter on the MindsEye Discord wrote: "Of course, we do want the game to get fixed. But what we also need is content, or else there is literally no point continuing to try and fix stuff." Someone even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">suggested Build A Rocket Boy take a leaf out of Splitgate 2's book</a>, and rerelease MindsEye in an 'early access' state.</p>
<p>"As a console player, there is literally no reason to return to this game," yet another user on the MindsEye Discord wrote.</p>
<p>These sentiments are echoed on the MindsEye reddit. "I want more MindsEye  missions to be added. Community and developer made ones as promised. As well as the essential fixes needed for free roam. Different playable characters, driveable vehicles, time of day, etc," reads one reply to Build A Rocket Boy's latest update.</p>
<p>Others are just annoyed that in its update post, the studio hasn't really said anything of any real importance. "This update doesn't say anything meaningful at all, are you kidding?" reads a reply.</p>

<p>MindsEye released earlier this year, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though MindsEye's publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane said: "Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat." We awarded it one star.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseyes-hitman-crossover-mission-delayed-leaving-its-community-starving-for-content]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/early-digital-sales-data-from-newzoo-shows-toby-fox%E2%80%99s-deltarune-topping-nintendo-switch-2-sales-charts-in-select-markets.1253313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published a <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/nintendo-switch-2-launch-what-early-digital-data-reveals-for-third-party-games">new report</a> looking at the data from early digital sales on the Nintendo Switch 2, as Newzoo's product manager, Max Otten, tried to get an early answer to the question of whether the Switch 2 is a viable ecosystem for third-party developers and publishers.</p>



<p>Otten looked at digital sales data for June 2025 from six major markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, and saw that three out of the top five games by units sold on the Nintendo Switch 2 were third-party titles. At the top of them all? Toby Fox's long-awaited Undertale follow-up, Deltarune.</p>



<p>Deltarune doing well isn't the biggest surprise, considering that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">a week ago</a>, Newzoo reported that it had made it into the top-20 games by revenue for June 2025. However, that knowledge doesn't exactly wear off the shock of seeing it over top of Mario Kart World, though this is where it's important to remember that the sales data Newzoo is pulling from does <strong>not</strong> include physical sales. In the US alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">82% of people who bought a Switch 2 also bought Mario Kart World in a physical forma</a>t, so it makes sense that the digital sales aren't as chart-topping as you might expect.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though perhaps the most surprising aspect of Newzoo's report is seeing Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in second place behind Deltarune, and ahead of Mario Kart World in third. Otten's guess at what happened here, while accurately calling Welcome Tour "<em>essentially a tech demo</em>" in the same breath, is that the combination of its "<em>low price and lack of launch-window exclusives likely helped drive</em> <em>sales</em>."</p>



<p>Rounding out the rest of the top five is Minecraft in the number four spot, and No Man's Sky in the number five spot, and once again, at least one of those games is not the third-party title you'd expect. Minecraft isn't a surprise, but No Man's Sky is, at least slightly, when considering that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37qmdfn2k">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Switch 2 has been one of the standout third-party releases so far, at least in the US.</p>



<p>That top five changes slightly when Otten looks at which games that were exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 had the biggest revenue share, with Mario Kart World in its expected top spot, followed by Fantasy Life I in second, Cyberpunk 2077 in third, No Man's Sky in fourth and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in fifth, making it once again a three-to-two third-party games majority.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, the only top five Otten shows in his report, where the majority of games listed are first-party Nintendo titles, is the list of top five titles by monthly active users for June 2025. Mario Kart World, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons take first, third, fourth, and fifth place on that list, respectively. Fortnite is the only third-party entry in the number two spot.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>All this said, Otten closes his report by saying that "<em>While first-party titles command overall sales leadership, there are clear pockets of spending on third-party content—especially for games that are well-optimized, offer genre diversity, or present new experiences to the platform."</em></p>



<p>He adds that "<em>early data shows glimmers of promise for third-party titles at launch, and players are showing up for enhanced ports, narrative games, and non-traditional Switch genres.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll learn more about how viable the Nintendo Switch 2 ecosystem is for third-party titles the deeper into the console's life we go. Only looking at first-month sales in select major markets and sticking with digital sales is nowhere close to the whole picture. But Otten has shown how even new third-party titles can find chart-topping success. It'll be interesting to see what else is able to top the charts in the coming months. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Hypnohead have announced that their roguelite kingdom-builder&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone within its first four days on release.</p>

<p><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>was released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-king-is-watching-release-date" rel="nofollow">on Monday this week</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/TKIWGame/status/1948672902137811139" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official X (formerly Twitter) account, it's already hit the 100,000 sales mark. That puts it in good company, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pioneers-of-pagonia-100k-sales" rel="nofollow">Pioneers of Pagonia</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">beaver colony sim&nbsp;<em>Timberborn</em></a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Hypnohead and tinyBuild <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753900/view/542237641778661281" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that free content updates are in the works for&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, with features like mid-run saves being "actively work[ed] on", according to the two studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=9k9uY5oa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=D-9_d71p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has reached an impressive sales figure in just four days.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, it's a roguelite kingdom-builder in which you must construct and maintain your kingdom, but with a unique twist (which the title has probably already given away).</p>

<p>As the king, you must actively watch areas of your kingdom you want to progress; if you don't, they will fall to "laziness" and "chaos", as the Steam page says, but watching them will result in progress "thriv[ing]".</p>

<p>You'll have to balance which parts of your kingdom you most want to succeed. Do you want to emphasize resource production, for instance, or defense to make sure your kingdom won't be caught unawares?</p>

<p>As you play, you'll gain upgrades that will allow you to watch more of your kingdom at once, and you'll also need to make decisions about where you want to invest the resources you've gathered in order to make your kingdom the best it can be.</p>




<p>Since this is a roguelite, you'll also have to deal with unique events that can significantly change the outcome of a run. Each run will allow you to unlock new abilities to help your kingdom thrive in future.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it's currently on sale for $13.49 or your local equivalent (although that's with a 10% discount).</p>

Players can use bumper buttons to cycle between districts of the same type, or a dynamic radial menu that appears over resource piles and presents actions specific to them. Additionally, following the console release, the PC version of <em>Frostpunk 2</em> will receive an update enabling players to use this new UI scheme whenever a gamepad is connected.</p></blockquote><p>“Initially, we tried to carry over as many interface solutions as possible [from PC to console],” said <em>Frostpunk 2</em> production coordinator Igor Skibinski in a press release. “But the two games differ so much in terms of gameplay that we had to adapt and rework those systems over time. Still, our main focus was to make interaction with the game feel seamless—so players never have to think about how to play while they’re playing. Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex <a title="Genres > Strategy [268 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy games</a> can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>Despite being primarily a three-player co-operative game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off has been criticised by players - in part because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">included solo play was too tough</a>, and in part because a two-player option wasn't included.</p>
<p>Previous patches have re-balanced the solo mode, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">two-player mode was promised at the start of June</a>. Now it's finally on the way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">FromSoftware announced Elden Ring Nightreign has sold over 5m copies</a> since its release at the end of May.</p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has sold 10m copies, meaning around a third of players have dived into the expansion.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has continued to update Nightreign with the rotating Everdark Sovereigns. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">next batch of these extra challenging Nightlords will arrive on 31st July</a> - good luck fighting them in pairs!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-duo-mode-is-finally-on-the-way-with-release-date-confirmed]]></content:encoded>
