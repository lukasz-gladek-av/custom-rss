<p>G2 Esports will reportedly hold on to Russian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/">CS2 superstar and AWP sensation Ilya “⁠m0NESY⁠” Osipov</a> during this upcoming post-Major roster shuffle. Team Falcons, who reportedly have already gotten the other G2 superstar Nikola “⁠NiKo⁠” Kovač to join them in 2025, will have to look elsewhere.</p>



<p>While these moves are not official yet, they will drastically shake up the CS2 landscape at the start of 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-g2-lock-down-m0nesy">G2 lock down ⁠m0NESY⁠</h2>



<p>The 19-year-old sniper superstar has been highly sought after by the Saudi Arabian for some time. Given his fondness for playing alongside NiKo, many speculated that m0NESY would depart alongside him. <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40587/sources-m0nesy-likely-staying-at-g2-despite-falcons-interest-tc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HLTV reported</a> that ⁠m0NESY⁠ “considered” Falcons offer to join the roster as part of a massive overhaul.</p>



<p>With NiKo garnering a reported $1 to $1.2 million transfer fee, m0NESY could easily fetch an even higher price from Falcons. He finished the the 2024 season as one of the consensus best players in the world. With m0NESY signed to G2 for the rest of 2025, the organization has opted to turn down Falcons’ offer and keep him. G2’s goal for 2025 is to make m0NESY the focal point of the roster, and they’re risking him leaving after 2025 as a free agent to do so.</p>



<p>The hope for G2 now is that Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa can step into the star position left vacant by the departing NiKo. malbsMd had a breakout performance at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, and if he takes on a bigger role while m0NESY stays, the offseason becomes far less daunting for G2.</p>



<p>Falcons are no strangers to getting spurned while pursuing superstars, as they notably failed to acquire NiKo from G2 last year. The organization will now have to look elsewhere for an AWPer, having terminated legendary AWPer Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev’s loan from NAVI back in November.</p>



<p>Is G2 doing the right thing by keeping m0NESY?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

"And the same goes for all of the fans who played our game, who streamed it, or who worked to build the XDefiant community."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">XDefiant's final S3.0+ update includes the previously announced Assassins class, which are modelled after Assassin's Creed's titular heroes, alongside myriad additional features that were planned for now cancelled future seasons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This includes a total of three new factions, 13 new maps, a new experience called Tactical, a means of gaining experience versus bots, new weapons, new progression mechanics for Faction Mastery and Badges, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">xDefiant is a free-to-play, fast-paced arena shooter that combines intense gunplay with personalized loadouts and specialized factions. But that market can be incredibly brutal, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">and perhaps after PlayStation arena shooter Concord was shut down after just two weeks on the market</a>, some fans of xDefiant grew concerned for its longevity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Rubin said in September that XDefiant "is absolutely not dying," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">Ubisoft announced earlier this month it would be shut down on June 3, 2025</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">XDefiant Update S3.0+ Patch Notes</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Factions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Faction: Assassins</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Hiding in plain sight through the centuries, the Assassins have waged a clandestine war against their ancient enemies, the Templars, to safeguard human freedom. Assassins combine rigorous combat training, unconventional weaponry, and a sixth sense to track and take out their targets. Their signature Hidden Blade is a one-hit melee elimination.</li><li>The Assassins receive combat guidance from Rebecca Crane, the technical genius who developed the Animus 2.0, an advanced model of the machine that lets Assassins relive genetic memories. She guided some of the Order's most well-known Assassins, including Desmond Miles. With Crane's assistance, the Assassins work in the dark to serve the light, combating oppression with lethal force.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Faction: Wolves</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ex-special forces gone rogue, Wolves employ an arsenal of Skell Tech drones for both offense and defense. The Wolves trait allows the pack to be a sight unseen, undetected by AI abilities and devices. Their Legion drone acts like a homing proximity mine, while the Stolas is effectively a mobile turret. And their ultra, Drone Swarm, is the last word on area denial.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Faction: Blood Dragon</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Super-deadly cyber commandos from a dark future where cyborgs and mutants collide. Use your cyberstrength, throw deadly shuriken, strike with your shock punch, or use the Killstar laser to deal massive damage.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Cleaners</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Fixed a couple of glitches with the Cleaners' Incinerator Drone when Hijacked by a DedSec player:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Drone no longer explodes next to the player who Hijacked it.</li><li>The Drone now leaves a complete fire trail back to its point of origin.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Echelon</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>No longer have a 50% reduction in flash grenade duration debuff</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Phantoms</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>AEGIS – Addressed issue with shots not registering at point blank range.</li><li>Blitz – Increased movement speed to truly “Blitz” your opponent.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>DedSec</strong> </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spiderbots 2.0 – We got the message. Spiderbots, DedSec's infuriatingly face-adjacent electro-minions, are now less in your face and more of an area-of-effect threat. When activated, Spiderbots will now dutifully follow their deploying player for 30 seconds, emitting an electromagnetic pulse that disrupts all enemy equipment within a 10-meter radius. And with that, the era of Spiderbot facehugging comes to a close.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Highwaymen</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>M79</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue that would lock the skill when activating right after a weapon swap</li><li>This should now have damage dealt while on different elevations</li><li>Improved handling and reload speed</li><li>Cooldown reduced to 40s</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>Buzzsaw Launcher</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Increased ammo count</li><li>Addressed issue with damage inconsistency</li></ol><h3 data-cy="title3">Maps</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New S3 Maps</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Mykonos (Arena)</strong>: Experience the island of Mykonos like the ancient Greeks did, except with more rooftop firefights, in this new map for Season 3. Your itinerary includes sprinting by market stalls, seeking roof access for the high ground, and jumping across boat decks in high-risk flanking maneuvers.</li><li><strong>El Barrio (Arena)</strong></li><li><strong>Jorvik (Linear)</strong></li><li><strong>Animus Anomaly (Tactical):</strong> Ancient worlds collide in Animus Anomaly, a new corridor-style map for Season 3. Hunker down among Viking castles, flank around the waterways of ancient Greece, or go out with a boom in the new Defuse tactical variant of BOMB!.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Future Maps</strong> - These maps were scheduled for later seasons but were too much fun not to release!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Arena</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Carlyle’s Lab</li><li>Enchanted Forest</li><li>Killstar Temple</li><li>Razia’s Realm</li><li>Skell City</li><li>West End</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Linear</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Skell Complex</li><li>Esperanza</li><li>Himalaya</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adjustments were done to invisible collision and areas where players were able to jump to places that are out of bounds for the map.</li><li>Adjustments to some maps where scrap turrets were also being placed where they’re not supposed to be.</li><li>DUMBO has decked the halls to be more festive for the holidays</li><li>Players can no longer climb and leap their way into what was supposed to be an inaccessible area of some maps, where they were using El Remedio to heal allies and doing other sneaky exploits.</li><li>Many maps have undergone improvements to mantling which should now be fixed in several map locations that previously were not.</li><li>Map voting improvements</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Game Modes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Modes:</strong></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Defuse</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>This season sees the debut of Defuse, a tactical and slower-paced version of BOMB!. Teams take turns planting and defending bomb sites, yet all players only have one life. Defuse is designed for play on a new "corridor" type map, in this case the Animus Anomaly created exclusively for this category.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Vs Bots</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>There’s now a Vs Bots option where you can face off against varying levels of computers. You’ll even earn XP by battling bots. Although at a slower pace with human enemies.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lum Hunt</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Catch them if you can, Lums (beings of pure energy possessing of a mindbogglingly sunny disposition) have been placed around the Enchanted Forest map in this variant of Hot Shot.

These top players are displayed in descending order of total Rank Points earned in the current season. Highlighting a player on the Leaderboard displays the following stats:</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Current rank insignia and RP total.</li><li>Win/Loss: Player’s ratio of wins to losses.</li><li>Kill/Death: Player’s ratio of kills to deaths.</li><li>Average Score/Minute: Player’s average score per minute.</li><li>MVPs: Number of times the player earned MVP.</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ranked Emblem in HUD</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Proudly display your ranked tier right on your heads-up display for all to see.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Ranked Rewards</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New S3 specific Ranked Rewards are available (to everyone).</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Matchmaking ranges have been disabled and join in progress has been enabled so that matches are easier to find.</li><li>Reduced the forfeit timer duration from 20s to 5s.</li><li>Players are no longer pulled out of active Ranked game sessions after accepting the Party invite for a Private Match.</li><li>Added a new menu experience, now players will be able to search for games and jump back to the Ranked menu tab to view rewards, info, and the top 500 leaderboard.</li><li>Removed Domination and CTF from Ranked playlists.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Weapons</h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Assault Rifle</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>FAMAS - The FAMAS is a burst-fire rifle like the M16A4 but with faster ADS time, movement, and rate of fire. It is slower to reload, however, and inflicts less hurt per shot.</li><li> G36K</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sub-Machine Gun</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>M1928</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Light Machine Gun</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>MG5 - Despite its shorter range and lower ammo capacity than other belt-fed LMGs, the MG5 with its higher rate of fire makes it a powerful and versatile option for those who can master its challenging recoil.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Marksman</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>M1A - An agile warhorse built for medium-range battles, the M1A offers a speedy rate of fire but deals less per-shot damage compared to other marksman rifles.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sniper Rifle</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>SRS</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Pistol</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Diceros</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:Sawed-off Shotgun Balance Adjustment</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The range and damage potential of the Sawed-Off Shotgun have been adjusted to better focus it on its intended role as a short-range kill-finisher and prevent it from killing full-health opponents with a single shot.</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Short Range reduced from 8m -&gt; 6m</li><li>Medium Range reduced from 12m -&gt; 10m</li><li>Short Range Damage reduced from 12 -&gt; 11</li><li>Bullets Per Round reduced from 12 -&gt; 9</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>Tweaked smoke grenade effects so that some components of cosmetic skins will no longer be visible through the smoke, while also improving the size, shape, and transparency of the smoke particles and radius of effect.</li><li>Adjusted the camera shake so that now it is based on distance to explosion. Removed friendly explosion camera shake.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Attachments</h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Tapered Barrel</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Introduced the Tapered Barrel, an attachment for most weapons that increases handling speed but reduces damage. Here are the pluses and minuses:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Pros:</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>25 percent boost to sprint-out time</li><li>15 percent ADS speed increase</li><li>5 percent movement speed increase</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cons:</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>20 percent short-range damage decrease</li><li>20 percent medium-range damage decrease</li><li>10 percent ADS walking speed decrease</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>In other words, this barrel will help you scoot around the map at a zippier pace, but you'll likely need to land more shots than normal to get kills.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Reticle Customization</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New for Season 3: Customized reticules.

Available to anyone who has completed their Base Challenges, Prestige resets player progress in exchange for an eye-catching Prestige Emblem. All starter and owned weaponry are locked – except the M4, M9, and frag grenade – but can be earned as players earn XP and Prestige Tokens to access their original gear plus new weapons until they complete the current Prestige Tier and acquire the next eye-catching emblem. Players can opt out of Prestige at any time and recover their weapons, or they can commit to unlocking the final Prestige Emblem, the ultimate display of dedication.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Badges!</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Badges are part of a mysterious new challenge-based progression system where players earn Badges for performing impressive feats and engaging with the game in creative ways. All Badge challenges have hidden requirements, encouraging players to go online and engage with the XDefiant community.

These new Pristine skins are like unmarred, fresh-from-the-factory versions of these weapons. Pristine skins are retroactively applied to any weapons that have already reached level 50.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Daily Rewards and Credits</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Players can now earn various rewards just for logging into the game. Bigger rewards are granted every 5th and 10th login. The days do not have to be consecutive.</li><li>Credits are a brand new in-game currency. Use Credits to buy cosmetics from previous seasons, giving you the opportunity to get any skins you may have missed back then, but you have everything now, so that’s nice</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Some Challenges, particularly those related to faction characters, weren't progressing on the main menu, but now they are.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Audio</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Battle announcer lines have been tweaked for their frequency of play:</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Lines announcing death streaks (or dying multiple times without killing an enemy) will trigger less often (now players need to die five times rather than three, and the death streaks will only trigger during the second half of a match).</li><li>Lines related to suffering from fire damage (from the Purifier, (Firebomb, Incendiary Drone–really anything involving the Cleaners) will trigger less frequently.</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>Phantoms – Blitz – Now has sounds for blocking a melee attack and for attacking others with a Blitz Shield.</li><li> GSK – Hardhat – Audio improved for impact confirm headshot</li><li>Highwaymen – M79 – Now has sounds for hit confirm and impact confirm with the M79.</li><li>Other various audio improvements.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Miscellaneous</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Assassin’s video on the main menu</li><li>New Career Stats page</li><li>New Store Layout</li><li>New Weapon Inspect</li><li>Input-based matchmaking is now disabled by default for faster matchmaking times.</li><li>Fixed various crashes and errors</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dont-miss-these-8-little-things-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The open, medieval world of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was built with even greater authenticity in mind than its historically-grounded predecessor was capable of. Whether you played the first one or not, there are plenty of potentially overlooked details you'll want to pay attention to. Sometimes because it might help you succeed on your journey, and other times because it's just a neat touch of realism. As part of this month’s IGN First, we’ll be taking a look at eight little things you won't want to miss in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1. Find An Old Friend</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Henry, the hero of the Kingdom Come: Deliverance saga, will get the chance to reunite with a number of old friends from the first game if you know where to find them. And one of them is a four-legged companion who's been given a bit of a special buff for the sequel.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your very first horse, Pebbles, has somehow managed to survive the turmoil of war brewing in Bohemia. And what's more, he's even learned some new tricks. In KCD1, his stats were… less than impressive, given you got him pretty early on. But in KCD2, he has a secret perk that will allow him to grow along with Henry. The more you ride him, the better his stats will get, so you don't have to say goodbye forever in favor of a more impressive steed.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Check the Freshness Date</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While in a game like Skyrim you may be able to pack your coat pockets with fresh fruit and set off into the wilderness for days without worry, KCD2 is a bit more unforgiving in how it simulates perishable foods. But it also provides you with historically-accurate ways to solve this problem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The longer something like bread or a cabbage has been in your inventory, the more it will degrade. And some foods keep longer than others. If you want things to keep longer, well, you're not exactly going to be able to haul an ice chest around on your back. But you can do what people in the actual middle ages did. Facilities are available around many settlements for smoking and drying foods, extending their shelf lives. This process also reduces their weight, so you can carry more food – or make room for an extra dagger.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Smoking and drying foods extends their shelf lives. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This even works with the herbs you'll use for alchemy. Freshly-picked herbs will always make the strongest potions, but dried ones keep for a long time and will do in a pinch.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">3. Liquid Courage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Folks in medieval Bohemia loved their drink. After all, we didn't know much about water safety at the time, so alcohol tended to be safer. And there weren't any open-world RPGs around either, so options for entertainment were more limited. In KCD2, booze can be both a blessing and a curse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Basically any alcohol will give you some positives when you are only slightly drunk and there's a lot of perks that will even improve this," lead designer Prokop Jirsa explained. "But be very careful because if you overdo this and if you get really drunk, it'll give you a lot of negative stats."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a risk of addiction if you imbibe too often in KCD2, with increasing stages of severity. And, of course, you can drink so much you pass out. In most games, this wouldn't be too much of an issue. But in KCD2, NPCs who don't like you might take that opportunity to steal the clothes right off of your back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A situation can happen when you just fall unconscious because you're drunk and when you wake up you see somebody wearing your shoes or your hat," Jirsa said. "So yeah, be careful about it."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4. Do Your Homework</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Henry's biggest character moments in the first KCD was learning how to read, which was so rare it was practically a superpower in the Middle Ages. And he can continue his erudite journey in KCD 2. But the Reading skill has been replaced with Scholarship, which is not so much about learning what the letters mean, but what they… well, <em>mean</em>, on a deeper level.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gaining ranks in Scholarship will unlock things like new dialogue options and even the ability to gain more experience in other skills. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bohemia is full of books, and collecting them will allow you to level up your Scholarship. There are even specific places that are better for reading due to their chill atmosphere. And gaining ranks in Scholarship will unlock things like new dialogue options and even the ability to gain more experience in other skills. After all, understanding the theory behind something like chopping someone's head off with an axe helps you with the practice.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">5. A Likely Story</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And whether you're an academic, a drunk, or both, your roleplaying possibilities will expand to fit your personality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are perks in Drinking skill and in Scholarship that will unlock completely new dialogue options with guards," Jirsa told us. "And you can use these new dialogue options to get away from crime. And they're really funny, especially the one from drinking. Try those. It's really funny, like drunkenly explaining why you didn't kill the chicken is hilarious."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6. Malicious Makeover</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While Henry's abilities and even attire can affect his chance of success in different social situations, like being well-dressed giving you more play with the nobles and being covered in blood letting you scare off bandits easier, these buffs and debuffs don't only apply to you. What an NPC is wearing and how healthy they are affects their social stats in the same way. Do you see where I'm going with this?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you need to win a charisma challenge against an NPC of high social status, and spiffing up your own wardrobe isn't an option, you can always come at the problem from the other direction and sabotage theirs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the night before you can steal their fancy clothes," Jirsa advised. "Or if you want to intimidate them, it might be easier if you poison them a little bit the day before."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7. Dress to Impress</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the first game, it could be a bit of a pain to optimize your fit for every possible situation. After all, it takes quite a while, even on an inventory screen, to squeeze out of heavy plate armor and into something a bit snazzier or sneakier. But KCD2 has made this a breeze. You'll be able to save three different outfits that you can switch between seamlessly. This lines up perfectly with having one set of nice-looking clothes for navigating social situations, a suit of full armor for intense combat, and some dark-colored clothing that doesn't make much noise when you're moving around for sneaky deeds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">8. When in Doubt, Yell</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This far along on Henry's journey, though, he's not necessarily just dressing for the job he wants rather than the job he has. No, he's a bit more of a force to be reckoned with, and it's possible to flaunt this with certain enemies who really don't have any business crossing swords with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">KCD2 introduces battle cries and taunts, which can influence an NPC's will to fight. In our Survival Tips list, we mentioned how certain enemies might think better of trying to tangle with you if you kill their commander or a bunch of their friends in very flashy ways. Letting out a fearsome battle cry probably won't do much if you haven't even drawn blood yet. But if things are going your way, it might serve as a signal for the remaining opponents to take stock of the situation and decide if this is really still worth it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And, of course, there are unlockable perks that will make your bellowing even more terrifying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are tons more little things to discover in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for the sharp-eyed explorers out there, so don't hesitate to take it slow and try out new things. For more, stay tuned all December long as our exclusive IGN First coverage of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A $25 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>-crossover mount bundle is available for free in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> for those who own the expansions for both games, but only for a limited time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Invincible mount bundle in Diablo 4 normally costs a pretty penny and includes a number of items tailored around WoW's Lich King. It includes his faithful steed, Invincible, as well as mount trophies for the Lich King's helmet, the Helm of Domination, and his legendary runeblade, Frostmourne.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1824" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417938"></a><figcaption>These are just some of the items owners of The War Within and Vessel of Hatred can claim for free.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To claim the bundle free of charge, players will simply need to own both Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion and WoW: The War Within before January 7. Blizzard states the bundle will be delivered to qualifying players by January 13. Both expansions are currently on sale via <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/sale/holiday-sale-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle.net</a> through January 6, with Vessel of Hatred 25% off and The War Within 30% off.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who primarily spend their time in Azeroth, there are some free rewards to be claimed there as well. A number of Diablo-themed cosmetics from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-diablo-4-event-has-players-hunting-down-treasure-goblins/1100-6514568/" data-ref-id="1100-6514568">WoW's Greedy Emissary Diablo 4 launch event</a>, many of which are no longer available, will also be automatically unlocked for those who own both expansions. Those rewards include the Amalgam of Rage mount, Tome of Town Portal toy, the Baa'lial pet, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">It's just the latest free offering for Diablo 4 players. Blizzard recently gave away <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-out-free-diablo-4-boosts-and-automatically-unlocking-those-annoying-lilith-altars/1100-6527717/" data-ref-id="1100-6527717">free level 50 character boosts to all Diablo 4 players</a>, with Vessel of Hatred owners earning two free boosts. The boosts fully deck out players in a new set of gear and automatically unlock all of the game's stat-boosting Altars of Lilith. Blizzard said the reason behind the boost is to give returning players a fresh entry point following the game's massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">Loot Reborn</a> and Vessel of Hatred updates earlier this year. The two updates dramatically overhauled Diablo 4's loot and endgame systems but in the process made many old items and builds from the game's launch obsolete.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. To celebrate, a number of Blizzard games, including Diablo 4 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-world-of-warcraft-crossover-will-let-players-fight-for-the-horde-or-alliance/1100-6526485/" data-ref-id="1100-6526485">Overwatch 2, offered WoW-themed cosmetics</a>. Blizzard revealed as part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">Warcraft anniversary livestream that player housing will finally be coming</a> to the MMORPG in its next expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dimension-20-dungeons-drag-queens-season-2-sashays-onto-dropout-in-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The drag queens are back in the latest trailer from Dropout announcing that Season 2 of Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens will be releasing on January 8th on Dropout.tv. The announcement trailer shows off the returning case from the original season, updated character art, and plenty of teases as to what is to come in the upcoming season.</p>


<p>Returning from the first season are drag queens&nbsp;Monét X Change as Troyánn (Triton/Arcane Archer Fighter), Bob the Drag Queen as Gertrude (Tiefling/Shadow Magic Sorcerer), Jujubee as Twyla (Fairy/Gloomstalker Ranger) and Alaska Thunderfuck as Princess (Orc/Berserker Barbarian). In the first season, we saw this group of level 5 adventurers head into the underworld to help Princess attempt to bring her family back to life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's nice to be reunited with Gerty" - Bobb the Drag Queen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over the course of the trailer, we're treated to reintroductions of each of the characters, including portions of updated character artwork, as well as full reveals for the character minis.</p>

From behind the scenes photos we get a better look at the frozen fortress map as well as a battle map not featured in the trailer showing off a massive octopus monster and crashing wave.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Sony <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">revealed the PlayStation 5 Pro a few months ago</a>, some wondered just how many people would be willing to spend $700 for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-ps5-pros-biggest-problem-is-that-the-ps5-is-already-very-good/">a marginal upgrade</a> to the already quite powerful graphical performance of the PS5. Now, initial sales reports suggest there's still a substantial portion of the console market that's willing to shell out serious money for top-of-the-line console graphics.</p>
<p>Circana analyst Matt Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dap62o">shared on Bluesky this morning</a> that the PS5 Pro accounted for a full 19 percent of US PS5 sales in its launch month of November. That sales ratio puts initial upgrade interest in the PS5 Pro roughly in line with <em>lifetime</em> interest in the PS4 Pro, which <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1834785622541975897">recent reports suggest</a> was responsible for about 20 percent of all PS4 sales <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1834878244509647327">following its launch</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>That US sales ratio also lines up with international sales reports for the PS5 Pro launch. In the UK, GfK ChartTrack <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/black-friday-video-game-sales-dip-in-the-uk-uk-monthly-charts">reports</a> that the PS5 Pro was responsible for 26 percent of all console sales for November. And in Japan, Famitsu sales data suggests the PS5 Pro was responsible for a full 63 percent of the PS5's November sales after <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/famitsu-sales-11-4-24-11-10-24">selling an impressive 78,000 units in its launch week alone</a>.</p>
<h2>Shut up and take my money</h2>
<p>In the US, raw unit sales for the PS5 Pro were down slightly (12 percent) compared to those for the PS4 Pro's launch month in November 2016, Piscatella writes. But the PS5 Pro still managed to bring in 50 percent more total US revenue in its launch month, owing to the PS4 Pro's much more reasonable $400 launch price (or $533 in 2024 dollars).</p>

The two companies are establishing a “deeper collaboration” to work on “Machine Learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay,” lead architect of the PS5 and PS5 Pro Mark Cerny <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/18/ps5-pro-technical-seminar-reveals-new-in-depth-details-on-console/">announced on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>The two already partner on the PS5 and PS5 Pro’s GPUs, which are based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture, and the PS5 Pro uses a feature called PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) to improve image clarity and frame rates.</p><p>Sony also released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMwXJsMfIQ">a 37-minute presentation by Cerny</a> discussing technical aspects of the PS5 Pro and some additional information about the “multi-year” project with AMD, which is codenamed “Amethyst.” The two are vague about how, when, and where the tech resulting from Project Amethyst will be used, but general it sounds like it’s something we could see on the next PlayStation and other future hardware that AMD is a part of.</p><div><p>“These components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics”</p></div><p>The companies have two goals with Project Amethyst, according to Cerny. “The first goal is a more ideal architecture for machine learning,” Cerny said, including something that’s particularly good at dealing with the lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for game graphics.</p><p>The second goal is to develop “a set of high-quality CNNs for graphics,” Cerny said. “Both SIE and AMD will independently have the ability to draw from this collection of network architectures and training strategies, and these components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics as well as enabling more extensive use of ray tracing and path tracing.”</p><p>Sony and AMD don’t want this technology to be exclusive to PlayStation. “Through this technology collaboration we’re looking to support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices,” Cerny said. That means “something that can be used broadly across PC and console and cloud,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mark-cerny-on-ps5-pro-flopflation-and-playstations-partnership-with-amd">Cerny said to <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>The fruits of this work seem like they’re a ways out, though: “Don’t expect some massive hardware announcement immediately coming out of this,” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald">Cerny told <em>Digital Foundry</em></a>. And since creating a console is “roughly a four year-journey,” Cerny said during the presentation, it’s possible we might not see hardware that uses tech from Project Amethyst until the PlayStation 6. (Cerny dodged a direct question from <em>IGN</em> about when we should expect a potential PS6.)</p><p>If you want to read more of what Cerny said about Amethyst in his presentation, here’s the transcript of that part (which starts at <a href="https://youtu.be/lXMwXJsMfIQ?si=n0E37ABklN1FMxTo&amp;t=2072">around 34:32 in the video</a>):</p><div><blockquote><p>I have some very exciting news to share. We have begun a deeper collaboration with AMD. For the project name we’re taking a hint from AMD’s red and PlayStation’s blue. The code name is Amethyst.</p><p>With Amethyst, we’ve started on another long journey and are combining our expertise with two goals in mind.</p><p>The first goal is a more ideal architecture for machine learning. Something capable of generalized processing of neural networks but particularly good at the lightweight CNNs needed for game graphics and something focused around achieving that Holy Grail of fully-fused networks.</p><p>In going after this we’re combining the lessons AMD has learned from its multi-generation RDNA road map and SIE has learned from the custom work in PS5 Pro.</p><p>But ML use in games shouldn’t and can’t be restricted to graphics libraries. We’re also working towards a democratization of machine learning something accessible that allows direct work in AI and ML by game developers both for graphics and for gameplay.</p><p>Amethyst is not about proprietary technology for PlayStation. In fact it’s the exact opposite. Through this technology collaboration we’re looking to support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices.</p><p>The other goal is to develop, in parallel, a set of highquality CNNs for game graphics. Both SIE and AMD will independently have the ability to draw from this collection of network architectures and training strategies, and these components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics as well as enabling more extensive use of ray tracing and path tracing.</p><p>We’re looking forward to keeping you posted throughout what we anticipate to be a multi-year collaboration.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Our plan is to offer you something distinct and special.”</p><p>The premium collaboration comes at a premium price, however. Buying everything in the set costs 1,975 Super Credits, an in-game currency players can slowly earn while playing or pay roughly $20 per 2,100 for. That makes the <em>Killzone</em> set the most expensive gear you can currently purchase in the <em>Starship Troopers</em>-inspired alien shooter, a game regularly priced at $40 with battle passes called Warbonds that include many more unlockables for just $10 each. </p><figure id="" data-id="eba5b8802d4b9a464ab45e29884a1965" data-recommend-id="image://eba5b8802d4b9a464ab45e29884a1965" data-format="png" data-width="1894" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows new items for purchase in Helldivers 2.

But unlike those games, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is not free-to-play and has already set a certain precedent for its in-game pricing system. Within that existing framework, the Helghast tributes look great but feel way overpriced. They’re also only in the shop for five days, meaning players can’t even take their time trying to grind for Super Credits across hundreds of missions. </p><p>“No set should costs over 1000sc,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one thread</a></span> currently shooting up to the top of the<em> Helldivers 2</em> subreddit. “Even if we forget the armor set, a new AR??

Players who have purchased every Warbond since the game launched without using free credits would have spent $90 by this point.</p><p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani took to the game’s Discord to try and diffuse the situation. “Hey - quick comment on the Helghast stuff,” he wrote on Wednesday. “Firstly - this is our first collaboration so we’ll be figuring it out as we go along. Let us know what you’d like to see in the future. Secondly it’s optional - the more of this we sell - the more illuminate type stuff we can keep dropping for free.”</p><p>The suggestion that players need to swallow higher prices in order to keep getting free updates didn’t go over to well. “You cannot be serious,” wrote one player in response. “These prices are fucking egregious. Your game is NOT FREE. We have already paid, you don’t get to hide behind a 20 dollar skin as if that makes the difference.” Jorjani simply wrote back, “noted!”</p><p>One of the biggest games of 2024, <em>Helldivers 2</em> has previously butted heads with its community a couple of times this year. The first was over a controversial PSN login requirement on Steam that saw the game’s rating review-bombed to smithereens until it reversed course. The second was a series of patches nerfing some of players’ favorite gear and loadouts, including things they’d purchased from paid Warbonds, which eventually lead the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269">to commit to an apology tour</a></span> of buffing things instead and focusing on addressing performance, stability, and other issues in the meantime. </p><p>That recent revival was capped off with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">the free Omens of Tyranny update this month</a></span>, that added the game’s third Illuminate faction and new urban warfare maps. It’s a great new chapter in the game’s ongoing Galactic War whose fanfare might be cut short by the bungled <em>Killzone </em>skin rollout, even if the studio was banking on those to help pay for it. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>XDefiant is preparing for the ultimate wind-down ahead of its inevitable closure in just a few months. It was recently confirmed by Ubisoft that XDefiant will be taken offline on June 3, 2025, but before then, the team has pushed out one final patch that includes a staggering amount of content.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1869382398929965418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> and confirmed by Mark Rubin on Twitter, the season three update for XDefiant includes additional content from <strong>the next five seasons</strong>, which will otherwise never see the light of day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-a-farewell">What a Farewell</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter, Mark Rubin explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft has not only allowed a small team to stay on and continue working to get our Season 3 content out the door, but we’ve also been able to add some extra content to this release from future seasons. </p>



<p>So, we have our Season 3 content plus some of the content from Season 4, 5, 6,7 and even Season 8. </p>



<p>We are adding 3 new factions this patch with the Assassin’s of course that was planned for Season 3 but also Wolves and Omega Force from Seasons 4 and 5 respectively.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Along with the new factions come six new ‘Arena’ maps and three new ‘Linear’ maps that were planned to be released further down the line. That’s a total of 13 new maps – but if you’ve never downloaded XDefiant, you’ll not be able to access them, which makes them somewhat rare.</p>



<p>This includes a new ‘Rayman map’ that was scheduled for a takeover event midway through season four.</p>



<p>Also, season three marks the arrival of a more esports-focused mode: Defuse. This is the traditional one-life bomb mode that serves as the foundation for games like Rainbow Six Siege and Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>Those still playing will also have access to ‘Lum Hunt’, ‘Tilt’, ‘Turbo XD’, and a vs-bots mode</p>



<p>This is all in addition to new weapons such as the G36K, M1A, and Diceros pistol. Everything that was added behind battle passes has been unlocked for the audience still able to access the game.</p>



<p>It’s one hell of an update, but it’s a farewell patch at best for XDefiant.</p>

                <p>There hasn't been a new game in the Marvel vs. Capcom series since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-review/1900-6416760/" data-ref-id="1900-6416760">Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite</a> was released in 2017. Now, players may have a good reason to come back to that title thanks to an upcoming fan-mod, Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond, which gives the game an almost literal fresh coat of paint. Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond will be released on December 20 and will only be available on PC. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PXorZjVETFQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond was originally started by a modder called WistfulHopes before the project was taken over by Maximillian “Maximilian Dood” Christiansen, who assembled a team to create new art and music, as well as a throwback visual style that more closely resembles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds-review/1900-6298807/" data-ref-id="1900-6298807">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a> than Infinite. The results speak for themselves.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/474516/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-beyond-mod-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Christiansen said he spent $30,000 of his own money to pay the artists and programmers who were enlisted for this project. And since this mod will be released for free, Christiansen won't be making any of that back. Regardless, Christiansen told the outlet that he has no regrets over his investment of time and money.</p><p>"Nobody played [Infinite] because of visuals and roster stuff," said Christiansen. "If the one thing that I can do within my power and budgetary scope is to fix the visuals, something that actually makes it look better, [something that] will get people to even play it, that's the goal--for you to go to Steam and buy Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, [download] our mod, and change the game."</p><p>Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite is discounted to $7 at GameSpot sister site Fanatical right now. Earlier this year, Capcom released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-review-new-age-of-heroes/1900-6418278/" data-ref-id="1900-6418278">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection</a> for PlayStation 4, PC, and Switch. That collection will also hit Xbox One sometime in 2025.</p>

			<p>If you're looking for a way to celebrate the festive season in Mortal Kombat 1, then look no longer. It's been announced today by Warner Bros. Games that new holiday-themed in-game events will be arriving at the game from December 19 through to December 30. These events will be staggered across the days, with each event providing different rewards upon completion. The rewards come in the form of new character palettes, of which the details will be provided below. The events comprise five new Towers of Time events, which are free events available to all owners of Mortal Kombat 1. Below are all of the details you need about these events so you can pick and choose which ones you want to participate in based on the character palettes that you can unlock.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloody Snow&nbsp;</strong>Tower (December 19-25) - Yuletide Necromancer &amp; Christmas Evil character palettes for Quan Chi</li>
<li><strong>Naughty List</strong> Tower (December 21-26) - Souls of Winter &amp; Holiday Collection palettes for Ermac</li>
<li><strong>A Christmas Krampus</strong> Tower (December 23-30) Holiday Hero &amp; Winter Wonderman palettes for Takeda</li>
<li><strong>'Twas the Night</strong> Tower (December 25-30) - Angel on High &amp; Holidazzle palettes for Cyrax</li>
<li><strong>Final Present</strong> Tower (December 26-30) - Eat, Drink, and Be Lethal &amp; Bah, Humbug palettes for Sektor</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these character palettes, players will be given the option to purchase new holiday skins for Kameo Fighters Frost and Sareena, as well as the previously released festive skins Santa's Helper Reptile, Krampus General Shao and Mrs. Klause Kitana.</p>
<p>For those who aren't owners of Mortal Kombat 1 yet, there is now the option to purchase the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Kollection, which is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store. This collection includes the main Mortal Kombat 1 game, as well as the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion, the previous Kombat Pack, and 1,250 Dragon Krystals.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you already own the game but you don't have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/">Khaos Reigns content</a>, you can upgrade your version of the game with Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, which will provide you with a new story expansion, as well as Konbat Pack 2, which adds Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot to the game. There are also some new guest fighters on the way that will be added to the game via Kombat Pack 2. This includes Ghostface, who is already in the game, as well as one-week early access to guest fighter Conan the Barbarian, who is set to be released on January 21. T-1000 Terminator is also set to join Mortal Kombat 1 but doesn't yet have an official release date.</p>
<p>What character palettes will you be aiming for this year?</p>

			<p>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition has officially launched for free on<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ark-ultimate-mobile-edition/id6639622324" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studiowildcard.arkuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a> today, with the game being completely free to play for those who want to get stuck into the Dino adventure. This announcement came from Grove Street Games and publisher Snail Games in partnership with Studio Wildcard. This is a brand-new free <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">adaptation of ARK</a>, serving as a massive mobile dino-adventure that will include the full-scale experience of ARK: Survival Evolved, as well as the ARK Expansion Packs. This consists of Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, Genesis Parts 1 &amp; 2, and the fan-favorite Ragnarok map that was created by the community. This is just the tip of the dino-shaped iceberg, as there is plenty more that will be available in this mobile adventure, with a promise of thousands of gameplay hours.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to get their games through the Epic Games Store mobile marketplace, it will soon be available there. If you're not sure how ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition is panning out, you can check out the gameplay launch trailer below, which gives you a glimpse into what you can expect. The trailer is just over a minute long, and showcases some of the key features of the game, the same features that are in the PC and console versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U014C9C2X60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition comes with massive worlds for you to explore, with over 150 dinosaurs and creatures to tame and train as your own, as well as multiplayer tribe dynamics so that you can partner up with friends. Of course, it wouldn't be ARK without the crafting and building experience, which you will be able to dive into from the outset. The app launches today with the original ARK Island Map, Scorched Earth, and Aberration expansions. The rest of the expansions will be available for players by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>For those interested, there is also the option to opt-in to a subscription service called the ARK Pass. If you want to subscribe to the ARK Pass, it's available at a $4.99 monthly cost or a $49.99 annual subscription price, whichever is preferable for you. By having access to the ARK Pass, you will get access to every current and future Expansion Pack, as well as monthly bonuses. These bonuses include God Console, giving you access to console commands if you're playing in a single-player, bonus XP in all game modes, monthly drops of free 'Keys,' and exclusive access to servers.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Expansion Packs and features for ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition can also be purchased separately, depending on what you prefer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-trailer-dc-universe-1851724194<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In our cynical timeline, hype is no longer something that’s generated organically on the basis of mass enthusiasm but rather something, we are instructed, that we already feel. So it is that tomorrow’s teaser trailer for the upcoming James Gunn-led relaunch of the DC cinematic universe, <em>Superman</em>, has just received its own teaser trailer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Given the premise—a piece of marketing material designed to have you intrigued to watch a forthcoming piece of marketing material that’s designed to have you intrigued to watch a film—the resulting diminishing returns are a collection of shots that tell us almost nothing whatsoever about the film it’s all intended to promote. We see reaction shots of people’s astonishment at seeing—presumably—a man who can fly, stop bullets, and leap tall buildings in a single bound. We also see less than a second of the super man himself.</p><p>Well shit, it worked, didn’t it? We posted it.</p><p>Let’s insist we’re doing it as a cultural observation of the sheer audacity of hype, of the fever pitch Warner Bros. and DC Studios are informing us we’ve reached, over finally seeing a tangible glimpse of this movie. They likely wanted that, too.</p><p>What strikes me as most interesting about what <em>is</em> shown here is how defiantly generic it is when it comes to Superman-based media. Forgetting the shots of crowds looking agog that makes up the bulk of the footage, we’ve got a glimpse of a generic Daily Planet office (including Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane and Skyler Gisondo’s Jimmy Olsen), a split-picosecond moment of Superman flying through the ice inevitably surrounding his Fortress of Solitude, and a tiny dot of Superman disappearing up into the clouds. Each could be lifted from just about any adaptation of the character, from the early ‘90s <em>Lois &amp; Clark</em> to the grey slop of 2006’s <em>Superman Returns</em>—hell, we only know it’s not from 1948's <em>Superman </em>serial or 2013's <em>Man of Steel </em>because it’s in color.</p><figure id="" data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rotten Tomatoes Trailers / DC Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, it’s also arguable that all of this is an act of boldness, a real statement from Gunn (although who knows how involved he is in the marketing), and that’s  backed up by two other factors: the title and the score.</p><p>Calling your movie <em>Superman</em>, with no subtitle, is a statement. There already was a <em>Superman</em>, in 1978, and Richard Donner’s version has never been improved upon in any of the six films across three relaunches since (let alone the character’s repeated flogging in Snyder’s DCU). It was originally to be called <em>Superman: Legacy</em>, and dropping the suffix is ballsy. Gunn invites direct comparison with the Christopher Reeve classic—a beautifully shot movie that holds up almost 50 years later.</p><p>Then there’s the theme. It’s right there, subtle at first, then—amid the obligatory bassy “thommmm”s that all superhero movie trailers must feature by law—out emerges a faint rendition of John Williams’ classic tune. Again, it’s an unflinching declaration that this film is operating at the same level and evoking the same tonal reverence as the classic that, arguably, both ushered in the era of the modern superhero film, and defined it.</p><p>Gunn’s a fun movie maker, and has had well-deserved success via funny, schlocky films like <em>Slither</em> and <em>Super</em>, followed by the cartoon-like jubilance and hilarity of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> trilogy and <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. I’m genuinely excited that he’s trying to make something un-terrible from DC properties, ending the era of Snyder’s well-intentioned but grimly dreary attempts, and he’s an obvious fit for the sillier, more subversive side of the comic franchise. But playing <em>Superman</em> this straight, this on-the-nose? I’m fascinated to see what comes of it. Even if I doubt tomorrow’s “teaser” will tell us anything useful.</p><p>My desperate hope is that this could be, finally, <em>finally</em>, the moment someone writes a <em>Superman </em>script that doesn’t depend on unSupermanning him in order to introduce any peril or plot. My “time to Kryptonite” stopwatch will be running, and god, I hope it never has to stop. It’s the great flaw of the great American hero, that the only way anyone can find for an invincible, all-powerful god-like to be interesting on film is to incessantly make him incapable and all-vulnerable, and rely on enemy hubris to save the day.</p><p>(Massive shout-out to CW’s recently finished <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, which despite featuring some hoary old cliches and a miserable over-reliance on all shades of Kryptonite, managed to make Clark Kent vulnerable in <em>far </em>more interesting ways, not least in its extraordinary third-season arc following Lois’s cancer story.)</p><p>So, are you hyped for the teaser trailer to hype the six months of trailer-trailers, to hype the movie, ahead of its July 11, 2025 release date? I really hope we’re not exhausted by its simple existence by then.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Oh, and all these items are only available for five days before they’re rotated out of the store.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth putting these prices into context. 1,000 SC costs $9.99 / £7.99 in the in-game store. One of Helldivers 2’s premium Warbonds costs 1,000 Super Credits, which means that if you want all the Killzone items, you’re looking at just shy of twice the price of a premium Warbond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, there will be Helldivers 2 players who have Super Credits saved up after nearly a year of playing the game, and it’s worth noting that you can unlock 300 Super Credits in Warbonds with your medals, or find them out and about by looting in gameplay. But the fact remains that these items are also being sold for real-world money, and the pricing is unlike anything fans have seen so far in Helldivers 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Killzone assault rifle has sparked renewed pay-to-win accusations from some in the game’s community, despite it being considered a bit of a downgrade compared to already available guns. The Helldivers subreddit is already littered with complaints, many of which point out that Helldivers 2 is not a free game and so should take a different approach to monetization.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/hd-1734537347269.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Some Helldivers 2 players say the Killzone items are too expensive.

Even if we forget the armor set, a new AR?? They seriously add a new gun and lock it behind a 600 Super Credit paywall!?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“615 SC for a primary weapon is straight up ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyz51/615_sc_for_a_primary_weapon_is_straight_up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added Goopmaster_</a>. “I get the game needs to be monetized in some way, I get that the devs’ work isn’t free, but charging half a Warbond price for an assault rifle with no optic is straight up nonsense.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I knew it was a slippery slope, but didn't think we'd reach that part of the slope already,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/comment/m2n69yx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SovietMarma commented</a>. “I've willingly paid for 1,000 SC packs for each and every Warbond release so I could support the game and buy the Super Store armors that came with them. Don't think I'll be doing the same here.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Arrowhead said the Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 belongs to a new tier of “special” premium content reserved for collaborations and other “uniquely-themed work.” “Our plan is to offer you something distinct and special,” the developer added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">Helldivers 2’s recent Illuminate update</a> breathed new life into the game, sparking a resurgence in players and enthusiasm around the addition of a new faction to fight against. But as has been the case multiple times during the game’s rollercoaster first year of live service, it’s a case of one step forward, two steps back for community sentiment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, as you'd expect, fans are taking to Steam user reviews to express their dissatisfaction over the Killzone prices. "The Superstore items are straight scams," one negative review reads. "Such a shame after such a great update."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Ultizero Games has revealed a new gameplay trailer for Lost Soul Aside. It will launch for PS5 and PC in 2025, although no specific date was given yet. It's an action game that looks like it plays similar to a Devil May Cry game with the visuals of a Final Fantasy game.</p><p>The trailer shows the main character, Kazer, in a snowy tundra setting fighting some big opponents, including some sort of ice monster and ice wolf. The gameplay features frenetic action and chaining together combos to pull off flashy attacks. It also looks like players will have a companion, as a woman is seen joining the heat of battle.</p>
