            <p>
Beleagured high street chain GAME will no longer sell physical games, other than fulfilling pre-orders. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/news/game-ending-in-store-video-game-sales/">Gfinity</a> report which states that upcoming new launches will need to be pre-ordered before launch to be picked up in store. 
</p>
<p>
The same is true of video game consoles, the report goes on, suggesting that outside of hardware launches you will no longer be able to walk into a shop and buy a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S off the shelf.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted GAME for more detail.

<p>
The move would be the latest radical change to GAME's operation this year, following the end of both its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">long-running trade-in scheme</a> - meaning you can no longer buy or exchange pre-owned games - and the shutdown of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">GAME Elite reward programme</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">Eurogamer reported how many GAME staff had been moved to zero-hour contracts, with others made redundant</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the changes to GAME are part of a wider move to operate the brand largely within concession units for other stores owned by its parent company the Frasers Group - such as Sports Direct.
</p>
<p>
Much of GAME's floor space and sales are now taken up by toys and collectables such as Funko Pops. Still, a GAME where you can't even buy physical games is the chain's most surprising move yet.

            <p>
With the release of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring players are back to their old tricks by playing the game in weird and wonderful ways.
</p>
<p>
Take Twitch streamer Perrikaryal, who's already played the game with her mind and is now tackling Shadow of the Erdtree. Yes, you read that right.
</p>
<p>
Perrikaryal uses a bluetooth, portable EEG reader to analyse patterns of brain activity and, along with an eye-tracker, convert these to inputs. She then thinks about specific actions, which trigger rolls, attacks and the like in game - <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/perrikaryal/clip/SpinelessFilthyPresidentShazBotstix-NCMKhK02R5dFDFsE">here's an explanation clip</a>.

<p>

This has allowed the streamer to complete Elden Ring without using a traditional controller. And now, with the DLC released last Friday, she's already beaten its second major boss. 
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>WE DID IT AGAIN</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree, SECOND boss, Renalla, DEFEATED with mind control, and ZERO HANDS.

<p>
Another streamer is back on the base game, but every dodge roll in the game is performed with an actual roll in real life.
</p>
<p>
GoodGameEthan began this run five months ago, playing the game with a controller until the time comes to dodge and he barrel rolls across a mat. So far he's up to Maliketh, but aims to play the DLC this way too.
</p>
<p>
"I tried really hard to beat the game before the DLC but my knees gave out on me after two hours fighting Godfrey this morning," he said in a comment on reddit. "Will try to beat the game before I tackle the DLC."
</p>

Lastly, streamer itzCBD has completed the entire base game from NG to NG+7 without dying a single time and without levelling up at all.
</p>
<p>
That's eight full playthroughs of the game with the same Wretch class character remaining at level one. 
</p> <div>

<p>
It's a hugely impressive feat, and along with others shows just how accomplished Elden Ring players have become after beating the base game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-defeats-elden-rings-malenia-in-dance-pad-and-controller-simultaneous-challenge-run">dance pads</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-beaten-with-an-actual-banana">bananas</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
Still, Shadow of the Erdtree bumps up the difficulty of the game, which - along with performance issues - has resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-falls-to-a-mixed-steam-rating-as-pc-players-complain-about-difficulty-and-performance">Mixed response on Steam from unhappy players</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-and-xbox-technical-differences-negligible/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The technical differences between PlayStation and Xbox consoles are so negligible nowadays that one standard home console would benefit games more than the current platform war between Sony and Microsoft, according to a former PlayStation head.</p>
<p>Speaking during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHf5avkORyc">a panel</a> held during IGN Live 2024 regarding where we will be playing games in the future, former PlayStation head Shawn Layden commented on the platform war between Sony and Microsoft, saying that if we got it out of the way and had one standard home console, games would be better. Nowadays, technical differences between PlayStation and Xbox are negligible, as both are using the same hardware from AMD.</p>
<p><em>"Xbox, PlayStation, high-end PC, that's almost at a plateau where all things being equal, they're pretty much the same. We'd be in a better world if we could get down to one standard home console technology that we could come together, and get this platform war thing out of the way."</em></p>
<p>The former PlayStation head also commented on the console market, which is currently struggling, but this, according to Layden, is nothing new. The global install base in any previous console generation never rose above 250 million, with the only exception being the Wii era, as some software, such as Wii Fit, appealed to an audience that doesn't usually play games. Those numbers were clearly not sustainable, and the install base went back to the 250 million overall of every other generation. The increased revenue during the pandemic, additionally, did not come from new people entering the console gaming world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Where Will You Be Playing Games in the Future? | IGN Live 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHf5avkORyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time in recent times we have heard that Sony and Xbox hardware is essentially the same. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-needed-advancing-visuals/">April</a>, well-known AMD leaker Kepler talked about how all hardware vendors have converged to very similar designs, and, as such, there's barely any difference between CPUs and GPUs from different vendors, and optimizing for one vendor essentially applies to all others. With Microsoft opening up to releasing some of its titles to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, one really has to wonder if the platform war will indeed go away at some point, although Nintendo is unlikely to retire from the hardware market anytime soon, considering how successful its systems continue to be.</p>

        <p>It has also launched a non-compliance investigation in response to Apple's business terms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The European Commission has found Apple in breach of its Digital Markets Act following <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eu-commission-investigates-google-meta-and-apple-for-possible-digital-markets-act-violations">an investigation launched in March</a> against the firm.</p>
<p>In its preliminary findings, the EU Commission said it found Apple's rules of engagement did not comply with the DMA because it "prevent[s] app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content."</p>
<p>The EU Commission found that Apple's business terms do not allow developers to freely communicate with consumers to promote alternative app stores, and that while the firm does allow steering by allowing developers to include links to web pages in their apps, they are met with several restrictions.</p>
<p>This includes Apple's "core technology fee" which sees developers pay €0.50 for every app install per year after the first install distributed via the App Store and alternative marketplaces.</p>
<p>The regulator has also launched a non-compliance investigation in response to Apple's business terms, including the core technology fee, eligibility requirements for developers, and the process to download alternative app stores on iPhones.</p>
<p>As a result, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-apple-facing-1bn-daily-fines-over-alleged-dma-breaches">Apple could face daily fines of up to 5% of the company's average turnover</a>, amounting to over $1 billion.</p>
<p>"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases," the regulator said.</p>

            <p>Pirates of the Caribbean is coming to Fortnite next month.</p>
<p>Last week's update to Fortnite included characters and content set to be part of the crossover, and initially an event pass featuring Captain Jack Sparrow was made available to buy. Dataminers quickly discovered other characters set to arrive as well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">solidifying rumours</a> that emerged several months back when Fortnite's 2024 roadmap first leaked. </p>
<p>Now, acknowledging the event pass' early sale, developer Epic Games has confirmed the crossover's official release: 19th July.</p>

<p>As you may recall, several of the leaked roadmap's upcoming events – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">such as Billie Eilish coming to the game in April</a> – have since turned out to be true, adding credence to reports that a Pirates of the Caribbean crossover was also on the way.</p>
<p>This time, notable Fortnite leaker Hypex took to social media platform X with a new image showing off Davy Jones, Hector Barbossa, and Elizabeth Swann, who look to be purchasable separately from the event pass.</p>
<p>There's also a new pirate-themed item, Ship in the Bottle – described as "a cursed ship trapped in a bottle. Open it to unleash the ship from its ghostly depths, diving into your opponents with a devastating crash!" – and a Jack Sparrow "Jar of Dirt" emote.</p> <div>

<p>Hypex says the Pirates of the Caribbean shop will open on 18th July, 2024, whilst fellow leaker ShiinaBR reckons the crossover event itself is scheduled to kick off the following day.</p>
<p>Hypex was one of the first to spot that The Pirates of the Caribbean pass had been placed for sale early, before Epic stepped in to ensure it was <a href="https://x.com/thedarkvortex13/status/1804517742768214028">swiftly removed</a>. Those who did manage to buy it say they <a href="https://x.com/ItzHarcos/status/1804411760285286532">"didn't get anything but the skin"</a> - for now.</p> <div>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Epic confirmed that anyone who purchased the Cursed Sails Pass ahead of its 19th July release date would not be able to "progress the pass until the start of the event", and invited players to apply for refunds if they didn't want to wait.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>For players who purchased the Cursed Sails Pass ahead of its intended release on July 19, please note you are currently unable to progress the Pass until the start of the event, but will retain your Jack Sparrow outfit in the meantime.</p><p>If you wish to instead refund this purchase… <a href="https://t.co/i3FdtuNSLW">pic.twitter.com/i3FdtuNSLW</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1804535483571007684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metallica-headlines-fortnite-as-it-introduces-a-new-music-themed-battle-mode-and-fresh-concert">Did you see Metallica's Fortnite concert over the weekend</a>?  Not only did the metal band headline the game's next Fortnite Festival season, but all four of Metallica's members are now unlockable as skins in the mode's next Festival Pass.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a recent Fortnite update notably adds a new competitive way to play Festival: Battle Stage. As Tom explained for us at the time, here 16 players face off against each other via a song chosen at random, with your Overdrive operating as an attack power to take other players down a peg. Or, you can team up with a four-person party of friends and pick specific tunes to fight over.</p>

            <p>Despite an overwhelmingly strong reception with critics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> is currently sitting at a ‘mixed’ review rating on Steam, with nay-sayers citing performance issues and overbearing enemy design. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-3-tips">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-review">Blood And Wine</a>’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.</p>

<p>On the technical side, recent negative reviews highlight stutters, drops, and low frame rates. As for gameplay, there’s a thread of players hitting breaking point with boss and enemy design, both in terms of difficulty scaling and boss attack patterns. To elucidate, although not dismiss, these complaints: Shadow Of The Erdtree implements a new progression system where players are required to explore and collect Scadutree Fragments in order to be on par with much of the DLC’s content outside the base area. As such, the damage that Erdtree’s enemies both dish out and take is scaled differently from the base game. The DLC has only been out a few days, so its possible players are attempting to best the high level content without being fully prepared.</p>
<p>As for boss design itself, players repeatedly mention lengthy attack combos, unreadable boss tells, and encounters that otherwise seem to prioritise difficulty over enjoyment. These same criticisms were levelled against some of the bosses in the base game, and it seems the arms-race design of the DLC has, for some, exacerbated these issues.</p>
<p>Speaking personally, I’ve got mixed feelings on the mixed reviews. I’m sympathetic towards anyone who felt alienated by Elden Ring’s critical reception, homogeneous and aggressively superlative as it was. It feels like, in distilling both what was good and bad about the base game, FromSoft have pushed a section of the playerbase to voice their issues with the DLC. That said, and strangely enough, I’m actually finding most of Erdtree’s bosses to be far fairer and more thoughtfully designed than the more difficult encounters found in the original release. It feels as if FromSoft have returned to the boss design of old somewhat. However, I am wearing extremely heavy armour, and I’ve also scoured the map for Scadutree fragments, so I'm basically a tank at this point. I’ve seen clips of people getting one shot by bosses, which must be extremely frustrating. </p>
<p>I think pushback on universally well-reviewed games - providing it's presented respectfully - is a good thing. No-one wants a critical monoculture. Players should absolutely voice the criticisms they have, but I do find myself asking if they'd be any less disappointed if they’d beaten the thing in a weekend? If we can say anything about FromSoft's games, it's that their resistance to instant mastery or comprehension makes them monumentally unsuitable for the culture of accelerated, reactive discourse in which we find ourselves. Friction, I suppose, was inevitable, and I do hope these players eventually find the joy in the game they've bought, even if it's just in the bizarrely serene ghost worms.</p>

            <p>Happy Monday all! Yes, I wrote that with total sincerity. We all deserve a happy Monday - perhaps video games can help with that. As you'd expect, Elden Ring's recently released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC remains this week's Big Kahuna, with no obvious mega releases in the offing to break its chokehold on the discourse, but I have dipped my latex-gloved hand into the gestation pools and fished out a few promising oddities.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 24th June kicks off with bone-throwing dungeon solitaire <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/">Dice &amp; Fold</a>. On Tuesday 25th June, we've got the remake of mystical 90s point-and-clicker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/">Riven</a> - now with real-time 3D environments, shock - together with magic realist high school visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/">Until Then</a> and Argentinian folk horror <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2761100/Pomberito/"> Pomberito</a>, in which a farmer must survive five nights while investigating a local beastie. Skipping forward to Thursday 27th June, there's some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807170/Stray_Gods_Orpheus/">Orpheus DLC for RPG musical Stray Gods</a>, and the early access launch of 30 player last-person-stand 'em up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287920/BATTLE_CRUSH/">Battle Crush</a>. On Friday 28th June, there's the early access release of tornado-chasing simulation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1107320/OUTBRK/">OUTBRK</a>, which has you monitoring rogue weather on a 625 square kilometre map. </p>
<p>Here at the RPS Treehouse we'll be spending a fair bit of the week feeding the Maw freshly-hewn pieces of Erdtree, but we'll also be running our mitts over a co-op anime shooter I won't spoil, dredging up long-forgotten Aliens games, and possibly finding time for a stylised retro FPS or two. The Maw would typically consider this spartan fare, but there's so much molten Elden Ring DLC running through its cyclopean veins I think we'll get away with it. Even the Maw needs time to digest.</p>

    I played a bit of knightly platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/662340/Renaine/">Renaine</a>'s demo over the weekend and enjoyed it. While Shovel Knight is the obvious comparison, I also get a very faint Mystery Dungeon vibe from it.

			<p>Sony may be working to bring proper PlayStation 3 backward compatibility to PlayStation 5, although only for select titles, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@XboxEra"> XboxEra podcast</a>, Shpeshal Nick revealed that he's heard that Sony is working on bringing backward compatibility for select PlayStation 3 titles on the current-generation consoles. The compatible titles will apparently also be sold individually, similarly to what Microsoft did with Xbox backward compatibility. Unfortunately, it is not yet known if the PS3 games compatible with PlayStation 5 will receive performance or visual improvements. It's also unknown which games would be selected to be playable on PlayStation 5, although Nick speculates it could be mostly first-party titles, which would make sense.</p>
<p><iframe title="The XboxEra Podcast | LIVE | Episode 217 - &quot;It Lives!”" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwVRYZGPWEA?start=10683&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Proper PlayStation 3 backward compatibility for PlayStation 5 would be huge, as right now, PlayStation 3 titles are only playable on the console via cloud streaming, which doesn't always deliver the best possible experience. The fact that titles would be available for purchase individually would be big as well, allowing users to enjoy them without requiring the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-plus-to-launch-this-june-premium-subscription-to-give-access-to-classic-ps3-ps2-ps1-and-psp-games/">PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</a> that is now needed to access PS3 games via cloud streaming. As it always is with rumors, however, we must take everything with a grain of salt until Sony makes an official announcement.</p>

            <p>BAFTA has tweaked some eligibility criteria and rules for its Games Awards, starting from the 2025 edition.</p>
<p>Two categories, Game Design and Technical Achievement, will now be voted in the first round by two dedicated voting chapters whose members have expertise in these crafts, rather than all BAFTA members.</p>
<p>Criteria has also been tweaked for two categories: New Intellectual Property will now take into account the "originality and innovation" of the IP, while the Evolving Game award will now only take into consideration titles that have "substantial future updates" on their roadmap.</p>
<p>When it comes to entering the Best Game and British Game categories, eligible titles that have entered other categories will automatically be enrolled in these going forward. With the previous rules, teams needed to opt-in for these awards.</p>
<p>Entries for the British Game category will also need to answer additional questions relating to DEI, bullying, and harassment in the games industry.</p>
<p>"This work will support the BFI Diversity Standards for Games and build on BAFTA's long-standing work to help tackle bullying and harassment across the screen industries, as part of our wider, ongoing collective cross-sector activity," BAFTA explained.</p>
<p>More info about criteria and eligibility can be found on <a href="https://awards.bafta.org/entry">BAFTA's website</a>.</p>
<p>The 2025 BAFTA Games Awards are set to take place in spring 2025. Entries are now open, for games released between November 25, 2023 and November 15, 2024.</p>
<p>Studios have until November 7 to enter, with the longlist then revealed in December, and the shortlist of nominations in March 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-bafta-games-awards-2024">Baldur's Gate 3 was the big winner of this year's BAFTA</a>, winning five awards including Best Game.</p>

<p>A full week! Wow!</p>



<p>Hey we launched this thing and boy the support you’ve shown sure has made this stressful process a million times easier. We’re still working out some bugs and quality of life issues, but the thing I’ve been most excited about is putting amazing words onto a website again.</p>



<p>Here’s a rundown of everything you absolutely have to check out from our first week of going live!</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/the-sex-of-snake-eaters-cure-system/">Stupid Sexy Snake</a></h2>



<p>That’s the name of the file Moira Hicks sent to me for edits for her piece about the sex found in <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>‘s CURE system where Snake has to be told how to carefully tend to his many wounds in the field. It is a wild read and <em>the</em> thing I edited over the past few months that made me go “oh we’re so fucking back.” Moira wrote a few of my favorite pieces at Fanbyte, most of which are totally gone from the internet at this point!</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>The Merritt K Double Feature</h2>



<p>It was such a joy getting to edit Merritt’s pieces again. The first is a rundown of <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-hidden-legacy-of-early-japanese-pc-games/">Japanese PC games</a> that inspired a whole heap of modern stuff you probably love! The second is a lamentation of the <a href="https://vgbees.com/dropped-connection-the-loss-of-local-handheld-multiplayer/">loss of local connection</a> via video games like Streetpass. I loved both of these pieces and I think you will, too!</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/pentiment-and-the-age-of-misinformation/">Power &amp; Communication By Way of Pentiment</a></h2>



<p>Andrei Filote handed in a draft I couldn’t stop reading in the form of this essay about modern misinformation campaigns and the historical analogue found in <em>Pentiment</em>, one of this website’s favorite games of the last decade.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/third-party-hardware-bans-leave-disabled-gamers-light-on-options/">Third Party Hardware Bans Throw Obstacles At Disabled Gamers</a></h2>



<p>Grant Stoner has been one of my favorite disability and accessibility writers in the games space for ages and I’m so glad he did this report on the controversial third party hardware bans levied by console manufacturers.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/hades-ii-understands-the-importance-of-camaraderie/">Return of the King</a></h2>



<p>Diego “El Rey” Argüello has graced us with his presence with this wonderful piece about <em>Hades II</em> and its keen understanding of rivalry and camaraderie. He paints a beautiful picture on the subtle ways the sequel sets itself apart from its timeless, near-perfect predecessor.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/the-top-10-video-games-bees-of-all-time/">These Are The Bees</a></h2>



<p>What would the launch of VFBees be without a definitive list of the very best bees from all of video games. You know, the best Vee Gee Bees? I’m glad I enlisted Izzy Kestrel to do the job for me. She was able to wrangle the finest bees this side of Hudson Soft.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/scooby-dooby-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-love-the-doo/">ZOINKS</a></h2>



<p>Ryan Easby going all-in on this rundown of Scooby-Doo games from the late 90s into the PS2 era was a wild ride! I now know so much more than I did before and isn’t that just the most magical thing about what we do?</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-needs-to-pick-a-direction/">Happy Birthday Sonic!!!</a></h2>



<p>Sonic turned 33 this week and who else would we have to celebrate the Blue Blur than Sean Aitchison with his debut for the site. He went deep on how the Sonic Team can’t seem to settle on a creative vision for the hedgehog’s AAA products even has he finds enormous success everywhere else. <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-sonic-adventure-pose-a-review/">Also hey that <em>Sonic Adventure </em>pose was cool.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/the-industrys-future-is-unwritten-make-sure-youre-holding-the-pen/">We’re Not Going Away</a></h2>



<p>I’m so glad Imran Khan decided to write something for our debut! As cloudy as the outlook seems for games in so many ways, the determined defiance in his piece resonated with me as we launched a new thing!</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>I Wrote Some Stuff, Too</h2>



<p>I had some thoughts, too. And not just the <a href="https://vgbees.com/stingers/">Stingers</a> I keep putting on the site every day! Those are fun to make.</p>



<p>I think M. Bison’s return feels right even though maybe they should’ve left him for dead. <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-return-of-m-bison-shows-the-lasting-allure-of-street-fighter-iis-designs/">I understand why they didn’t</a>! I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>‘s redebut felt really weird. <a href="https://vgbees.com/metroid-primes-return-to-the-stage-felt-weird-right/">I tried to put my finger on it</a>. I played <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> at SGF and <a href="https://vgbees.com/fear-the-spotlight-scared-me-in-little-ways/">liked it a lot</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/podcasts/">We’re Talking, Too</a></h2>



<p>My partner in crime, Niki Grayson, and I are back talking to each other about video games with the official VGBees Podcast. This week we had Merritt K on to talk about <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> and all of the wild games that keep coming out under that license. The week before we had Game Informer &amp; MinnMax’s Charles Harte on. It’s a great show! You should subscribe!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I absolutely love Elden Ring, and I love FromSoftware games in general – I quite literally have an Artorias tattoo on my shin. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">Elden Ring</a> is, in my opinion, sort of the pinnacle of the design philosophies so far, and while I appreciate it’s not completely perfect, I do think it’s very close. With all of this in mind, I’m very split on Shadow of the Erdtree, and it’s causing me no end of pain.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-Xh4vbs6go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree opens up with another stunning reveal. You chat to a mysterious NPC, and then get warped to the new time and/or place with a new world about to open up before you once more. This time, instead of Limgrave’s almost hopeful horizon, you’re in a strange field filled with spectral tombstones and the sight of some seriously gnarly trees in one direction and a big flaming Wickerman boss in another. It’s a truly excellent beginning, and I have a great deal of love for this specific moment.</p>


<p>From there, as is the case with the main game, you can go anywhere and try to fight anything you encounter. You can absolutely wander up to some bosses in the overworld or head to one of the new big dungeons and throw the gauntlet down, but you really shouldn’t. That’s because of something called Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ash. Revered Spirit Ash basically powers up your spirit summons, and Scadutree Fragments boost your offensive and defensive powers. These only work in the DLC, and they’re clearly introduced as a way to try and add a progression system into this new area so you still get that difficulty that many of us love from FromSoftware games.</p>


<p>I think it’s a good concept, but I also don’t think it’s especially well-implemented, and nor do I believe it fits with the rest of the game’s design. Don’t get me wrong, I’m looking forward to watching DLC speedruns that don’t use a single one of these items because they play these games as a full-time job, but good gravy is that not viable for the rest of us. The result is that, until you gather these upgrade, you get killed in one or two hits by nearly everything. It doesn’t matter if you’ve built a character with 99 vigour and the heaviest armour ever created because you’re still going to get smashed into pieces; they’ll just be bigger and better-armoured pieces.</p>
<p>It feels as though Shadow of the Erdtree basically adds a multiplier to enemy attacks and HP using a dial, and then every time you upgrade your Scadutree thing, that dial it turned down a bit. Frankly, I think it’s been turned too high to begin with. You’re heavily incentivised to engage with as little in the world as possible until you’ve gathered a few Scadutree Fragments and made yourself more powerful. It’s not what I want from the Elden Ring. I want to be able to level up if I fancy being overpowered or walk into a fight in my undies with nought but my fists if I feel like I want God to fear me. It’s about player choice, and I feel like these new mechanics are antithetical to that.</p>

<p>The good news is that the world is truly stunning. FromSoftware has an understanding of environmental design that dwarfs nearly every other group of artists in existence, and it shines through constantly in Shadow of the Erdtree. If you’re a fan of stopping to take photos, then you may well never leave this DLC, because it’s not only absurdly varied, but also consistently breathtaking. It definitely helps pull you along and makes you want to stay engaged.</p>
<p>Then there’s all the new weapons, talismans, spells, and so on. I was incredibly excited about the hand-to-hand arts, especially as the world’s biggest fan of the Bone Fist from Dark Souls 2, but I can’t help but feel like the Elden Ring take on the punchy martial artist doesn’t quite hit the mark. I do think that most of this is because the fist weapons are already so satisfying though, so it’s not all bad.</p>
<p>Outside of that, you’ve got an unreasonable number of new weapons, including other new weapon types, new spells, new armours, and even new spirits to summon. Fine-tuning your build is always a joy in Elden Ring, and all of these new options unlock, well, new options, so I’m a huge fan of that. Unfortunately, though, we’ve now got to move on to my biggest gripe: the story.</p>

<p>What it boils down to is that the final boss feels like it was generated by a randomiser, and the ending cutscene felt like the world’s most disappointing ice cream. I’d been looking forward to it throughout all of the tough boss fights and all of the awe-inspiring scenery, and then I got an ice cream that was actually sugar-free, made from beetroot, and I clearly saw the person who served it to me scratch their butt before using their hand to scoop it into a slightly damp tub. It’s not a good ending.</p>

			<p>The Fallout 4 Boon Island mod adds a new world space to the game based on a real-life island.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Created</a> by madders 'Tenhats' and 'Shreddah4', this new lands mod for the PC version of Bethesda's 2015 Fallout entry, is the first chapter of 'The Isles of New England' series. The new world space is located between Far Harbor and Boston, and comes complete with a new fully-voiced quest. In addition, it offers music, animations, custom textures, sound effects, and more.</p>
<p><em>"The first chapter of The Isles Of New England series,&nbsp;Boon Island is a location/quest &amp; settlement mod that takes the player to the forgotten shores of&nbsp;Boon Island, Maine, an&nbsp;unassuming lighthouse with a tragic history in real life, from shipwrecks, to cannibalism, fires, madness, deadly illness, and harrowing storms", </em>the description of the mod reads.</p>
<p>We've included the main features of this interesting new mod below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small but detailed new worldspace with a fully functional settlement, 3 minor locations, and many small points of interest along the ocean floor.</li>
<li>Custom Textures, Meshes and a custom&nbsp;Pipboy Map</li>
<li>A working animated Boat that will take you to the Island.</li>
<li>A brief Lore Friendly Quest with optional side objectives and a custom quest icon animation.</li>
<li>Immersive repairs that allow the player to fix the broken buildings in the settlement.</li>
<li>Custom music selection featuring music from previous fallout games.(all music has correct permissions for use)</li>
<li>Balanced loot (mostly handled by leveled lists)</li>
<li>Custom weather selection featuring a blend of Far Harbor and Commonwealth weathers.</li>
<li>FOMOD install options for&nbsp;Karma&nbsp;by&nbsp;Bp42s</li>
</ul>
<p>mod works with both the recently-released next-gen update and the version before that update. Also, the duo has said that the next chapter in the series will offer a bigger island with several quests and settlements. Players who want to use this mod, won't have to start a new game or create of new character.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-5-brings-players-back-to-hell-with-roguelite-mode-expands-weapon-types-available-to-classes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-season-5-brings-players-back-to-hell-with-roguelite-mode-expands-weapon-types-available-to-classes.909399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-5-brings-players-back-to-hell-with-roguelite-mode-expands-weapon-types-available-to-classes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-LVOWgIuo0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campfire Chat</a>, Blizzard Entertainment unveiled the specifics of Diablo IV Season 5, which is slated to begin on August 6. It will be a shorter season than usual, running for only two months before the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-gets-october-date-new-cinematics-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred</a> expansion (due on October 8).</p>
<p>However, its content and feature set are rather interesting. To start with, the developers are adding a brand new roguelike mode called Infernal Hordes. Players will have to go through a new questline first, taking place after the main campaign; this questline will stay on the Eternal Realms even after the end of Season 5. The story begins in Hawezar, where the heroes will have to investigate a disturbance among the townsfolk. After finishing the questline, you'll unlock the Infernal Hordes mode for all characters on your Diablo IV account.</p>
<p>Heroes will have to head back to Hell to face time-limited (90-second) waves of hellspawn. They'll collect Burning Aether during a wave to spend at the end of a successful Infernal run. At the end of the 90 seconds, kill the remaining enemies and choose from three Infernal Offers. These give you a choice of three different Boons &amp; Banes that modify your run, such as Elite damage increased, but Elites grant increased Burning Aether. Infernal Offers will stack across the duration of your Infernal Hordes run and any can be active at the same time. They are your chance to increase the difficulty in order to earn more Burning Aether or select a more modest Infernal Offer if the intensity is too great.</p>
<p>Once chosen the Infernal Offer, the next wave will begin. Successfully kill all waves in the tier you are attempting to advance to, then battle the Fell Council. Originally created to protect from the Prime Evil Mephisto during the events of Diablo II, these noble priests were corrupted and became champions of the very demon they were sworn to oppose.<br>
There are 5 Fell Council members in total, each equipped with different unique abilities. Each time you face the Fell Council, 3 different members will fight you - each three will be randomly selected to fight you. After defeating the Fell Council, spend your Burning Aether on the Spoils of Hell.</p>
<p>As you would expect, Diablo IV Season 5 introduces new Legendaries, Uniques, and items. These new Legendaries and Uniques can be earned by slaying enemies across Sanctuary, but have the best chance of appearing when playing the Infernal Hordes mode.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Another big change made by Blizzard is that classes will have access to expanded weapon types: for example, Sorcerers will be able to wield one-handed swords and maces. This includes updating innate affixes to be more useful across classes and adjusting their conditional requirements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Diablo IV Season 5 patch will be on the PC PTR from June 25 to July 2. The developers will gather feedback on all the aspects of this major patch, including three new accessibility features: Auto-Pin, Audio Navigation Assistance, and Compass.</p>
<p>To read the full patch notes, head to <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know?blzcmp=blizzard-news#Notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page</a>.</p>

<article id="post-6381">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>As of writing this, Sonic the Hedgehog and his colorful group of friends have taken up temporary residence at the illustrious International House of Pancakes. Sonic’s position as ambassador of mid-at-best flapjacks and adjacent breakfast items is, unintentionally, kind of the ultimate signifier that the blue hedgehog has reached peak saturation as a franchise, mascot, character and video game series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But Sean,” you might say, “it’s just pancakes! Lighten up!” I say this goes beyond pancakes and straight into the soul of a beloved but wayward video game icon.</p>



<p>Although, I did enjoy the pancakes…</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regardless, my point is that <em>Sonic</em> partnering with IHOP is just a recent example in a long line of <em>Sonic</em> saturation; some good, some bad. The movies are good for what they are, <em>Sonic Prime</em> did well on Netflix, there’s plenty of new merchandise that was never around when I was a kid (like an increasing lineup of fun LEGO sets) and the IDW comic series continues to be one of the best (if not <em>the </em>best current) example of Sonic storytelling.</p>



<p>However, these better examples stand alongside countless products with old renders of Sonic’s visage slapped on, Sonic Speed Cafes popping up across the nation — I am once again a hypocrite, driving up to San Diego to visit the first location, because I am a freak — and a slew of brand-tie-ins, mobile game crossovers, and other corporate and stale promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that’s what saturation is, a mixed bag of varying quality because Sonic is just <em>everywhere</em> now. You’d think I’d be happy about this as one of the character’s most passionate fans, but I’m more mixed than anything. I’m mostly uneasy because this saturation is the result of the current direction of the <em>Sonic</em> franchise that has left the games feeling rudderless. To put it simply, somewhere along the line, SEGA and Sonic Team decided Sonic could be <em>anything</em>, which has turned him into a big nothingchilidog.</p>



<p>Sometimes this limitless versatility is good! It can work for things like comic book superheroes — there’s a Spider-Man for everyone in <em>Spider-verse</em> — and I think this works under the notion of <em>Sonic</em> being a multimedia franchise, the aforementioned comics and movies being good examples. But where we run into a problem is the games — uncommitted to any one notion of Sonic and always choosing a new direction with each major game.</p>



<p>This isn’t bad in a vacuum, but because Sonic Team has been throwing spaghetti at the wall for close to 20 years at this point, experimentation is now the well-worn norm. We’re seeing half-baked ideas and erratic execution quality in games committed to neither a new direction nor solid implementation of classic <em>Sonic</em> elements. It’s time to pick a noodle off the wall and stick with it. To it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Sonic</em> games of the last two decades have all had some “bold and new” element shoehorned into 3D <em>Sonic</em> gameplay — which has itself never fully been polished enough to form a solid base to support these new ideas. <em>Sonic</em> is amorphous, no longer bold for experimenting, now just a nebulous concept that is in desperate need of decisive direction lest it become the wrong kind of blur. Sonic is becoming the modern Mickey Mouse: lacking identity and trying to be anything and everything while still being nothing at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Sonic</em> doesn’t need to keep trying new ideas or rehash old ones banking on pure nostalgia, it needs to choose a direction and see it through to its best possible self.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>So how did SEGA and Sonic Team get here? I would argue the issues began with the release of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog (2006). </em>In KingK’s video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPT7VPoHxxs">The Unfortunate Legacy of Sonic the Hedgehog</a>,” he talks about how <em>Sonic 06</em> was, in many ways, the next step in the <em>Sonic Adventure</em> evolutionary line. The game is built around multi-character gameplay with interweaving stories, polished gameplay that was clearly an evolution of what <em>Adventure</em> brought to the table, and a story on the scale of your average action Hollywood blockbuster.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Sonic 06</em> wasn’t conceptually flawed as it had intentions of evolving the current Sonic gameplay of the time into a more polished form. In a better timeline, a more complete version of <em>06</em> would have given way to another game with similar mechanics where 3D <em>Sonic</em> gameplay was further polished, perhaps even perfected. Even if the <em>Sonic Adventure</em> style of games wasn’t perfect when it was first conceived, it was successful, popular, and had a strong enough base that SEGA and Sonic Team could have, I imagine, toughed out the lean times in order to get to a more perfected product. I’m reminded of <em>Super Mario 64</em> giving way to all its successors until we get the polish of the format in games like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. There was a blueprint for what 3D Sonic could be.</p>



<p>But alas, <em>Sonic 06</em> was rushed and put on shelves as an incomplete mess, and the world subsequently clowned on it, turning it into the go-to joke of the fandom as a whole. It was, as KingK puts it in his video, “an icon of absolute ruin.”</p>



<p>So, as big companies tend to do in response to failure, they decided to throw the <em>Sonic Adventure</em> baby out with the bathwater. It wasn’t rushed execution, it was the entirety of the project. This is speculation — I don’t know the whole story, of course, but it’s very easy to draw a line from <em>Sonic 06</em> bombing to Sega completely changing the <em>Sonic</em> formula going forward. The board was cleared and the slate was cleaned; it was time to try a new <em>Sonic</em>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There was potential in this for sure. The first thing that Sega put out with the intention of a new direction was <em>Sonic Unleashed, </em>a game lauded for its daytime levels for pushing 3D Sonic gameplay to new speeds with effective experimentation. Then the game also had Sonic turning into a werehog at night, which gave each level in the game a nighttime beat-em-up variant, a role that could have been better suited for Knuckles (in a game about parts of the planet floating into the sky, you know, like Knuckle’s home?? Don’t get me started), but SEGA was likely too afraid to significantly use <em>Sonic</em>’s extended cast beyond Tails out of fear that the large cast was part of why <em>Sonic 06</em> and its story bombed. Additionally, as good as the day levels are in <em>Unleashed</em>, the game was, like most <em>Sonic</em> games before and after it, rushed to make a release date, leaving it feeling very unfinished.</p>



<p>This lead to <em>Unleashed</em> getting mixed-at-best reviews. So the game was deemed another failure and SEGA had the same response as they did to<em> 06 </em>— clear the board and try something new. This trend continued with every new <em>Sonic</em> game; try something new, veer from that potential and crunch for a hard release date, leave the game unfinished and the new idea left in a terrible state. Furthermore, when a game is half-done, the other half has to be filled with something, and it’s typically some combination of shoddy 3D gameplay cobbled together scraps of the previous game and a healthy dose of forced nostalgia.</p>



<p>Shoehorned nostalgia is a huge problem in <em>Sonic</em> games, and it unfortunately starts in <em>Sonic Unleashed</em>. The 2008 game first introduced the concept of side-scrolling segments of 3D sonic levels. Despite very little else being implemented from <em>Unleashed</em> into future games — really just the boost mechanic, but not the quality it had in <em>Unleashed</em>, nor the momentum techniques/quicktime dodges that made it work — the side-scrolling bits were one of the few things that still persists in the games. But these later implementations were subpar at best; clunky segments utilizing a different interpretation of speed (speed rewarded for pattern memorization) in the middle of that enticing <em>Sonic Adventure</em> interpretation of speed (hitting the right boosters and chaining attacks to keep momentum) and the transition just never worked smoothly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s really baffling that <em>this</em> is what SEGA and Sonic Team thought was the most salvageable part of <em>Sonic Unleashed</em> when there’s a lot the fanbase actually did like about this new direction. What’s worse is the nostalgia path drove the team into injecting 2D <em>Sonic</em> stuff into 3D <em>Sonic</em> stuff in ways that felt incongruous almost every time! There was a sense, at one point, that the fans wanted a return to “the old days,” but this was clearly misinterpreted by the <em>Sonic</em> teams at large.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s an issue that plagued <em>Sonic Colors</em>, a vaguely fun game that’s lost in trying to figure out what 3D <em>Sonic</em> even is anymore; stripped of world-threatening <em>Adventure</em>-like stakes, drained of <em>Unleashed</em> speed experimentation, and desperately cribbing from previous 2D games.</p>



<p>Then comes <em>Sonic Generations</em>, a game that’s fun in concept and hollow in execution: modern Sonic is reunited with his classic self to take on levels of <em>Sonic</em> past in both 2D and 3D style. Granted, the 3D sections also have 2D side-scrolling because that’s what <em>Sonic</em> is now. This problem is repeated in <em>Sonic Forces</em>, a game with its own identity crisis and lack of commitment to any new idea with potential. You can’t skip <em>Sonic Lost World</em> and <em>Sonic Boom</em>, the former being<em> </em>a <em>Mario</em> game in structure and the latter being a reboot that somehow ended up <em>more disastrous than the last time they tried a reboot</em>. <em>Sonic Frontiers</em>, a more freeform open world experiment, had potential, but is again a “bold new direction” that felt rushed into its drab, empty <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-inspired trappings. <em>Sonic Dream Team</em> has nice character models and colors. That’s all I got.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SEGA is aimless with <em>Sonic</em>. When something doesn’t work they drastically change direction, don’t fully believe in it, and then fumble that new direction. The result is a smoothing out of <em>Sonic</em> gameplay since they can’t commit to anything long enough to sharpen it. It’s everything and nothing at the same time. <em>Sonic</em> needs direction — <em>any</em> direction at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My vote goes to committing to the <em>Unleashed </em>day level style. The way those daytime levels <em>feel</em> fast without losing control are powerful and the methods behind it should have never been abandoned. Also, not to sound like every other extremely online <em>Sonic</em> fan, but <em>for what it’s worth</em>, SEGA could benefit from at least <em>looking</em> into popular Sonic fan games for insight. I’m not saying replace Sonic Team with fan teams, but just <em>perusing</em> what Sonic fans see has potential is worth the time and effort. Of course, we’d risk the team not being to stick with one of those directions, but that’s another can of worms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Really, <em>any</em> consistent direction is something at this point. It feels like there’s this nebulous collection of 3D <em>Sonic</em> game elements that get rotated and mixed-and-matched with each new game with almost no rhyme or reason. It’s just a repetitive process of misidentifying what worked, mixing elements left behind long ago, and expecting drastically different results. It’s exhausting. But hey, <em>Sonic Frontiers</em> was okay and there’s rumors of a sequel; it’s not my favorite place to start from as a path forward, but at least it <em>is</em> a forward step instead of a step <em>sideways</em>, an iteration with room to re-tool instead of re-think completely.</p>



<p>Remember how I said that it’s good that <em>Sonic</em> can be anything, specifically in regards to the larger multimedia franchise? I think that’s the key here to actually getting to a good place with the “main” line of 3D games. Sonic has been thriving as a movie star, a TV show, a comic book and as a LEGO minifig (amongst other toys). Heck, even the 2D “classic” style games have had solid reception, which certainly helps prove my point that consistent vision leads to positive results. </p>



<p><em>Sonic</em>‘s multimedia success has certainly bought the franchise time to get its AAA game product line right. If nothing was working, I think there would be a breakneck rush to figure this out. That said, a commitment needs to be made because as everything else <em>Sonic-</em>related begins to thrive, we’re left with mainline games that aren’t much fun to play and it feels more noticeable! Even if the next iteration isn’t perfect, SEGA needs to tough it out and <em>find</em> that perfection over time by establishing and sticking to a vision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183307/house-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="JsBiAW"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 1</a> surprised <em>Game of Thrones</em> fans who were not well versed in George R.R. Martin’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained"><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a> with the introduction of its two most confusing characters yet: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403463/house-dragon-twins-names-actors-cast-arryk-erryk-yes-really">Ser Arryk Cargyll and Ser Erryk Cargyll</a>. </p>
<p id="jCq127">In an effort to mimic history and maintain a sense of reality, Martin has gleefully named key characters in Westeros with the same names or variants based on family. But Arryk and Erryk, being twin members of the Kingsguard with nearly the same name, were a next-level troll. Luckily, actors Luke and Elliott Tittensor — yes, they’re real twins, no CG required — gave them vivid personalities that made their split between the Greens and Blacks all the more gut-wrenching. Then season 2 upped the ante.</p>
<p id="FFuWl2">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains major spoilers for the end of <em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 episode 2.]</p>
<p id="oIGd7o">In season 1, Arryk and Erryk were brothers and allies whose previous missions included locating the twerp Aegon in episode 9. But as Queen Alicent and her father, Ser Otto Hightower, pulled strings to put Aegon in power and bump out Princess Rhaenyra from her position as heir to the throne, Arryk and Erryk drifted apart. They both seemed to agree Ser Criston Cole is a nimrod — objective fact? — but after butting heads over loyalties, Erryk helped Rhaenys escape King’s Landing, while Arryk remained to serve Aegon. Season 2 finds them on opposite sides of the brewing conflict, and Arryk makes one of the worst calls ever: When Criston guilt trips him over the death of li’l Jaehaerys, the twin soldier sets off to assassinate Rhaenyra and inevitably confront his bro. </p>
<p id="b4toRQ">Mistakes were made — but Arryk’s fateful fuck-up results in one of my favorite fight sequences of either Game of Thrones series. The scene kicks into high gear as Arryk strides, with the confidence of an undercover twin, up to the guard protecting Rhaenyra’s room. Assuming Erryk’s identity, Arryk tells the man on duty to take a break. Note to self: Do not trust a twin who wants you to walk away from the job! Luckily, thanks to his twindar (and maybe the White Worm), Erryk shows up just as Arryk prepares to strike down Rhaenyra in her bed. The brawl begins, and it’s pure chaos. A few beats later, another of Rhaenyra’s men literally exclaims, as he must, “Which one is Erryk?!”</p>

<p id="aW7Ike">There are only a few circumstances that can lead to a classic “Which one do I shoot?!” impostor moment, and even fewer that conjure the visceral confusion of what <em>House of the Dragon</em> director Clare Kilner achieves in episode 2. Typically, when there’s a shape-shifter in play, we get at least a burst of hero-on-fake-hero action — Mystique’s fight with Wolverine in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151991/x-men-97-movie-why-black-leather-costumes-bryan-singer-ian-mckellen">2000 <em>X-Men</em></a><em> </em>being one of the best, though it ends with her transforming back into her blue self, and then into Storm as a way of escaping the brawl. Actual “Which one do I shoot?!” scenes end up being rather chill, so the villain doesn’t show their hand. T-1000 impersonating Sarah Connor in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/2/8883287/original-terminator-2-ending"><em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em></a> is high-tension but low-key, as Fake Sarah Connor begs for John’s help just as Real Sarah Connor walks around the corner and blasts him from behind. (<em>Terminator Genisys</em> has a similar scene involving Kyle Reese, which does force young Sarah Connor to actually decide which one to shoot, but, uh, maybe watch <em>Terminator 2</em> if you need a molten metal doppelganger fix.)</p>
<p id="YOoYGF">While I appreciate Buzz snuffing out his own Evil Buzz in <em>Toy Story 2</em>, the apex of lookalike-on-lookalike action in film has to go to James Wong’s <em>The One</em>, which put the multiverse to good use by pitting an evil Jet Li against himself. For 2001, all the sequences in which Li fights himself — through body doubles, face replacement, digital compositing, and a number of other techniques that involve punching tennis balls — are exceptional, showcasing various martial arts techniques enhanced with multiversal superpowers. Even the behind-the-scenes documentaries of how they did it rock:</p>
<div id="0wOmFW"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyGHKx8o2gw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="v1Tr4a">But there’s a clear advantage to having two physical warriors on set able to duke it out, and Kilner takes full advantage. When Arryk and Erryk begin whacking the crap out of each other, the camera drifts away from the combat to pick up the fear on Rhaenyra’s face, leading to intentionally convoluted action geography. A scene that’s meant for a pure adrenaline rush might showcase the sword swings and defensive kicks to ensure, even while wearing similar period-appropriate armor, the players are identifiable. There are a few tells in the fight that viewers might try to cling to — Erryk gets his leg slashed early on, and it could be a tell, if any shot held for long enough. But Kilner amplifies the disorienting effect of two twins fighting by breaking the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%2F180-degree-rule-explained%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%2520180%252Ddegree%2520rule%2520states%2Cright%2520relationship%2520with%2520each%2520other.%26text%3DThe%2520rule%2520dictates%2520that%2520you%2Cof%2520this%2520180%252Ddegree%2520line.&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24183307%2Fhouse-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23947348__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://vimeo.com/blog/post/180-degree-rule-explained/#:~:text=The%20180%2Ddegree%20rule%20states,right%20relationship%20with%20each%20other.\u0026text=The%20rule%20dictates%20that%20you,of%20this%20180%2Ddegree%20line.\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24183307/house-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23947348__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/blog/post/180-degree-rule-explained/#:~:text=The%20180%2Ddegree%20rule%20states,right%20relationship%20with%20each%20other.\u0026text=The%20rule%20dictates%20that%20you,of%20this%20180%2Ddegree%20line.&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24183307/house-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">180-degree rule</a>, bouncing between angles that won’t cohere for the brain. It’s the medieval action equivalent of a ball-and-cup trick.</p>
<p id="STCM34">The brawl leaves the spectators without a true clue of who won, a beat that left me gasping for air. Even moments after watching it, I wasn’t completely sure Arryk prevailed over Erryk… but it ultimately didn’t matter. One twin dying meant both twins had to go, for honor. The fight ends in Targaryen suicide, another tragedy on top of a tragedy. While I am sad to see the twins go from the series, it also feels like history — I’m not sure the stars will align for such a captivating “Which one do I shoot?!” scene ever again.</p>

<p id="5Idbe6">Hugh is the blacksmith who asked Aegon for extra money for the smiths in season 2’s first episode — just after Aegon heard the complaint from the farmer. While he may not have seemed like much of a character then, Hugh showed back up in episode 2, in a scene with his wife, where we get to see the plight of the common people in King’s Landing. While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> is certainly making more room to give the audience insight into how the Dance of Dragons is affecting the small folk of Westeros, something about Hugh’s conspicuously silver hair tells us he has a little more to do in this story than just clue us in to the rabble’s discontent. </p>

<p id="IHMpqB">Addam is the sailor we see briefly in the first two episodes of the season. He meets with Corlys Velaryon, who thanks him for saving his life and pulling him from the sea after their fleet was ambushed. We also see Addam’s brother Alyn. But other than those two facts, his purpose remains far more mysterious than anyone else this season so far. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182584/house-dragon-aemond-daemon-interview-episode-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NFILeg">Like anyone who’s had a hit taken out on him that resulted in the death of a nephew, Aemond Targaryen (Ewan Mitchell) starts the second episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> with a swirl of feelings. But — still a little <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419041/house-dragon-aemond-targaryen-death-dragon-sapphire-eye-villain-meaning">conflicted about <em>his own</em> slaying of his nephew at the end of season 1</a> — the only feeling he wants to talk about right now is how “proud” he is to be seen as a threat to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23380813/house-dragon-daemon-matt-smith-wedding-bad-guy">someone like his uncle Daemon</a>. </p>
<p id="RLkErg">It’s unsurprising; both men are second sons who feel fit (and ready) to lead, maybe even more so than their brothers. They’re strategic thinkers, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419108/house-dragon-aemond-lucerys-vhagar-battle">good fighters</a>, and steely conversationalists. They’ve both been underestimated, and even their aesthetic similarities are, to Mitchell, no accident. </p>
<p id="NJa5tc">“I’ve always thought Aemond is Daemon’s biggest stan; so much of the image Aemond has curated over the years, it is almost like a homage to his hero,” Mitchell said in a recent roundtable. In the fog of war, Aemond sees Daemon as the adversary he’s staring down across Targaryen family lines. “Aemond idolizes Daemon; there’s almost this romantic quality that Aemond feels that Daemon got this close — or, rather, he sent people to end Aemond’s life, but he didn’t want to do it himself. [...] So Aemond likes being noticed by his idol.” </p>

</p>
<p id="rgZBPd">It’s a feeling Mitchell sympathizes with — and wanted to exploit in his own way with his own feelings toward Matt Smith, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152946/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwa-costume">he watched on <em>Doctor Who</em></a> as a kid. </p>
<p id="vjJnTS">“Matt Smith brought such a vibrancy and an electricity [to the Doctor], and the youthfulness that was a little more accessible to me as a kid,” Mitchell says. “So I thought there was something interesting in never taking Matt Smith off that podium. I wanted to kind of keep my distance. [...] I wanted to save our eye contact for a moment that we share in episode 8 of season 1, that moment where they face off against each other at the banquet table.”</p>
<p id="S7rCkx">To keep the fire between them this season (even when separated by several Westerosian miles), Mitchell took inspiration from James Gandolfini’s performance in <em>The Sopranos</em>, recalling a story he heard about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/20/showbiz/gandolfini-appreciation/index.html">Gandolfini putting a rock in his shoe</a> if he wanted to have anger simmering underneath the surface. “That was something I wanted to explore with Aemond, was putting this coin in my shoe going forward. It’s something that constantly reminds him going forward that Daemon got this close to ending him. And maybe there’s a guilt that Aemond feels with that.” </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch abruptly banned one of its biggest stars —&nbsp;Herschel “Guy” Beahm, better known by his persona Dr Disrespect —&nbsp;in 2020 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">without a word of explanation</a>. Now, four years after Beahm’s permanent ban, two former Twitch employees have come forward to describe events they say contributed to his removal from the platform.</p><p>One former Twitch employee, who asked to remain anonymous citing the potential risk to their career, told <em>The Verge </em>that Beahm had used Whispers, Twitch’s now-defunct messaging system, to exchange messages with a minor and initiate a conversation about meeting up at TwitchCon. The employee worked on Twitch’s trust and safety team at the time of the ban in 2020.</p><p>Their comments corroborate a post from Cody Conners, a former Twitch employee who worked on the company’s strategic partnerships team. Late Friday, Conners&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">posted on X</a>, “He got banned because got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text.” </p><p>Though Conners did not explicitly name Beahm, it was understood the streamer was the subject of the post. Beahm’s ban came shortly after Twitch updated its sexual harassment policy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers">to punish offenders with permanent suspensions</a>.</p><p>Beahm denied Connors’ allegations. “This has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged, and they paid out the whole contract,” <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955">he posted on X</a>. Beahm <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">published an additional post</a> reiterating that no wrongdoing was found. “I didn’t do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid,” he wrote.</p><p>The news of Beahm’s ban, which came down four years ago this week, was shocking. Beahm was one of Twitch’s most popular stars at the time, with around 4 million followers, and he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21151223/twitch-dr-disrespect-streaming-contract-personality-mixer-kobe-bryant">had just signed a seven-figure, two-year exclusivity contract</a> with the platform. Neither Twitch nor Beahm would say why the streamer had been banned. In an interview with <em>The Washington Post </em>shortly after the ban, Beahm said that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/07/16/dr-disrespect-is-speaking-again/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_business">Twitch wouldn’t even tell him</a>&nbsp;the reason why his account had been removed.</p><p>The former employee who spoke with <em>The Verge</em> also shared more insight into the order of events that led to the ban. They said there was a significant amount of time between when the messages between Beahm and the alleged victim were sent and when the moderation report about those messages was filed, but they weren’t able to recall how much time. When Twitch received the report in 2020, they said that Twitch investigated the claims and ultimately banned Beahm’s channel.</p><p>A year after being banned, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/dr-disrespect-is-suing-the-fuck-out-of-twitch/">Beahm said he was suing Twitch</a>&nbsp;for monetary damages and disclosed that he finally knew why the platform issued the ban. However, Beahm declined to say what that was. A year later, the dispute was resolved with Beahm saying, “I have resolved my legal dispute with Twitch. No party admits to any wrongdoing.”</p><p>Beahm and Twitch did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s requests for comment.</p><div><p>Are you a current or former Twitch employee?

<p id="iOHKgO">The <strong>Dragon-Hunter’s Great Katana</strong> is your reward for defeating the <strong>Ancient Dragon-Man</strong> — the real one, not the Invader — at the end of the <strong>Dragon’s Pit</strong> dungeon in Gravesite Plain. </p>
<p id="9zdfEJ">To reach Dragon’s Pit, ride east from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182490/site-of-grace-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Castle Front Site of Grace</a>, just in front of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180357/castle-ensis-walkthrough-dlc-sote">Castle Ensis</a>. When you reach the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182490/site-of-grace-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Pillar Path Waypoint Site of Grace</a>, go southwest instead of south and take the lower path. You’ll run into the Ancient Dragon-Man Invader and then find yourself at the mouth of the Dragon’s Pit. Continue through the dungeon to reach the true Ancient Dragon-Man and earn your Great Katana.</p>

<p>Everyone is complaining that the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is too difficult, with some streamers admitting defeat early on. It has garnered negative reviews on some platforms because of how ‘unreasonably challenging’ it is, but perhaps we need to simply get better. Recently, one streamer managed to defeat a Shadow of the Erdtree boss using her brainwaves – so what’s your excuse?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mind-powers">Mind Powers</h2>



<p>For months, ‘Perrikaryal’ has been slaying the toughest Elden Ring bosses using various methods, but her most recent conquest has involved using an EEG-powered, head-mounted controller with an onboard gyroscope. This fancy piece of technology has required Perrikaryal to map her brainwaves to synchronised inputs, then quite literally train her brain to work how she wants, emitting ‘brainwave events’ that are captured by the headset and translated into movements, attacks, and other mechanics in-game.</p>



<p>In every clip she’s shown using the headset, she’s always deep in concentration, as even thinking the wrong thing could throw off her game. Here’s the clip she uploaded after defeating Divine Beast Dancing Lion in Shadow of the Erdtree:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WE DID IT</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree, first boss, COMPLETED with mind control, and ZERO HANDS</p><p>I can't believe it. This was the hardest thing ever. We've come SO FAR! Let's gooooooo <a href="https://t.co/INrwrgOH0Y">pic.twitter.com/INrwrgOH0Y</a></p></div>— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/1804649206310752418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While some users are understandably sceptical of the legitimacy of Perrikaryal’s gameplay, she has uploaded lengthy videos explaining how it all works and has invited friends to try out the hardware too – they’re just nowhere close to her level.</p>



<p>More power to her, I can’t even defeat starter bosses on Elden Ring using whatever device I desire.</p>

		<p>Abramelin Games has announced the follow up to Injection π23 – Ars Regia, with the new game being Injection π23 Tabula Rasa. Tabula Rasa is the final entry to the Injection π23 trilogy. The series started in 2019 with Injection π23 No Name, No Number, and was followed by Ars Regia in 2021. The reveal trailer for Tabula Rasa consists entirely of in game cinematics, and some scenes are a bit disturbing.</p>

<p>The Injection π23 trilogy is a mix of exploration, puzzle solving, and strategy. The previous game, Ars Regia, had a simple goal of finding the character’s missing dog. However, that mysterious setup was attempting to prevent the main character from descending into a deep spiral of paranoia and madness.</p>
<p>A release date for Injection π23 Tabula Rasa is yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Some are speculating that Bandai Namco's message follows news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-falls-to-a-mixed-steam-rating-as-pc-players-complain-about-difficulty-and-performance">Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC has fallen to a "mixed" user rating on Steam</a> after players logged their disappointment with the PC version's performance issues.</p>
<p>An aggregate score of almost 27,000 players has seen the critically acclaimed DLC stumble on PC, and whilst most players comment favourably on the game's stunning presentation and world building, others take issue with the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ilmyr/recommended/2778580/">capped FPS, stuttering</a>, and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/turbek666/recommended/2778580/">"bosses with jerky roll-catch movements and a plethora of physically nonsensical moves"</a>.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble even getting to the DLC, fear not: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-pros-are-offering-to-help-beat-key-bosses-so-all-players-can-access-the-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">Elden Ring pros are helping players beat two key bosses</a> to enable fellow Tarnished access Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
<p>As Shadow of the Erdtree isn't accessible until you've taken out both Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/time-is-running-out-to-prepare-for-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">something a surprisingly high number of Elden Ring players have yet to do</a> – Elden Ring experts are offering their time and expertise to fell the great enemies to help players jump into the new content.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's Soulsborne games are notoriously difficult to beat, but creator Hidetaka Miyazaki recently said it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">"break the game itself"</a> to turn down the challenge.</p>
<p>"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn't the right approach," he said. "Had we taken that approach, I don't think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy - which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."</p>
