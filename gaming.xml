			<p>Work on Valve's HLX project, rumored to be the highly anticipated Half-Life 3, is continuing with more optimization passes, suggesting that the project's polishing phase is in full swing.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McVicker</a>, who provided correct updates on Valve's project for years before their official announcements, reviewed some of the additions made to the Source 2 engine with the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4522268822998171356">Counter-Strike 2 October 15 update.</a></p>



<p>Unlike past updates, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">introduced new systems and features that aren't in use in any other game powered by the Valve engine</a>, the latest update focuses more on optimization and polishing, introducing an automated process to clean up system resources, changes to the sound simulation and liquid simulation systems, and more. </p>



<p>Though in a smaller number than before, new features likely meant for Half-Life 3 HLX have also been added by the latest Counter-Strike 2 update to the Source 2 engine, such as an expanded damage group system to take into account enemy models other than humanoid, and an asynchronous particle simulation system which will compute particles interfacing with simulated wind speed, allowing wind speed to adjust how the particles react on a case-by-case basis as well.</p>



<p>The most notable addition, and the one that is sparking the most discussion in the community, is the introduction of a new icon that denotes a new group of assets labeled as <em>"science"</em>. Tyler McVicker speculates that this doesn't mean much for Half-Life 3 HLX, as, from every update seen to date, the game is clearly in a polishing phase where no assets are being added. Though this usually is the final development phase, Valve could take years to complete it, so there's no indication the game is any close to release.</p>



<p>However, something could be brewing, and the game's release could not be too far in the future. According to rumors, a trailer for Half-Life 3 HLX is being worked on, and if how Valve handled Half-Life Alyx marketing and release is any indication, the game should be launching shortly after its announcement. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Tyler McVicker speculates that something related to Half-Life 3 HLX can happen in November, we have to take any potential reveal date with a massive grain of salt, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">previous reveal windows ended up not being correct</a>. As of now, only one thing seems to be almost for sure: the Half-Life series is far from being done.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-new-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-is-already-cheaper-on-amazon-a-subtle-pre-black-friday-surprise-2000639857</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-new-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-is-already-cheaper-on-amazon-a-subtle-pre-black-friday-surprise.1339060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When the&nbsp;<em>really</em> big sales events of the year get close — Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, etc., one of the big questions is always “What’s Apple going to do?” If this new Amazon deal on the brand-new M5 iPad Pro is any indication, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">Apple’s going to be dipping at least a toe in the Black Friday pond in the weeks to come. For the first time, the 11-inch M5 iPad Pro is taking a price drop — it’s $949 right now, down by $50.</a></p>
<p>Apple fans and creative pros in particular are going to be all over this one, because the new M5 iPad Pro comes closer to full high-end laptop power than any tablet yet. The M5 chip is a game changer in terms of speed and pure power, and the newly released iPadOS 26 is a massive leap forward. The two combine with Apple Intelligence to create a tablet that can do nearly everything a powerful laptop can, especially if you add the Magic Keyboard to complete the experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Faster, Thinner, Better</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the new IPad Pro is lighter than the iPad Air — 0.98 pounds, which speaks to just how much size and weight Apple has cut from their latest tablet design while amping up its power and ability. The M5 chip gets the lion’s share of attention, and deservedly so, but don’t sleep on the N1 wireless chip that’s also in the new iPad Pro, because it makes Wi-Fi 7, Thread, and Bluetooth 6 connections happen.</p>
<p>As with all things Apple, the screen on the M5 iPad Pro is best-in-class. It’s an Ultra Retina XDR tandem OLED screen with anti-glare treatment and an oleophobic coating that cuts down on fingerprints — an essential feature for an elite tablet. The ProMotion adaptive refresh rate ranges from 10Hz to a blistering 120Hz, and the peak performance of 1,600 nits delivers all of the exceptional quality of the screen in its full glory.</p>



<h2>All About the Images</h2>
<p>The M5 iPad Pro’s cameras and what it can do with the images are where this tablet really shines. The 12MP Wide camera at the rear of the tablet can shoot 4K ProRes video, and also be used as a powerful document scanner and AR code unlocking device. The front of the tablet has a powerhouse 12MP landscape Center Stage camera for pristine video calls and conferencing. When you shoot your videos or stills, Apple Intelligence takes over to deliver the best and most powerful range of editing and creative options of any tablet on the market.’</p>
<p>The first price break on this brand-new tablet is definitely an occasion, even if it’s just 5%. That might not be the case with other tablets, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">but the M5 iPad Pro was a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of tablet at its full $999 price, and now that it’s down to $949 at Amazon, it’s a more impressive deal yet.&nbsp;</a></p>

It also happens to be what some believe is “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq7iq/hands_down_the_worst_map_in_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hands down the worst map in the game</u></a>” if not “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/man_this_is_the_worst_map_in_bf_history_i_cant/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the worst map in BF history</u></a>.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch"><u>Season 1 launch</u></a> was meant to be the first in a long line of exciting moments for Battlefield players. Instead, it’s kicked off seasonal updates on a sour note, as fans flock to criticize Blackwell Fields as a wasteland that suffers from a lack of cover for infantry and vehicles alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't count the amount of times I spawn on this map and instantly have direct vision of the enemies capturing points,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/comment/nltl0qp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dissatisfied Battlefield 6 player</u></a> said. “You get shot at from every angle on this map, there's never a break. People can just spawn and start shooting you straight away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My playstyle is engineer class and I blow up armored vehicles, but I cant even get into cover in this map without getting shot from ALL sides," another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq7iq/hands_down_the_worst_map_in_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular post</a> explained. "The massive open areas makes it a sniper haven and every other class is just trashed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its relatively large battles, Battlefield 6’s Conquest mode seems to suffer the most when it comes to Blackwell Fields, as players report facing enemy fire from as far away as enemy HQ spawn points. Pilots for air vehicles, specifically, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/blackwell_fields_enemy_base_aa_shoots_you_while/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> having a hard time on the new Season 1 map. Despite being considered one of the larger maps Battlefield 6 has to offer, opponents with the right hardware can still lock onto some jets before they’ve even taken off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is fantastic,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/comment/nltejew/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user</u></a> jokes. “I was hoping for more maps where Helis are useless.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No no, they are perfect nice garage helicopters,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/comment/nlthu77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> teases. “You keep them nice and clean in the hangar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's not helicopter season yet.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Blackwell Fields balance issues only add fuel to the fire that is the conversation surrounding map sizes in Battlefield 6, but many have expressed dissatisfaction with the map regardless of game mode. Even smaller objective-based game modes in downsized versions of Blackwell Fields still feature those orange visuals, leading to even more chaotic moments as bullets fly through dense environments obscured by smoke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I played a round of breakthrough which was decent and one of conquest which was a disaster,” one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/599667545349564587/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam user</u></a> commented. “The visibility is already so bad in this game no matter what settings you use, the red/orange tint that this map have it's a disaster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the <a href="https://x.com/L0SSY/status/1983322555940516260" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>stray comment</u></a> praising Blackwell Fields and its cinematic feel can be found if you look hard enough, it seems most players online would trade atmosphere if it meant BF Studios would fix what they feel are one-sided battles and suffocating gun fights. Of course, it’s only been one day since Season 1 launched for Battlefield 6, so opinions could shift after they spend more time with the new map.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Me on Blackwell fields <a href="https://t.co/03GkOb6pAd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/03GkOb6pAd</a></p>— Lou (@louallen026) <a href="https://twitter.com/louallen026/status/1983213456758063388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear if Blackwell Fields will receive any changes, but EA and BF Studios have proven to be responsive when it comes to fan feedback so far. Even if Blackwell Fields continues to be a sore spot for the community, Season 1 will at least deliver a new, less orange map in the form of Eastwood come November 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Numerous updates, big and small, have arrived since Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X  and S October 10.

            <p>The backlash to the Trump administration's use of AI Halo imagery to promote political causes - notably the use of force by ICE to detain purportedly illegal immigrants - has spread to include strongly worded responses from the original designers of the Halo game.</p>
<p>Jaime Griesemer, who worked as a designer at Bungie for 12 years, on all Halo games up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-reach">Halo: Reach</a>, told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react">Game File</a> that: "Using Halo imagery in a call to 'destroy' people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation. I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people."</p>

<p>His comments refer to <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">an image posted by the Department of Homeland Security</a> which showed two Spartan soldiers on a Warthog jeep, riding across a Halo ring world, underneath the words "Destroy the Flood" and a call to join ICE. The inference was clear.</p>
<p>Marcus Lehto, the co-creator of Halo and lead designer of Master Chief, added to Game File that: "It really makes me sick seeing Halo co-opted like this." The DHS Flood-related image in particular was "absolutely abhorrent", he said.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Lehto and Griesemer featured in a news story earlier this week responding to the Halo 1 campaign remake, voicing confusion at some of the apparent design decisions in it. And it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-microsoft-be-able-to-stop-the-white-house-using-ai-generated-halo-imagery-to-depict-trump-as-master-chief-and-to-promote-and-recruit-for-ice-depressingly-i-doubt-it">this Halo remake which sparked the flurry of Halo-related AI images used by the Trump administration</a>.</p><p>So far Microsoft - owner of the Halo IP - hasn't noticeably said or done anything about the Trump administration's use of Master Chief and Halo. The ongoing silence speaks volumes. It follows similar inaction by Nintendo when the Trump administration co-opted Pokémon for similar social media use. Thus emboldened, <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">the Trump administration's provocative use of iconic IP continues, now reaching The Lord of the Rings</a>.</p>

		<p>GFAGames has announced that it will be launching an open beta for the open world MMO FPS PIONER on November 4th, giving players the chance to check out the game world. PIONER has both PvE and PvP gameplay, and it looks like players will be free to choose which side of the game they want to interact more with.</p>

<p>PIONER’s description says, <em>“PIONER is an open-world MMO first-person shooter set in a haunting, alternative-reality world where Soviet-era structures lie abandoned on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island. In this immersive environment, the gameplay experience is defined by dynamic PvE and PvP elements, where realism takes priority over traditional health bars or character levels. With a sprawling map of 50+ square kilometers, not counting hidden dungeons, players can explore a world rich with mystery and danger, encountering story quests and faction missions that influence relationships and loyalty rewards.”</em></p>
<p>On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. To survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand. There will be a crafting element to the game allowing players to create weapons and equipment to use in both PvE and PvP. Additionally, there are a number of different factions within the world, and building up a reputation with each will also give new items and missions.</p>

<p>GFAGames is targeting this year to fully release PIONER, but it is likely that will be looking at feedback from the open beta before committing to a solid release date for the full game. PIONER is currently confirmed for PC.</p>

<p>Step by step</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We had a good time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped">Biped</a> — the robo co-op platformer all about putting one foot in front of the other — when it arrived on Switch back in 2020, and what do you know, META Publishing has got even more up its sleeve.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped_2">Biped 2</a> is set to step onto Switch on <strong>5th November</strong>, and it looks every bit as full of Nintendo charm as its predecessor. Once again, the main gimmick here is to do with controlling a sweet little robot's left and right feet independently to get them walking in a straight line, but there are obstacles, drops, and platforms to contend with along the way.</p>
<p>Like that which came before it, Biped 2 can be played either in solo or two-player co-op — there's a new 'pair' mechanic that sees you sticking to your pal to solve puzzles — but the sequel also adds in a fresh <em>four-player</em> mode for those who really want to up the party vibes.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Biped-2-2950357.html">eShop</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ENJOY THE CONTROLS<br>
- Meet the classic two-leg mechanics and a brand-new variety of ways to move!<br>
- Try out new movement types that are smoothly integrated into the game process! Soar gracefully on a hang glider and leave beautiful patterns behind, or conquer ledges and breaks with a grappling hook!<br>
- And guess what? Sliding is back too! Be ready to slide a lot!</p>
<p>UNIQUE PAIR MECHANICS<br>
- Not only help each other to get further, but act together to achieve success! Unite with your robot partner and become one to solve special puzzles. Take the role of “legs” or “arms” and coordinate your next step. And a whole bunch of pair puzzles will help you to master this technique!</p>
<p>EXPLORE NEW BIOMES<br>
- Unknown planets bring uncharted places! Unravel the mysteries of an alien planet and meet new characters, even elementals! Explore unfamiliar environments and be ready to face the challenges that they might bring. Have a good time, and let beautiful scenery and wonderful music create a memorable atmosphere!</p>
<p>PLAY SOLO OR IN TWO-OR-FOUR-PLAYER CO-OP<br>
To make the gameplay process even more diverse, you can choose from lots of possibilities to play:<br>
- Single-player: Become a hero of your story and test your skills in a single-player mode!<br>
- Two-player co-op: Invite a friend to share the journey with you. Take the roles of two bipeds and make the most out of this synergy. Test your skills and assist each other in difficult situations because companionship will be essential.<br>
- Four-player co-op: Apart from familiar mods, we’ve introduced a new one - a four-player co-op! Beat the challenging levels together in a team of four!</p>
<p>STYLE IS A MUST<br>
- Show the new world your creativity! Dress up your bipeds for the occasion to impress your new friends - collect treasures and buy wacky hats. Be unique or choose pair looks with your partner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biped 2 will arrive on the Switch eShop next month for <strong>£16.75 / $19.99</strong>.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/biped">review</a> of its predecessor, we called Biped "a lovely co-op game that’s bursting with unique challenges and obstacles to overcome", though we did feel that it was a little on the short side.</p>

            <p>
Amazon have cancelled their second attempt at a Lord Of The Rings MMO as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-wont-be-getting-any-more-new-additions-following-mass-layoffs-at-amazon">recent mass layoffs</a>, according to a now-former senior gameplay engineer at Amazon Games.
</p>
<p>
The engineer in question is Ashleigh Amrine, who announced that she had lost her job on LinkedIn yesterday. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">wrote</a>. I've reached out to Amazon for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Colonial fantasy New World has already been confirmed to be ceasing development, following the recent Nighthaven update, as part of a company-wide shift away from MMOs. Amazon will keep the servers warm through 2026, and say they'll give six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable.
</p>
<p>
Amazon's first LOTR MMO was a collaboration with Chinese company Leyou, announced in 2019. It <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-cancel-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">met an unfortunate end in 2021</a> thanks to an apparent contractual dispute, after Leyou were acquired by Tencent. Amazon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-games-announce-a-second-attempt-at-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">revealed the second LOTR MMO in 2023</a>, after partnering with new Middle-earth rights-owner Embracer. They called it a "persistent open-world MMO adventure", spanning the events of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and the LOTR trilogy, but beyond that, we've never heard much about the project.
</p>
<p>
"It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here."
</p>
<p>
It's claimed that 14,000 people are losing their jobs as part of Amazon's latest cuts. Best of luck to everybody affected. At the risk of being twee, here is an encouraging aside from the books: "in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach."
</p><p>
If you're desperate to roam Middle-earth in company, Standing Stone and Daybreak's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> is still trucking along with a small but steady audience, almost two decades since launch. The community's recent doings include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lord-of-the-rings-online-players-finally-complete-the-great-hobbit-run-by-incinerating-themselves-in-mount-doom">finally accomplishing a pilgrimage of desperately underlevelled hobbits to Mount Doom</a>.

            <p>Arc Raiders servers have gone live, and following the historical trend of massive releases and server woes, players are running into an Online Connection Error thousands across PC and consoles flood in.</p>
<p>After booting up the game and attempting to connect to servers, a significant number of players have run into an error pop up that reads: "Online Connection Error. Online services are currently unavailable." Other players have managed to squeeze through, leading some players stubbornly spamming the bright yellow retry button in hopes of gaining access.</p>
<p>In the hours prior to the game's release on Steam, it shot up <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">to the global number one ranking for Top Sellers on Steam</a>. Within five minutes, over 100,000 concurrent players were in-game, an absurd number considering it's a work day today lads.</p> <div>

<p>As of writing there's been no public statement on official Arc Raiders channels on this error, so if you've booked a day off or are thriving in a remote role, you might not be having as smooth an Arc Raiders experience as you'd hoped. Still, shaky server problems like this are part of the charm. Just ask anyone who was awake for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor">World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor</a>'s launch.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/heres-the-november-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-cats-cars-and-tabs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-the-november-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-%E2%80%93-cats-cars-and-tabs.1339021/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The PS Plus Monthly Games selection for November 2025 has been revealed, which can be neatly summed up as being all about cats, cars and TABS.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus November 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 4th November:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stray</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>EA Sports WRC</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>TABS</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>“Playing through the kitty cat adventure of Stray is an experience that’s filled with joy and delight,” Tuffcub said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/18/stray-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">review of Stray</a>. “I loved it, and so did my cat.”</p>
<p>To be fair, I’d expect that most people that wanted to play this game already have, as it launched in 2022 after a couple years of excited anticipation for cat loving gamers. It delivered on that vision in spades, and it’s easy to suggest you should catch up on this if you did skip it during sales in the last few years.</p>


<p>It sadly seems that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/ea-sports-wrc-will-get-no-more-content-future-rally-game-development-paused/">rally racing is done and dusted at EA and Codemasters</a>, making EA Sports WRC the end of a long lineage of rallying that goes back through the DIRT series and Colin McRae. This was a pretty good effort to follow up on Dirt Rally 2.0, adding the official sport’s license into the mix. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">WRC review</a>, Dom said, “If you’re looking for a fully featured and great handling rally game, EA Sports WRC is the undisputed champion this year, though PC players need to be aware that some technical bugs still need to be ironed out.”</p>

<p>And finally, there’s TABS, which stands for Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. You can’t disagree with that name, as the game lets you take various different units and army formations and test them out against other armies and formations. It’s basically “who would win out of…”, but a video game, and there’s just sloshing buckets full of physics to make it all science-y.</p>

<h2>Can you still get the October 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 3rd November to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Goat Simulator 3</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Cocoon&nbsp;</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>

            <p>You can now retrieve Fargoth's ring and get in hot water for not-so-sneakily pilfering someone's sujamma in a mod which is aiming to port <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. This and more is shown off in the first update video the modder leading the charge has shared since first unveiling their impressive undertaking.</p>
<p>That initial reveal was about a month ago, when modder AnotherPlus lifted the Vvardenveil on the fact they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morrowind-is-being-ported-into-elden-ring-by-a-modder-complete-with-the-vast-army-of-goats-and-female-clones-vvardenfells-always-had">managed to transfer Morrowind's landscape across into the FromSoft game</a>. While there are still plenty of placeholders and bits in need of work, they and their team look to be making great progress thus far.</p>

<p>This update sees AnotherPlus show off some early quests which are now completeable, meaning you can step off the boat and start carving a path towards Dagoth Ur. I assume Dagoth, like all of the NPCs in the mod, is still a clone of a random Elden Ring lady with a computerised voice which can deliver his nice speeches.</p><p>"For those of you wondering about how far in the game you could actually get right now, I'm not sure, but fairly far, I'd imagine," the modder says. "The script compiler is not fully finished, but I have implemented a lot of the really common calls of the Papyrus language. So, you can actually do a lot of quests right now perfectly fine, but every once in a while, you'll run into a quest that requires a very specific Papyrus command that currently is a no-op and it just breaks."</p>
<p>The same sort of thing is true of the crime system the team have begun to implement. You can crouch to open up the option to nick items, with that being the way AnotherPlus has opted to go about things in order to avoid it being very easy to accidentally steal instead of initiating chats, and be hit with a bounty for doing so. However, guards currently don't have a jail to send you to and can't chase you outside of force-initiating shouty dialogue if you wander too close or turning hostile if you declare you're resisting arrest.</p>
<p>This is due to the lack of navmeshes, which AnotherPlus says is the sole challenge that they're really concerned about having the potential to stop them being able to get the mod working in full, adding that the team haven't made much progress on it so far. "That issue is currently our biggest roadblock," AnotherPlus explains. "In some ways, it's probably the only thing holding us back from finishing this project in the long term. It's the only thing on the project that I don't know what the solution is going to look like and there is a chance we just don't solve it." Though, they make clear they still believe it can be sorted.</p>
<p>Going forwards, the modders are looking for a number of extra volunteers to take on roles outlined at various points in the video. Possibly the most noteworthy of these is the need for some experienced Morrowind modders to step in and help create a compatibility patch that can reconcile the difference in how the two games handle integer values.</p>
<p>As you might expect, there's still no word on a release date or target, but AnotherPlus does hope to have another update video out relatively soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first positive thing I heard about the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> campaign was that it throws up an “uninstall” button once you’ve watched the credits roll. On one hand it’s a genuinely helpful way to save some precious hard drive space, especially at such a release-heavy time of year, but given how divisive the reception has been towards this story-driven single player portion of the game, that button certainly has some emotions attached to it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 - Campaign Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZb3lPmxuSc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I wouldn’t exactly call past Battlefield campaigns an afterthought, and there’s some real highlights from their varied efforts, though they are never the reason for the season. In the same way that I blitz through the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> campaigns before touching Zombies or multiplayer, I’ve traditionally done the same with Battlefield, knowing that the beating heart of these games rests within their brand of all-out, never-ending online warfare. Of course, when it came to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, there was no such option.</p>


<p>It’s hard to say whether a thrilling string of solo missions would have vastly improved EA and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/DICE">DICE</a>’s previous punt at their flagship FPS franchise, but even the barest offering could have helped flesh out its near future setting. In Battlefield 6 we’re immediately introduced to the game’s two warring factions: NATO and the private military corporation known as Pax Armata. While the two peacefully coexist for a time, Pax is on the rise as a growing coalition in its own right. 2027 Pax make their move and ambush unsuspecting NATO forces stationed in Georgia.</p>
<p>It’s the ultimate game of chicken. For the longest time NATO has gone unchallenged, and in its slow response to the sudden Pax threat, it loses credibility, with former allied nations now rallying under the protection of the ambitious PMC. What follows is an effort by NATO forces to retake territories and strongholds, spliced with cutscenes that probe into a deeper conspiracy of who is actually behind Pax.</p>


<p>There’s nothing all that gripping about the story. It succeeds in doing some basic stage-setting, giving players a pit stop tour of the various locations they’ll be blowing to smithereens in BF6’s multiplayer. While there has been a clear effort to weave in added layers of intrigue through the narrative’s framing, there isn’t much of a pay off – in fact, the game ends on an abrupt cliffhanger, just as things are starting to heat up and the conspiracy has begun to unravel.</p>
<p>One thing the campaign does get right is an emphasis on squad-based gameplay, even if it’s only lightly implemented as opposed to being a core feature. While you don’t get to directly control your fireteam, you can activate their class abilities to help turn a firefight in your favour, ordering them to deploy a smokescreen, scout enemy locations, or toss frag grenades. It’s a small touch, and one that’s very easy to completely ignore, yet it can lightly offset some of the repetition that comes from gunning down enemies at each checkpoint.</p>
<p>There is another staple Battlefield feature evident throughout the campaign: environmental destruction. It adds an extra strategic dimension to firefights, allowing players and NPCs to blast chunks out of walls in effort to flank enemies to hinder them as you retreat to safety, with plenty of stereotypically explosive barrels conveniently scattered through each location.</p>
<p>It isn’t all running and gunning. There are a handful of cinematic on-rails sections where you mount a machine on an armoured truck and one mission where you take control of a tank. These help add some variety, as do some of the gadgets you get to play with such as the tactical drone. However, given just how important vehicles are in multiplayer, it’s a shame we don’t get a campaign mission dedicated to fighter jets or helicopters. With no in-game tutorials explaining how to control these aircrafts, I’ve been in plenty of online matches where the sky hosts a flying circus of rookie pilots struggling to keep the sky above them and the ground below.</p>

<p>Clocking in at around 6 hours and spread across 9 missions, length isn’t really an issue for Battlefield 6’s single player. The problem is that, after investing all of that time, there are few memorable moments outside some technically impressive set pieces. Rather than being a satisfying conclusion to the story, the last cutscene feels more like the introduction to a final act that doesn’t exist. Unless EA and DICE decide to pick up where they left off in a sequel, of course.</p>
<p>To no-one’s surprise, the Battlefield 6 campaign isn’t an essential part of the overall package, but playing through these missions should give players more insight into the near future setting DICE has created and the motivations fuelling its two endlessly fighting factions.</p>

		<p>Monster Theater has announced that it has been working on update 2.0 for Atomic Owl, which it expects to release in November, and one of the major additions will be a No Roguelite mode. The main experience of Atomic Owl is that of a roguelite, where you replay stages and gain improvements to pass them. This new mode will bypass all that and assumedly make Atomic Owl a straightforward linear action game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomic Owl - Official Launch Trailer | Indie3 Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XhW86Kdn9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Monster Theater said, <em>“We have been toiling silently on a huge update to Atomic Owl! We found out pretty soon after release in July that we had to update our project to Unity 6, which caused a handful of animation issues, sequencing problems, and yada yada.&nbsp;&nbsp;It…was a pain. <wbr>Long story short…we did it and now we now have a potential candidate for Atomic Owl’s V2.0 release. Well, we wanted to address some repeating issues that we noticed players and reviewers weren’t fans of on launch.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>1.&nbsp;<b>No Roguelite Mode</b>&nbsp;that addresses the core concern from the game’s reviews regarding the game’s roguelite structure.</em><br>
<em>2. Huge UX and Background visibility improvements.</em><br>
<em>3. Voice acting volume slider.&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>4. Pitfall improvements.&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>5. NPC UX visibility improvements.&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>+ Bug fixes galore!</em></p>
<p><wbr><em>We are wrapping up all of the above fixes and submitting the 2.0 build, this Friday, October 31st.&nbsp;<wbr>The Planned release date for the V2.0 release of the game to drop on Steam sometime in November.”</em></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/atomic-owl-review/">Atomic Owl Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Atomic Owl review, I said, <em>“Atomic Owl is a satisfying roguelike with a simple progression that allows you to make headway quickly through the levels. This does come at the expense of the combat, which is a bit too on the easy side, with the platforming much more challenging than any boss fight. Overall though, if you want a short, simple, and good looking roguelike then Atomic Owl is worth a go.”</em></p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced the latest GameCube addition to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack’s</a> library of classic games, and with Halloween tomorrow, you’d better believe that it’s one of the company’s spookiest games: Luigi’s Mansion.</p>
<p><iframe title="Play Luigi’s Mansion with Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on Nintendo Switch 2!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5jceyKM83L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>That’s great and all, but where’s the GameCube’s scariest game? In the early 2000s, Nintendo was trying to pivot and capture a more mature audience, in the wake of the PS1 and PS2’s huge successes, and this came in a number of forms. Nintendo famously signed a major deal with Capcom, which led to the Resident Evil Remake, Resident Evil Zero and the groundbreaking Resident Evil 4. They’re great, and all, but they’re not the crowning jewel of horror gaming on GameCube, which has to be the Nintendo-published Eternal Darkness.</p>
<p>Silicon Knights’ game featured an innovative sanity meter that altered the game experience with sanity events that warped not just the game world, but broke the fourth wall in ways that have gone down in gaming lore.</p>

<p>But anyway, Luigi’s Mansion is great to have on Switch Online, and means that Switch 2 owners can play the full trilogy on one system – the GameCube original via Switch Online, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/25/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review/">remaster of Luigi’s Mansion 2</a>, and then the excellent Switch native <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/28/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch/">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>. It’s a shame that we don’t have a native remake of this original game for Switch, given that it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/24/luigis-mansion-nintendo-3ds-review/">ported to the Nintendo 3DS back in the day</a>, but for the sake of gaming history, the original is better.</p>

			<p>Though updated in every possible way, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake retains the challenge of its classic JRPG roots. If you are a newcomer to the series, understanding some essential quirks is key to enjoying both games right from the start. This guide will walk you through settings, exploration, and combat tips to tame the difficulty.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: Tips devised and refined during two complete playthroughs of both games over the course of 45 hours at Dragon Quest difficulty in the game's PlayStation 5 1.0 version. Screenshots captured from the same version.</em></strong></p>

<figure><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D features some really helpful features that can improve the experience of anyone who isn't a series veteran</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake features some new settings the original games and their many remakes didn't. Unless you are a hardcore series veteran who wants to be challenged, you must change some of them to have an easier time with both games.</p>



<p>The first settings to turn on are found in the <strong>System Settings menu's Helpful Settings section</strong> (Triangle/X/Y button on the field - Misc.- System Settings). These are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Treasure Chest Locations</strong> - Adds icons on the mini-map indicating treasure chests</li>



<li><strong>Secret Spots</strong> - Adds icons on the world map indicating the general location of Secret Spots, where you can find additional items, gear, Scrolls and Mini Medals</li>
</ul>



<p>The third setting to turn on is found inside the Difficulty Settings section of the System Settings menu:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recover HP/MP When Levelling Up</strong> - Restores HP and MP fully every time any character levels up</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Turning on these features vastly improves both games significantly for the majority of players due to both games' high challenge level and encounter rate. The Treasure Chests and Secret Spots indicators will cut down the time needed to explore locations fully, making you get into fewer random encounters. Restoring HP and MP fully upon level up allows you to explore dungeons for longer without being forced to return to a town to rest at an inn and heal up, improving both games' pace quite a bit for a more enjoyable experience.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-leave-no-stone-unturned">Leave No Stone Unturned</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>A lot of items can be found by searching everywhere in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D, including very useful Scrolls</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exploration and traversal in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is quite straightforward, but this doesn't mean that the colorful world of both games isn't hiding all sorts of secrets, including powerful gear, Scrolls, consumable items that can teach characters some new spells or abilities, or the elusive Mini Medals that can be exchanged for other useful items.</p>



<p>While shining spots on the field and treasure chests are the most obvious indications that new items can be obtained, they aren't the only places you should search. Whenever you reach a new town, explore every house, check every <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">drawer, cabinet, bookshelf</strong>,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> pot or barrel</strong>. Same inside any dungeon: even if a path doesn't seem to lead to treasure, there's a good chance something may be hidden inside a stray pot.

<h2 id="h-stock-up-on-healing-items">Stock Up On Healing Items</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Stocking healing items is crucial to survive in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, the descendants of Erdrick learn plenty of healing spells to heal their wounds quickly, but the limited MP pools, and the scarce availability of MP restoration items force you to think hard about which spells to use and when to use them.</p>



<p>As such, <strong>healing items should be the core of your healing strategy</strong>, more than MP-consuming spells. Thankfully, Medicinal Herbs and Strong Medicine, which heal HP by 30 and 50 HP respectively, are quite cheap to purchase, and can be stocked up in your Item Bag by the hundreds. However, make sure to transfer these healing items to your characters, as <strong>no item stored in the Item Bag can be used in battle</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>If you use the Tactics auto-battle options a lot, having a healthy stock of healing items has another important benefit. Every option besides Show No Mercy heals characters when needed, and will use items if no healing spell is available, unless you set your characters to not use items with auto-battle settings active.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-use-tactics-as-often-as-possible">Use Tactics As Often As Possible</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <strong>Tactics</strong> feature in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake offers a few auto-battle settings that can be quite effective. These settings are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Show No Mercy</strong> - Characters fight with everything they got</li>



<li><strong>Fight Wisely</strong> - Characters strike a balance between offense and defense</li>



<li><strong>Focus on Healing</strong> - Characters prioritize healing above all else</li>



<li><strong>Don't Use MP</strong> - Characters fight and heal without using MP</li>



<li><strong>Watch My Back</strong> (Dragon Quest II HD-2D only) - Characters focus exclusively on healing, leaving damage dealing to other party members.</li>
</ul>



<p>Generally in any JRPG, you want to have direct control of your characters, but in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, these options work remarkably well in random encounters. By assigning these settings individually, you can have party members in Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake focus on specific strategies, and you can even tweak which spells or what item types can be used with the Tactics auto-battle options to further enhance your strategies. With how many random encounters you will get into during the course of these epic adventures, Tactics can <strong>make you save a lot of precious time</strong>, and improve the pace of the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Every Tactics auto-battle setting with the exception of Show No Mercy has a hidden mechanic that can help your party stay alive against powerful enemies. Unlike a human player who cannot predict which character is going to be hit, the AI can, and thus can take advantage of turn order to provide emergency healing to a character hit by an unexpected critical hit.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-don-t-be-afraid-to-lower-difficulty">Don't Be Afraid to Lower Difficulty</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although not as unforgiving as the original NES releases and some of their subsequent remakes, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is still <strong>a challenging experience that can get you off guard</strong>. Even if you have set up your party properly, ready for every contingency, there will be times when you will have to deal with some unexpected difficulty spikes due to powerful enemies, some capable of acting twice out of turn, appearing out of the blue. This is all part of the Dragon Quest series experience, so veterans are fully prepared to deal with this.</p>



<p>However, if you are a newcomer, <strong>don't be afraid to drop the difficulty to Dracky Quest</strong>, the easiest setting available. If you turn off Invincibility, which makes both games literal walks in the park, this difficulty setting can still provide a solid level of challenge to a newcomer without overwhelming them with massive difficulty spikes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty can be lowered at any time via the System Settings menu, so the experience can be quite flexible, allowing you to experience Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake at a variable difficulty setting. No content is locked behind difficulty, so change it away if you're finding the hordes of fiends too challenging for you.</em></strong></p>

            <p>
Once upon a time, the great graven cave troll Terry Cavanagh rose from his slumbers, scratched the opals from his beard of woven copper, and said to himself: "Today I will make a 3D egg platform game in which a 3D egg goes platforming, like my hit game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a>, but 3D and with eggs." And because there was no-one around to say "WTF, Terry" or "perhaps you are just hungry" or "Mr Cavanagh, the egg's paucity of external appendages and senses wholly disallow it as a means of self-directed locomotion", that is exactly what he did. 
</p>
<p>
We are all the richer for it, because Egg (subtitle "why not be an egg") is eggcellent. It's also free and <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/egg">playable right now in a browser on Itch.io</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Where Cavanagh's early influences include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, in which there's a chapter that has you defending a giant condor egg against Shinra, I happen to be a graduate of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> University, which teaches that eggs are the work of Satanic industrialists. As such, I was profoundly suspicious of the egg platformer concept, but there is ample precedent: the Dizzy series (in which the egg has hands and feet), the shellshocked and yolk-crazed Billy the Hatcher, and the recent physics-me-do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2897610/Egging_On/">Egging On</a>. Sometimes when Sonic curls into a ball, I think that he looks rather like an egg. But then I close my eyes and bang my temples until the demons go away.
</p>
<p>
Cavanagh's Egg is both familiar of structure and tonally eggcentric. It puts you in charge of a supermarket box of six eggs, perched on a cliffside. Your job - I think, based on about 30 minutes with the game - is to control and guide the eggs one by one to a nest, somewhere in the landscape. It's possible there's a moral here about industrial poultry farming, but I don't want to bust out the <a href="https://kimstallwood.substack.com/p/the-sexual-politics-of-meat-by-carol">Carol Adams</a> just yet. I've succeggsfully guided just one egg to a "nest" so far. It slumbers now in a clump of frogspawn on a sandbank, deep underwater.
</p><p>
 The world is a stark, pixellated, precarious and arbitrary yet somehow consoling expanse of ledges and moving platforms and tunnels and whirling machinery, divided into discreet biomes that are linked by warp pipes. You move with WASD, look with the mouse, and jump with space, holding down the bar to charge up higher jumps.</p>
<p>It's a little fiddly, with lots of deadly drops, but not that punishing: checkpoints are plentiful, and you have infinite lives. Also, when you slide down a slope to a messy doom your egg makes a charmingly wibbly ooh-er noise. I think the eggs are all voiced by Cavanagh himself. Pretty sure Hideo Kojima has never voiced an egg.
</p>
<p>Who can explain the scrambled imaginings of the great graven cave troll Terry Cavanagh? It's possible <a href="https://distractionware.com/blog/2025/09/about-the-egg-game/">this blog post</a> might shed some light. Do a battery hen factory sim next, Terry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is tweaking the reward process in Ranked for Season 2, reducing the requirements to earn exclusive Mega Evolutions in the game.</p>



<p>The latest Pokémon title earned criticism for locking a trio of Mega Evolutions behind Ranked performances, with a minimum rank of K required to claim Greninjite and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mega-greninja-greninjite-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlock Mega Greninja</a> in Season 1.</p>



<p>However, that approach is being shifted for Season 2, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-season-2-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicks off next week</a>, with significantly lower requirements to claim the latest batch of rewards.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Waiting game. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post published by The Pokémon Company, which has since been deleted but can still be read on social media platforms like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ojaaqn/comment/nm1hax1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, the requirements to earn Delphoxite and unlock Mega Delphox were shared.</p>



<p>Initially, the post stated the requirements would be the same, with Rank K required to be reached, but a later update reduced the level of unlocking Delphoxite to Rank S—a whopping eight levels lower than the initially stated reward.</p>



<p>Additionally, those who missed out on Greninjite and Mega Greninja in Season 1 would immediately have the opportunity to claim the required item for the Mega Evolution, with Rank Y required.</p>



<p>The post also outlined the duration of Season 2, stating it will kick off at 10 PM PT on November 5 and last for 20 days until November 25. </p>



<p>The deletion of the posts from The Pokémon Company raises questions about whether any additional changes will be made and why the posts were deleted, though it seems the information was published earlier than was planned.</p>

            <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has provided yet another hint that the next Xbox console will, in essence, be a PC, in a recent interview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tbpn.com/">Speaking to TBPN</a>, Nadella spoke at length about the companies' future plans when it comes to gaming, including the mysterious new console that Microsoft is working on. This includes direct mention of Steam as a competitor platform, and Microsoft's current significance as a video game publisher.</p>
<p>"To us, gaming on Windows… and of course, Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of it, and they’ve done a very successful job," Nadella states. "Now, we’re the largest publisher after the Activision [deal]. Therefore, we want to be a fantastic publisher. Similar approach to what we did with [Microsoft] Office. We want to be everywhere, in every platform.</p>
<p>"So we want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming, or the TV, we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere."</p>

<p>Nadella then moved on to future hardware, telling TBPN: "Second, we also wanted to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. It’s kind of funny that people think about the console-PC as two different things. We built the console because we wanted to build a better PC which could then perform for gaming. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom."</p><p>This interview comes shortly after rumours ran amok that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">Xbox would not be creating another console after the Xbox Series</a>, which was debunked by Xbox president Sarah Bond. She's also spoken at length about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-releasing-a-1000-handheld-microsoft-has-said-its-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience">the "premium" nature of the upcoming Xbox</a>, stating it'll be a "curated" experience, much like the ROG Xbox Ally.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally that has been met with mixed reception. Eurogamer editorial director Tom Orry described it as: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">an impressive handheld PC wearing an Xbox mask</a>", while editor-at-large Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whatever-it-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-makes-me-pine-for-xboxs-distant-heyday">came away from their time with the console longing for Xbox's past heyday</a>. Others have found the presence of Microsoft apps like One Drive a hurdle to the gaming experience they could find on a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Is this the future of an ‘Xbox PC’, a product loaded up with One Drive, Co-Pilot, and other non-gamer focused apps? It remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>CAPCOM has officially opened pre-orders for its highly anticipated game Resident Evil Requiem. You can now purchase the ninth mainline installment of the beloved horror franchise across all platforms: PC (Steam and, for the first time, Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>All pre-orders will include “Apocalypse,” a freebie costume for protagonist Grace, as a pre-order bonus. The Standard Edition is priced at $69.99, while the Deluxe Edition adds the Deluxe Kit for $10 more. The Deluxe Kit includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Five costumes, including Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu</li>



<li>Two filters, including Filter: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Four weapon skins, including S&amp;S M232 Weapon Skin: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Two charms, including Charm: Mr. Raccoon</li>



<li>Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic</li>



<li>Files: Letters from 1998</li>
</ul>



<p>To celebrate the aforementioned debut of the Japanese publisher on the Epic Games Store, players who get Resident Evil Requiem on this platform will receive special Resident Evil-themed collaboration items in Fortnite, like the Grace skin. These items will be distributed in Fortnite following the game's release, which, as a reminder, is set for February 27, 2026.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>CAPCOM also unveiled a special edition Resident Evil Requiem Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, featuring art from the game and styled in gunmetal-inspired black. It will be available from Nintendo on launch day. Lastly, it was revealed that Grace will become the first-ever Resident Evil amiibo, available sometime in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>Following the opening of pre-orders, the publisher also shared the minimum and recommended system requirements for the PC version. These are surprisingly accessible.</p>



<p><strong>MINIMUM:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11 (64-bit required)<br>Processor: Intel corei5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: GeForce GTX 1660 6GB / Radeon RX 5500 XT 8GB<br>DirectX: Version 12</p>



<p><strong>RECOMMENDED:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11 (64-bit required)<br>Processor: Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: GeForce RTX 2060 Super 8GB / Radeon RX 6600 8GB<br>DirectX: Version 12</p>



<p>Of course, should you wish to play Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with path tracing on PC</a>, you'll need a lot more than a GeForce RTX 2060. Still, optimization was already in a good place <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on what we played at Gamescom 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update: ARC Raiders is out now!</strong></p>



<p>ARC Raiders is out today, October 30, bringing the most highly anticipated extraction shooter ever made to the global market. It has been pieced together by Embark Studios, of The Finals fame, and it offers a unique perspective and take on a typically gruelling and super-challenging genre.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’ll break down the official launch times for ARC Raiders, letting you know when in your region ARC Raiders will be released. It’s being opened up to the world on a simultaneous basis, so that means it goes live for everyone at the same time.</p>



<p>What time does ARC Raiders go live? Find out below.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-live">When is ARC Raiders Live?</h2>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will go live at 02:30 AM PDT on October 30, which is today. </strong>It’s available for preload on all platforms, but there’s not that long to wait before it kicks off.</p>



<p>Here are all the time zones for the ARC Raiders launch:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Timezone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Launch Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">PDT</td><td data-align="center">02:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">MDT</td><td data-align="center">03:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CDT</td><td data-align="center">04:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">EDT</td><td data-align="center">05:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">UTC</td><td data-align="center">09:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GMT</td><td data-align="center">09:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CET</td><td data-align="center">10:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">IST</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CST</td><td data-align="center">5:30 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">JST</td><td data-align="center">6:30 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AEST</td><td data-align="center">7:30 PM</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>It’s safe to expect some kind of technical or network issues, which are typical when a game has a global launch like this. With the launch not being staggered by local time, it means that everyone who wants to play this game will be jumping online at the same time, which inevitably causes some issues, and there might be some kind of server queue system arranged.</p>



<p>However, that’s what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/">recent server slam</a> was supposed to iron out.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-arc-raiders">How to Preload ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you want to get ready for the launch of ARC Raiders, you can preload the game on your platform of choice after purchasing it.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is available on PS5, Xbox Series, Epic Games, and Steam, and every storefront has mostly the same process for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preload-arc-raiders-file-sizes/">preloading the game</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Head to the storefront you want to use</li>



<li>Complete your purchase</li>



<li>Find the game in your library and hit the option to preload or pre-install</li>



<li>Wait for the download to finish</li>



<li>Sit back and wait for the ARC Raiders launch time to come around</li>
</ul>



<p>You won’t need to soak up much storage space with ARC Raiders either, as the game has a relatively small install size:</p>



<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 – 16.19 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series – 27 GB – 32 GB</li>



<li>PC – 29.05 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord</a> which ARC Raiders launch time you’re preparing for, and we’ll see you in Speranza!</p>

<p>WayForward's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae">Shantae</a> series has been expanded with all sorts of games over the years, and following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shantae-advance-risky-revolution">revival of the lost GBA title</a>, the series director Matt Bozon has now shared a major update.</p>
<p>The next Shantae game, which marks the seventh major title, is now officially in development. This was shared at the end of Limited Run's 10th anniversary broadcast this week, with Bozen mentioning how more details would be shared in the future. Here's what he had say, along with the attached image featuring Shantae and Risky Boots:</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fnpzhrm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>The music app is now a year old</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="577d025e97be0"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/577d025e97be0/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're a fan of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or not, one thing every racer should <em>probably</em> agree on is that this new entry has an amazing soundtrack. If you are wondering why Nintendo hasn't added this album to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> service just yet, we've now got an official response.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/10/29/breath-of-the-wild-vinyl-nintendo-music/">The Washington Post [paywall]</a>, Nintendo's Bill Trinen acknowledged fan requests for this particular album, which is "particularly robust", and mentioned how soundtracks "actually take time and work" to prepare. It's also apparently about lining it up on the calendar and seeing if it fits. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I can’t go into too much detail, but I can say that it does actually take time and work to prepare soundtracks for Nintendo Music. And that soundtrack is particularly robust. It’s a matter of looking at the calendar and saying whether something might fit in or not. We’ve certainly heard that people are eager to see that on Nintendo Music.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Mario Kart World's album isn't available on this subscription service just yet, you can listen to existing Mario Kart soundtracks. It's now also been one year since this music app was released for mobile devices, and during this time, Nintendo has bolstered the service with all sorts of retro albums, as well as some sample collections for Switch 2 titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>If you would prefer something more physical, Nintendo yesterday announced it was teaming up with Laced Records to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-is-scoring-a-gorgeous-vinyl-release-next-year">soundtrack on vinyl</a>. You can find out more in our previous post. Earlier this week, it also updated its digital music app with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> soundtrack.</p>

<p>In response to this, a response has been issued about the "current known issues and planned fixes" on the way. The fixes will be rolled out in a "future update" that's currently planned for November. For now, this is what you can expect, courtesy of the official Pokémon Legends Z-A news page.</p>
<p>One issue is tied to Pokémon Boxes, and the other is linked to side missions. Here's the rundown:</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59gmowvh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<h3>Pokémon Legends Z-A - Current Known Issues and Planned Fixes (November, 2025)</h3>
<p>We have confirmed the following issues and plan to fix them in a future update.</p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your Pokémon Boxes become full before the first Rogue Mega Evolution battle and the Boxes menu had not been opened at any point prior to being filled, Pokémon catch attempts will always fail. Additionally, if a side mission that allows you to receive Pokémon is attempted under these conditions, the mission will be completed without granting the Pokémon.<br></li>
<li>In certain side missions, if the time of day switches between daytime and nighttime at the exact moment that a move hits its target, it will become impossible to hit the target afterward, rendering the side mission incapable of being progressed further.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Planned Fixes</h3>
<p>These issues are scheduled to be fixed in the update planned for release in November.</p>
<hr>
<p>When this update and the patch notes are released, we'll provide an update. In some other Pokémon Legends Z-A news today, the second Ranked Battle season has been announced. This event will run from 6th - 26th November. You can find out more in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-battles-season-2-start-date-and-rewards-revealed">our previous story</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem, which launches on February 27th, 2026, are now live. Furthermore, a showcase including the upcoming title will air closer to release.</p>



<p>Celebrating the 30th anniversary next year, Resident Evil Requiem is the next big title for the iconic horror franchise. Following Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Outbreak’s Alyssa Ashcroft, you’ll survive horrors beyond compare in the now-desolate Raccoon City. Story details are under wraps but, assuming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some leaks are true</a>, it’s sure to be quite the journey for new and returning fans. Earlier this month, details about its pre-orders came out, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing an October 29th date</a> with a special video. Now, the content in question is out and holds another surprise: a new Resident Evil Showcase.</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="Resident Evil | Road to Requiem" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQODLCylKbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQODLCylKbM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the 10-minute video</a>, narrated by Lady Dimitrescu herself Maggie Robertson, we see a flashback to how the Resident Evil series got to where it is today. From the original 1996 title to the latest mainline entry, Resident Evil Village, it’s all there and connected with Requiem.</p>



<p>While there isn’t any new footage of the upcoming game, you won’t have to wait long to see more. Towards the end of the video, <strong>a Resident Evil Showcase is announced</strong>, and is planned to release <strong>early 2026</strong>. While there’s no specific date, it’s likely taking place in January as Requiem releases in February. As for what we can expect, more gameplay will probably be shown, but there’s a chance we could see the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-0-remake-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored Resident Evil 0 remake</a>.</p>



<p>The biggest announcement was the fact that <strong>pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem are now live</strong> on all storefronts. The game is available for <strong>$69.99</strong> for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. A Deluxe Edition is also available, costing <strong>$79.99</strong> and including the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Five costumes, including one of Grace as Lady Dimitrescu</li>



<li>Four weapon skins</li>



<li>Two screen filters</li>



<li>Two charms</li>



<li>One Audio Pack (Raccoon City Classic)</li>



<li>One File (Letters from 1998)</li>
</ul>



<p>The physical Deluxe Edition will also come with a Steelbook casing featuring a limited edition lenticular card. Also announced during the video is a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller adorned for Resident Evil, coming out at launch, as well as a Grace Ashcroft Amiibo, releasing in Summer 2026. Furthermore, Grace Ashcroft has been revealed to be going to Fortnite as a skin, though no date is given for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget earbuds often disappoint with tinny sound and uncomfortable fits, leaving people wondering if they should have spent more on premium brands. The Soundcore P20i by Anker changes that calculus entirely, delivering features and sound quality that rival earbuds costing ten times more while earning an impressive 4.4-star rating from nearly 80,000 reviews. Amazon has slashed the price from $39 to just $19, hitting an all-time low that makes these earbuds an absolute steal for anyone who needs reliable wireless audio without breaking the bank. This deal has already attracted over 10,000 buyers in the past month alone, speaking to the value proposition these earbuds represent.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5095/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Oversized Drivers Deliver Surprising Bass Performance</h2>
<p>The 10mm drivers in these compact earbuds outperform expectations and <strong>deliver bass that rivals earbuds priced at $100 or more</strong>. The size of the drivers affects bass reproduction because larger diaphragms move more air and it creates low-frequency sounds that make music feel immersive instead of flat. The larger drivers follow the 16-ohm impedance specification for efficient power use. The sound signature highlights bass without drowning out mids and highs: You get a satisfying thump in hip-hop and electronic music, while vocals remain clear and instruments distinct. <strong>Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity provides stable audio transmission</strong> with minimal delay and prevents annoying audio-video sync issues that come with cheaper wireless earbuds.</p>



<p>The Soundcore app takes these earbuds from good to exceptional: <strong>It includes 22 preset EQ profiles</strong> designed for various music genres and listening preferences. Presets for rock, classical, jazz, podcasts and bass boost adjust frequency response to enhance sound for different types of content. You can customize tap gestures to control functions, such as skipping tracks, adjusting volume or activating voice assistants based on how you like to use them.</p>
<p>Battery performance is impressive as it offers <strong>10 hours of continuous playback on a single charge</strong> which is enough for multiple workdays or long flights without needing the case. The<strong> charging case extends total playtime to 30 hours</strong>, and gives you nearly a week of typical use before you have to charge it again. Fast charging technology provides 2 hours of listening from just 10 minutes in the case which is helpful if you forgot to charge overnight.</p>



<p>The compact design, complete with an attached lanyard, makes these earbuds extremely portable: They are <strong>small enough to fit in pockets or clip onto bags and keys</strong> without taking up much space. Their lightweight design keeps you comfortable even during extended use and prevents ear fatigue that heavier earbuds can cause. Water resistance protects against sweat during workouts and light rain while commuting but they are not rated for swimming or heavy water exposure.</p>
<p>Call quality is enhanced by <strong>dual microphones that work with AI to isolate your voice from background noise</strong> in phone conversations. The system filters out distracting sounds, such as traffic, wind, or office chatter, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly. This AI processing occurs in real-time without creating the robotic voice quality typical of simpler noise reduction systems. The microphone placement captures your voice naturally while minimizing wind noise during outdoor calls.</p>
<p>At $19, this is one of the best deals you can get.</p>

                <p>The age of AI has barely begun, but there are some in the industry who see it as an absolute necessity for the future. Electronic Arts, for example, has reportedly instructed its employees to treat AI as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>" in every aspect of game creation. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick isn't buying into the hype, and he doesn't believe AI will ever be able to compete with Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto games.</p><p>"Let's say there were no constraints [on AI]," said Zelnick during an appearance on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>. "Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the Grand Theft Auto marketing plan? The answer is no. A, you can't do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn't end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative."</p><p>Zelnick went on to explain that AI can't innovate, because it's "backward-looking" by design and its predictive models are built on things that have already been created, rather than anything new.</p><p>This isn't the first time Zelnick has shared his feelings about AI, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">he's been fairly consistent over the years</a>. Earlier this month, Zelnick made a point of saying that people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-says-ai-is-great-but-people-are-overstating-what-it-can-do/1100-6535679/" data-ref-id="1100-6535679">overstate what AI can do</a>.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently disclosed that his company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-primarily-uses-ai-for-security-so-far-says-phil-spencer/1100-6535672/" data-ref-id="1100-6535672">primarily uses AI for security purposes</a>, but he didn't rule out its role in game creation. Meanwhile, Microsoft is attempting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-ai-and-voice-control-to-be-an-even-bigger-part-of-windows/1100-6535491/" data-ref-id="1100-6535491">to fully integrate AI and voice commands into Windows 11 machines</a>. Video game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield have both stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI tools should be embraced</a> in game creation. A recent survey also found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-japanese-game-developers-are-embracing-ai-than-ever-before/1100-6535072/" data-ref-id="1100-6535072">over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI</a> in some way.</p>

              <p>Running out of storage space on your phone, Nintendo Switch, or camera creates that frustrating moment where you have to delete old memories to capture new ones. MicroSD cards solve this problem by expanding your device’s capacity and let you hoard thousands of photos or hours of 4K video without compromise.</p>
<p>The Samsung EVO Select with 512GB capacity provides enough room for approximately 124,000 photos or 60 hours of 4K footage, essentially future-proofing your device against storage anxiety. And Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/">just dropped the price from $46 to just $37, hitting a new all-time low</a> just before Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed Meets Capacity for Real-World Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>160 MB/s read speed makes file transfers fast and smooth</strong>: Copying a full 4K movie to your card takes less than a minute, unlike slower cards that can take five to ten minutes. Good news is, <strong>write speeds match the demands of continuous 4K video recording</strong>. This prevents dropped frames and stuttering that can ruin important footage when slower cards can’t keep up with the data. The UHS-I interface offers the bandwidth these speeds need and connects through the standard microSD slot found in nearly all modern devices.</p>



<p>The A2 application performance class means <strong>this card can run apps and games directly from its storage:</strong> This avoids the lag that older microSD standards often had. The rating shows minimum random read speeds of 4000 IOPS and write speeds of 2000 IOPS, which results in quick app launches and smooth gameplay on devices like the Nintendo Switch. Games load faster, transitions between levels are smooth, and you bypass the frustrating delays that come from using slower storage.</p>



<p>The i<strong>ncluded SD adapter increases compatibility</strong>: It works with laptops, desktop card readers, cameras and the original Nintendo Switch dock. This simple adapter <strong>changes the tiny microSD size to standard SD</strong> so you don’t need to buy separate adapters or search for specific readers. You can easily insert the card into your computer’s SD slot to transfer files without needing cables or wireless connections that use up battery.</p>
<p>Samsung’s six-proof protection guards <strong>against water, extreme temperatures, X-rays, magnets, drops, and wear from repeated insertion and removal</strong>. These durability features mean the card can survive an accidental trip through the washing machine, withstand desert heat or winter cold outdoors, and pass through airport security scanners without corrupting data. The <strong>10-year limited warranty</strong> supports these protection claims with reliable manufacturer backing that goes beyond standard consumer electronics coverage</p>
<p>At $37, the card costs about seven cents per gigabyte, which is great value for Samsung’s premium EVO Select line.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build-2000640003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build.1338877/</guid>

              <p>LEGO Architecture sets rarely go on sale which makes this London Skyline deal something special. The 4.8-star rating (across more than 13,000 reviews) speaks to the quality and satisfaction <strong>this 468-piece set</strong> delivers to builders who want an iconic city skyline on their desk or shelf. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/">has dropped the price from $39 to just $31, which marks an all-time low</a> that won’t last long given how quickly these sets disappear during promotional windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Iconic Landmarks Come Together in Miniature Form</h2>
<p>The set captures<strong> five of London’s most recognizable structures</strong> in carefully scaled brick form. It starts with the National Gallery’s neoclassical facade which anchors Trafalgar Square, then Nelson’s Column rises with its distinctive proportions (honoring the admiral who secured British naval dominance at Trafalgar in 1805). The London Eye appears as a functional rotating observation wheel made from transparent and gray elements that showcase its modern engineering style. Big Ben’s clock tower displays the Gothic Revival architecture that makes it easily recognizable in photographs and films worldwide. Last but not least, Tower Bridge completes the collection with its twin towers and suspended walkways.</p>



<p>The Thames river flows through the scene, and uses transparent blue baseplate tiles to create a convincing water effect beneath the landmarks. This smart design choice grounds the buildings in their geographic setting while adding visual depth to the display. The transparent elements catch and reflect light in various ways throughout the day. This gives the model a dynamic quality that shifts with your viewing angle and the ambient light. The <strong>baseplate measures about 11 inches wide</strong> and provides a stable foundation that keeps all elements securely connected during transport or dusting.</p>



<p>The<strong> set includes 468 pieces</strong> and hits the sweet spot between being challenging enough to feel rewarding and manageable enough to complete in one satisfying evening or weekend session. LEGO Architecture sets differ from standard LEGO builds by focusing on architectural accuracy and the proportions between structures rather than play features: Each landmark uses specialized pieces and smart building techniques to replicate distinctive architectural elements at this smaller scale.</p>
<p>Display potential makes this set especially appealing for offices, home libraries or anywhere you want decor that sparks conversation and reflects sophisticated interests. The monochromatic color scheme, using mainly gray, black, and tan bricks, creates a cohesive look that appears professional rather than toy-like in adult spaces. Its compact size means it fits on crowded bookshelves, desks, or window sills without overpowering the area.</p>
<p>The <strong>recommended age of 12 and up</strong> reflects the patience and fine motor skills needed for smaller pieces and detailed assembly steps. However, younger builders with LEGO experience can succeed with adult guidance. This set makes an excellent gift for Anglophiles, architecture enthusiasts, travel lovers reminiscing about London visits.</p>
<p>At $31, it offers great value given the piece count, display quality, and lasting appeal of the Architecture series.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/philips-clears-hue-bulb-starter-kit-stock-now-selling-at-all-time-low-for-early-black-friday-2000639968</link>

              <p>Smart lighting transforms how you experience your home, <strong>turning ordinary rooms into spaces that adapt to your mood, schedule, and activities</strong> with just a tap or voice command. The<em> Philips Hue</em> starter kit delivers this transformation in minutes and requires nothing more than screwing in bulbs and plugging in the bridge to unlock millions of colors and automated lighting scenes. This bundle includes the <strong>essential Hue brige and two 60W A19 color-changing bulbs</strong> that work in standard E26 fixtures throughout your house. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/">has slashed the price from $142 to just $99 for early Black Friday</a>, which marks a new all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Bridge Makes Everything Possible</h2>
<p>The Hue bridge acts as <strong>the main hub for your smart lighting system</strong>: It connects your bulbs to your home network and offers features that standard Bluetooth bulbs can’t. This hub creates a special Zigbee network and keeps your smart lights responsive without slowing down your Wi-Fi or hurting connection quality. The bridge also allows for automations: You can set your lights to turn on before you wake up or turn off automatically when you leave home.</p>



<p>The two included A19 bulbs deliver 800 lumens each: This provides <strong>brightness similar to traditional 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong> while using much less energy. These <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs cover a range from warm candlelight tones at around 2000K to cool daylight at 6500K,<strong> plus offer access to 16 million colors for fun lighting effects</strong>. The <strong>E26 base fits standard lamp sockets</strong> and ceiling fixtures: You can install them in table lamps, floor lamps, or overhead lights without needing adapters. Dimming is smooth through the app or voice commands, and gives you fine control over brightness levels that wall switches can’t achieve.</p>



<p>Preset scenes take the hassle out of choosing colors: They provide <strong>ready-made lighting combinations tailored for different activities and moods</strong>. The 24-hour natural light scene mimics the sun’s movement throughout the day. It begins with energizing cool tones in the morning and shifts to calming warm hues as evening approaches. <em>Focus</em> modes provide bright, clear lighting to help you concentrate during work hours, while reading scenes offer comfortable light that reduces eye strain. <em>Relaxation</em> and sleep scenes gradually dim to warm amber tones, signaling to your body that it’s time to unwind.</p>
<p>Voice control with Alexa and Google Assistant lets you <strong>adjust your lights without reaching for your phone</strong> or getting off the couch. Simple commands like <em>“turn on the living room lights”</em> or <em>“set bedroom to 50 percent”</em> become routine after a few days. The Hue app guides you through setting up voice control with easy instructions that take only a few minutes. You can also create custom voice commands for specific scenes, like saying <em>“movie time”</em> to automatically dim your lights to theater mode.</p>
<p>At $99, this starter kit is an easy way to enter the Philips Hue ecosystem. It provides everything you need to experience smart lighting in two rooms right out of the box.</p>
