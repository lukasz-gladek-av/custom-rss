It's not, but a remaster is. On this week's Aftermath Hours, we talk about whether that's a good or bad thing.</p><p>This week, Chris and I are joined by Aftermath contributor Isaiah. We open with Chris being unable to resist talking more about <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a></em>, and he also tells us how he's finding <em>Silent Hill f</em>. Then, Chris and Isaiah talk some <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yakuza</a></em> while I listen politely, because I have to stop trying to play games <a href="https://aftermath.site/crusader-kings-3-help-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke likes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to State of Play.

Isaiah explains how the presentation's focus on the game's <a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-wolverine-blood-tech-insomniac-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood tech</a> might hit different to Marvel fans. Then we ask whether we need a <em>Deus Ex </em>remaster when it basically just makes a game from 2000 look like a game from 2004. Also, Chris is really into those <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/introducing-pulse-elevate-sony-interactive-entertainments-first-wireless-speakers-for-desktop-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speakers</a>.</p><p>After that, we talk about the continued fallout from Charlie Kirk’s assassination, with some game devs <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing their jobs</a> over their comments about it, though not as many as in other fields. We also talk about what’s known about <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/the-ice-shooters-motive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the shooter at a Dallas ICE facility</a> this week, and how it feels like meme culture has taken on the role that video games once played in being blamed for violence.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/live-action-beauty-and-the-beast-was-an-inspiration-for-ff7-remake-trilogy-says-director.1310022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix arguably broke the internet about 10 years ago when it finally revealed it was working on a long-anticipated remake of <i>Final Fantasy 7</i>. Now, in 2025, two parts of this trilogy project have arrived on PlayStation and PC, with ports expected on Switch 2 and Xbox in the near future.</p> <p>Speaking with a number of outlets, <i>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</i>’s director Naoki Hamaguchi shed some light on <i>FF7 Remake</i>’s upcoming arrival on Switch 2 and Xbox, what it took to get the game running on less powerful hardware, how <i>Rebirth</i> is shaping up on Switch 2, and which <i>Final Fantasy</i> he’d be eager to see remade next.</p> <h2>The key to the Switch 2’s <i>FF7R</i> port was nailing the lighting</h2> <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/ff7-remake-director-interview-rebirth-switch-2-confirmed/">Speaking to <i>ScreenRant</i></a>, Hamaguchi zeroed in on “character expressions” and “lighting” as being essential to delivering a quality experience on Nintendo’s hybrid console:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our aim was to align more towards the lightning we see in the PS5 version, and then we also kind of balance this by aligning more towards the sort of switch to post-effect and fog. And in this way the user is not really able to make out a huge difference</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-xbox">In an interview with <i>Inverse</i></a>, Hamaguchi said that a Switch 2 port seemed likely early on once “Nintendo first shared with [Square Enix] the new hardware […] the thought came to me that <i>Final Fantasy 7 </i>can likely run on these specs.”</p>

 <p>According to Hamaguchi, the Xbox version was already in the works before the team got their first look at the Switch 2 hardware. And, contrary to what you may think, the underpowered Series S wasn’t much of an issue. Though the team has run into some memory problems on Series S, Hamaguchi still describes Microsoft’s budget console as “quite high in terms of specs.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7 Remake</i> isn’t the only part of the remake project headed to Switch 2. The more graphically ambitious <i>Rebirth</i> is also expected to arrive at some point in the future. Hamaguchi described <i>Rebirth</i> as being in a “working state” on Switch 2. “Our desire was to be able to ultimately offer and serve all of the platforms available,” Hamaguchi told <i>ScreenRant</i>. He declined to say, however, whether or not the third installment will arrive as a multiplatform title on day one.</p>

 <h2>Development on part three of <i>FF7</i> remake’s trilogy is ‘going extremely well’</h2> <p>The <i>FF7 </i>remake project is still ongoing, with a yet-unnamed third entry on the horizon. Hamaguchi describes development as “going extremely well.” “A lot of the content is already playable,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">he told <i>Automaton</i></a>, “and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now the team is united around refining everything.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7</i>’s remakes have certainly impressed a number of fans, but concerns over the sales of the last entry and the general direction of the various plot changes do remain. For his part, Hamaguchi has described <i>Rebirth</i> as “doing very well on both PS5 and PC” in terms of sales. He also shared with <i>ScreenRant</i> how the recent live-action <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> remake inspired his decisions in reinterpreting <i>FF7</i> for the remake trilogy:</p> <blockquote><p>When development [on <i>FF7 Remake</i>] was happening, the <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> movie remake was released. That movie, the original, was one I watched as a child. And then they now had the live-action that’s a remake…I saw the overall story and the world itself was not altered, but it was completely deconstructed in a way to really entertain today’s viewers, which was deeply satisfying.</p></blockquote> <p>Although <i>FF7</i>’s remake chapters have occupied his time, Hamaguchi has spent some time daydreaming about other possible remakes in the classic JRPG series. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Speaking to <i>Windows Central</i></a>, the director described <i>FF6</i> as his favorite, saying “That would be very cool to take on as a remake. I’ve put my heart and soul into the <i>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</i> series for over a decade now. Working on something completely new would be quite fun as well.”</p>

			<p>Heart Machine, the studio behind Hyper Light Breaker, Hyper Light Drifter, and Solar Ash, is getting ready to release its next game, Possessor(s), which it has announced will arrive on PC and PS5 on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Possessor(s) is a 2D search-action title where you play as Luca, but you also play as Rhem, the demon possessing Luca, as you both work together to escape the clutches of a company called Agradyne, who was using demons like Rhem to power the energy they sold to Sanzu City, the game's setting.</p>



<p>A gameplay overview trailer that debuted today alongside the release date news shows off the art and design chops Heart Machine is known for, while also delving into what Possessor(s) is about, and a bit more on how the high school-aged Luca and the demon Rhem ended up having to work together.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The launch of Possessor(s) will mark the second major release for Heart Machine in 2025 as it started the year with the early access launch of Hyper Light Breaker. Since then, the game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breakers-first-major-update-buried-below-arrives-next-week-game-key-giveaway/">received multiple updates</a>, the most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/497207097933433675?l=english">having arrived earlier this week</a>, as Heart Machine continues to fix and tweak the game in collaboration with its community.</p>



<p>Unlike Hyper Light Breaker, Possessor(s) is not releasing in early access, with the complete game set to launch in a little more than a month at the time of this writing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-pricey-tablets-from-apple-and-samsung-this-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-is-going-for-nothing-before-october-prime-day.1309989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been perusing for a fancy new tablet, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/">do take note that the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ just got its price chopped down over at Amazon.</a> Usually this Samsung tablet starts at&nbsp; $220, but right now you can score the 11-inch Android for just $159. The 28% discount amounts to a savings of $61. That’s for the 64 GB model by the way. Double your storage, and you can still save as the 128 GB model dropped from $270 to just $209. That one is a 23% discount which works also out to you saving $61. Both versions are available in either black or silver.</p>
<p>This 2024 Galaxy tablet has a nice and large 11-inch LCD screen which can display in resolutions of up to 1200p with a refresh rate of 90 Hz. According to the product page, the Galaxy Tab A9+ can deliver a “cinema-like audio experience,” which is, uh, an obvious embellishment. No one is expecting something you can hold in your hands to match that of an AMC theater. What this is really saying is the tablet has Dolby Atmos support. You can expect terrific sound that’s loud and clear as far as tablets go coming from the on-board speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The build of the Galaxy tablet is slim and light, yet durable —exactly what you’d hope for on a device you’d likely to take with you out and about. Bring it from home to your office, down to a coffee house, then over to a friend’s no problem.</p>
<p>Storage we covered. You have a choice between either 64 GB or 128 GB. The price jump from one to the next is an even $50. If you expect to be downloading a bunch of movies or TV shows or storing tons of photos, you may decide it’s best to splurge. Otherwise if streaming and documents saved to the cloud will be the main way you use it, just stick with the cheaper 64 GB.</p>



<h2>Full Flexibility</h2>
<p>Android OS is able to run multiple apps at the same time, allowing you to view them side-by-side. This is excellent when multitasking, letting you work more efficiently. You can even view multiple tabs in you web browser next to each other. Transferring files is easy as Quick Share allows you to send stuff to another nearby device with just a couple button presses.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/">If you have little ones at home, they can enjoy your Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ as well</a>. The Samsung Kids app is filled with all sorts of playful and colorful content to keep them entertained.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/brazil-president-signs-law-to-ban-loot-boxes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/brazil%E2%80%99s-president-signs-ban-on-loot-boxes-aimed-at-u-18s-into-law-will-go-into-effect-in-march-2026.1309974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As a part of <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2025/lei/L15211.htm">a law focused on protecting Brazil's youth online</a>, a ban on loot boxes for those under 18 in Brazil has been signed into law by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and will go into effect in March 2026, per a report from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-campaign-against-predatory-in-game-practices-takes-a-step-forward-in-brazil-as-president-lula-bans-loot-boxes-targeted-at-under-18s">Eurogamer</a>.</p>



<p>Specifically, when the law goes into effect in March, as it currently stands, games that have loot boxes will have to be rated as 18+, and any rated below that will be prohibited from including them.</p>



<p>It's the latest update in governing bodies across the world, looking more closely at loot boxes in videogames. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/dutch-government-intends-to-ban-lootboxes-in-games-alltogether/">2023, the Dutch government put forth a motion to ban loot boxes</a> in games altogether, and back in 2018, Belgium also banned loot boxes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-cease-sales-fifa-points-belgium/">prompting the sale of FIFA points to cease in the region</a>.</p>



<p>There's also been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-loot-box-class-action-lawsuit-canada-costly/">cases of lawsuits brought to game companies</a> over loot boxes, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lootboxes-battlefront-ii-gambling-banned/">whether they constitute gambling</a>. Though there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-ultimate-team-packs-arent-gambling-rules-austrian-court/">rulings pointing towards them not being gambling</a>, they remain a controversial element of modern gaming's live service era.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how strictly this current ban in Brazil is enforced, and how game companies respond to the new law once it officially goes into effect in March of next year. Even before then, we could likely see companies lobbying in an attempt to change the law, so that we don't have a case of, as a hypothetical, EA Sports FC being rated as 18+ in Brazil, and as a game suitable for children everywhere else.</p>



<p>Though if the ban does prove effective, it could be that one of the videogame industry's largest sticking points is slowly changed through further legislation like what Brazil is implementing in other parts of the world.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-26-year-old-mystery-behind-a-cult-classic-srpg%E2%80%99s-gradius-sword-has-finally-been-solved.1309971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Vandal Hearts II</em> is an obscure strategy RPG sequel produced by Konami at the end of the PS1’s life. Few played it but many who did will cherish it forever. Now its oldest and weirdest mystery has finally be solved. A reference to Konami’s classic shoot ’em up series <em>Gradius</em> mentioned a special sword in the game’s files that no one could ever get to spawn without hacks. Fans thought up all sorts of wild theories about the “intended” way to unlock the secret, including maybe needing very specific save files from other Konami games like<em> Suikoden</em>. It turns out that they actually needed a super-rare demo disc.</p> <p>The Gradius Sword in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> isn’t just a fun little Easter egg. The weapon contains a powerful spell called “Ripple Laser” that summons an actual 3D model of <em>Gradius</em>‘ ship, the Vic Viper, to fly across the battlefield and blow up enemies. It’s pretty powerful and has a surprisingly ornate animation for something that no one was ever able to discover in the game naturally. The result has been decades of random threads across <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=2">message boards like GameFAQs</a> and elsewhere as fans tried to figure out what you could actually do in the game to trigger the Gradius Sword to appear.</p> <p>Three years ago, the tiny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjQ4JRg9fo">YouTube account Dragon Quarter</a> reposted footage of the Ripple Laser skill in action that was originally uploaded in 2010. Then last night, Dragon Quarter returned with a major update. “After getting a tip from a follower (who I realize now got their tip from a recent post on&nbsp;<a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">GameFAQs</a>) of Twitch streamer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/karkalla" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Karkalla</a>, who is currently playing through <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> for the first time, I have confirmed the Gradius Sword was originally unlocked by downloading a special save data file from Dengeki PlayStation D22 (SLPM-80471), a demo disc included with <em>Dengeki PlayStation Magazine</em> Issue 116 (dated 1999-09-24),” they <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-decades-old-mystery-about-a-hidden-unlockable-gradius-sword-in-vandal-hearts-ii-for-playstation-has-finally-been-figured-out.1309491/">posted</a> on ResetEra on Friday.</p>

  <p>According to GameFAQs user Kern, the discovery came after finding a reference to the demo disc on an older Japanese site. “Someone on a discord who had some old discs found the file on the D22 disc (which you can get from ebay),” they wrote. “I wasn’t able to verify it personally myself but he posted images of the file, and he was able to open the save file on an English copy and the Gradius sword was available for purchase.” Dragon Quarter has since confirmed it as well.</p>

 <p>This is the kind of deep gaming lore I thrive on. For years, random players <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/53785268">on forums have claimed</a> to have found the weapon early on in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> just by chance. Is it possible there’s some one in a million chance for it to just spawn randomly without the demo disc data? Who knows. It seems clear that Konami at least intended for it to be an exclusive bonus for owners of the demo disc, similar to the deluxe edition pre-orders of today that let players begin a game with unique upgrades and gear.</p> <p>The most absurd theory by far was that you needed to have a final Gregminster save point from the original<em> Suikoden</em> on a memory card to get the Gradius Sword to appear in the shop. When that was debunked a couple of years ago, many players had resigned themselves to the weapon only being available via some hacked save file from “Jean” that was uploaded to GameFAQs over a decade ago. Now players can get it the “official” way by downloading a <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/saves">copy of the demo disc save</a> and using a PS3 memory card converter to get the data onto a PS1 memory card.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="cec31544ef737"><a title="Devon Pritchard Lead" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cec31544ef737/devon-pritchard-lead.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement">Nintendo shared the news</a> that none of us could have predicted so soon: Bowser is stepping down from the position of top dog at the end of this year. The Koopas will have to find a new king, the Mushroom Kingdom will have to find a new menace, the kart racing scene will ha- what? Not <em>that</em> Bowser? Oh... we're going to miss these jokes.</p>
<p>Okay, for real now: Nintendo announced that <em>Doug</em> Bowser is retiring from his role as Nintendo of America President on 31st December 2025. After six years in the position, Bowser is to be succeeded by Devon Pritchard, a long-time NOA executive and the subsidiary's first female president.</p>
<p>While we'll be sad to see Mr. B go at the end of the year, it's an exciting time to get to know the new face stepping into his boots — not literally, we assume. You might have seen Devon Pritchard's name crop up in various conferences and events in recent years, but we actually know surprisingly little about her.</p>
<p>So, join us as we run through everything we know about the new face of NOA, and say farewell to 'not <em>that</em> Bowser' in the process — come on, who knows when we're going to be able to make those jokes again?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:188448 @ 1758909099 -->
<h2>Who Is Devon Pritchard?</h2>
<h3>Far From A Nintendo Newbie</h3>
<p>Despite appearing at a fair few Nintendo events in recent years — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFfc70f6rE">the San Francisco Nintendo Store grand opening</a>, Switch 2 reveal etc. — the name Devon Pritchard may not have entered your sphere. But it should have, because she's far from an NOA newbie.</p>

<p>Pritchard joined Nintendo of America in 2006, heading up the subsidiary's legal department as its presidency changed from Tatsumi Kimishima to Reggie Fils-Aimé — remember that guy?</p>
<p>She would go on to take leadership roles in the company's Marketing, Business Affairs, and Publisher Relations sectors, before landing her current title of NOA’s Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing and Consumer Experience in 2021.</p>
<p>Why is this important to note? Well, because it follows a similar pattern to what we have seen with NOA's presidential promotions in the past. Let's not forget, both Bowser and Reggie's NOA careers started in the sales and marketing departments (of which they were both vice presidents), and Kimishima came to the role off the back of his work in Pokémon finances. If you want a new NOA president, you look to the internal marketing and finance departments first.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:134329 @ 1758909636 -->
<h3>Law, What Is It Good For?</h3>
<p>With all that background, it'll come as no surprise that Devon Pritchard knows her legal onions. She became a Doctor of Law at the Gonzaga University School of Law in 2001, and before that, got a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from Kansas State University.</p>
<p>While at Kansas State, she played on the university volleyball team... sooo, revival of the canned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/06/next_levels_super_mario_spikers_was_canned_because_nintendo_had_issues_with_its_level_of_violence">Super Mario Spikers</a>, then? We doubt it.</p>
<h3>A Grip On Gaming?</h3>
<p>It seems somewhat counterintuitive, but being the most die-hard capital-G <em>Gamer</em> isn't necessarily a prerequisite to being the Nintendo of America President.</p>
<p>Of course, we all remember Reggie being very much hands-on in this department, regularly sharing what he was playing and for how long — what can we say? He had to get back to playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on his Nintendo 3DS — but do you ever recall Bowser sharing his playtime?</p>
<figure data-uuid="307f8fc5e9f93"><a title="Reggie Look" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/307f8fc5e9f93/reggie-look.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don't know for sure what Pritchard's <em>vidyagame</em> chops are like just yet, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9fW2TGXxco">Kit &amp; Krysta's latest video</a> shed <em>some</em> light on her gaming habits. The former-NOA employees worked closely with the soon-to-be President during their tenure at the company, and while they agreed that she's far from a hardcore gamer, they were quick to point out that she knows her Nintendo.</p>
<p>"She definitely loves Nintendo," Krysta stated. "Like all of us, she has these childhood memories of connecting with Nintendo in some way, shape or form. She's probably not playing games every day for many hours, she's not a '<em>core gamer</em>', as we like to call it, but she definitely understands the industry, and she understands how Nintendo fits into [it]."</p>
<p>Kit was quick to also point out that Pritchard has young children, and very much views Nintendo's image through them. "I had some very insightful conversations with her about the industry, about games, and about Nintendo's games. So, I think she's really on it."</p>

<h3>Pik Me A Winner<br></h3>
<p>Let's briefly address the Bulborb in the room: yes, there is a picture of Devon Pritchard holding a Bulborb plushie, and yes, it was formerly her display picture on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devon-pritchard-a970a21aa/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Does that mean we're going to get <strong>Pikmin 5</strong> under her leadership? Maybe. But a NOA president being a fan of a series doesn't really have any sway over what the company releases, and, according to Krysta Yang, "she's not really a Pikmin fan".</p>
<p>But hey, we can dream...</p>
<h3>Bye To Bowser</h3>
<figure data-uuid="4933d2c1eaa82"><a title="Doug Bowser Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4933d2c1eaa82/doug-bowser-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, Pritchard sounds like a promising follow-up, but we couldn't celebrate the incoming talent without also sending a goodbye to Mr. Bowser himself — he's been the NOA president for the past six years, after all.</p>
<p>When we look back on the Bowser era, it's impossible <em>not</em> to compare him to Reggie. Let's admit it, Bowser wasn't the larger-than-life quote machine that his predecessor was, but honestly, who is?</p>
<p>Bowser's tenure can generally be looked back on as steadily guiding H.M.S. Nintendo of America through calm waters; for that, he did a good job. Nintendo didn't need another recognisable Reggie-like to drum up the hype at otherwise quiet Directs because, since Bowser's introduction in 2019, the output has been anything but quiet.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">launched to record-breaking sales numbers</a>, Nintendo continues to earn more money than ever before, and Bowser has, from an outside perspective at least, maintained cool, calm, and collected at the head of it all.</p>
<p>It mightn't have been the back-to-back tough-call role of previous NOA presidents, but remaining steady during some of the strangest times for the wider industry is nothing to scoff at — even if you do think he should have pulled rank on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> à la Reggie and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a> to make the damn thing a pack in...</p>
<p>As for what the incoming president had to say about her predecessor, Pritchard shared the following message on her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7377109391864610816/">LinkedIn</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on an incredible career, Doug! You’ve been a fantastic leader and it’s an honor to build on the foundation you’ve established here at Nintendo. On behalf of the entire Nintendo of America team, thank you for everything. Wishing you a well-deserved and happy retirement!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Setting A President For The Future</h3>
<p>So, where does this leave us for the future? Honestly, we'd be surprised if it were anything other than more of the same.</p>
<p>The days of Nintendo requiring a Reggie figure at the helm are long behind us. Nintendo is <em>not</em> big on its personalities, and if the Bowser era has taught us anything, it's that the NOA president will mainly stay out of the public eye while the going's good.</p>
<p>From an outside perspective, we can only assume that Pritchard will follow the same approach: generally staying in the background before occasionally popping up at a North American event or showcase. That's just the way Nintendo <em>is</em> these days.</p>
<p>But who knows, perhaps she's being measured up for a Jim Henson puppet replica as we speak.</p>
<figure data-uuid="74d119a1b787e"><a title="Nintendo Direct Puppets" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74d119a1b787e/nintendo-direct-puppets.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Hat Productions has announced it will be launching a crowdfunding campaign for Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins. This is not a reprint of the original documentary-style books, but rather a new collection of volumes that delve into the early years of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and its numerous supplements.</p>

<h2>The <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> Backerkit Campaign Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its official <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/0477a26f-723e-4d2f-8f11-74cdc007daf1/landing" rel="nofollow">landing page</a>, <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> is a 4-volume set that covers the history of each and every product released by TSR for original <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>AD&amp;D</em>, and <em>Basic D&amp;D</em>. This will include all Unearthed Arcana, the legendary orange-covered B3, and the rare 1986 <em>Up The Garden Path</em> prewritten adventure.</p>

She delves deeply into the artwork, design, and origins, as well as other iconic books released during the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG's formative years. Everything from the start of the TTRPG genre, to the discovery of the Forgotten Realms, to the fall of Mystara will be covered in these books.</p>

<p>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins is a more comprehensive look at one of <em>D&amp;D's</em> eras by Appelcline. This is in comparison to past <em>Designers &amp; Dragons</em> books, which focused more on the broader history of the TTRPG industry. The origin of TSR and the influence of wargaming in the 1970s. The rise of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-rpg-series-returns-to-us-through-steve-jackson-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steve Jackson</a> and West End Games in the 80s. The growth of independent publishers in the 2000s. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Evil Hat Productions is the publisher of many beloved TTRPGs throughout the years. Their work includes the electropunk dark fantasy heist game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/blades-in-dark-review-next-level-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, the <em>Dresden Files</em> RPG, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>, <em>Apocalypse Keys</em>, and <em>Monster of the Week</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the landing page, the Backerkit campaign for <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> will go live near the end of October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We can’t blame you if you were planning on keeping your wallet stashed away until Amazon’s Fall Prime Day hits on Oct. 7-8, but the run-up to the big event is often where you can find sneaky-good deals as Amazon looks to clear out the shelves. We found this one today — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">24% off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro, which brings their price down to just $190.</a> That’s right in line with Apple’s AirPods 4 and a big drop from the closer-comparison AirPods Pro3.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds3 Pro got a full redesign from Samsung before dropping this past July, with an emphasis on comfort for long listening sessions. The sound is, of course, the amazing quality that Samsung’s famous for. And these buds are bolstered by Galaxy AI to enhance the noise cancellation, equalization, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Theater of the Mind</h2>
<p>Whether you’re listening to your own playlist or connecting to your tablet or TV via Bluetooth, the surround sound from the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is so good and so immersive it’s like being in the theater, but the sound is all for you. Dual amplifiers and a 2-way speaker in each bud creates a 360-degree effect, and Galaxy AI powers an adaptive equalizer that optimizes the sound specifically for you.</p>
<p>You can disappear into the listening experience of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro regardless of where you are, because the Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation feature, also powered by Galaxy AI, intelligently adjusts the level of noise cancellation based on your surroundings, and changes is as the conditions around you change. You won’t want to put them down, and thanks to the comfort-enhancing redesign and long battery life, you won’t have to.</p>



<h2>Futuristic Features</h2>
<p>One of the most jawdropping features of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is the real-time interpreter. When your Buds3 Pro are paired with a compatible Galaxy device, your can carry on a conversation with someone speaking a foreign language and hear the translation on your earbuds in real time. All you need is a Samsung account, from which you can download languages for free. (English and Spanish are pre-installed.)</p>
<p>Will there be incredible tech deals dropping during the two-day Fall Prime Day event? Of course. But consider the several days leading into the event a golden opportunity to find those under-the-radar bargains Amazon likes to drop as they get their inventory set for the big rush. This is most definitely one of them — a $60-off deal on Samsung’s newest and best wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Get the Galaxy Buds3 Pro for just $190 and beat the Prime Day rush.</a></p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/roblox-child-exploitation-lawsuits-consolidation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lawyers-look-to-consolidate-dozens-of-roblox-child-exploitation-lawsuits.1309917/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Roblox</em> has a <a href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predator problem</a>, according to the dozens of lawsuits filed against the game platform over the past year. Lawyers&nbsp; are looking to consolidate at least 31 different lawsuits filed in 12 different districts into one, big multidistrict litigation. The alleged victims in these cases are all different — and, crucially, all children — but the core of the lawsuits are the same: Parents are looking to hold Roblox accountable for its role in the abuses their children are alleged to have experienced on the platform.</p><p>“The case presents a matter of significant public concern involving a multibillion-dollar technology platform, Roblox, falsely represented as safe for children,” lawyers wrote in a newly filed document asking the court to consider consolidating the cases. “In truth, the platform’s design is alleged to be dangerously and unreasonably defective, providing a platform that enables adult predators to easily target, contact, and exploit minors.”</p><p><em>Roblox</em> is more popular than ever. <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/06/roblox-infrastructure-supporting-record-breaking-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">By Roblox’s own count</a>, more than 30 million people were using the platform in June 2025, a number that has since grown to a reported 47 million concurrent users, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/roblox-is-reportedly-bigger-than-the-entirety-of-steam-with-a-whopping-47-4-million-concurrent-users-almost-exclusively-thanks-to-two-games-steal-a-brainrot-and-grow-a-garden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per unofficial data</a>. A large number of those people were pouring into two wildly popular games: <em>Grow A Garden</em> and <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> — they both can amass tens of millions of players at one time.</p><p>By design, <em>Roblox</em> is a space for socialization and play rather than a game itself. <em>Roblox</em> is a platform where its users can create games and other experiences. There are thousands of games and experiences, most of which don’t have the immense popularity (and millions of players) of <em>Grow A Garden</em> and <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>. But the promise of <em>Roblox</em> is that anyone can see this potential success, and anyone can play in the created spaces. It attracts a lot of children because of that simplicity, but it’s a space where adults congregate, too. Connection on the app is easy; part of the draw is that people can socialize with others while playing games. But, according to these lawsuits, Roblox isn’t doing enough to keep kids safe from the dangers that bad actors using the platform present.</p><p>Each of these lawsuits has their own individual claims and impacts, and separately detail the way in which a child allegedly met a predator on <em>Roblox</em> who later coerced and exploited that child. In one lawsuit, filed in September, <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/roblox-discord-lawsuit-teen-suicide-b2826315.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mother is suing Roblox for wrongful death</a> after her son died by suicide following abuse by a 37-year-old man he met on the platform. In a different lawsuit, <a href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a parent said that their child had been coerced and abducted across state lines</a> by a predator the child met on <em>Roblox</em>. The child later escaped. Other lawsuits detail alleged other sorts of exploitation and blackmail, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/air-force-member-charged-sexual-exploitation-nine-year-old-child-long-island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including bribing children for explicit photographs</a> with money or <em>Roblox</em>’s currency, Robux. The common thread between all these lawsuits is the claim that Roblox is responsible because it failed in creating a space that was truly safe for children.&nbsp;</p><p>Multidistrict litigation is a strategy that’s designed to streamline the court processes in instances where a company is being sued by lots of different people in different districts. Lawyers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138572/video-game-addiction-lawsuits-2023-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempted to consolidate a bunch of different video game addiction lawsuits</a> into a multidistrict litigation case in 2024, but the court panel denied the effort because the cases were levied against too many different companies. (The lawsuits can still continue on an individual level. Some have since been dismissed, while others are ongoing.) However, <a href="https://www.broughtonpartners.com/updates-on-video-game-addiction-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 100 lawsuits alleging video game addiction <em>were</em> consolidated</a> in the California court system in 2025; this consolidation is cited in the exploitation filings as proof that centralizing these lawsuits is appropriate.</p><p>A Roblox representative told Aftermath it “strongly disagree[s] with the characterization by the plaintiffs lawyers and will respond in court.” The company said it has implemented “over 100” new safety features “this year alone,” including age verification, AI tools to monitor voice chats, and the ability for parents to better control what their children have access to.&nbsp;</p><p>“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, and prohibiting sexual conversations,” a Roblox spokesperson told Aftermath in an email. “We also partner with law enforcement and leading child safety organizations worldwide to combat the sexual exploitation of children.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Roblox vice president of civility and partnerships Tami Bhaumik addressed the issue and Roblox’s improved safety measures while also claiming that the “negative press has come from things that have happened five years ago,” <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-negative-press-child-safety-old-events-1236527396/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Variety</a>.</p><p>As press around Roblox’s safety issues continues to grow, so does its userbase, making parents and lawmakers’ continued fight for accountability even more urgent. Alongside these parent lawsuits, Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in August that she’s suing Roblox</a> over its alleged negligence. Oklahoma attorney general Gentner Drummond announced in mid-September that he, too, <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/oag/news/newsroom/2025/september/drummond-moves-to-hold-roblox-accountable-for-child-safety-failure.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is looking into legal action against Roblox</a> “over serious child safety concerns.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-voice-in-games-coalition-helps-game-developers"><h3>New Coalition Seeks To Help Palestinian Game Developers ‘Speak Loudly’ Through Games</h3></a><p>Palestinian Voices in Games aims to ‘push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/easy-delivery-co-impressions-review"><h3>Finding Peace In Work</h3></a><p>I've had a great time playing Easy Delivery Co.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soulframe-bear-stomach-interview-digital-extremes"><h3>Inside The Soulframe Scene Where You Go Inside A Bear</h3></a><p>"There is a running gag that I watched over 40 hours of bear colonoscopy videos"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon"><h3>Netflix’s Kiss Or Die Is Yakuza’s Cringiest Eroge Substory Turned Into A Full-Blown Variety Show</h3></a><p>A sketch show with comedians, AV actresses, and a high-budget production that's more insufferable than entertaining</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/roblox-child-exploitation-lawsuits-consolidation]]></content:encoded>

The city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building</a> genre is grossly overpopulated. Competing Simvilles predicated on wholly opposed theories about plumbing and traffic wardens stretch as far as the eye can see. As such, the genre must imitate real-life urban centres of the 20th century, and begin expanding vertically. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stario-haven-tower">Stario: Haven Tower</a>, the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> management sim from Chinese developers Stargate Games, in which you build upward through the realms of Sand, Mist, Rain, Frost, and Clear Skies until finally, your city stands among the Stars.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Accomplishing this will require a fair amount of faith, but above all - yes, literally above all, ha ha - it will require a mastery of resourcing and logistics. You will need to stretch water pipelines between city layers, set up balloon deliveries, and engage in shrewd bartering with the flying turtles that, for some reason, keep showing up at your window. You will also need to think about reinforcing the foundations and/or managing the city's mass with "lattice-like aerial platforms" and so forth.

Stario enters early access today, and I've just procured a code from one of the flying turtles that periodically appears at my window, asking me to write about a videogame. As such, I can't give you much sense of how it plays, but I like the concept's blend of mysticism and heavy engineering, though I have reservations about the in-game vocabulary. You can build sacred beacons to raise the morale of your, ugh, "Towertizens", together with ritual platforms that can be used to meddle with the weather.
</p><p>
If nothing else, it cuts an intriguing figure. The architecture is ornate and colourful but also, curiously muted in places, almost a little spreadsheety. There's a flat interface that floats next to your tower and drifts about when you rotate the camera, not quite ruining the view. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I hope to fit in some time with this over the coming weeks, but given the abundance of town-tenders round these parts, I figured you'd like to hear about it now. Food for discussion about this very busy genre, if not a thing to immediately purchase. Stario: Haven Tower will remain in early access for 6-12 months, according to the developers - you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3209750/STARIO_Haven_Tower/">read more on Steam</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/head-magic-the-gathering-designer-apologizes-for-misogynistic-card-from-27-years-ago.1309887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has finally come clean about one of the bigger stains on its legacy. Veteran head designer Mark Rosewater recently apologized for the misogynistic treatment of a low-level pro player in the ’90s that he immortalized as a printed card called Ghazbán Ogress. “I have had a hand in creating thousands of Magic cards over the years, and Ghazban Ogress is the one I most regret making,” he <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/795689646039367680/there-was-a-video-posted-yesterday-about-the-card">wrote</a> in a new blog post.</p> <p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ugl/60/ghazb%C3%A1n-ogress">Ghazbán Ogress</a> was a parody of an existing card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/arn/49/ghazb%C3%A1n-ogre">Ghazbán Ogre</a>, but its real inspiration was a woman named Catherine Nicoloff, an aspiring pro player who also dated several different top players in the ’90s <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> competitive scene. Part of the 1998 Unglued side-expansion, which was designed entirely by Rosewater, the card’s description read, “When Ghazban Ogress comes into play, the player who has won the most <em>Magic</em> games that day gains control of it.” It essentially took slut shaming that was happening in private and immortalized it in print.</p> <p>This darker chapter in the card game’s history was explored in a recent video on the <a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheTranquilDomainMTG">The Tranquil Domain</a> YouTube channel in which Nicoloff was interviewed about it for the first time. “I just wanted to be one of the guys at the time,” she said. “That was the biggest compliment you could get is if you were one of the guys and man, when people say guys don’t gossip, boy are they lying. So, the attention was mixed, but you were always being watched. I could not go anywhere without being watched. If I went to lunch with a friend, there would be a rumor the next day that I was seen with so-and-so and I was dating him, even if I wasn’t, even if it was nothing more than a lunch where we were talking about decks or cards or draft strategy or whatever.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I laughed at and shared that joke at the time, when I was a teenager, and it certainly can’t have made women feel welcome in the community. I think one of the worst habits that Magic embedded in me was choosing my social circle based largely on peoples’ perceived skill.</p> <p>— Brian Kibler (@bmkibler) <a href="https://twitter.com/bmkibler/status/1395410046394060802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nicoloff said Rosewater took her aside during one event to give her a heads-up that the Ghazbán Ogress card would be coming out. “Mark Rosewater wielded enormous power over the game and continues to do so,” she said. “I was just, you know, a a small-time wannabe pro player. So, at that moment, it this is going to sound melodramatic, but it just kind of broke me a little because I had thought Mark was a friend. I thought he was trying to be humorous, but [that] he had the best interests of the players at heart. And now I’d been handed this tiger by the tail, and I had to either ride it or get eaten by it. That was what Mark gave to me.”</p>

 <p>She ended up signing some other people’s copies of the card while also trying to collect as many of them as possible to keep it from spreading. Nicoloff reckons she has two binder pages full of Ghazbán Ogress now. It wasn’t until a viral post about the incident four years ago by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/nh5pep/comment/hf1dq1n/?context=3"><em>Magic</em> player Brian Kibler</a> that she wanted to correct the record about what a gross thing it was. “I admit I still felt just a little bit angry and a little bit hurt by the whole thing because this was like an elephant in the room and nobody had ever apologized to me.”</p>

 <p>That changed after the video went live and people started asking Rosewater about it. In a post over on his blog he unequivocally apologized for it. “Let me start by stating unequivocally that it was a mistake to have ever printed the card. It is 100% my doing,” he <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/795689646039367680/there-was-a-video-posted-yesterday-about-the-card">wrote</a>. “I designed it and put it into the set. I take full responsibility for the card’s existence. It’s important to own up to one’s mistakes and not try to justify them.”</p> <p>Rosewater has since called Nicoloff to apologize 27 years later, an apology which he said she accepted. “This apology should have come decades earlier though, and for that I am also sorry,” he wrote. “Magic cards should be something that bring people together and help foster growth and connection,” he added. “It should never be used to tear people down.”</p>

              <p>Following the non-appearance of a new mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> was left with a bit of a predicament at the end of its three years of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets. So, rather than drag it on, the trading card game has opted to return to Mega Evolutions, perfectly in time with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380">giant monsters’ resurgence in the forthcoming <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>. The first new set, out today in the U.S., is aptly and simply called Mega Evolution, and based on opening a few dozen packs, I’m delighted to report that a newfound generosity seems to have arrived.</p> <p>Now, while The Pokémon Company has chosen to save the really big guns for November’s next set, Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-charizard-x-ex-secret-rare-card-inferno-2000628025">a Charizard card that is likely to cause riots in the streets</a>, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some big hitters in this first outing for the new era. Sure to see high demand and higher prices are Special Illustration Rares for fan favorites Mega Venusaur ex, Mega Lucario ex and Mega Latias ex, as well as one very special card: the return of Mega Gardevoir ex. I can’t hold it in any longer. I pulled it! I pulled the Gardevoir!</p> <p>OK, I’m not going to let this color my assessment of the set, but I will say I when I opened it last night I ran upstairs and woke up my son to show him in quite the display of excellent parenting. Oh, and the centering on the reverse is <em>awful</em>, so there’s no hope of a nice PSA rating. Right, moving on.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629190"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629190">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Another New Beginning</h2> <p>While the ex cards continue to appear, although only in Mega Evolved form here, Mega Evolution does represent something of a resetting of recent trends in the TCG. For instance, the completely out-of-control reverse holos with either Poké Balls or Master Balls on them are all gone, and in fact the reverse holo has no pattern&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. There are no holo Energy cards, no Ace Spec-likes—just a very basic set of a very normal size (188 cards). As such, in this sense, it feels like an appropriate wiping clean of the slate for a new era. In another sense, other than the Mega Evolved Pokémon, it’s an incredibly&nbsp;<em>ordinary</em> set, too. The art on a large number of the Basic cards is weirdly generic, images that look so plain that you’d swear you’ve seen them before.</p>

 <p>This makes for an odd set in some ways. With no new Pokémon arriving, and the indistinct art, most of the cards feel like they could come from any era in any of the last ten years. However, when you pull something more special, they feel&nbsp;<em>very</em> special, and I’m delighted to report that in our smallish sample, that happened a lot more often than I was expecting.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629195"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629195">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So <em>Pokémon TCG</em> sets in recent years have been built of your regular cards with the small window of art, Double Rares that are either the older basic Vs or the more recent basic ex cards, Ultra Rares which tend to be more elaborate V/ex arts or full-art Trainer cards, then the desirable Illustration Rares (IR) which are full-art cards depicting Pokémon in their environment, followed by Special Illustration Rares (SIR) which also full-art, but mostly far more elaborately detailed. Then you get your gold cards which used to be the most prized, but more recently lost all their allure—this time out there are just two of them, with a lot more detail etched into the gold foil, and the hilarious new classification of Mega Hyper Rare. Mega Evolution sticks to this formula but with a boost, giving those Illustration Rares a big upgrade: the artworks in this set are <i data-stringify-type="italic">astonishing</i>.</p>

 <p>Each time I pulled an IR I was convinced it had to be an SIR, so gorgeous and elaborate was the art. Cards like the Clawitzer, Bulbasaur, and Ivysaur IRs would previously have easily been given an SIR rating. And yes, that means the 10 SIR cards have stepped up too, all of them (but for the Mega Absol ex, I would argue) looking like they could have been the ultimate chase card in any set on their own. Mega Latias ex is just extraordinary, while the Mega Lucario ex seems to be deliberately evoking the classic Mewtwo vs Charizard cards of the <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era, as the Lucario soars over a city, wheeling back to punch an attacking Venusaur. And talking of it, the Mega Venusaur ex card completes a triptych set with Bulbasaur and Ivysaur in gobsmacking artwork by very new Pokémon artist mashu. And then, yes, there’s that Mega Gardevoir ex, with a degree of intricacy not seen since <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/crownzenith/H69.shtml">Akira Egawa’s Giratina VSTAR in Crown Zenith</a>. (Egawa designed the Mega Latias in this set.) What’s more extraordinary is that the Gardevoir card was designed by an artist brand new to the TCG, Raita Kazama, who has previously designed incredible packaging and sleeves for the franchise, but never a card.</p>

 <h2>Pull Rates</h2> <p>Pull rates over&nbsp;<em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> felt like they were crawling by the end, settling on a pretty desultory 1 in 5 chance of a pack having something you’d care about, even including a basic ex. Mega Evolution (and again, I stress my sample size is non-scientific) blew this out of the water for me. Of the first 40 packs, I pulled 12 cards Ultra Rare or higher! If you include the basic ex cards (which look great, by the way) that goes up to 21 pulls from 40 packs. 1 in 2?! And better than 1 in 4 for real pulls. That’s so much more appealing, and a far better use of someone’s allowance.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629192">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>What’s The Meta?</h2> <p>As for how all this will affect the game itself, I’d say it’ll be pretty big stuff. The Mega cards are as powerful as you’d hope, and are going to absolutely flip the meta. Mega Gardevoir ex, for instance, has a one-Energy ability called Overflowing Wishes that lets you add an Energy card to <em>every</em> benched Psychic Pokémon you have at once, and a second called Mega Symphonia that’ll deliver 50 damage for every Psychic Energy attached. It’s a Stage 2, so you’re not going to be playing it out your deck, but at the same time that gives you a lot of time to build up its Energy stock while you evolve it. Meanwhile, Mega Abomasnow ex could possibly deliver the highest damage I’ve ever heard of. Hammer-lanche has you discard the top six cards from your deck, doing 100 damage for every Energy card that’s there. Load your deck with Energy and you could hit for 600! Albeit at a hefty cost for your reserves of cards, of course.</p> <p>Mega Camerupt ex can deliver a ludicrous 240 damage for&nbsp;<em>one</em> Energy if the opponent is Burned, while my favorite, Mega Mawile, can take a Huge Bite of 260 damage if an opponent is unharmed (and only 30 if it isn’t!), but also Gobble Down for 80 per prize card you’ve taken. What a finisher that would be, your opponent finally playing their stacked Mega Gardevoir with five prize cards gone, and you clobber it in one turn for 380.</p>

 <p>There are also nice twists like Wally’s Companion, a Trainer card featuring good ol’ Wally that will heal&nbsp;<em>all</em> damage from an ex Pokémon at the cost of returning Energy attached to it back to your hand. Yup, it’s not discarded!</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629193">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is to be a very brief set, given the arrival of Phantasmal Flames as soon as November 14. It’s an even shorter time if you live outside the U.S., where Mega Evolution has been delayed by a full two weeks due to manufacturing issues—barely a month long. But it’s a lovely way to begin the new era, unless I was just ridiculously lucky!</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Frozen Lake has previously collaborated with Gearbox on Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderland, per the studio. In addition, Frozen Lake highlights experience assisting on games set during World War II, such as Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond as well as Sniper Elite 4.</p><p dir="ltr">The last mainline Brothers in Arms game that was released on consoles and PC was 2008's Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway. The FPS was developed by Gearbox and published by Ubisoft. Since then, there have been multiple mobile titles (like 2014's Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War) and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brothers-in-arms-furious-4-to-be-reimagined-into-new-ip/1100-6394527/">a Gearbox-developed project called Brothers in Arms: Furious 4</a> that ultimately was canceled, with some elements later used for the ill-fated Battleborn.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/">Borderlands 4</a> just launched earlier this month from Gearbox.

                <p>A MOBA that's been in development for 15 years and launched into early access in May 2025 to a "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790090/Sirocco/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mostly positive</a>" Steam rating has unceremoniously shut down. The game never left its early-access period and, according to developer Lunchbox Entertainment, couldn't keep going despite the team's best efforts.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBqkNeYZje4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sBqkNeYZje4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>You may have never heard of this game before now. Titled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790090/Sirocco/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sirocco</a>, it's a 5v5 naval brawler where customizable boats try to send each other to the bottom of the sea. It started as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged/" data-ref-id="5000-504202">Warcraft 3</a> mod over a decade ago before the team made the concept--a sort of Battleships-esque multiplayer online battle arena--a full-blown game. It's only ever peaked at 882 players some four months ago, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2790090/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB data</a>. And now, with the game barely cracking 30 players at any given time since its May 2025 launch, Lunchbox Entertainment has decided to pull the plug on Sirocco servers.</p><p>"We are shutting down our servers indefinitely on August 20, 2025 at 3PM ET," the team wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2790090/view/502834059926306900?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Steam update post</a>. "After that time, the game will be unplayable. [...] We are sorry for the inconvenience and grateful for your support. If you have questions, reach out in Discord and we will do our best to help."</p><p>In the official Sirocco Discord server, developer Jack of Boxes gave a bit more details on August 18, writing that the team is proud of the game and hopes to bring it back.</p><p>"Hi everyone, getting emotional just writing this," Jack of Boxes wrote. "Today is the day we pull the plug on our servers. Despite our best efforts, we can’t keep Sirocco going. So, we’ll be shutting things down [on] Wednesday, the 20th. In other words, Sirocco will go offline in two days. All Patreon supporters who [subscribed] in the last 90 days have been refunded. As much as it sucks to shut off the servers, we're really proud of Sirocco and we are going to do everything we can to keep making games so one day we can bring back Sirocco in the future when we have more resources. [...] Thank you all for being a truly amazing community. You all have gone above and beyond to make our game and community the best it could be and, for that, I can’t thank you enough."</p>
