			<p>Sony has just <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1838254671456018525" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a new State of Play broadcast will air tomorrow on YouTube and Twitch at 3 PM Pacific Time / 6 PM Eastern Time | September 25 at 12 AM Central European Time / 7 AM Japan Time, available in English and Japanese languages. It's been nearly four months since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-featuring-14-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous one</a>, which featured the following fourteen titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Concord</li>
<li>God of War Ragnarok PC</li>
<li>Until Dawn</li>
<li>Skydance's Behemoth</li>
<li>Path of Exile 2</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>
<li>Silent Hill 2</li>
<li>Alien: Rogue Incursion</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
<li>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</li>
<li>Ballad of Antara</li>
<li>Infinity Nikki</li>
<li>Where Winds Meet</li>
</ul>
<p>This upcoming State of Play will feature even more games. Sony remained pretty vague but confirmed there will be 'over 20 PS5 and PS VR2 games)' developed by studios from all over the world.</p>
<p>Among those, we'll probably hear about Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered (already <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-by-esrb-for-ps5-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> by the ESRB) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> Days Gone remaster. Other than that, it's anyone's guess, but it would be best to keep expectations in check. Sony reserves its big first-party reveals for the PlayStation Showcase events, while State of Play broadcasts are dedicated to third-party studios and minor projects like remasters.</p>

The consumable item <strong>Goddess Scales</strong> allows you to reset a character’s Elemental Plot progression, but this does not show up in bulk until Chapter Seven. For context, Chapter Seven is the start of the game’s final act, so you’ll have already seen most of the main story content by this point. Additionally, this is only a one-use item, so you can’t use these willy-nilly to test new builds. You’ll want to plan exactly how you want to respec a character before you use one of these.</p><p>That said, <strong>I strongly recommend holding off on using Goddess Scales until you clear the main story in <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong>. If you want to know why, let’s get into the nitty gritty of how <em>Visions of Mana</em> progresses in its post-game.</p><h2 id="h14762"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find Goddess Scales in <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-recommend-id="image://1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-recommend-id="image://1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned above, Goddess Scales won’t appear in <em>Visions of Mana</em> until the late game. You’ll likely first encounter this item by <strong>opening treasure chests</strong>, which are thankfully marked right on your map screen. By the time you’ve obtained all eight elementals, you should be able to collect every treasure chest you see (save maybe chests hidden in ruins, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-how-to-beat-ruins-guide-1851646843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-how-to-beat-ruins-guide-1851646843">though even those should be feasible by this point</a></span>). By my count, I was able to obtain five Goddess Scales this way.</p><p>The other source of Goddess Scales comes from the <strong>Grizzly Exchange</strong>. You know, the shop run by the Dudbear that goes “Badu badudu bub.” Starting in Chapter Seven, you can purchase five Goddess Scales for 20 Grizzly Syrups each. Then, once you enter the post-game content after Chapter Nine, you can purchase an additional five Goddess Scales.</p><p>By the post-game, <strong>I had found fifteen Goddess Scales in total</strong>. That’s three respecs per character, or five respecs for your main team if you don’t use anyone else. As far as I can tell, there are no ways to grind for Goddess Scales outside of replaying the game all over via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405">New Game Plus</a></span>. While this should offer enough chances for you to customize your team exactly how you want, you still want to be careful before using these.</p><h2 id="h14763"><a id=""></a><strong>Why you should wait until the postgame until you use Goddess Scales</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ee22226dc4b1e359a1d6b03c445c9b2d" data-recommend-id="image://ee22226dc4b1e359a1d6b03c445c9b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ARGH!

It's a giant orange cricket with giant claw arms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout most of the main story of <em>Visions of Mana</em>, you’ll have access to the first two tiers of each character’s Elemental Plot. If you explore the world and gather Elementite as they become available, you should have plenty of Elemental Points to experiment with different classes and obtain most of the spells that each character can natively learn. Only in Chapter Seven will you start obtaining each character’s third tier of the Elemental Plot, and by this point you should feel generally decided on which classes each character can learn. Maybe your build isn’t as optimized as you like, but you should fare well if you only focus on maxing out the classes your party currently mains.</p><p>The big thing here is that Chapter Eight and Chapter Nine consist of the game’s final dungeon and final boss respectively. There isn’t a ton of game left once you start finding Goddess Scales.</p><p>After you beat the final boss, you’ll unlock the post-game of <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Visit the Dudbear’s Grizzly Exchange again, and not only can you purchase additional Goddess Scales, you can buy the Tonics to unlock each character’s final tier of their Elemental Plots for a total of 100 Grizzly Syrups. Max out the class of any character’s Elemental Plot, and, surprise, it turns out <strong>your base class can equip any of the skills of any class you’ve maxed out</strong>.</p><p><strong>That’s right, you functionally have cross-classing now, and you’ll <em>need</em> to respec every character to get the most out of this system</strong>. Instead of grabbing helpful skills from any line of the Elemental Plot, you’ll want to reinvest all your points into two or three classes to make builds that can take on the post-game superbosses.</p><p>If you already respecced everyone in Chapter Seven, you should still have two more chances to respec your party in your pocket. But this leaves you short on chances to adjust your builds, especially if you want to rethink your party after finding out a superboss resists every element in the game.</p><p>To be fair, <em>Visions of Mana</em> doesn’t sport a terribly robust post-game. If you want to use a Goddess Scale before this point, it’s not the end of the world. But when faced with the hardest content in the entire game, you’ll feel happy to have that extra security in case you need to rethink your team. Make an extra save file after the postgame to be safe!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In parts 1 and 2 of this interview, the company reveals a number of tidbits about Echoes of Wisdom, including Grezzo as the elusive co-development studio behind the project and Tomomi Sano as the game's director, and first-ever female director on The Legend of Zelda series.</p><p>You can read the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/?utm_source=SW-AAA&amp;utm_medium=sotwnoa&amp;utm_campaign=N1141-01&amp;utm_id=N1141-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full interviews yourself</a>, but here are some highlights. First off, Sano has a rich history in the industry, earning her first credit in 1998 for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3">editing stage textures on Tekken 3</a>. She began working with Nintendo in 2004 as a coordinator on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-party-6">Mario Party 6</a>, and over time was involved in a number of Nintendo-published and supported projects. Her first Zelda credit was in 2011 on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> as a coordinator, and she followed it up with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-3d-review">same role on Majora's Mask 3D</a> a few years later. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/23/sano-zelda-1727113341689.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tomomi Sano is Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's director. Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p>In 2016, Sano served as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd">assistant director on Twilight Princess HD</a>, and was also assistant director on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-and-luigi-superstar-saga-bowsers-minions">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-and-luigi-bowsers-inside-story-bowser-jrs-journey">Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey</a>. Most recently, she was a project coordinator on the Switch version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">Link's Awakening in 2019</a>. According to the interviews, Aonuma apparently "almost always" asks Sano to be involved with Legend of Zelda projects at Grezzo.</p><h2>The origins of Echoes of Wisdom</h2><p>Grezzo and Nintendo co-developed Echoes of Wisdom, but in the interview, series producer Eiji Aonuma says that Grezzo had an even greater role than usual on the game. Apparently, Nintendo wanted Grezzo's take on Link's Awakening to serve as a blueprint for top-down Zelda games this generation, but  didn't just want to only do remakes. So the team asked Grezzo to pitch ideas internally for a new Legend of Zelda game, marking the first time the studio was challenged to participate in a Zelda project from the conceptual state. According to Aonuma, everyone in the studio participated across disciplines, pitching ideas to Aonuma, and it took Nintendo three days to review all the proposals.</p><p>Ultimately, the idea that won wasn't exactly what Echoes is now, though it was kind of close. The winner was a "copy-and-paste" gameplay style combining the "top-down and side-view" gameplay styles seen in Link's Awakening.</p><p>"These were the two basic elements, and from there, I asked them to think of ways to add some freedom," Aonuma says. "Having worked on games in the Legend of Zelda series over the years, we started to feel that fans may not continue playing this franchise unless they can think independently and try various things freely on their own, rather than following a set path. Even when it comes to solving puzzles – in a game in the Legend of Zelda series, having the excitement of solving puzzles in your own unique way makes the game 'Legend of Zelda-like.' Hence, we need to increase the degree of freedom to achieve that. With this in mind, I asked Grezzo to use those two elements as a foundation for the gameplay and add freedom on top of it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What Grezzo came up with was more of a "dungeon editor" game than what Echoes of Wisdom ended up being, where Link could copy and paste objects to create original dungeons. They prototyped this version for about a year, but Aonuma "upended the tea table" so to speak in changing the premise to focus more on copy-and-paste as a gameplay and puzzle-solving tool.</p><p>The rest of the interview discusses some of the different ways in which Nintendo and Grezzo had to navigate the challenges of giving a player access to copy-and-pasting over 100 objects in the game anywhere, anytime. That includes challenges with how every object can interact with both top-down and side-view gameplay, and struggles in ensuring gameplay didn't feel too slow while the player waits for enemies and echoes to take actions against one another.</p><p>One particular sticking point, per Aonuma, was placing restrictions on what the player can do with Echoes early on, or in dungeons. Earlier in development, Aonuma says the team tried to put restrictions on Echo use out of fear players would break the game. But over time, they discovered this wasn't necessary, and gradually lifted these restrictions until the final version of the game had almost none from the start.</p><p>All this led to further enabling players to "be mischievous," which was a key phrase used during development.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We wanted to do some things that were really out there.</p></div><p>"We came up with this key phrase because we wanted to do some things that were really out there," Aonuma says. "For example, if you roll something like a spike roller along the ground, that's a lot of work, because it can hit all kinds of things, but if we didn't allow for this possibility, it wouldn't be fun. (Laughs) The development team called these kinds of ideas 'being mischievous.'"</p><p>Sano adds that the team created a document explaining what "being mischievous" meant "so that everyone could return to this concept if they weren't sure how to proceed."</p><p>"There were three rules," continues Grezzo director Satoshi Terada. "Be able to paste things however, wherever, and whenever you like. Make it possible to complete puzzles using things that aren't there."</p><p>Sano shares the third. "Being able to find uses for echoes that are so ingenious it almost feels like cheating should be part of what makes this game fun."</p><p>Aonuma concludes by referencing the Myahm Agana shrine from Breath of the Wild, an infamous motion-sensor puzzle where players had to use the Switch controller to move a platform and tilt a ball through a maze to a finish line. However, the puzzle also allowed players to flip the entire platform upside down and roll the ball across a smooth surface to the goal.</p><p>"If this kind of solution isn't allowed, then it's not fun," says Aonuma.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ara-history-untold-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ara: History Untold is the latest in a procession of turn-based 4X games trying to settle on the once-sovereign territory of Sid Meier's Civilization, and it's one of the more competent challengers to do so. The liveliness and detail of its animated towns and cities never fail to delight me – as a historical ant farm, at least. But it expects more of us as a world leader than Civ ever has, and doesn't really provide us with the tools to make it truly feel good to be the king.</p><p>On a basic level, Ara doesn't have a vastly different view of history from its 4X forebears. Starting from roughly Neolithic times, you race down a tech tree split up into three acts of four ages each along a familiar and narrow path based mostly on Europe and its colonial offshoots. One little twist I did appreciate is that the final, futuristic era has a lot more to do with general AI, transhumanism, and cybernetics than going to space, which I think is a necessary and likely step on the path ahead of us that often gets skipped over in favor of interstellar travel.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Much like Civ, Ara lets you select from an array of historical leaders who appear in a simple but expressive 3D style. Alongside familiar faces like Caesar and Shaka Zulu, we also get some less conventional "rulers" like Copernicus for Poland and Sappho for Greece, which is a nice touch. </p><p>Their bonuses are all underwhelmingly passive, though. None of them can really do anything the others can't. And there are no culturally unique units – at least, not from your leader choice. You can unlock a couple wildcards, like Berserkers from building a brewery, but they're available to anyone who meets the right conditions. There's also a system of opposing personality traits that maybe could have been interesting, because it does affect how other leaders will initially view you diplomatically, but I didn't find it to be that impactful. Also, some of them provide a negative modifier with no upside, which seems very strange from a balance perspective, since the leaders who have them don't seem to get anything to make up for this.</p><h2><strong>Wonderful World</strong></h2><p>Ara's procedurally-generated worlds are positively enthralling to look at. Everything from trees to houses are rendered at a much smaller scale than in other, similar games, which makes the world feel larger and more authentic. Every town square, windmill, and even herd of wild animals is fully animated, bringing liveliness to every corner of the map. I honestly enjoy the simple act of panning around, watching my people go about their lives.</p><p>It's not all great, though. Road-building, which is fully automated, tends to make these nonsensical tangles with too many sharp angles to look organic. You could argue this is to simulate real-world traffic engineering debacles, but it doesn't look nice compared to everything else.</p><p>Performance can also get a little bit iffy in the late game, at least on the largest map size. The more of the fog I lifted, the more frames I lost, even on a 4070 Super GPU. We never quite reached slideshow territory, but I did end up having to turn some settings down in the last 100 turns or so.</p><p>I was also a little disappointed that there isn't much difference in architecture other than which era you're in. At least judging by the civs I played, it seems like a farm or a residential neighborhood for any given time period looks about the same no matter who built it. And this just further reinforces the feeling that your leader choice is little more than a set of numerical bonuses.</p><h2><strong>The Economy, Fools</strong></h2><p>Where Ara almost literally grinds to a halt is also its most interesting gameplay innovation. While food, gold, science, and production – the usual gang – are all here, Ara features a very in-depth, goods-based manufacturing economy. You can harvest grain, which can then be made into bread at a bakery, which can then be used as an ingredient in gourmet meals at an inn. This continues all the way up to things like refrigerators and game consoles in the later eras.</p><p>You can either spend these goods as a one-time cost to slot them into a specific building's inventory, like adding plows to a farm to increase its productivity, or consume them as amenities in your city-center for a temporary benefit. In theory, I like this a lot. In bigger settlements, simply producing the generic "food" resource will eventually become insufficient to feed the masses. But if you refine your crops into grain stores and preserves, and produce enough to keep those amenity slots full on an ongoing basis, you can grow much larger. Most manufactured goods also have multiple options for what you can make them with, including just spending gold if you don't have access to the base resources. I really liked the decision-making and economic planning involved here at smaller scales.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>ARA: History Untold - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The problem is that this becomes a nightmare to manage with even two or three fair-sized cities. There's no notification I could find or enable for when a city has a free amenity slot, for example. Nor when I could potentially fill an empty supplies slot on a production building, or swap out those supplies with a better option I had recently unlocked through technology. It also won't warn you when you have idle experts – Ara's version of specialists from Civ, who appear as your population increases and can be slotted to supercharge specific buildings.</p><p>There's not even a really convenient way to keep track of your economy. There is a tooltip that will show you a basic balance sheet of everything you're producing and consuming, but it's too small, there's no way to sort the rows by anything but alphabetical order, and it eventually fills up with so many types of goods that it becomes overwhelming. Or you can look at a grid view, which is a bit easier to navigate, but doesn't include the spreadsheet and still can't be sorted.</p><p>To really optimize my economy, I had to open dozens of individual building menus every time I unlocked a new tech or gained access to a new type of tools. And since this is essentially the core mechanic in Ara, everything else starts to collapse around it. The late game really gets to be a tedious slog, unless you pull far enough ahead that you can simply stop caring about most of the mechanics, which is what eventually happened to me on the default difficulty.</p><h2><strong>To The Strongest</strong></h2><p>Combat is fine. It's very automatic, with some rock-paper-scissors unit choices and unlockable formations that can give you modest bonuses based on the types of troops you have access to, adding a little bit of tactical decision-making. Engagements play out in full 3D, which is neat to watch the first few times as potentially hundreds of troops clash, but these animations lost their appeal for me fairly quickly since they're not especially dynamic.</p><p>Ara also includes a knockout mechanic, which is something I'm generally not a fan of. After a certain number of players have reached Age 5 and Age 9, the ones with the least accumulated Prestige – your overall score based on everything from military victories to total population – are removed from the map, with their cities becoming explorable ruins.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Len's Top 10 4X Games</h3><p>The best games to explore, expand, exploit, and extol in 2024.</p></div><p>It's possible to turn this off for human players, which is nice. But I didn't really get the sense that streamlining the later eras to just a handful of great powers was worth losing the diplomatic complexity of a larger cast. In a 12-player game, eight will move on to Act 2 and five will remain competing for the top spot in Act 3. It's also just weird the second time it happens, with bustling Enlightenment-era cities vanishing overnight.</p><p>Diplomacy is as basic as it could possibly be in this type of game, with the ability to send gifts, declare wars, open borders, and broker alliances and research agreements. Trade can be useful in the early game when you don't have access to a resource you really need for a higher-tier building, but you need to heavily commit to it to have enough merchant capacity later on to even make a dent in your goods deficit.</p><p>Government, religion, and advisers are also pretty unmemorable. Like leader choice, it's just stacking more numerical modifiers. They don't typically unlock new playstyles or new ways to solve problems. They just make you marginally better at doing things you could already do anyway.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Shirley Curry, the 88-year-old YouTuber better known as the Skyrim Grandma, has announced her retirement, saying she's "bored to death" of making gaming videos.
</p>
<p>
Curry uploaded her first Skyrim gameplay video to YouTube in 2015, and had amassed over 1m subscribers by 2021. Despite suffering a stroke that same year, Curry soon returned to her gaming chair and has continued to post videos of her adventures in Tamriel since then.
</p>
<p>
But now, Curry's Skyrim journey has finally reached its end. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGH8o3LDBo">vlog</a> titled 'No More Gaming Videos' shared over the weekend, Curry told fans, "It seems I spend most of my time sitting in here at this computer, and lately - probably for the last month - I walk in here and look at my computer, and think 'I've got to make a video today'. And then I just shake my head at myself and say, 'I don't want to, I have no desire to, and I turn around and walk back out.'"

<p>
"I'm just doing it for fun, and it isn't fun anymore. I'm tired of it, and I'm bored to death with it. So I'm making the decision now, totally, finally, I am not going to be making any more game videos."
</p>
<p>
Curry doesn't, however, plan on disappearing from YouTube entirely. Despite admitting to fans, "I'm old and I'm tired, and I don't feel like doing much anymore", she says she'll still make vlogs "every so often". These will include updates on her life, the books she's reading, maybe even some of her own writing. And away from the camera, Curry is "going to start making a quilt I've been wanting to make for a very long time".
</p>
<p>
And as Curry points out - before signing off with, "I'll see you in a blog later on, I promise" - those missing her regular gaming escapades have nearly a decade of earlier videos to enjoy. And if that's still not enough Skyrim Grandma, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-skyrim-grandma-is-now-a-skyrim-follower-thanks-to-a-mod">2021's fan-made Shirley Follower Mod</a>, which adds Curry to Skyrim as a two-handed barbarian companion, complete with a fully fleshed-out, lore-friendly backstory.
</p>
<p>
That particular mode emerged following a fan petition to "immortalise" Curry in The Elder Scrolls 6, after she lamented the game was likely so far away she "probably won't get to play it". Three years later, The Elder Scrolls 6 is still nowhere in sight, but here's to Curry's well-earned retirement from gaming, and best wishes on that quilt.

		<p>Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/20/kingdom-two-crowns-call-of-olympus-dlc-revealed/"> originally revealed back in May</a>, and now it has a release date. Players who want to venture through a new version of Olympus can do so when the Call of Olympus DLC releases on October 8th. In the Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus DLC, the Greed has started to take over the home of the Gods, who require your aid.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus | Date Reveal Trailer | Wishlist Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fsx2lMf-A98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Journeying to the top of Mount Olympus will not be a simple feat, as to gain access you need to gain the favour of some of the gods, including Athena, Hermes, Artemis, and Hephaestus. In addition to that, players will travel to Temple and Quest islands, which hold artifacts to use against Greed, treasures, and challenges to complete. In total, there are four artifacts to be found that represent one of the gods. There are also new mounts to find and unlock within the DLC, with those being the Chimera, the underworld’s guardian Cerberus, Pegasus, and Donkey. The Greed is also stronger this time round with boss battles having multiple stages to complete to beat them, but you do get allies of your own. You can build a fleet of ships to join you, use siege weapons, and have Hoplites fight with you.</p>

<p>In our Kingdom Two Crowns review, Thomas said,&nbsp;<em>“Kingdom Two Crowns feels more like an extensive update than a new entry to the series, but the base game is still so immensely enjoyable that it doesn’t really matter. This is the perfect starting point for new players, and those who are returning might still be surprised by some of the secrets to be found.”</em></p>

<p>Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, iOS, and Android. It will be £8.49 on consoles, and £3.49 for mobile devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-dev-wanted-to-make-two-games-at-once-but-one-is-winning-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-larian-studios-2-new-original-projects-best-work-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a while ago that it is working on two major new projects following its decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-4-playable-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandon the plan to make a Baldur's Gate 3 seque</a>l. What we didn't know for certain is that Larian is planning to make them at the same time, not one after the other, but as Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-studio-wanted-to-make-2-rpgs-at-once-but-its-devs-got-swallowed-by-the-ambitions-of-the-one-we-want-to-release-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Gamesradar</a>, one of the projects is winning out.</p>
<p><em>We had some people who were dedicated to the other one, and they just got swallowed by the ambitions of the one that we want to release first. So we will try and do it concurrently, but we have to figure out how to leave people alone.</em></p>
<p>Vincke then tackled another major issue for the studio. While the Larian CEO originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-breaks-814k-steam-ccu-but-larian-wants-the-next-game-to-be-smaller-and-to-stay-independent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoped</a> to make a smaller game after the gargantuan Baldur's Gate 3, he is now coming to terms with the fact that the next games are going to be really large, too.</p>
<p><em>We always say we do want to rein in our ambitions, but then we start thinking, and the machine is meant to make large games. We were made for making large, ambitious RPGs and to try new stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the core problems - it's not really a problem - but one of the core problems to do what you're suggesting is that we actually know what we want from our gameplay systems, how to evolve them, how to do new things…and they're all big.</em></p>
<p>It's not surprising, given the growth of the studio. Just four months ago, Larian <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the opening of a new office in Warsaw, Poland. This is the seventh office, following the headquarters in Ghent and the offices in Quebec City, Dublin, Kuala Lumpur, Guildford, and Barcelona. The total headcount is around 500, making Larian effectively a triple-A developer at this point.</p>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Invictus, a multiplayer-focused title in Ubisoft's long running franchise, is reportedly inspired by the round-based gameplay of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fall-guys/" data-ref-id="5000-497671">Fall Guys</a> and will support up to 16 players, according to a leaker.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft announced Assassin's Creed Invictus back in 2022 alongside a host of other Assassin's Creed projects, but no official details other than its multiplayer nature or a release date have been officially revealed since.

		<p>Sony has announced that a State of Play will be taking place tomorrow, September 24th at 3PM PDT/6pm EDT/ 11pm BST. The show will last 30 minutes with news and updates for around 20 games to be showcased.</p>
<p>The games include both PS5 and PSVR 2 titles, and there is likely to be more news about games that will take advantage of the PS5 Pro’s specs. The State of Play will stream across YouTube and Twitch.</p>


<p>There are not that many rumours around to say what will be shown, though one that has been persistent the last week is a Days Gone remaster, which may or may not generate a similar reaction the news of the Horizon Zero Dawn remaster. If there is a remaster announcement then many would be waiting for games like Bloodborne, which would be a very popular option for fans.</p>
<p>Sony’s State of Play comes a few days before Tokyo Game Show gets into full swing, so there could be some early surprises from Japanese studios. Microsoft also have a Tokyo Game Show showcase taking place this week, with that happening on September 26th, and that will have a focus on games from Japanese studios.</p>

		<p>Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings game has been given a new release date, following on from i<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/14/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed-to-2025/">ts delay from a couple of weeks back</a>. That new release date is March 25th, 2025, and from then on you will be able to live the cost life of a Hobbit. To mark the news, a brand new behind the scenes look at the development of Tales of the Shire has been released focusing on features and inspirations.</p>

<p>Tales of the Shire allows players to create their own Hobbit, who lives in Bywater and can establish their own life. As time passes in Bywater, other Hobbits will come to ask your Hobbit for help on matters. Additionally, you can do all the cosy things a Hobbit’s life should consist of, including growing your own vegetables, going fishing, trading items with neighbours, and cooking up meals. You can wander around Bywater visiting other Hobbits and going to the shop, or venture a bit further out to forage in the fields for supplies.</p>
<p><em>“Wētā Workshop has been trusted with J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth universe for more than 25 years, and over that time we have built up a deep understanding of the lore and a real love of Middle-earth that flows through our creative work across screen, collectibles and now, our cosy sims games,”</em> said Richard Taylor, Co-founder and CEO at Wētā Workshop. <em>“Tales of the&nbsp;<span>Shire</span>&nbsp;allows us to inspire our talents in an entirely new medium and, ultimately, create this game for people just like us – fans of The Lord of the Rings. This is a beautiful way that players who are looking for a quieter, more peaceful time can discover this in a less explored corner of this universe.”</em></p>

<p>Tales of the Shire will be released for PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and it will also be available on Netflix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-warhammer-40000-superfan-henry-cavill-is-playing-space-marine-2-no-he-wont-reveal-his-username<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Henry Cavill, the world’s most famous Warhammer 40,000 fan, is like so many others enjoying the recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a>.</p><p>In an Instagram post, the Superman and Witcher star praised the developers at Saber Interactive for the action game set in Games Workshop’s grimdark universe, although revealed he failed to complete the campaign solo on the Angel of Death difficulty, which is the hardest of the four difficulties available.</p><p>As we can see from the photo, Cavill is currently big into Space Marine 2’s PvP mode, dubbed Eternal War. We can see him matchmaking on the PC version of the game, although the actor was smart enough to paste over his username with the word “nope.” Yes, that means you could be playing with or against Henry Cavill in Space Marine 2 PvP and you’d never know it.</p><p>Space Marine 2’s PvP, Cavill said, “has real potential to be absolutely awesome,” but he admits he knows nothing about video game development.</p><p>“Disclaimer: I know nothing about game development so the kind of dreams I have may be rather difficult to implement!” he said.</p><p>Also of note, Cavill is playing as an Ultramarine Tactical class, and he’s got a copy of The Horus Heresy Book Two on his table. The book contains rules and special characters for the pre-Heresy Iron Hands, Salamanders, Night Lords, and Word Bearers Legions, which I'm sure will set tongues wagging among the Warhammer 40,000 community.</p><p>It might make sense for Cavill to be submerged in the Warhammer 40,000 universe right now. Games Workshop recently reiterated that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-have-until-dec-2024-to-agree-creative-guidelines-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-film-and-tv-series-or-they-wont-happen">Amazon’s hotly anticipated Warhammer 40,000 film and TV series</a>, to which Cavill is attached, will not happen unless both companies can agree “creative guidelines” by December 2024.</p><p>In December 2023, Games Workshop said it would work with Amazon for a period of 12 months ending in December 2024 “to agree creative guidelines for the films and television series to be developed by Amazon.” And that agreement “will only proceed if the creative guidelines are mutually agreed between Games Workshop and Amazon.”</p><p>“We will update you accordingly,” Games Workshop said, like a Space Marine might tell a Guardsman anxious about a coming battle. That means Games Workshop and Amazon have just a few months to sort themselves out, or the Warhammer 40,000 movie and TV series fans so desperately want might never happen.</p><p>If the Warhammer 40,000 Amazon projects move forward, Cavill will be involved. The Hollywood actor is set to star in and executive produce the Warhammer 40,000 franchise across all Amazon Studios productions.</p><p>While concrete details on shows and films are likely a way off, Cavill nonetheless sounded excited to be bringing Warhammer 40,000 to life. “I have loved Warhammer since I was a boy, making this moment truly special for me. The opportunity to shepherd this cinematic universe from its inception is quite the honor and the responsibility,” said Cavill. “I couldn’t be more grateful for all the hard work put in by Vertigo, Amazon and Games Workshop to make this happen. One step closer to making a nigh-on lifelong dream come true.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-says-warhammer-40000-amazon-project-the-greatest-privilege-of-my-professional-career"><u>Cavill touched again on the Warhammer 40,000 Amazon project</u></a>, saying: "It is the greatest privilege of my professional career to have this opportunity. I can’t say too much, again, it’s early days still. But to have this opportunity to bring it to screen, and be at the tiller so it can be faithful, is key to me.</p><p>“This is the stuff I’ve been dealing with since I was a kid. This is the stuff I spend my free time daydreaming about, as an adult as well, and I get to bring it into life. There is no greater reason than I joined the industry than doing something like this.”</p><p>Warhammer 40,000 is Games Workshop’s science fiction universe used as the setting for its hugely popular tabletop wargame starring the iconic Space Marines. It’s a grimdark universe in which humanity clings on to survival in the face of terrifying threats within and without the fascist Imperium.</p><p>Who might Cavill play across the Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe? Talking to IGN in 2021, Cavill expressed interest in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-warhammer-tv-show"><u>playing one of the Primarchs or Captain-Generals</u></a>, who are high-ranking key characters from the Warhammer lore.</p><p>As for Space Marine 2, be sure to check out IGN's interview with Saber development chief Tim Willits to find out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">what the game's success means for DLC and a potential Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>The next generation of Xbox consoles reportedly could include both a console and a handheld.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/were-building-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary-of-halo-and-xbox-microsoft-confirms-in-a-new-interview-we-have-such-a-rich-heritage-you-have-to-celebrate-that" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is taking another two-pronged approach to the Xbox hardware market like it did with the Series X and S. The plan is reportedly to have a traditional-style successor to the Series X, as well as a handheld gaming option similar to that of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">Steam Deck</a>.</p><p>It's currently unclear what this approach would end up looking like, but if the handheld anything like the Steam Deck, players will likely be able to play their digital purchases and bounce between the handheld and console. There likely won't be a separate ecosystem like the 3DS and Wii U or Vita and PS3. There's also the possibility that it could look more like a Switch and have both the console and handheld components work together.</p><p>Separately from this report, Microsoft <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/video-games/xbox-gaming-evolved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also confirmed</a> that it has plans to celebrate both Xbox and Halo's 25th anniversaries, which are landing in 2026. This current generation has been a strange one. Developers are still making games for last generation's consoles, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-analysts-weigh-in-on-price-gta-6-effect-and-more/1100-6526411/" data-ref-id="1100-6526411">backlash against the PS5 Pro's price</a> puts the traditional console generation cycle into an awkward spot.</p><p>Last year, documents regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-digital-only-mid-gen-refresh-has-been-leaked-in-court-documents/1100-6517813/" data-ref-id="1100-6517813">Xbox's mid-gen refresh plans were leaked</a>, aiming for a supposed October 2024 release.

  </p>

    

</div><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has submitted a mystery new "wireless device" to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval that does not appear to be the hotly-expected <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Specific details of the device remain under-wraps, as Nintendo's <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=m9V0HXBXo8nolsDsEYU3Nw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKECLO001">application</a> comes with a confidentiality request set to be held for another 180 days - until late March 2025.
</p>
<p>
Still, we know a couple of things. First, its shape - a roughly-square object with curved corners when viewed from underneath. Second, that it has wireless capabilities - including an intriguing 24GHz mmWave sensor. It's also powered by a USB-C connection. 
</p>
<p>
Could this be a Switch 2 peripheral? After all, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">leaked and likely-real (if dated) Switch 2 prototype</a> model features USB-C ports top and bottom. Perhaps, but what's odd here is the device's product code (CLO-001) denotes an item treated by Nintendo as its own separate 'thing'. 
</p>
<p>
This is not Switch 2 (leaks have already pinned down its likely product code line) and is unlikely to be a peripheral for it (this would have a higher product number than 001). The product code also does not relate to any Nintendo device line released to date.
</p>
<p>
Back to that 24Ghz mmWave sensor. These items can detect human presence or movement in a room and are often paired with smart home features to activate lights or monitor the general activity of people or pets. It's intriguing to imagine the usage case for this in a video game. Could it detect gestures? Is this some kind of party game add-on? 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's application for confidentiality simply states that details of the device "contain technical information which we deem to be trade secrets and proprietary. If made public, the information might be used to the disadvantage of the applicant in the market place".

That, in and of itself, is more than enough to get somebody invested in the action, at least for a match or two. From there, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>sinks its hooks into players very easily.</p><p>The worlds on which your battles take place have so much going on, you may be in awe from the second those boots touch ground. Visually, every planet—even the dead ones—is a marvel, and most of them actually feel distinct, whether due to changes in the biome or larger planetwide effects like fire storms or blizzards.

You are, at the end of the day, a human facing off against aliens that simply outclass you. The bug-like Terminids come in all manner of shapes, sizes, and forms that have their own capabilities.

Sure, you can call down weapons to defeat them, but in one-on-one scuffles, these things are superior to you in every way, and that’s just one enemy faction.</p><p>Due to this obvious and intentional imbalance, overcoming the odds feels clutch, and victory almost always emerges from smart interplay with your team and a smattering of good luck. I remember running from a hulking Bile Titan and facing my camera back at it while I booked it. I had nothing in the way of resources that could take it out, so I assumed I would just try to dodge its projectiles and legs for as long as I possibly could. The action felt like the big setpiece sequence of an alien invasion film, but the real movie moment came when I rounded a corner, found an ally with exactly the weapon needed to take out my pursuer, and watched them bring it down as I dove past them to safety.

Resources can be found around its huge maps and put toward passive upgrades back on your ship, which forces you to explore and discover how deep these environments actually are. They are dotted with patrols, enemy camps, optional objectives, and installments, and taking on all of it can yield even deeper rewards, as well as a stronger sense of mastery over <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Soon enough, you’ll be undertaking major orders, defending planets or trying to capture other ones, and maximizing your loadouts and deployable stratagems like rocket barrages or heavy machine gun turrets to meet the increasing challenges of the missions you undertake.<br></p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, too. Falling for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>also means inevitably becoming a conspiracy theorist who constantly argues about the appearance of a third enemy faction, and the motivations of “Joel,” the developer at Arrowhead Game Studios largely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376">responsible for the tug-of-war meta narrative</a></span> that encapsulates the game. Like I said, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>fans are different, but they can occasionally be good fun, and if all of that sounds like a good time to you, picking this game up seems like an obvious move while it’s on sale.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’re into streaming and game capture, you’ve probably heard of Elgato. They’ve dominated the game capture space for over a decade due to their overall quality and understanding of what streamers and content creators need with their products. This time around, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elgato-neo-the-new-family-of-elgato-products-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato has taken a different approach with its Elgato Neo line</a>, offering a series of new products in a new Plug-and-play format at a competitive price. For this review, we’ll be deep-diving into the Elgato Game Capture Neo, its latest game capture device that is great for anyone wanting to get into streaming and content creation.</p>



<h2 id="h-cut-to-the-chase">Cut to the Chase</h2>



<p><strong>Price –</strong> $119.99 / £119.99<br><strong>Max Passthrough Resolution</strong> – 4K60HDR<br><strong>Max Capture Resolution</strong> – 1080p60<br><strong>How does it work? –</strong> It connects your console (PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, etc.) to your PC, laptop, or iPad to stream or record.<br><strong>What apps are compatible?</strong> – It’s compatible with almost every app, including Discord, OBS, etc. and can be used to stream to Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Tiktok.<br><strong>Is there a subscription service needed?</strong> – No, it’s a one-time purchase price, and that’s it.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-affordable-option">An Affordable Option</h2>



<p>I’ve been in the gaming content creator scene for about 15 years now, and the truth is, it can be costly. However, the Elgato Game Capture Neo, priced at $119, is a fantastic price point that suddenly makes streaming and recording gameplay affordable for the masses. The Elgato Game Capture Neo offers a 4K60 max passthrough resolution and a 1080p60 max capture resolution, a perfectly acceptable content output resolution for any novice content creator. For comparison, the Elgato HD60 X will also offer these same resolutions, but with frame rate support up to 240FPS priced at $159.99, but unless you have a monitor that supports such a high FPS, you’re getting the same bang for your buck with the Neo but 25% cheaper.</p>



<h2 id="h-plug-in-and-play">Plug in and Play</h2>



<p>All the Elgato Neo family devices have a ” plug-in and play” design that makes whichever Neo device you use simple and easy to understand. While you will still need to download the Elgato Capture Software or OBS to start your recording or steaming journey, the Elgato Game Capture Neo can be set up from unboxing to recording in minutes.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note – You must have two HDMI cables handy as they do not come with the device. </strong></em></p>



<ol>
<li>Connect HDMI IN to your console and HDMI OUT to your TV or monitor.</li>



<li>Connect Game Capture Neo directly to a USB 3.0 (or better) port on your PC or Mac. (To connect to your iPad, use a good third-party adapter or USB-C to USB-C cable. Do not use a USB hub.)</li>



<li>Download your favorite recording or broadcasting app.</li>



<li>Select Game Capture Neo in your favorite recording or broadcasting app.</li>



<li>Share or share your gameplay on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Tiktok, etc.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong><em>Note—If you’re getting “No Signal,” you need to disable HDCP on your console. This is located under Settings in your console’s dashboard.</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall, the Elgato Game Capture Neo is a great capture device for anyone who wants to try out streaming or content creation. While it doesn’t record to the highest resolutions and framerates, it’s important to note that this product is for those who want to dip their toes into recording and streaming gaming content without spending hundreds of dollars on just one product.</p>



<p>Its elegant and simplistic design, lightweight and small size make it an ideal capture device to add to any setup and is the perfect choice for gamers on the move. Overall, it’s another high-quality product from Elgato and a great addition to its existing product line. </p>



<p>The entire Neo family of products, which consists of the Elgato Game Capture Neo, Stream Deck Neo, Facecam Neo, Wave Neo, and Key Light Neo can all be yours now for £399 on the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/neo-creator-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato website</a>.</p>

<p>When The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom began development, it started out as a dungeon creator game. That’s according to the game’s developers at Grezzo.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A from Nintendo</a>, Grezzo game director Satoshi Terada said that the studio looked at “a few different ways to play the game”.</p>



<p>“In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons,”  Terada said. “During this exploration phase, this idea was called an “edit dungeon” because players could create their own Legend of Zelda gameplay.” </p>



<p>Producer Eiji Aonuma then chimed in saying that after playing it, he wanted to take the game in different direction.</p>



<p>“As I played, I started thinking that while it’s fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it, it’s also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies,” he said. </p>



<p>“That was the beginning of gameplay using “echoes.” The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure.”</p>



<p>The changes were made, according to Tomomi Sano, the first female director in the history of the Zelda franchise, about a year into the game’s development.</p>



<p>”&nbsp;…It’d been that long,” said Terada before Sano chimed in confirming.</p>



<p>“Everyone else was developing the game with dungeon creation in mind, but I was right next to them thinking of something different. (Laughs) But there’s a reason it took a year to upend the tea table,” Aonuma then added.</p>



<p>“After all, you can’t really see the potential for ideas to develop into solid gameplay until you can verify features and their feel, so I wanted them to try making it first. I felt that the “edit dungeon” feature they showed me had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the Legend of Zelda games if the gameplay was changed to use “echoes” instead. So, I thought it would be good to expand in that direction and could be even more interesting that way. However, there was one concern. Even though game consoles have larger memory capacity nowadays, the more things players can copy and paste, the more game memory is used up. I was really worried that it would crash the game.”</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, the first Zelda game to feature Zelda as a main playable character, releases exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26.</p>
