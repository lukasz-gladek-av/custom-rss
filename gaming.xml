            <p>
Ubisoft has announced delays for Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence, its two upcoming free-to-play mobile shooters, as part of its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3J1aM8p3bRqk3oSBRQPkFY/e2642b7dafe168b5c4ebb4acc9006f5f/Ubisoft_FY25_Q1_Sales_EN_vFinal.pdf">first-quarter earnings report</a>, which is says marks a "solid start" to the current financial year.
</p>
<p>
Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence - a 5v5 competitive FPS and third-person, open-world "shooter RPG", respectively - were both originally due to launch some time before the end of its current financial year on 31st March 2025. However, the publisher has now delayed both games out of that window to give their development teas the "necessary time to ensure that these experiences deliver on expectations with optimised KPIs in the context of a demanding yet very large market."
</p>
<p>
Both titles - which Ubisoft is referring to as "triple-A" mobile games - were announced back in 2022, and have hosted closed beta since then.
</p>

<p>
Beyond those delays, Ubisoft's latest earnings report sees the publisher in a buoyant mood, describing its Q1 results as a "solid start" to its current financial year, with net bookings "above target". CEO Yves Guillemot called the results proof the company was "on the right track" after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">disappointing results</a> for its 2022-23 year which saw the company cancel a raft of projects and adopt a strategy "increased cautiousness over the coming years".
</p>
<p>
Some of its Q1 success can be attributed to the launch of its free-to-play shooter XDefiant back in May, which Ubisoft says got off to an "encouraging" start, managing to attract 10m players in its first two weeks of release. Rainbow Six Siege is also said to have seen "very strong year-on-year growth" as far as player activity and monetisation goes, while the The Crew Motorfest has seen "solid engagement".

<p>
As for Assassin's Creed, it continues to be a big winner for Ubisoft; the series is said to have "overperformed" this quarter, with sales getting a boost from Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-gives-us-our-first-look-at-the-new-current-gen-engine">Assassin's Creed Shadows announcement</a>. The company is even reporting its critically panned pirate adventure Skull and Bones continues to "perform well" in terms of engagement and annual revenue per user. All that has led to net bookings of €290m, ahead of its €275m target. 
</p>
<p>
As for what's next, Ubisoft says it's "too early" to talk about its next financial year, but we do at least known Anno 117: Pax Romana, the next entry in its long-running strategy series, is due in 2025. Up first, though, are Star Wars Outlaws and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, launching on 30th August and 15th November respectively.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/european-game-sales-decline-by-1-9-in-first-half-of-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Compared to other places across the world, European game sales suffered the least. <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The UK experienced a decline of 30%</a> in the first half of 2024, whereas European game sales only experienced a decrease of 1.9% in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-game-sales-down-just-16-during-the-first-half-of-2024-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Games Sales Data</a> report, 80 million games were sold across Europe in the first half of 2024 on PC and console. Compared to other parts of the world, this is a solid start to the year for Europe, as there weren't many hard-hitting games released in the first half of the year compared to 2023. For example, the first half of 2023 saw games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, and Diablo IV be released and be hugely successful right out of the gate.</p>
<p>Only two of the top ten best-selling games of 2024 were released this year: Helldivers 2 and The Last of Us: Part 2 Remastered. Compared to other big releases, these games had a lower selling price than other AAA games released in recent years, which has helped contribute to the boost in sales.</p>
<p>Looking at European game sales in June at a glance, 11.3 million video games were sold in the last month, which is a drop of 19% from June 2023. June 2023 saw some big releases, such as Diablo IV and Final Fantasy 16, which helped elevate sales massively. However, June 2024 did not see a big AAA game come through this month, which has led to a decline in sales.</p>
<p>The one huge positive for this half of the year was the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring DLC</a>. Looking at month-on-month data, sales shot up by 454% for the base game of Elden Ring alone. For the highest charted game of this half of the year, it goes to Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. However, only physical sales for this game were counted, with no data on how many digital sales the game received.</p>
<p>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD was nearly the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game this year, but it narrowly avoided the title, with Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door taking its place instead. Nintendo has had a jam-packed first half of the year, with games such as Princess Peach: Showtime and Mario vs. Donkey Kong also being released in the first half.</p>
<p>While most places have their digital and physical data tracked, Nintendo's digital data for Europe is missing, making it difficult to know if they are excelling in sales or falling behind.</p>
<p>Overall, European game sales have stayed strong for the first half of the year, with a very minimal decline compared to the UK and the US.</p>

A disillusioned junior at a law firm, Luisa packs up her bags and flees the tedium and numbness of her life for a chance at feeling <em>something </em>through the literal magic of the town of Hinterberg. And let me tell you, <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>is teeming with magic. Across 20 hours of plumbing its dungeons, meeting its townsfolk, and hiking up and down the Alps’ numerous terrains, I was <em>enchanted</em>. It isn’t without some jank, but it’s without a doubt <em>my </em>feel-good game of the year so far, and a wondrous attempt at an indie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Zelda</em></a></span>-like.<br></p><h2 id="h61"><a id=""></a>A clean escape</h2><p>The crux of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s charm is its simplicity. At the beginning of every day, you will often have a short conversation with another character, and then embark on a journey to one of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s regions to explore a dungeon. At that point, you hike through the picturesque park (rendered in stunning pop art) looking for one of the game’s 25 dungeons, and eventually enter one. Upon its completion, you return to town where you are allowed to shop for potions, gear, and upgrades, as well as talk to some of the townsfolk and other tourists and engage with a straightforward adaptation of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540">Social Link system</a></span>. Then, you rinse and repeat.</p><p>By cutting a lot of the filler and bloat that a much bigger game might load up on, <em>Hinterberg </em>is allowed to shine a spotlight on its most honed edges, namely its titular dungeons. Each of the game’s 25 dungeons has some sort of gimmick, and though they begin simply enough, they eventually evolve into much grander fare. An early dungeon funnels you from encounter to encounter via minecart, but a much later one might become a multi-stage auto scroller on a river raft or a puzzle box with the mind-bending perspective of <em>Fez </em>or <em>Monument Valley</em>. Some of them are low on encounters in favor of puzzles (or vice-versa), but each is a mostly refreshing experience that riffs on an aesthetic, as well as a mechanic that fans of dungeon-heavy games might recognize.</p><figure id="" data-id="4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-recommend-id="image://4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A screenshot showing Luisa skating on a rail in one of Dungeons of Hinterberg’s later levels.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microbird Games / Curve Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-recommend-id="image://4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When it really gets going, <em>Hinterberg</em>’s puzzling is wonderful. It is never so abstract or convoluted that you’re absolutely stumped, but it does demand focus. The solutions to puzzles are never far off, meaning you just have to think about it for more than a few seconds to piece together what’s got to be done. As someone who can be a bit of a brute, I <em>love </em>this school of puzzle design. <em>Hinterberg</em>’s puzzles are intuitive, and because many of them build off of one another to grow subtly more complex as you progress, you, too, gradually evolve, informally learning the language of its philosophy and getting to gel with it. In a lot of puzzle games, I bang my head against a wall till I triumph over it, but in <em>Hinterberg </em>it felt more like I was in sync with the puzzles and we had achieved a mutual sense of cohesion.</p><p>One way in which <em>Hinterberg </em>remains novel is by inventively playing with conventions and camera to radically change on the fly. One level might present itself as a sort of 2D platformer, another might come across as an action-RPG like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/diablo-iv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/diablo-iv"><em>Diablo</em></a></span><em> </em>complete with an isometric angle, and some of my favorite levels appear in a snow region whose various dungeons riff on the level design of <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, of all things. It even has a Lost Woods-style dungeon in the vein of <em>Zelda</em>, its chief influence, and while <em>Hinterberg </em>remains fundamentally the same through these shifts, it embraces a vivacity as it pays homage to these genres and specific games, and becomes a celebratory and triumphant pastiche of its various forebears.<br></p><p>Speaking of, though <em>Hinterberg</em>’s dungeons lean heavily into <em>Zelda </em>territory, its combat most notably cribs from <em>Dark Souls</em>, though it’s never so grueling. You have a light and heavy swing which can be woven into short and simple combos that might stagger and even topple opponents. When you’re not on the attack, though, you’ll be dodge-rolling like a motherfucker, as well as managing your stamina and MP gauge, which are tied to the use of two abilities which rotate depending on the region you’re currently in. The cherry on top are these super-effective moves called attack conduits which have cooldown timers rather than gauges, and can be swapped out at nearly any time. If this sounds pretty standard, it’s because it is, and <em>Hinterberg </em>doesn’t mess with this winning formula for the sake of player comfort. In a game brimming with novelty, it’s a little disappointing how cut-and-dry encounters grow to be.</p><h2 id="h62"><a id=""></a>More than meets the eye</h2><p>As Luisa, who has come here to become an adventurer—known as a slayer—ventures out and talks to the townsfolk, it becomes apparent that magic isn’t all that the brochures and marketing machines have made it out to be. Magic came to Hinterberg and transformed the town, which is led by a mayor who seems hellbent on commodifying the experience and pimping it out to as many people as possible. Theresa, who runs the inn Luisa stays at, has never enjoyed more success thanks to the constant influx of tourists, but it comes at the price of the constant <em>noise</em>. Not literal noise, though a club for adventurers does exist just around the corner from the inn. Rather, the noise of gears churning beneath the surface of it all; a noise that threatens to drown out the denizens of Hinterberg who once had a say in what happens in their small town for the sake of capital.</p><p>Soon enough Luisa, who befriends various folks around town and benefits from these relationships through its social system, becomes an avatar for their collective will. As she gets to know people like the smithy Hannah, Luisa begins unraveling a conspiracy that threatens to unmake Hinterberg, whose leadership has tried to capture and sell magic. <em>Hinterberg</em>’s “coziness” disguises an uglier truth as it provides commentary on the things we aren’t willing to do and forsake for a dollar or an ounce of powermoney or influence.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-recommend-id="image://ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A screenshot of Luisa talking to Renaud, one of Dungeons of Hinterberg’s more eccentric slayers.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microbird Games / Curve Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-recommend-id="image://ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I really appreciated the nuance with which <em>Hinterberg </em>tells this story, which wound up going places I didn’t expect. The game’s very conscious of even Luisa’s role as tourist, and acknowledges how her and many of the people she meets are very much part of the problem plaguing the village. Whether it be for fame, a fantasy-fulfilling vacation, or as a way to exorcize some personal demons, everybody looks to Hinterberg and its magic to solve some ill of their own, but never really give back to the town or invest in it and its people. Instead, Luisa and her ilk come to town and <em>take</em>. If magic were real, <em>Hinterberg </em>believes there’s no way we wouldn’t abuse it, and maybe we’re better off without it. Maybe what we all need to do is take stock of our lives and the lives around us and ask how we can resolve to make things communally better, rather than looking to the divine or magical to fix it all.<br></p><h2 id="h63"><a id=""></a>10/10, would slay again</h2><p>Despite <em>Hinterberg </em>telling me that I should confront my problems rather than run away from them, I’d happily run back to this game time and time again. The beauty of its rendition of the Alps is hard to overstate, and I was enamored by the mere act of jogging up and down its sumptuous trails. Its top-notch dungeon design only further complements what an absolute joy it was to sink into its world filled with magic. Like the best vacation spots, I can’t wait to be drawn in by <em>Hinterberg</em>’s magnetism again and revel in its luxuries for a long time to come.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those gains could be wiped away by proposals in Project 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These proposals attack overtime benefits from multiple angles. In his chapter on the Department of Labor, Berry argues that overtime laws are too restrictive on companies who wish to offer other benefits like reimbursement for education, childcare, or free meals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As he states, "overtime requirements may discourage employers from offering certain fringe benefits such as reimbursement for education, childcare, or even free meals because the benefits' value may be included in the 'regular rate' that must be paid at 150 percent for all overtime hours."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elsewhere, Berry writes that overtime laws should be adjusted to offer "flexibility" to "employers and employees" to calculate overtime over two-or-four-week periods. "This would give workers greater flexibility to work more hours in one week and fewer hours in the next and would not require the employer to pay them more for that same total number of hours of work during the entire period," he says.</span></p><p>Image via Adobe Stock.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This means that if an employer were to demand developers work 60 hour weeks to hit a milestone, they would be able to not pay overtime so long as equivalent time off was offered in the weeks after. Such a regulation does not account for the strain that excessive work hours can inflict on workers, even in the software industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elsewhere, Berry writes that home offices should not be considered workplaces under OSHA guidelines, and employees should not be entitled to overtime protections while working from such locations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, Project 2025 seeks to reverse changes to the "overtime threshold" implemented by President Joe Biden's administration.

It was raised to include workers making up to $58.6k annually, up from $35.5k under the previous administration. About 4.3 million Americans benefitted from this expansion. This expanded range band covers many junior positions in the video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Berry states that the threshold under the previous administration was "high enough" to cover "line workers in lower-cost regions," an eyebrow-raising implication that only certain types of workers deserve overtime protections.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take-home pay for working overtime could also be reduced under Project 2025. Berry advocates that Congress should clarify that the 'regular rate' for overtime pay is based on the salary paid rather than all benefits provided." In other words, if your overtime pay was calculated as 1.5 times your total pay including benefits, you would now only receive 1.5 times your base salary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Project 2025 proponents may point out these changes would be counterbalanced by proposals that would expand accumulation of paid time off based on overtime. This again does not account for the physical and mental strain that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617405/">overtime can exert on the human body</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It isn't unreasonable to expect that if the costs of implementing crunch are lowered, more American employers would gladly push for employees to work more and more hours per week.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Project 2025 is an attack on the video game industry">Project 2025 is an attack on the video game industry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A deeper examination of Project 2025's impact on the game industry would need to explore how it brutalizes the civil rights of undocumented immigrants while slashing immigration rates for workers on visas.

			<p>With the release of No Man's Sky Update 5.0 (known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-worlds-update-part-i-refreshes-the-universes-flora-fauna-weather-and-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Update Part I</a>), Hello Games has also added NVIDIA DLSS 3 support on PC. Keep in mind that the studio's comparison image is not representative of the frame rate boost GeForce RTX 40 will be able to get after enabling DLSS Frame Generation, as they simply picked the same comparison used for the original DLSS 2 (Super Resolution) when the feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-coming-to-no-mans-sky-and-vr-titles-game-ready-driver-optimized-for-days-gone-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was added to No Man's Sky over three years ago</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man’s Sky | 4K NVIDIA DLSS Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHiB8g0Klok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 3 certainly has the potential to boost frame rates even further. However, Frame Generation currently makes things actually worse when enabled. The game feels far less smooth than it does without it, and it also introduces some weird flickering. Perhaps that's why NVIDIA did not advertise the addition yet. Anyway, I checked with Hello Games and was told the developers are aware of the issue and will be pushing a hotfix. There's already an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/4526764179300014742/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimental branch</a> available on Steam, but its current list of fixes does not include DLSS 3 yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a PC-only crash that could occur at the transition from the starfield to the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused graphical corruption on Mac.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to interaction with NPCs on freighters.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when taking damage from the brood mother.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash related to planetary objects.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that occurred when playing PSVR1 on PlayStation 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a whole, this new No Man's Sky update brought many tech improvements to engine, improving both fidelity and performance. Here's the related excerpt from the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shadow-rendering system has been reworked to take advantage of screenspace shadowing techniques, resulting in more richly lit planets and more accurate and more detailed shadows.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The rendering of planetary objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been rewritten and moved to a more modern GPU-based system, allowing for more objects at a better performance.</li>
<li>Distant planetary objects now look significantly more detailed and realistic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, which reduces vertex count, increases terrain generation speed, improves framerate, and saves significant amounts of memory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The component system has been reworked for increased speed and improved memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Networking systems have been improved for reduced bandwidth usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Significant memory and performance optimizations have been made across the entire game, particularly in metadata usage, texture streaming, LOD generation, and procedural mesh generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is on top of the many rendering enhancements made to the sky, cloud, water, and environmental effects. Are you already back into No Man's Sky, or are you waiting to actually be able to use NVIDIA DLSS 3?</p>

What is surprising is that some of these games are still pretty dang expensive considering their age. It’s wild to me that <em>Call of Duty 2</em>, an Xbox 360 launch game approaching 20 years old, is still normally sold for $20. Also, <em>Call of Duty Classic</em>—an HD Xbox 360-era port of the original game—isn’t part of this sale and neither is the recently released <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>. So it’s only most of the franchise.

So if you just want to get caught up on that part of <em>Call of Duty,</em> know it will cost you $105 to purchase all six games.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Call of Duty: World at Wa</em>r</strong> - $10 ($20) </li><li><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em></strong> - $15 ($30) </li><li><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 </em></strong><em>- $15 ($50) </em></li><li><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em></strong> - $20 ($60)</li><li><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em> -</strong> $20 ($60)</li><li><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></strong><em> -</em> $25 ($70)</li></ul></blockquote><p>The entire <em>Modern Warfare</em> franchise (minus the previously mentioned exceptions) is on sale <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/all-games?cat=all&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/all-games?cat=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via Xbox’s Summer Sale, too</a></span>.

Normally all of these games would cost $860, so it’s a pretty solid discount even if I think some of the older games (looking at you <em>Call of Duty 3</em>) should be marked down even more. </p><p>Of course, the real question is if Game Pass subscribers should even buy these games. I think there’s a significant chance in the future that most, if not all of, these <em>Call of Duty </em>games arrive on Game Pass, especially as Microsoft plans to raise the price of the service soon. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-xbox-360-servers-black-ops-input-delay-1850647392&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-xbox-360-servers-black-ops-input-delay-1850647392">Last year work was done by Activision and Xbox</a></span> to make sure these games were playable again online, which seems like more evidence they might arrive on Game Pass one day. </p><p>But for now, if you want to relive 2009 and play some <em>MW3 </em>at midnight while drinking Red Bull, Xbox’s Summer Sale is currently offering a cheap way to return to those glory days. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Last night, I saw <em>Twisters</em> in one of those theaters in Times Square, walking out after its two-hour runtime slightly damp, a little shaken, and absolutely certain that there has never been a movie more perfectly suited for 4DX.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194012,194316" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Twisters</em> stars Daisy Edgar-Jones as a former storm-chasing student reluctantly returning to the field and Glen Powell as a rowdy chaser with a cowboy sensibility and a popular YouTube channel. Like the original film, the push-and-pull between corporate shills and blue-collar babes drives the plot, while a simmering romance between the two leads hooks you in. But unlike the original <em>Twister</em>, you can watch this new film while getting your shit absolutely rocked by wind, rain, and hydraulics. You know that internet meme whereby someone posts a picture of something so thoroughly modern (like a frozen Baja Blast or a robot police dog) along with the phrase: “This would kill a Victorian child”? <em>Twisters</em> in 4DX would turn a Victorian child to dust.<br></p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twisters-movie-release-promo-wind-tornado-1851397889&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twisters-movie-release-promo-wind-tornado-1851397889">Bizarre <em>Twisters</em> Movie Promo Lets You Experience A Tornado (Kind Of)</a></span><br></p><p>I’m not kidding—the 4DX experience is <em>rowdy</em>. Anytime an action sequence began, the woman next to me would hold onto her chair for dear life, anticipating how much she’d be rocked around as soon as a truck turned onto a bumpy dirt road or a huge piece of debris whizzed past. Two kids in front of me (who were definitely too young to be there) were shaken around so violently I worried for their soft little brains. Every so often, flashes of light timed perfectly with the on-screen lightning strikes that hit just before a funnel cloud descends sent murmurs of anticipation through the crowd as we all waited for our seats to start bucking like broncos again.<br></p><p>During a tornado scene, the theater would be periodically sliced through with the sound of gleeful laughter, like the kind you’d hear on a rollercoaster’s ascent. At one point, a tornado petered out around the storm chasers, and a perfectly timed plume of smoke wafted up from under the screen, signifying the disintegrating funnel cloud. Several people let out awe-inspired “oohs.” But it was during the final scene, which mirrors the ending of <em>Twister</em> (read: the characters encounter their biggest tornado yet) and takes place in a movie theater, that I achieved Nirvana.</p><figure id="" data-id="3ab0a0f6ce510e358aff4fa28f723df6" data-recommend-id="image://3ab0a0f6ce510e358aff4fa28f723df6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2781" data-height="4031" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyssa holds up a finger in front of a Twisters step-and-repeat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alyssa holds up a finger in front of a Twisters step-and-repeat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ab0a0f6ce510e358aff4fa28f723df6" data-recommend-id="image://3ab0a0f6ce510e358aff4fa28f723df6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2781" data-height="4031" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyssa holds up a finger in front of a Twisters step-and-repeat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the massive tornado barrels toward a small town, our heroes usher many of its denizens into an old movie theater, quickly realizing that there’s no basement in this building and they’ll have to ride the storm out in the theater itself. My chair rumbles and shakes as the twister nears the building, puffs of wind dry out my eyes, spurts of water leave droplets on my glasses. Anthony Ramos’ character, Javi, yells, “this theater wasn’t built to withstand what’s coming!” and I let out an uncharacteristically cowboy-esque “YEEHAW!” Then the wall on which the theater’s screen is mounted tears away, revealing the funnel in the near-distance.<br></p><p>For a moment, as the ground rumbles beneath me and I’m forced to squint my eyes against the elements, it feels like the wall of this Times Square theater has been ripped away too, and I’m staring into the belly of the beast. “Holy shit!” I yell, as my body is whipped about. “Holy shit!” This is it. This is what I’ve wanted to see in person my entire life. “The finger of God,” as they say in the original film. It’s roaring, it’s twisting, it’s gaining on us—I’m going to get sucked into it in a moment and become just another statistic. And then, the tornado dissipates. My seat settles into stillness. The wind calms. The entire theater exhales. We just survived the storm that is <em>Twisters</em> in 4DX.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ubisoft has delayed two of its upcoming games. As part of the company's earnings announcement, the French publisher revealed that the mobile games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-562223">Rainbow Six Mobile</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-resurgence/" data-ref-id="5000-566851">The Division Resurgence</a> are no longer expected to release in the company's fiscal year 2025. That means they won't be released until some time after March 31, 2025.</p><p>The development teams are using the additional development time to "ensure that these experiences deliver on expectations." Ubisoft added that it's hoping the extra time can help its teams "optimize" each game's key performance indicators "in the context of a demanding yet very large market."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> THE DIVISION RESURGENCE: NEW-YORK CITY TRAILER</p>
      </div>
<p>Rainbow Six Mobile is, as its name suggests, a mobile version of Ubisoft's popular tactical shooter series. The Division Resurgence, meanwhile, is a free-to-play spin-off of the shooter franchise. The delay of these two games comes not long after Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/" data-ref-id="1100-6523480">canceled The Division Heartland as part of the company's examination of its strategic investments.</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-officially-in-the-works-announced-with-little-fanfare/1100-6517899/" data-ref-id="1100-6517899">The Division 3</a>, however, remains in the works.</p><p>Rainbow Six Mobile was available through a soft launch in some markets earlier this year, but <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/mobile/news-updates/3ug03FGf8cTBFiUbf05TCu/the-next-steps-for-rainbow-six-mobile" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft said in March</a> that it was pausing the game's global rollout so it could go back to working on "key elements" of the game. The Division Resurgence has also already been available to early testers <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/resurgence/news-updates/3C0NpnVTS6bRQs7rJSmayB/technical-test-information-and-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through regional technical tests.</a></p><p>Ubisoft did not announce new release dates or windows for Rainbow Six Mobile or The Division Resurgence. The company's next big release is Star Wars Outlaws, which releases on August 30.</p><p>Also as part of the earnings announcement, Ubisoft announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xdefiant/" data-ref-id="5000-534971">XDefiant</a> is off to an "encouraging start," reaching more than 10 million players in its first two weeks. Ubisoft said the game continues to grow at a "steady pace."</p>

            <p>
We've had a glut of articles about gloomier video games on here today, Rachel's bright and breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review">Dungeons Of Hinterberg review</a> notwithstanding. Tomorrow, I promise, it'll be wall-to-wall wholesome life sims, pastel petals and hug emojis as far as the eye can see. But before then, a quick piece on well-received DreadXP-published <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> sim The Mortuary Assistant, which will shortly be updated with an "endless embalming-only mode" that strips out the game's supernatural scares and turns it into a very downbeat job sim.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I say "downbeat", but I myself have never worked in a mortuary, and should resist making presumptions about the nature of the work. If you work in a mortuary, you may prefer to see tending to human remains as a cathartic labour, or a spiritual experience, or simply a dispassionate activity you do to pay the bills. Perhaps The Mortuary Assistant might qualify as "wholesome", given a positive acceptance of one's finitude and the frailty of the flesh. One obvious reference point here is A Mortician's Tale, which, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-morticians-tale-death-positive">Emma Kidwell wrote in 2017</a>, is "a rare breed [of game] which explains to us how our bodies will be treated after our demise and asks us not to be afraid of the process." You might also like to read Dan Hett's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-games-should-be-truly-honest-about-death">piece about exploring loss as a video game writer and designer</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Mortuary Assistant's endless embalming mode <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295920/view/4349997893936742751?l=english">arrives as a free update on 2nd August</a>, alongside the game's Definite Edition. In the base game, embalming corpses forms part of a story about identifying and repelling demonic invaders while investigating various long-buried secrets. Developers DarkStone Digital	use various procedural systems to cunningly rearrange the pieces and ensure a different cadence of scares and revelations every time.
</p>
<p>
It's not wholly clear how the new mode changes the game, but seemingly, it does away with all the demon stuff, and leaves you alone to practice your trade. It's not the only thing the update adds: there will also be new "haunt events", fresh lore, and new bodies to embalm. Also, a Valentine's Day seasonal event. That seems pretty wholesome? If you've not encountered the game before, there's still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295920/The_Mortuary_Assistant/">a demo on Steam</a>. If you have played already, you might like to know that DarkStone Digital are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-paranormal-activity-horror-game-in-the-works-from-the-creator-of-the-mortuary-assistant">now making a Paranormal Activity adaptation</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-gets-new-gameplay-footage/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been following Unknown 9: Awakening, developed by Reflector Entertainment LTD and published by Bandai Namco, brand-new gameplay footage shows off what you can expect to see in the story-rich game.</p>
<p>This title received a new trailer during<a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-first-gameplay-summer-2024-release-date/"> Summer Games Fest</a> that finally gave players a glimpse into the world of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1477940/Unknown_9_Awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unknown 9: Awakening</a> and Haroona's powers. The title was first announced at Gamescom in 2020 and has been developing ever since. The game finally has a planned release date in the Fall of 2024.</p>
<p>In the new eight-minute video, you can see how the gameplay works in Unknown 9: Awakening while the gameplay is accompanied by developer commentary from Creative Director Christophe Rossignol. In this video, Rossignol explains the diverse world that Haroona will get to explore and how exploration ties in with the gameplay. Whether you want to be as stealthy as possible or as destructive as you can be, multiple play styles are available to anyone who dives into Unknown 9: Awakening.</p>
<p>This title features a unique mechanic called "stepping," where Haroona can control her enemies and put them in a position advantageous to her so that she can succeed in battle. This feature may be tricky to wield, but looking at the gameplay footage, it can be incredibly useful. By using her stepping ability, Haroona can temporarily move an enemy to attack then another enemy, which can be beneficial if she needs to plan an escape.</p>
<p>In battle, Haroona is seen to have other abilities that can manipulate the fold to her advantage. This includes her "peeking" ability, which allows her to see the positions of enemies so that you can plan your next attack tactfully and precisely. Haroona can also pull and push enemies, which can help attack enemies high on a cliff to try and avoid damage. She can pull them off the cliff and into a fire hazard, as seen in the footage.</p>
<p>Unknown 9: Awakening features some stunning vistas in the distance, as Haroona has to travel far and wide to understand her powers. This will take her through the deep jungles of India, the Mauritanian desert, and many more fascinating locations, allowing Haroona to bolster her powers differently in each location. Secrets hide around every corner when in exploration mode, and going off of the beaten path can prove to be an asset, as she can find items that can benefit her later in the game.</p>

<p>Unknown 9: Awakening will be available on Steam, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 in Fall 2024.</p>

It combined the feel of an old-school arena shooter with the novel and brain-tickling mechanic of on-demand portals. Now the team behind it is promising a sequel that’s bigger, better, and coming sometime in 2025 to join an increasingly crowded field of would-be live-service juggernauts. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196909" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Made by 1047 Games, <em>Splitgate 2</em> will still be free-to-play and remain cross-gen on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in addition to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as well as come to PC. Here’s how the studio describes it: “Three unique factions grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies, while a large variety of arenas, weapons and modes keep things fresh.”</p><p>And here’s the cinematic trailer announcing the game:</p><p>This time around, the game is being made in Unreal Engine 5 and with a team much bigger than the original, full of veterans from competitors like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Overwatch, </em>and <em>Valorant </em>as well as single-player games like <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em> and <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. </em>There’s a free app you can download to learn more about the in-game universe and even a five-issue comic book arc, because in 2024 it’s no longer enough just to show a trailer that looks cool for a game that’s fun to play. </p><p>Originally launched in Early Access in 2019, it wasn’t until <em>Splitgate</em> went into beta across PC and console that interest in the mashup reached a fever pitch that led to sporadic outages and downtime to fix server issues. The developers eventually abandoned the game in 2022 to work on the sequel. The servers remain up, however, and people are still playing today. </p><p>A few matches of <em>Splitgate</em> provides a good sense of the promise and potential of its gameplay feel and mechanics if 1047 is able to nail the art direction, world building, and map design this time around. Based on the initial trailer, characters in<em> Splitgate 2</em> are still looking a little bland visually, but the arena looks interesting enough, at least for a cinematic reveal. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here are the details on how to upgrade from the base barn to the Big Barn and Deluxe Barn.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Every barn upgrade</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336042-barn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336042" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336042-barn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336042"></a><figcaption>The fully upgraded barn can hold up to 12 animals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336042-barn.jpg"></figure><h3>Base Barn</h3><p>Before you can upgrade your barn, you will need to build the base version first. The barn can be built by purchasing it from the Carpenter and providing the necessary materials. The barn takes up a 7x4 space on your farm, which will not increase even when you upgrade the barn. It takes three days to build. <strong>The required materials are 6,000G, 350 wood, and 150 stone.</strong> The initial barn allows you to purchase cows from Marnie's Ranch for 1,500G each, and it can hold up to four animals.</p><h3>Big Barn</h3><p dir="ltr">The next version of the barn is the Big Barn. <strong>Upgrading to the Big Barn requires 12,000G, 450 wood, and 200 stone</strong>. Upgrading the barn only takes two days and it is still usable during this time. The Big Barn can hold up to eight animals and allows animals to get pregnant. It also unlocks goats, which can be purchased for 4,000G from Marnie's Ranch. Goats produce goat milk every two days.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Deluxe Barn</h3><p dir="ltr">The third and final barn upgrade is the Deluxe Barn. <strong>Upgrading to the Deluxe Barn requires 25,000G, 550 wood, and 300 stone. </strong> The Deluxe Barn can hold up to 12 animals and adds the auto-feed system, which will automatically fill the trough with hay, so long as you have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-hay-in-stardew-valley/1100-6525028/">silo with hay in it.</a> This also adds two new animals to Marnie's Ranch for purchase: pigs and sheep. Pigs cost 16,000G and can find truffles if you allow them to go outside. Sheep cost 8,000G and grow wool, which can be sheared every couple of days.</p><p dir="ltr">So long as you have space on your farm for the building, you can construct as many barns as you want, but each barn will have to go through the upgrades each time to reach the Deluxe Barn.</p>

                <p>Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm has laid off its mobile team.

A quality assurance analyst said, "Unfortunately, NetherRealms mobile team was shut down. A ton of very talented people were put out of work. We had live services on multiple titles such as Mortal Kombat Mobile, Injustice 2, and Mortal Kombat Onslaught."</p><p>An animator also said, "It hurts me to announce I've been laid off from NetherRealm Studios after about 10 years of working there."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-rog-ally/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is making excellent progress and is now apparently close to getting in-game in a popular title.</p>
<p>Two videos shared on YouTube this week by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gmoralistube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeorgeMoralis</a> highlight how the 0.1.1 version of the emulator, which is currently in the works and now yet available for download, can load up Dark Souls Remastered, get into the character creation menu, and even load up the introduction movie. While the emulator still can't get in-game, this is amazing progress that bodes extremely well for the future, considering how quickly things are improving.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls Remaster - Shadps4 v0.1.1 WIP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvTSjdwXLTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls Remaster again... Shadps4 v0.1.1 WIP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HqNUtYBm1Wg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ShadPS4 may also make playing PlayStation 4 games on the go a reality. Earlier this week, MaliceSpeedwagon shared a video showcasing eight games running via the emulator on an ROG Ally in Turbo Mode. While Bloodborne doesn't even boot up, far less demanding games like Sonic Mania and Undertale already seem to run great, so it is still impressive, considering the emulator is still very early in development.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 (v0.1.0) Emulator Tested In 8 Games On The Rog Ally Ryzen Z1 Extreme In Turbo Mode" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wjBpM0yTNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ShadPS4 emulator isn't the only PlayStation 4 emulator actively in the works, but it's been quickly gaining attention thanks to the steady and quick progress it has been making. It is also capable of booting up <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-emulator-improves-bloodborne-pc/">Bloodborne</a> and getting up to the character creation menu, so the day when the game will finally be playable on PC may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found by going <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4">here</a>. The 0.1.0 version is also available for download for free.</p>
