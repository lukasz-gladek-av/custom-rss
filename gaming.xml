		<p>The development team of Tenderfoot Tactics has announced it has removed the game from sale on Xbox in solidarity with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian led campaign to highlight companies that are see to support the Israeli government’s actions again the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>In a statement, the development team said, <em>“The Tenderfoot Tactics team has decided to remove our game from sale on Xbox in solidarity with the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign, which added Xbox to their priority boycott list earlier this month. We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months. We hope that the broader community will join in the pressure campaign and fight for an end to occupation and apartheid in Palestine and across the world.”</em></p>
<p>The BDS Movement has claimed, <em>“Microsoft partners with the apartheid regime of Israel and its prison system. It provides the Israeli military with Azure cloud and AI services that are central to accelerating Israel’s genocide of 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip. After 34 years of deep complicity with Israel’s military, the Israeli army relies heavily on Microsoft to meet technological requirements of its genocide and apartheid regime.”</em></p>

<p>Tenderfoot Tactics is still available for sale on PC and Switch. Microsoft has not yet released a statement on the removal of Tenderfoot Tactics, or addressed the reasons as to why the development team took the action.</p>

			<p>As part of PlayStation's celebration of the platform's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> last year, PS5 owners enjoyed console themes based on each PlayStation console generation. These themes were only available for a limited time until today, when Sony announced that they are making a return in a system update that will be rolling out across the globe tomorrow, April 24, 2025.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/new-ps5-system-software-update-features-audio-focus-and-the-return-of-the-classic-console-ui-customizations/">PlayStation Blog</a> post about tomorrow's update, Sony Interactive Entertainment's vice president of product management, Shuzo Kikuchi, announced a new feature coming to the system called Audio Focus. This new audio setting is designed to make the softer sounds in games louder for players using headphones, with the provided example being to make things like footsteps come through more audibly in your headphones.</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the classic console themes, Kikuchi admitted that their return was solely due to fans asking for them to return.</p>
<p>"<em>During our 30th anniversary celebrations, we surprised our fans with a limited time selection of nostalgic customization features for the PS5 System UI to honor the four PlayStation consoles that paved the way for PS5: PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4,</em>" Kikuchi wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Due to the overwhelmingly positive response from our community, we're happy to bring back the look and feel of the four console designs for players to customize the home screen on PS5!</em>"</p>
<p>When you update your PS5 console, you'll be able to find these returning themes under a new menu in the system's settings called 'Appearance.' Having different themes for your Home screen has been a key customization feature PlayStation players have enjoyed since the dawn of the PS3.</p>
<p>Hopefully, bringing these themes back is just the first step towards more, like the many game-specific themes that used to be available. A few first-party and second-party titles already have themes set for the Welcome menu, but nothing like the themes from the 30th anniversary, which changed the console's entire UI. Players would surely love to see more of the latter down the line.</p>

Here’s the the teaser: </p><p>And here is the official synopsis from 20th Century Studios and Disney: </p><p>“<em>Predator: Badlands</em> is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator  outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.”</p><p>In case you can’t tell from the trailer, <em>Badlands </em>will make one of the franchise’s deadly alien hunters the protagonist. As seen in the teaser, we are going to be spending a lot of time with this outcast Predator who seems to not wear a mask for large sections of the movie. That lets us get a good look at his alien face and mandibles and it reveals that one of the only flaws of <em>Prey</em>—the goofy maskless Predator design—has been fixed here. No more giant forehead! </p><p>If, after watching that teaser, you’re thinking, “Wait, didn’t we already see a trailer for a new Dan Trachtenberg-directed <em>Predator </em>movie earlier this month?” don’t be alarmed. You aren’t losing your mind. We did get a trailer for a <em>different Predator </em>movie<em>—</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-killer-of-killers-cartoon-animated-disney-hulu-1851775292&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-killer-of-killers-cartoon-animated-disney-hulu-1851775292"><em>Killer of Killers—</em>about two weeks ago</a></span>. That one is an animated movie featuring different Predators in different time periods and is also from Trachtenberg. That movie is set to launch on Hulu on June 6. Will it have any ties or connections to <em>Badlands</em>? Maybe!</p><p>Anyway, <em>Predator: Badlands</em> (the live-action movie) is set to land in theaters on November 7. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*1to08ik*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTQyNjc4NC4zMjUuMS4xNzQ1NDMyOTYwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*1to08ik*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTQyNjc4NC4zMjUuMS4xNzQ1NDMyOTYwLjYwLjAuMA..">Two <em>Predator </em>movies in one year?

Ahead of the game’s launch (12am PST tonight in the U.S.), it holds a 92 rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a>, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">IGN’s 9/10 review</a> praising the story design and describing it "as a true modern throwback.” The game’s stylish UI reminds me of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona series</a>, and early <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/clair-obscur-expedition-33-40-minutes-of-gameplay-4k-60fps-ultra-settings">gameplay footage</a> shows off one of the coolest turn-based combat systems I’ve ever seen. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">base edition</a> is launching at the same price as the Bethesda remaster: $49.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Expedition 33 was marketed as the headline of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-spotlights-its-game-pass-april-2025-wave-2-rollout-including-clair-obscur-and-gta-5">April’s Game Pass lineup</a>, the surprise release of Oblivion Remastered has led to some concern of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">"shadow"</a> over the indie game's release. That said, my perspective is that we're getting two incredible cakes, and Game Pass makes enjoying both a little easier on the wallet.

Now the only question is when I'll touch grass again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty more of 2025's biggest games have recently made it onto the service, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review">Blue Prince</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review">South of Midnight</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review">Avowed</a>, which join mainstay classics like GTA V and, of course, the full spread of Call of Duty.

Its sales were 23% higher than its predecessor, MLB The Show 24, during the same debut month last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other games doing well in March included Fortnite, which led all games in MAUs on both Xbox and PlayStation, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which leapt from No.103 in February to No.10 in March on PlayStation specifically thanks to being added to PS+. Co-op horror game R.E.P.O. made a similar leap from No.93 in its debut month of February to No.1 in March on the Steam MAU charts, likely due to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/554398/repo-streamer-social-media-clips-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing social media virality over time</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all these exciting new releases doing pretty well for themselves, March was actually a bit of a low month for games as a whole. Overall games spending dropped 6% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, and content spending dropped 4% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, Circana reports. Non-mobile subscriptions and digital premium downloads on console were the only content areas showing growth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Piscatella for context as to why content spend was down, and he pointed to mobile as the primary perpetrator. Mobile spending, per SensorTower's report, was down 6% year-over-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mobile being such a big component of content means that a dip there usually means the market dips. Console full game download spending was up this March. But declines in mobile and drops in PC full game spend and a drop in digital add on content spending meant overall content fell."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for hardware, spending was down 25% year-over-year to $286 million, the lowest March spending total since 2019 ($279 million). PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, but its sales were still down 26% year-over-year. Xbox took second place, down 9% year-over-year, and Switch sales were down 37% from last year, likely in anticipation of the impending successor, the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">March 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows (NEW)</li><li>MLB: The Show 25* (NEW)</li><li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li><li>WWE 2K25 (NEW)</li><li>Split Ficton (NEW)</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls (NEW)</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Madden NFL 25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>Xenoblade Chronicles X* (NEW)</li><li>Suikoden I &amp; II Remaster: Gate Rune &amp; Dunan Unificaiton Wars (NEW)</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>EA Sports College Football 25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

                <p>Console commands are a part of the very fabric that makes up Bethesda RPGs. While they're exclusive to the PC versions of games, console commands offer players a way to gain a small, or large, edge during their playthrough. The original Oblivion featured a laundry list of console commands, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Oblivion Remastered</a> has brought all of them back.</p><p>Some console commands are fairly harmless in Cyrodiil, while others can completely alter your playthrough. You can activate god mode to rain down hellfire on the citizens of the country, or simply add some items to your inventory that you need for a quest. In any case, you can see a complete list of every console command and how to use them in Oblivion Remastered below. Naturally, for much more on the game, refer to our complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered walkthrough</a>.</p><h2 id="How_to_use_console_commands_in_Oblivion_Remastered">How to use console commands in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>First up, let's talk about how to use console commands. As previously mentioned, <strong>this is a PC-only feature</strong> in Oblivion Remastered, so PlayStation and Xbox players will have to sit this one out.</p><p>PC players can follow the steps below to activate console commands:</p><ul><li>Once you're in-game, press the tilde (~) key, next to the 1 key, on your keyboard</li><li>This brings up the console command menu, which is a large black text box that has a repeating line at the bottom of it</li><li>The repeating line indicates where you can type in your console command</li><li>To use a console command, simply type it in exactly as it appears in the list below, press Enter, and your cheat will activate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481286" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481286"></a><figcaption>The console command text box in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png"></figure><p>As you'll see when you bring up the console command menu, <strong>achievements become disabled if you use any kind of cheat</strong>.

In the list below, you'll see each console command itself and its description. You must type the console command exactly as it appears in the list when you activate it in-game. If you put even a space where it's not supposed to be, the console command won't work.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Console Command</th><th scope="col">In-game

playthrough. Adding and removing items from your inventory, messing with enemies, and changing your level, skills, and attributes will likely be the commands you use the most frequently, though.</p>

Upon further investigation the individual pages for each game, though, you'll see that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a Metascore of 95 on Xbox Series X|S, 91 on PC, and 92 on PS5, while Blue Prince has a 92 on PC, 84 on PS5, and 89 on Xbox.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new turn-based RPG inspired by classics in the genre. It's set in a world where everyone above a certain age dies when a number is painted in the sky, and players set off as part of the titular expedition in hopes of defeating the Paintress behind this. Its provocative story and intense RPG gameplay really resonated with critics, including GameSpot's own.</p><p>"This is a supremely confident game that reinterprets familiar mechanics with an imaginative eye, Richard Wakeling wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">GameSpot's very positive review</a>.

It launches tomorrow, April 24, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S and will be part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog from day one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AI Has Come For The Horse In The Hospital]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/google-ai-idioms</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ai-has-come-for-the-horse-in-the-hospital.1171704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/google-ai-idioms<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, my Bluesky feed was full of people who have discovered what seems to be a quirk in <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-ai-search-god-no-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google’s AI search</a>. Apparently, if you ask it the meaning of an idiom you’ve made up, it will treat it like a real, well-known expression and, with the embarrassing confidence only AI can muster, tell you what it means.</p><p>In one apt <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/albertburneko.bsky.social/post/3lni7smjfps2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a>, noted language genius and Defector writer Albert Burneko asked Google to define “ask a six-headed mouse, get a three-legged stool,” which Google says “suggests asking the wrong question or seeking the wrong advice from someone unqualified can lead to a nonsensical or unhelpful response.” Other examples have included “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gregjenner.bsky.social/post/3lnhxkdywzc2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t lick a badger twice</a>, “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timmarchman.bsky.social/post/3lni72oq2t22m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t make love to a dead dog</a>,” and other <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gregjenner.bsky.social/post/3lnhxkdywzc2m/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fake phrases</a> like “two cars short of a Winnebago,” “don’t touch my mother’s goats,” and “one sandwich in the stomach is worth two in the toilet.” In every instance, Google inserted literal nonsense into the lexicon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is funny because it’s such a clear highlight of one of AI’s most dangerous flaws: the confidence with which it makes things up and then presents them to users as true. Like a man you wish you weren’t talking to in a bar, it (or, more correctly, the people behind it) is desperate to come off as knowledgeable and authoritative, even when it can’t possibly be. It takes obvious bullshit and spins it into truth, in the same way it tells you to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/pm/artificial-intelligence-tells-google-users-to-eat-rocks/103891826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eat rocks</a> or recently gave me <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ll5kmvcqrk2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physically impossible chicken</a>.</p><p>But I think making up meanings for invented idioms is particularly telling of one of AI’s biggest flaws. It made me think of comedian John Mulaney’s famous “horse in a hospital” joke:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="There's a Horse In The Hospital | John Mulaney | Netflix Is A Joke" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhkZMxgPxXU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>To ruin the joke for you with editor brain: The bit, a metaphor for the first Trump administration, is such a good use of language–besides the alliteration of “horse” and “hospital,” the phrase itself is evocatively weird. You assume it’s a people hospital (maybe because we usually say “vet” for animal hospitals), which raises all kinds of questions about how the horse got in there and what it would do in this situation, which provides the grounding for the rest of the joke. The two specific nouns paint a richer picture than, say, “there’s a bird in the bank;” they give high stakes, but it’s such a funny idea that it’s more intriguing than upsetting, providing just the right level of alarm to help you process your actual alarm about the real situation it calls back to.&nbsp;</p><p>If you hadn’t heard the joke and someone just said the phrase “there’s a horse in the hospital,” you’d have a sense of what it was getting at, but you couldn’t, or wouldn’t, define each word the way Google’s AI does. The joke and its reception are both so excellently human; the phrase has a meaning, but it isn’t a strict one-to-one. It highlights the fun of idioms and the things that only people can do with words. That’s given it some sticking power not just as a funny bit, but, to an extent, as part of our language.&nbsp;</p><p>So of course here’s AI to ruin that whole idea. AI can’t be clever or understand human cleverness; it can’t <em>play</em>; it can’t mess around with language, no matter what Sam Altman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/12/a-machine-shaped-hand-read-a-story-from-openais-new-creative-writing-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insists</a>. When you feed Google’s AI nonsense, it can’t screw around with that nonsense with you, it can’t go with the joke. Its answers aren’t funny because it’s creating and interpreting with you; they’re funny because of how energetically AI misses the point–not just of your question, but the whole idea of fun with language.</p><p>Beyond reminding us how easily AI spreads misinformation, this gives a glimpse of what everything we do could look like if the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/22/ai-schools-executive-order-trump-draft/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzQ1Mjk0NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2Njc2Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NDUyOTQ0MDAsImp0aSI6ImMyMmFlNWY1LWZlZTUtNGFkNS04YzI5LTRkMGY2NGM2MDJkMyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyNS8wNC8yMi9haS1zY2hvb2xzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1vcmRlci10cnVtcC1kcmFmdC8ifQ.kZQoEmtK8YUZQVDTZidEQKeAAeZXTwtL7kFYsV8f0WA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losers</a> have their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/654223/cheat-on-everything-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">way</a>. Mess and creativity are a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/654223/cheat-on-everything-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waste of time</a> to them; words and <a href="https://aftermath.site/let-humans-not-ai-be-bad-at-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/studio-ghibli-ai-art-openai-gpt-sam-altman-is-just-the-biggest-pile-of-shit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drawings</a> are just containers for inputs and outputs, boxes with no room for anything that makes these things meaningful or fun. This is the embarrassing future the “AI in everything” crowd wants; this is the machine they want us to find essential when, even in a low-stakes situation, it can only demonstrate that it has no use. As a person who makes their living through words, I’m all in favor of you pushing your weird phrases into conversation with your friends; do cool new things with language, because AI certainly can’t.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending"><h3>Does Blue Prince Never End?</h3></a><p>After finding the 46th room, the journey in Blue Prince really begins.

			<p>UK-based studio Athena Worlds has announced that it is working on a new stealth survival game called Xenomorph, a spiritual successor to the beloved Alien vs. Predator game launched for the Atari Jaguar in 1994.</p>
<p>We know little about the game so far, except that it is happening after Jane Whittaker, the former co-programmer on the Atari AvP game in 1994, announced the project on <a href="https://x.com/WhittakerGames/status/1914981311263002968">his personal X account</a>.</p>
<p>"<em><span>You have been asking me for a personal sequel to our</span> Atari AvP for 30 years...</em>" Whittaker wrote. "<em>Funding, team in place. Production underway!</em>" Whittaker also included a key art image for the game, showcasing the classic shot of a Xenomorph with both its mouths wide open, ready to strike.</p>
<p>Whittaker is also the chief executive officer of Athena Worlds and commented on what this project means to him in a <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/335859/athena-worlds-announces-xenomorph-a-spiritual-sequel-to-alien-vs-predator">press release</a>, saying, "<em>It is a very personal journey for me</em><em>. So many people still talk about our work on AvP to this day, with a massive following. I have been asked for over 30 years to create my next survival and stealth strategy game. I am beyond thrilled to say that thanks to generous support, my day has come.</em>"</p>
<p>The game is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, though this announcement just states that the project is in the works. There's no news about when we might see it come to light.</p>
<p>Whittaker also confirmed that <span>Mike Meaden</span> will be the project's creative lead, and Blaire Wathen will lead character design.</p>
<p>Regarding the game's setting, the press release includes a short snippet of the world players will be stepping into. It reads, "<em>After crash landing on planet XL-243, you quickly find you are not alone and the battle for survival begins</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>The release also confirms that Xenomorph is "<em>aimed at being a landmark open world game of exploration, survival, high stakes tension and combat</em>."</p>

It may not sound like much, but that extra sustain can be extremely helpful against tough foes.</p><h2 id="h664420"><a id="wildfire"></a>Lune: Wildfire</h2><p>While “Immolation” will be Lune’s bread and butter for keeping Burn applied to single targets (especially if you’re using it with Gustave’s Marking Shot), Wildfire is the best early-game AOE (area of effect) option for her. This attack will deal solid damage and apply Burn to every enemy hit. And if you have two Ice stains built up for her, it’ll deal even more damage!</p><h2 id="h664421"><a id="healinglight"></a>Lune: Healing Light</h2><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> isn’t a particularly easy game on its standard difficulty, so unless you are perfect at dodging and parrying, you’ll need to have healing options. One of the best choices is Lune’s “Healing Light,” which can heal an ally while removing status effects. That’s a pretty sweet deal.</p><h2 id="h664422"><a id="guarddown"></a>Maelle: Guard Down</h2><p>While Maelle is a heavy hitter when you get her set up to go all out, she’s also great for applying buffs and debuffs. Grab “Guard Down” to apply the Defenseless status effect to all enemies so that your team can pummel them for even more damage than usual.</p><h2 id="h664423"><a id="guardup"></a>Maelle: Guard Up</h2><p>While “Guard Down” is excellent for helping you dish out more damage, Maelle’s “Guard Up” can provide Shell to your party, which reduces the overall damage they take. Taking less damage means less healing is required—and that means you can spend more time beating the hell out of baddies.</p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available on April 24, 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of course, if you see a Birthsign that works well with the build or character you're going for, choose that one and press on.</p><h2 id="Best_Birthsigns_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Birthsigns in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Let's talk about the best Birthsigns you can choose. There are four Birthsigns that stand out among the rest, and you can see what they are below:</p><p><strong>The Thief </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481109-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.25.55.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481109-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.25.55.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481109"></a><figcaption>The Thief Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481109-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.25.55.png"></figure><p>The Thief is arguably the best overall Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered, regardless of what class or build you're going with. It increases three separate attributes, Agility, Luck, and Speed, by 10 points, giving you a massive head start. Agility and Speed are useful attributes for any build, as they're both incredibly helpful to have when exploring the world. However, both are useful in combat, as well, if you're moving around in any capacity. The increase in Luck is also beneficial, granting you a small bonus on all of your other skills.</p><p><strong>The Atronach </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481113-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.34.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481113" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481113-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.34.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481113"></a><figcaption>The Atronach Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481113-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.34.65.png"></figure><p>If you're planning on playing a magic character in Oblivion Remastered, there are two main Birthsigns you want to target: the Mage and the Atronach. The Mage grants you a base bonus to Magicka and calls it a day, and this is usually the better choice for beginners. However, the Atronach completely changes up the magic gameplay, granting you a huge bonus to Magicka but making it so you can't regenerate Magicka naturally. Instead, you gain Magicka by siphoning it from magic enemies, drinking potions, and using Welkynd Stones.</p><p><strong>The Lady </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481122-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.39.70.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481122" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481122-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.39.70.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481122"></a><figcaption>The Lady Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481122-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.39.70.png"></figure><p>The Lady is a classic Birthsign in Oblivion, and it's one of the best you can choose for any build. It simply boosts your Willpower and Endurance by 10 points right out of the gate, granting you some great attribute bonuses as soon as you start your journey. Willpower affects your Alteration, Restoration, and Destruction stats, as well as affects the regeneration of Magicka and fatigue. Endurance affects your base HP, fatigue, time to hold your breath, and how much health you increase after leveling up. Both are tremendous attributes to boost in Oblivion Remastered, so The Lady is always going to be a solid pick.</p><p><strong>The Shadow </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481123-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.31.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481123" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481123-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.31.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481123"></a><figcaption>The Shadow Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481123-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.31.21.png"></figure><p>Finally, The Shadow allows you to unlock arguably the best Birthsign spell in Oblivion Remastered. You gain access to the Moonshadow spell, which lets you become invisible for a minute. The spell can only be used once a day, but it's incredibly helpful in combat, exploration, and during quests. There's a plethora of uses for invisibility in Oblivion Remastered, so having access to Moonshadow can be a godsend at any time.</p><p>And that wraps up the best Birthsigns in Oblivion Remastered. Again, there's no one correct choice, but there are some options that allow you to gain a quick head start in Cyrodiil to make your journey easier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We all knew that an official remaster for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> was coming from Bethesda and Virtuos. There were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/">more than enough leaks</a> to let us know ahead of time. But we also knew for a long time that a group of modders were already working on their own remake/remaster of Oblivion in Skyrim, called <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">Skyblivion</a>.</p>
<p>Bethesda has always supported modding groups like the Skyblivion team, mainly by not getting in their way and trying to halt the work the modders are doing with a cease and desist order. With the launch of the Oblivion Remaster, Bethesda went a bit further in their support, the Skyblivion team confirmed.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914751791381495955">post on X</a>, the Skyblivion team thanked Bethesda for sending each member of the modding team a game code for the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remaster.</p>
<p>"<em>Huge thanks to our friends at Bethesda Studios for their continued support of Skyblivion!</em>" the post read. "<em>As massive fans, we're beyond grateful for the generous gift of Oblivion Remastered game keys for our entire modding team! This means so much to us. Thank you for everything, Bethesda</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>Skyblivion is a total conversion mod that turns the Special Edition release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim into Oblivion. It's been in development for <a href="http://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/">years</a>, and nearly a decade later, the Skyblivion team is nearing the finish line, with a launch planned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">sometime in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Wccftech has <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">followed</a> its development for practically the whole of that time, so we're just as excited for its release as we are of the fact that Bethesda and Virtuos have made their own remaster of Oblivion.</p>
<p>Both versions will also have big key differences, like the fact that Skyblivion will include more gameplay changes and cut content instead of just being the original Oblivion with a fresh coat of Unreal Engine 5 paint. There's room enough for both Skyblivion and the Oblivion Remaster. In the end, it's the fans who are winning.</p>

The tabletop developer behind Halo: Flashpoint will be developing <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus</em>, a game spanning multiple eras and protagonists from across the franchise.</p>

<h2>The <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus </em>is an ambitious tabletop adaptation where 2-4 players work together using fan-favorite Assassin's Creed characters. The press release included characters like Ezio Auditore, Conner Kenway, Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, and Eivor Varinsdottir. Furthermore, it will feature "enjoyable, challenging, and choice-rich gameplay."</p>

Given developer Mantic Games history of complex but accessible miniatures games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/overdrive-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Overdrive</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/halo-flashpoint-rise-of-banished-brings-alien-exiles-to-battlefield" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Halo: Flashpoint</em></a>, it is likely this board game will be in that mold.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time <em>Assassin's Creed</em> has gotten a tabletop adaptation. Back in 2021 there was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/assassins-creed-board-game-raises-shipping-costs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice</em></a> developed by Triton Noir, which focused more on Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Since <em>Assassin's Creed</em> is about secret orders of assassins taking out targets with parkour, gadgets, and hidden blades across different eras of history, that kind of gameplay loop can translate well to a miniatures environment. A focus on spatial and environmental awareness, planning your moves. Choosing the right time to strike and escape. With some time and consideration, Mantic's style can mesh well here.</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed</em> is one of publisher Ubisoft's most popular action franchises. It began in 2007 and has continued to the present. The franchise has covered multiple historical eras, including The Crusades, the Italian Renaissance, the American Revolution, the Golden Age of Piracy, the French Revolution, the British Industrial Revolution, the time <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">of Vikings</a>, and recently, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Feudal Japan</a>.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for Assassin's Creed: Animus will be going live at some point later this year.</p>
