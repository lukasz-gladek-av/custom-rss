			<p>During our recent trip to Oslo to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play Funcom's Dune Awakening</a> game, the developer also organized a roundtable Q&amp;A where the press could ask a few questions directly to Game Director Joel Bylos. You can find the full transcript of the conversation on the game's features and mechanics below. As a reminder, Dune Awakening is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated for a Q1 launch on PC</a> (where it will support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> on day one) and later on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p><strong>From what I've seen, the PVP seems mostly going to be world PVP. But is there going to be any kind of game mode where you are instanced for some kind of ranked mode where you can compete and maybe rank up?</strong></p>
<p>No, the plan is to keep it to world PvP.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned before having the limitation of portraying the Fremen in the game. Were there any other instances of things that you could or could not do because of the movies? How did that impact your take on the game?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, sure, plenty of things. For example, they're working on the third movie now and I thought, oh, they're gonna be loosened up a little after the second movie's out and it has been such a huge success that they're not gonna be as worried about what we're portraying in Dune Awakening.</p>
<p>And then they announced the third movie and they came to us and said, oh, by the way, all these things from the second book, you can't use them. And I'm like, guys, the game is half built around those things already because we've been working on it for X years and then we had a long conversation and it's kind of okay. But there were things that, yeah, they didn't want us to show.</p>
<p>I don't want to go into too many specifics because it kind of spoils the game and the third movie. But there are things that, because I knew we couldn't rely on the first book, I took a lot of the stuff from the second book and put it in the game because I was like, well, the first book, I know they're making two movies out of that one, and I didn't know they were going to make a third movie.</p>
<p>About eight months ago, I found out they were doing that, and I had a conversation with Legendary. They're great partners to work with. I've heard horror stories about working with, say, Star Wars, and it's nothing like that. These guys are great at sharing with us, they're great at keeping us in the loop. But they also want to make sure that when Denis does his vision for certain things in the world, we haven't already put out something that sort of would change that or conflict with that. I can give an example, a very specific one: the trailer we saw with the old history.</p>
<p>Originally, that trailer showed Paul in the future, sitting on his throne, talking about the past, talking about this other universe he sees, but they were very clear that he can't be sitting on a throne. We can't imply that Paul is in any way a king or an emperor. So, we changed it to him standing up in front of a stone mural, and that was because, which is kind of flattering, they said, look, the visuals for this are so nice, it could be something that Denis did, and we don't want people to make that mistake.</p>
<p>We were like, okay. They were worried that it might actually be taken as a trailer for the third movie or something, so that's actually a bit flattering, but it's also a restriction that comes back to us. In general, it's been great to work with them. We got to go to Budapest and walk around the sets of the films and things like that, so we've been very involved with working tightly with them.</p>
<p>But yeah, there's always constraints and like I said, I think that actually drives us to more creativity. It forces us to think around corners, and I think that it puts us in a place to make the game super interesting for people who already know the story of Dune and want to see what this alternate take looks like.</p>
<p><strong>When creating Dune Awakening, which existing games do you see it appealing the most?</strong></p>
<p>It's a tough one. I'll just say survival games first and foremost, I think there's a huge number of people who play survival games. I think we've seen massive successes in that space. We made Conan Exiles, so we know that crowd.</p>
<p>Also, anybody who likes to play with their friends and muck around a bit, I think it's a pretty good experience for that. And just people who are into detailed, interesting worlds, and of course, that includes people who are into Dune, but also kind of just people who like to play around in a nice cool open world and see what's there.</p>
<p><strong>The example of the gameplay given here today obviously is to show off the combat in one of the dungeons of Dune Awakening. Going a little bit further with that, obviously players want to feel rewarded for the content that they do. In the instance of doing a dungeon, for example, how is the looting in that case? Is it like, throughout the dungeon, you pick stuff up on the side, or is there just one main end goal at the end of it?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the stylization of the progression of the location, it is mostly towards the end, but there can be tidbits throughout the way. We have to see exactly how players respond to how we're distributing rewards. Right now, we have a reward for everybody - as long as you get to the end boss, everyone gets a version of the reward. We're going to see how that works for the economy to see if we need to adjust anything there, but that's the current approach. There are other things along the way, but by grouping together, you will not be penalised for playing with your friends.</p>
<p>There are types of resources that only exist in ecology labs. There are types of resources that only exist in fallen shipwrecks. In particular, it's tied to the type of item it is. Vehicles and vehicle parts can only be mostly found in ecology labs, and suspenser tech and Holtzman shield technology can only be found in these ecology labs where it's been locked away for 10,000 years.</p>
<p>Things like modern weapons and armors, a lot of those are locked away in shipwrecks that have fallen, so you need to go to those locations to get those components. We have an instanced looting system, which means that everybody gets their own version of what the chest has, so everyone rolls on the chest and gets their own thing. There's no loot stealing from other people in a sense. But all the dungeons are open, so it is quite possible for you to come across a dungeon where someone's just run it and there's no enemy inside because they've just killed them all for you. You run in and get your own loot. It's your lucky day, you've got a jackpot and you didn't have to do much work. But it's spread out enough that that doesn't happen that often.</p>
<p>Finally, the other thing I was going to mention is we have a unique schematic system in Dune Awakening, which I think is maybe somewhat interesting for people who play survival games. In the technology tree, you unlock schematics that you can craft infinitely, but in the world, you find unique schematics that you can only craft one or two or three of, and this is what drives our economic system in the game. You might find a special type of Lasgun, and you can only craft one of them. You'd have to run that dungeon many times to get more of that particular gun. Also, they can be repaired a certain number of times before the durability goes to zero, and then you will be like, I need to go back and run that dungeon because I really like that gun or that armour.</p>
<p>In the deep desert, because we're wiping it every week, you can have stuff like a really cool gun that only shows up once every six months. Maybe your guild wants to get as many of those schematics in that week as possible, so you're the only people on the server who can craft that gun. It's a real driver of this rarity and uniqueness of items. That's the loot philosophy in the game right now.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DA_Slowblade-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>WCCFTECH: I was curious if there are any plans to enable privately hosted servers for the roleplaying communities in Dune Awakening.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, so it's an ongoing discussion. We have the ability to do it. What we don't want to do is release our server code to people because it's slightly different than how it's been in the past.</p>
<p>There's a discussion going on about whether we can host servers for people, kind of like Fallout 76 allows people to host, they pay Bethesda but they get their server. We're thinking about how to do this in the best possible way. We haven't made any clear decisions on it yet because it's a complicated thing, especially because the game is made of multiple maps, and one server is usually one map. Essentially, you'd be renting four maps, because you'd have to rent the main map and then all of the social hubs, and then the deep desert is nine maps using <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-qa-creative-director-clarifies-mmo-size-hints-at-beyond-arrakis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">server meshing</a>.</p>
<p>They're all tied together, so it becomes very complicated. In order to rent a private world, you would have to pay the cost of 15 servers, and that is not something we want to put on players, so then we need to figure out the best configuration. Maybe people just want to rent the main map and that's fine, and then we can allow people to do things like speed up progression and change variables on that map, but that's why it's complicated. We're still under discussion. I don't know if we'll have it sorted out for launch, but it's definitely not off the table, and it's something we're discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Are there trade auction houses, that sort of thing?</strong></p>
<p>We have a place called the Exchange in the major cities. You can go there and put things on the Exchange for sale, buy and sell orders, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>In terms of player trade, when you meet a player in the world, you can just click on them, choose trade, and exchange items with each other. You can also do the classic survival thing and just dump it on the ground and someone can pick it up. But I'm not sure we have the permission set up so that you could pick up someone else's loot bag.</p>
<p>Follow-up question about PVP. If there's not gonna be any instanced PvP, but will it be possible to duel someone, to challenge someone to a one-on-one duel? In the movies, we saw some of this.</p>
<p>I want to do that in the future, but it's not gonna be there for launch. I'm sorry about that, but yeah, I just couldn't fit it in the time scale for the game.</p>
<p><strong>When you die in Dune Awakening, how much do you lose of what you collected?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not gonna dare to try and remember the percentages, but you don't drop any of your items, you lose resources. If you're carrying scrap metal, stone, spice, I think you drop all of your spice, 100% of whatever spice you're carrying, 100% of the coins you're carrying, the money you're carrying, but there's a banking system so you can bank money to avoid losing it. And then I think it's 30%ish of the resources you're carrying that are lost upon death. Of course, you can run back to pick it up from your corpse. People cannot loot your corpse in PvE areas of the game, but there are PvP areas of the game where they can.</p>
<p><strong>I really like the ability customization that you guys have. I was kind of wondering, is there a possibility to save builds of abilities so somebody can hotkey to them really quickly to switch?</strong></p>
<p>No. That's a great quality of life suggestion that we should have. We need to figure out how we handle cooldowns and swapping out abilities when they're on cooldown and off cooldown. Yes, we want it. We need to figure out the best way to do it. But yeah, it's definitely one of those quality of life things we'd like to have.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/">Wired Productions</a> will be collaborating with Camel 101 once again to publish their upcoming Lovecraftian horror FPS Beneath. This game draws inspiration from F.E.A.R and Resident Evil and will see players head into the darkest of the depths as a deep-sea diver. While there, you'll have to fight off eldritch horrors that are lurking below. For those who are interested in Beneath, a<a href="https://mailchi.mp/wiredproductions/omniumtrials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> closed beta playtest</a> is currently available for sign-up, where you may get the chance to explore the game early and help the developers by providing feedback.</p>
<p>Below is the trailer for Beneath, where you can see what to expect from the upcoming title developed by Camel 101, the minds behind Those Who Remain and Syndrome.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beneath | Publishing Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSa-rGiKdh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play as a seasoned deep-sea diver named Noah Quinn, and you end up on an expedition that begins to go incredibly wrong, causing you to end up trapped in the depths of the ocean. There, you'll begin to uncover the ancient evil that lurks in the waters, and you'll have to start confronting them yourself if you want to have any chance of survival.</p>
<p>Much like titles like Resident Evil and Half-Life, the ammo you have access to is limited, meaning you have to make do with the scarce amount of supplies you have. All the while, you have to maintain your sanity levels in the depths to avoid being overwhelmed by the eldritch horrors. There are more than just eldritch atrocities to deal with, as you'll also have to fight off soldiers. In Beneath, you aren't confined to just your rig, as you will also be able to utilize your deep-sea dive suit and navigate the ocean.</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to work with Bruno and Ricardo again," said Leo Zullo, Managing Director at Wired Productions. "They are a passionate and talented team, and as brothers, their bond resonates deeply with Wired. Long-term relationships are important to us and we will put our hearts and souls into Beneath and them."</p>
<p>Thus far, it's been confirmed that Beneath will be coming to PC. It has not been stated as of yet whether this game will be available on other platforms in the future.</p>
<p>"We couldn't be more excited about teaming up with Wired! Our previous partnership on Those Who Remain was a success, so we already know the value they bring to the table. Beneath is our most ambitious project to date, and we're sure that their passion and expertise will be invaluable in helping us bring the game to its full potential," said Ricardo Cesteiro, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Camel 101.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-scheduled-for-march.1099785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and Bugbear have announced the Early Access release date for destruction derby racer&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>, so get ready to engage in what the two studios describe as "absolute vehicular mayhem".</p>

<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on March 20th. The game will also eventually come to consoles, although it doesn't look like the Early Access release is making it onto PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, sadly.</p>

<p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>will pack in three gameplay modes: Racing, Derby, and Multiplayer. They're fairly self-explanatory, and as Early Access progresses, Bugbear says it'll also add "a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=Fej_bZWq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=v8MCyrFL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>promises glorious destruction derby action in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the career mode, Bugbear is also promising to add new tracks and vehicles throughout&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>'s Early Access development, and new special challenges in which you race vehicles that "were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack" will be introduced.</p>

<p>Various other features, like tournaments and mod support, are also on the cards for Early Access. Rest assured that it does sound like&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>has a solid core in place if you do decide to pick it up before these features have been implemented, though.</p>

<p>That experience involves what Bugbear and THQ Nordic describe as "full-contact racing action with no rules, just jaw-dropping moments of chaos and destruction". The sequel will sport an improved physics engine compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wreckfest" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, too.</p>

<p>You can check out the Early Access release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good idea of what kind of destructive action to expect from the game.</p>




<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on March 20th. There's no word yet on when the game is coming to consoles, although it has been slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and if you've ever wanted the destructive power of a Hellbomb strapped to your back, this is the Warbond for you.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, Servants of Freedom brings a bunch of new gear for you to try out, foremost among which is the B-100 Portable Hellbomb Stratagem. Like the regular Hellbomb, make sure you're nowhere near this one when it goes off.</p>

<p>Of course, new weapons are also coming as part of this Warbond, including the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle, which powers up the regular Sickle and allows it to overheat, potentially damaging both you and "everything in its path".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=dpfGsSCh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=y7p1VvWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond gives you your very own portable Hellbomb.</figcaption></figure><p>The secondary slot, meanwhile, gets a new GP-20 Ultimatum grenade pistol, which is "designed for closer-range use". That, given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s penchant for randomly murdering you in hilarious ways, sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.</p>

<p>Servants of Freedom also brings a new throwable weapon in the G-50 Seeker, a drone that follows along behind you and explodes near enemies when it detects them. It can also target enemies you ping.</p>

<p>Two new armor sets have been added, both medium sets: the IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous. Both sets come complete with rather terrifying masked helms that will make you look like Doctor Doom, but if he fought on the side of justice, truth, and democracy (ahem).</p>

<p>Naturally, the Warbond comes complete with new capes, a new player title, and a new cheer as well, all of which should help you express yourself when you're taking the fight to those dastardly Terminids (or bots, or Illuminate, of course).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt announced last week that he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">intending to take a sabbatical from work</a>, and that when he returns, he'll begin work on a new Arrowhead game. Exciting!</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and the Servants of Freedom Warbond arrives on February 6th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another big milestone, further cementing the latest&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighter's popularity and success.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1886686193535848650" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the studio reveals that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has hit five million sales, a figure it's managed to reach in around four months.</p>

<p>We already knew the game was successful; it launched to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">best Steam debut ever</a>&nbsp;and went on to top three million sales in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">first day on release</a>, meaning that it's picked up another two million for itself in the intervening months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-dlc.jpg?itok=f9xMvhw5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-dlc.jpg?itok=d6-c2rLE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone just a few months after its release.</figcaption></figure><p>That figure almost certainly includes both physical shipments and digital sales, and it'll take into account all three platforms on which the game is available as well. Still, five million since October is no mean feat!</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is, it's a fighting game that lets you do battle as one of over 180&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>characters, including fan favorites like Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks (and variations thereof).</p>

<p>The game features characters from media like&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z</em>,&nbsp;<em>GT</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Super</em>, as well as "selected&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>movies", and it'll also let you relive some of the series' most iconic moments "from the perspectives of eight characters".</p>

<p>After its release,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>received updates adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen" rel="nofollow">splitscreen play across all of its stages</a>, a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-limited-time-mode" rel="nofollow">limited-time game mode</a>, and plenty of gameplay tweaks and improvements.</p>




<p>Last month, the Hero of Justice DLC pack was released, bringing an additional eleven playable fighters to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, as well as a new costume and three bonus battles.</p>

<p>The DLC has not, however, met with a particularly positive reception, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310650/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO_HERO_OF_JUSTICE_Pack/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">at least on Steam</a>, where fans are complaining about the lack of variety between playable characters and the price of the pack.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790600/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/9n7xmjjhnfc3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/final-destination-bloodlines-movie-trailer-1851754613<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In case you’re worried—as I was—that the <em>Final Destination</em> franchise has been continuing on for years without your noticing, rest assured: <em>Final Destination Bloodlines</em>, due out May 16, is the first new entry in the series in 14 years. The first five movies ran from 2000 to 2011, meaning it’s been gone for longer than it was ever around. Until now! And, you know what? The trailer is fantastic.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For the uninitiated—and hold onto your pensions, but anyone under the age of 25 wasn’t born when the first movie came out—<em>Final Destination</em> was a tale of the repercussions of escaping death. A group of teenagers, boarding an airplane for a school trip, leave the plane after one of their number realizes he’s had a psychic premonition of the flight’s imminent explosion. And some concept of death appears to be most perturbed by this turn of events. They start dying, one by one, in increasingly ludicrous circumstances.</p><p>While it’s not yet known which event the cast of <em>Bloodlines</em> has escaped, one such ludicrous circumstance makes up the splendid trailer for the new movie. Be warned, it’s going to make you yell out loud:</p><p>Oh my oh my. Admittedly, there was a part of me that was hoping for the alternative gag, where despite all those events he then dies because he gets shot through the window or something. But still, that did the job.</p><p>Part of what made 2000's <em>Final Destination</em> so great was the way it framed itself as one of the self-aware slasher flicks that emerged post-<em>Scream</em>, but without the masked killer. Removing the audience’s requirement to put their energies into solving a murder mystery and determining the identity of the villain, it offered a freeing viewing experience, one where the only obligations incumbent on viewers were pondering which elaborate confluence of events would lead to the next character’s grisly death. And then leaned in hard.</p><p>And it still holds up! Admittedly, the film’s most effective moment—the bus—has since been copied so much as to have been entirely neutered, to a degree where such moments are now woefully predictable. But there’s so much more besides, and it’s all delivered with a wink and a bucket of glee. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s a really good time.</p><p>This was largely thanks to the writing team behind the movie: Glen Morgan and James Wong. Any fan of <em>X-Files</em> would immediately recognize those names, the ones you’d sit up in delight at seeing appear during the opening moments of an episode, because it meant it’d be an absolute gem. Despite all this, via what I contend was a snobbery that was rampant at the turn of the millennium, the movie was grimly reviewed, still sitting at a horrible 39 on Metacritic and 36 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>This makes <em>Final Destination</em> one of the strangest horror franchises, as its review scores have <em>climbed</em> with each subsequent movie (other than the fourth, a 3D movie which was universally condemned, including by viewers), despite each generally being worse than the last. As the 11 years went on, perhaps critics became less performatively weary of <em>Scream</em>-likes, and just acknowledged they were being offered a silly good time.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see whether this sixth film will be met with that sense of pre-ordained exhaustion that too often accompanies a revived franchise, or if it’ll just be dreadful all on its own. Or—and this is actually possible—if it can be a genuinely good movie that’s back for a reason! </p><figure id="" data-id="0edc75cad02361320333c2defc9987c3" data-recommend-id="image://0edc75cad02361320333c2defc9987c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1504" data-height="846" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The nodding head of death." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The nodding head of death." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0edc75cad02361320333c2defc9987c3" data-recommend-id="image://0edc75cad02361320333c2defc9987c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1504" data-height="846" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The nodding head of death." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m intrigued by who’s making it, and sadly that doesn’t include Wong or Morgan. But it’s co-directed by Zach Lipovsky, whose track record is, well, it’s improving! He was behind 2014's <em>Leprechaun: Origins</em>, which has the ignominious achievement of holding a 0 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, but then found more success with 2018's <em>Freaks </em>where he partnered up with Adam Stein who co-directs here, and with whom he earned well-deserved acclaim for directorial work on the 2022 revival of <em>Fraggle Rock</em>! So, honestly, who knows there. </p><p>Writing comes courtesy of recent <em>Scream</em> franchise penner Guy Busick and Jon Watts...yes, <em>that</em> Jon Watts, the director of the last three <em>Spider-Man</em> movies! Wow!</p><p><em>Bloodlines </em>will also be the wonderful Tony Todd’s final film, after his death last year. He reprises his character, William Bludworth, who appeared in four of the previous films in the series, giving this revival an extra sense of validity in my mind.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-launches-on-february-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been announced today by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/04/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-launches-february-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Baskin</a>, Social Media and Community Manager of Arrowhead Game Studios, that the next Warbond to be added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wins-goty-at-tiga-awards-2024/">award-winning</a> Helldivers 2 will be released on February 6. Its full title is Warbond: Servants of Freedom. Helldivers 2 is already an incredibly chaotic game, but now even more chaos will be unleashed with the addition of Portable Hellbombs, which you can carry around as a backpack before dropping it off and setting it to blow. You only have ten seconds to clear out, so make it quick.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from this update, make sure to check out the trailer below, which is just under a minute long.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Servants of Freedom Warbond | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7s2Es5g7fwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Sickle can now do even more, as the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle burns both the wielder and the ones on the receiving end of the weapon. It's a bit of a niche choice when it comes to weaponry, but it may just be something that you find plenty of enjoyment in. Alongside the Portable Hellbombs and the Sickle, you can now equip a grenade pistol. Known simply as the Ultimatum, you can launch grenades like never before. Instead of shooting them further away, the Ultimatum is designed for close-range use. However, it still packs an almighty punch, so be careful where you aim it.</p>
<p>A new throwable has been added in this Helldivers 2 Warbond. Named the G-50 Seeker, it's a small drone that follows after you and then explodes near enemies when detected. It can also be used to target pinged enemies and hunt them down to then detonate when found.</p>
<p>Weapons aren't the only thing being added in the Helldivers 2: Servants of Freedom Warbond, as there is new armor for you to try out. The IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous medium armors come equipped with the Integrated Explosives passive.</p>
<p>To be able to access this Servants of Freedom Warbond when it releases, you will, of course, need to own Helldivers 2. It also requires a paid purchase of Super Credits and game progression to unlock.</p>
<p>Will you be purchasing this Warbond when it releases on February 6? Let us know in the comments what you're excited for with this new update.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-profits-plummet-as-switch-crosses-150m-sales.1099692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-switch-150m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the nine-month period between April and December 2024, and although the Switch has hit a new sales milestone, profits and sales are down overall.</p>

<p>In its financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204_3e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, Nintendo acknowledges that sales are down by 31.4% and net profit has fallen by 41.9% when compared to the same nine-month period last year, with sales of both hardware and software plummeting.</p>

<p>Despite this, the company also reveals that the Switch has reached 150 million lifetime sales, putting it within throwing distance of the Nintendo DS family (around 154 million) and perhaps even the all-time title holder, Sony's PS2 (160 million).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-financials.jpg?itok=Lp-eUizf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-financials.jpg?itok=Qhm9YWCG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>was one of Nintendo's best-selling games over the nine months between April and December.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of software sales, while overall figures fell,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>emerged as a big seller for Nintendo, reaching 6.17 million units sold in the nine-month time period.</p>

<p>Newcomer&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>sold almost 4 million copies, while&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em>picked up another 2.63 million sales for itself. Incredibly,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>sold 5.38 million units during this time period. Could there still be Switch owners out there who don't own this game?</p>

<p>Of course, there's one big, massive exclamation point hanging over these figures, and that's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">recent announcement</a> of the Nintendo Switch 2, which will be unveiled in full during a Nintendo Direct showcase in April.</p>

<p>While the console itself wasn't revealed until January, Nintendo did reveal in May that a Switch 2 announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">would come before April 2025</a>, suggesting that many consumers may have been holding off on buying a Switch in order to wait for the new machine to appear.</p>




<p>&nbsp;With regards to its future, Nintendo points to a number of games it's releasing in the coming months, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, which is due to land in March.</p>

<p>The publisher also recommits to 2025 releases for&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>, both of which are apparently still slated to come to the original Switch (although I wouldn't be surprised to see Switch 2 ports for both).</p>

<p>You can check out Nintendo's full <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial results document right here</a> if you want to get super-nerdy with stats and figures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-says-it-will-support-switch-if-theres-a-demand/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Support for the original Nintendo Switch isn’t going to end just because its successor, Nintendo Switch 2, is heading to market. During its Q3 FY2025 earnings call on Tuesday, Nintendo said that they will continue to support the console if demand requires.</p>



<p>As part of their latest earnings call on Tuesday, Nintendo gave an update on the Switch business as a whole. The company announced that the console had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-has-now-sold-over-150-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 150 million units sold</a>, creeping closer to the 160M of the PlayStation 2. It was also revealed, however, that sales have slowed quicker than the company expected. That required Nintendo to lower its operating profit by 22% due to Switch sales falling by 30% for the quarter.</p>



<p>As far as why the drop, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa doesn’t believe the announcement of the Switch 2 has led to a slower sales rate of the original console.</p>



<p>“We don’t think the impact of the reluctance to buy is that great, and we think that it is solid for the eighth year, but we have not been able to reach the plan,” he said according to <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250204-KB2S2JK245IALH4D6JO4NVHOZU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sankei</a>.</p>



<p>Going back to support for the original Switch, it’s not out of the norm for Nintendo to support a console for at least a few years after its predecessor made it to market. The Nintendo Wii was released in 2006, but Nintendo kept services online until May 2014. For the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, online services lasted until April 2024. Whether continued online services means games will still be releasing for the original Switch two, three, or more years after Switch 2’s launch remains to be seen.</p>



<p>How long do you think Nintendo will continue to support the original Nintendo Switch? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-february-titles-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Microsoft has announced its line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for the beginning of February. 
</p>
<p>
The selection is, as you'd expect, headlined by this month's big <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> arrival Avowed, the fresh role-playing game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> developer Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
But, of course, you'll only get the game on 18th February - its launch date - if you have either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for February:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Far Cry: New Dawn - 4th February (Standard, Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Another Crab's Treasure - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Starfield - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Madden NFL 25 - 6th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Kingdom Two Crowns - 13th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Avowed - 18th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>
If you're already on Ultimate or PC Game Pass, your other new additions this month include Far Cry spin-off New Dawn, a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>, and the arrival of this year's Madden NFL installment from EA Sports.
</p>
<p>
Subscribers to the newer Standard tier now join Ultimate and PC subscribers in gaining access to Bethesda's space RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, plus Another Crab's Treasure,  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a> and Kingdom: Two Crowns.
</p>
<p>
As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, it also taketh away. Seven games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass on 15th February, in case you want to give them a quick bash before they go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Little to the Left (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Bloodstained Ritual of the Night (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>EA Sports UFC 3 (Console via EA Play)</li>
<li>Indivisible (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Merge and Blade (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Return to Grace (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Tales of Arise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.
</p>

Last week, Microsoft gave us a glimpse at Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4 and South of Midnight as part of its Xbox Developer Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-is-positioned-to-save-the-xbox-console-business">It's taken eight years, but could  Game Pass finally be positioned to save the Xbox console business and give Xbox a point?</a>

			<p>Following the launch of NVIDIA DLSS 4, NVIDIA confirmed today that PC gamers can use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA app DLSS Override functionality</a> to enable the new transformer AI model and even Multi Frame Generation in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-demo-out-now-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo of The First Berserker: Khazan</a>. Of course, Multi Frame Generation is only available to owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5090</a> or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-suprim-soc-16-gb-gpu-review-superior-cooling-stunning-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5080</a> (the RTX 5070 and 5070Ti are slated to launch later this month). The First Berserker: Khazan is scheduled to be released on March 27; you can read our take on the action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As part of an NVIDIA DLSS news round-up, NVIDIA said that the Unreal Engine 5 powered <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> remaster supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, though the DLSS Override functionality isn't enabled for either the new transformer AI model or Multi Frame Generation. The same goes for Level Zero: Extraction, the multiplayer extraction horror shooter developed by Doghowl Games and published by tinyBuild, which has recently launched out of early access with standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation integration.&nbsp;In two days, developer Aesir Interactive and publisher NACON will release Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator, which is described as the first paramedic simulation game. This title also supports standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth supports standard DLSS Super Resolution (you can turn it into DLAA by simply setting both maximum and minimum Dynamic Resolution Scaling values to 100%). For some graphics enhancement mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our previous coverage</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Warhorse's excellent (as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our perfect score review</a>) Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launches today with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. Through the NVIDIA app, users can activate the DLSS Override to force the transformer AI model to take over for improved image quality.</p>

The license for the anime-inspired miniatures skirmish game series, which went dormant after a controversial crowdfunding campaign, has been picked up by Ignition Core Games. Better still, it will be on sale at this year's Adepticon.</p>



<p>According to a press release, Ignition Core Games, Relic Knights will relaunch on the 27th of March at Adepticon at the Ignition Core Games/ Scale 75 USA booth.&nbsp; They will offer a 2-Player Starter Set and three additional miniatures to expand the units in the starter set. Those miniatures are Combat Armor Cordelia, Alabaster Automata, and Infiltrator Candy.</p>

If you want to know how it plays before you buy, you'll have plenty of opportunities.</p>

<p>The releases will not end there. Throughout 2025, Relic Knights will have faction releases for Shattered Sword, Black Diamond, and Cerci Speed Circuit.&nbsp; Everything offered will be available via direct sale, at conventions, or on Ignition Core Games' website from a stock of on-hand inventory.</p>

<p>A discount is possible if you were a backer of the <em>Relic Knights Second Edition</em> Kickstarter campaign. If you directly email Ignition Core Games, you can get a "steep discount" on anything in the product line you pledged for during the campaign.</p>

<p>To quote the press release directly, "It's not a perfect solution but we will provide you with your pledged items at the lowest prices possible."</p>

<p>This is important since the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sodapopminiatures/relic-knights-2nd-edition/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Relic Knights Second Edition</em> Kickstarter</a> campaign ended in disaster. It was originally developed by Soda Pop Miniatures and published by Ninja Division, the same studio behind <em>Super Dungeon Explore</em>.</p>

<p>Despite the campaign raising an impressive $386,826, production was stalled and stopped for several years. Ultimately, all Kickstarter Backers were left with nothing as <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/03/11/thousands-of-kickstarter-backers-left-out-of-pocket-as-super-dungeon-explore-publisher-ninja-division-files-for-bankruptcy/" rel="nofollow">Ninja Division filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<p>For those still interested in enjoying the anime-inspired action of <em>Relic Knights,</em> Adepticon is a few months away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-breaks-the-heavens-with-new-sales-milestone/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to the latest announcement, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has sold more than 5 million units globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s 2024 3D arena fighter, the latest instalment in a decade-old game series, has hit a major sales milestone. Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the successor to the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series, has sold over 5 million units across PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, and PC since October 8, 2024 (less than 4 months since release). The developers have <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1886686193535848650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanked</a> the fans for their passion and support in helping them achieve this milestone. </p>



<p>Moreover, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has shown no signs of slowing down. The developers have already released the first DLC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-hero-of-justice-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero of Justice</a>. The latest expansion introduces 11 new playable characters, with the likes of Beast Gohan, Orange Piccolo, Cell Max and more from Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie joining the roster. The developers have also released a new game mode and fresh cosmetics with the new DLC. 2 more DLCs are planned, introducing more than 20 characters to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are several reasons why Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has sold 5 million units. Most importantly, fans appreciate that the developers stayed faithful to the source material. They built upon the already perfected gameplay from the Budokai Tenkaichi series by enhancing it with stunning visuals, destructible arenas, and a roster of nearly 200 characters. Additionally, the game’s multiplayer aspect is easy to access, and the story mode offers a refreshing experience with new Episode Battles and Custom Battles.</p>



<p>In other news, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-is-one-of-the-best-selling-bandai-namco-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco’s best-selling games</a>.

<p>VALORANT is one of the most popular online multiplayer titles in gaming, attracting thousands of players a day to the tactical shooter genre. With so many agents and abilities, the game consistently receives fixes when these abilities aren’t working properly, like the one in today’s 10.02 patch.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of bug fixes coming to <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT</a> in Patch 10.02.</p>

<p>VALORANT Patch 10.02 doesn’t feature any significant gameplay changes or improvements, save for one to Killjoy’s Alarmbot. It features a number of bug fixes, primarily targeting agent abilities that were bugged. Here are those changes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vyse</strong>: Fixed an issue where Arc Rose and Razorvine were visible when placedon specific water surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Tejo</strong>: Fixed an issue where players could rarely survive running straight through the full duration of Armageddon.</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy: </strong>Fixed an issue where Killjoy’s recall minimap indicator could get stuck in a state where it was invisible.</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy: </strong>Alarmbot logic has been updated to be more intelligent.
<ul>
<li>In niche circumstances, <strong>the Alarmbot will now path towards players if they are on ledges and explode on them</strong> if they would be hit by the size of the explosion rather than trying to run extremely long paths around the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where certain types of damage could leave players with Regen Shields at 1 HP when the damage should have been lethal.
<ul>
<li>This also fixed issues where <strong>Clove</strong> could tank lethal damage specifically when Regen Shield and Pick Me Up were active at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed a bug where Observers were seeing inconsistent player team outline colors.</li>
</ul>



<p>The following fixes to Premier, VALORANT’s seasonal competitive mode, apply only to PC players: </p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where long team names could overlap each other on the playoff bracket screen.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where dropdowns on the standings sometimes cut off text.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the division name text was not always correctly aligned on the match history screen</li>
</ul>



<p>Since his arrival at the start of the season, Tejo has become a popular fixture amongst competitive and pro players. However, his destructive ultimate Armageddon was sometimes not killing players caught in it’s full blast. Now, thanks to patch 10.02, players caught in the full duration will die.</p>



<p>Arguably the biggest change in VALORANT Patch 10.02 is the improved intelligence of Killjoy’s Alarmbot. Players are no longer safe from the Alarmbot if it they’re up on a ledge above it.</p>
