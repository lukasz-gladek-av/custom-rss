			<p>As someone who has never played a game <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the Nikki series</a> but knew a lot about it from other people talking about the mobile games, I was truly shocked playing the Closed Beta of Infinity Nikki. My time with the game was short, but I can't wait for more. If you're someone who loves to customize your character, unlock new outfits, and get to play dress-up, this is the perfect game for that. Typically, I avoid the<a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-reaches-20-million-pre-registrations/"> gacha game</a> experience, and it took me a while to realize that Infinity Nikki was a gacha game until it was mentioned in a tutorial. Compared to other gacha games, the micro-transaction part of the game didn't feel like it was forced on you or like you were being influenced into purchasing something.</p>
<p>Instead, it simply felt like an accessory to the game, where you could form your own decisions about whether you used the system or not. However, stepping into the world of Infinity Nikki was nothing short of magical. From the high-definition graphics to the sparkle effects on the clothing, I was enamored immediately.</p>
<p>As a kid growing up with browser games, I spent a lot of time playing dress-up games online, including StarDoll. Growing up, I continued to love games where I could dress characters up and customize them, which is why I have such an intense love of The Sims, even today. Getting to step into a world full of magic, glitz and glamor felt like a dream come true, and every second I played of Infinity Nikki was an absolute delight.</p>
<p>The fashion wasn't the only thing that blew me away. The Unreal Engine 5-powered graphics and location designs were absolutely stunning, and I ended up with quite a few screenshots just to create some backgrounds for my laptop. The lighting was perfect, and it was very realistic and magical to look at. In certain locations, it reminded me of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but with more realistic animations and stylistic choices.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/infinity-nikki-flying-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>


<p>Going into it, I had no idea what to expect. I knew it was an open-world game, but that was as far as my knowledge went. What I wasn't expecting was to have to complete puzzles, take part in delicate platforming, and fight enemies. The enemies in the game reminded me a lot of the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts, giving me a little shot of nostalgia when I'd have to interact with them. Although it wasn't much of a combat sequence, as you just had to fire a purification orb at them, they would disappear.</p>
<p>I liked that Nikki's dress would change depending on what abilities she had to use. For example, if she had to jump and float, her dress would change into a gorgeous blue dress full of shimmer as she floated on bubbles to get to her location. It reminded me a lot of typical girly toys you'd get as a kid, like the Barbie dolls that would change color when submerged in water.</p>
<p>The first city you stumble upon is beautiful and teeming with life, with plenty of different characters to talk to, mini-games to complete, and side-quests to embark on. One of the mini-games I enjoyed was having to steer a paper crane away from trees and stones to be able to complete it. It wasn't difficult by any means, but it had a lovely, unique animation style.</p>
<p>My only gripe came when entering the Stylist's Guild. For some reason, you go from being able to pan your camera around as much as you want to a locked camera. Maybe it was a bug or just my game having issues, but it made navigating the area really difficult. I found myself running into walls time and time again to try and figure out how to leave the building.</p>

<p>Overall, my experience with Infinity Nikki was a great one. I loved figuring out how to platform and parkour my way to getting items, finding secret chests with new clothing, and discovering secrets around every corner. I truly cannot wait for this game to be fully released, and I just know it will be a huge time-sink for me. The game doesn't have a release date yet, but it should be available soon on PC (via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/infinity-nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/infinity-nikki/id6502622570" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infoldgames.infinitynikkien" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizard-of-legend-2-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Dead Mage and publisher Humble Games have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, showing off what's coming to the co-op action roguelite during its Early Access period.</p>
<p><em>Wizard of Legend&nbsp;</em><em>2&nbsp;</em>was released just a couple of days ago, but Dead Mage is already looking to the future, and it looks like that future is solid despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures">Humble Games' recent layoffs and restructuring</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2193540/view/4670886977421955728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> titled "What to Expect for&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>!", Dead Mage says today's roadmap is intended to show off what the team is working on, but that there's still room to "adapt based on your feedback and input".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizard-of-legend-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=dueteFXB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizard-of-legend-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=fQGq0fwi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new stuff is on its way to&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>in the coming months.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap isn't organized by time, and the new features it promises are presented "in no particular order", Dead Mage says.</p>
<p>New biomes, including the Castle and "the Final Biome", are on the way, and you can also expect two brand new elemental bosses based on Fire and Wind, both of whom will have unique attacks for you to deal with.</p>
<p>You can expect the game's story to be significantly expanded during the Early Access period, with Dead Mage promising "more profound lore and story elements", and, of course, you'll be getting more Arcana, as well as more upgrades and enhancements for those Arcana.</p>
<p>Other improvements promised by the roadmap include four-player co-op play, as well as more relics and medallions, more contracts, and more ways to customize the game. It's Dead Mage's hope that these additions "provide endless replayability" for&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>, it is, believe it or not, the sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wizard-of-legend">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend</em>.</p>
<p>Released last week in Early Access,&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>introduces a new 3D visual style, as well as new spells, new challenges, and more. Dead Mage says the plan right now is to stay in Early Access "for at least six months".</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2193540/Wizard_of_Legend_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> right now.</p>

Morpeko, admittedly one of the more shameless examples of a Pika-clone, has two forms: One is Full Belly Mode, and the other is Hangry Mode. Yes, you feel seen.</p><p>Why is it so prone to the major munchies? Because while this flagrant cut-and-paste of Pokémon’s main mascot goes as far as to including it generating electricity in sacs in its cheeks, in Morpeko’s case, this is a major drain on its energy levels, leading to becoming ravenous. And if that appetite isn’t quickly sated, it causes a hormone imbalance that induces a physical transformation—Jekyll &amp; Hyde-style—where its fur and eyes change color, and its mood becomes aggressive and volatile. Or put more simply, when it gets hungry, it gets <em>mad</em>.</p><h2 id="h123469"><a id=""></a>Morpeko finally shows up</h2><p>Come October 22, from 10 a.m. (no matter where you live), Morpeko will finally be appearing in <em>POGO</em>, and brings with it a small tweak to battling.

Attacks like Zapperator in a dynamic twist on turn-based combat, where well-timed attacks, dodges and counterattacks are key to defeating foes.</p><p>Don’t forget to equip Battle Plugs for extra abilities that can grant you strategic advantages, like creating a shockwave to damage multiple enemies or guaranteed critical hits against flying enemies. Experiment with creative combinations to layer different effects and see what happens!</p><p>Plus, discover the power of Luigi’s inventive mind with Luigi Logic, which can lend a helping hand during exploration and boss battles alike.

            <p>There's a new Star Wars game on the horizon. No, I am not talking about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">Eclipse</a> or even that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kotor-remake-alive-and-well-says-saber-interactive-ceo">Knights of the Old Republic remake</a>. I am in fact talking about the surprise announcement of Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles, a spruced up version of the original game, which first released all the way back in 2000 (slowly crumbles to dust).</p>
<p>Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles is developed by Aspyr, and coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will feature improved gameplay, enhanced models, the option to play with modern or classic controls and so on. It will also have all secret characters and levels from the original game unlocked from the start, so you maul as Darth Maul from the off if you so desire.</p>
<p>There are also going to be 13 newly unlocked playable characters to battle it out with on Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles' release. These include a Rifle Droid and a Tusken Raider. My favourite feature, though. The cheats are all there as well. Big Head Mode, here we come. You can check out the announcement trailer for Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles below.</p>

<p>I just hope Aspyr releases a slightly, erm, more polished Star Wars game this time. </p>
<p>The developer released its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-battlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> Classic Collection earlier this year, but it arrived in a bit of a sorry state, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/players-criticise-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-for-bugs-server-woes-at-launch">numerous bugs and severe lack of preparation for online multiplayer</a>.</p>
<p>Aspyr was also originally at the helm of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-aaa-project-has-switched-studios-following-report-of-kotor-trouble">KOTOR remake</a>, before development was moved to Saber Interactive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FIFA has announced that Konami is its new partner for the FIFAe World Cup esports event, replacing former partner EA, with whom FIFA parted ways back in 2022.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/konami-replaces-ea-as-fifas-esports-partner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, the free-to-play football (sorry, but I'm going to be saying "football" throughout rather than "soccer") game <i>eFootball&nbsp;</i>will now be the game in which the esports World Cup takes place.</p>
<p>Naturally, prior to this partnership, that honor went to EA's <i>FIFA&nbsp;</i>series, but that franchise was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year">renamed to&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year">EA Sports FC</a>&nbsp;</em>following the split between EA and FIFA. A reason for the split was technically never officially revealed, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-really-looks-like-fifa-23-wont-be-thing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it was reported</a> that a licensing fee dispute was the cause.</p>

<p>A total of 18 countries have been invited to take part, including England, France, Brazil, and Portugal, among others. The champion will be named at the conclusion of each tournament.</p>
<p>Konami senior executive officer Koji Kobayashi says he's grateful to FIFA for giving Konami the opportunity to play host to the FIFAe World Cup, and that it looks forward to sharing the "enthusiasm, excitement, and joy" of players worldwide.</p>
<p>FIFA CBO Romy Gai, meanwhile, says the association is "incredibly excited" to team up with Konami, and that the partnership is part of FIFA's "mission to promote football globally".</p>

<p>Still, FIFA's decision to partner with the studio that created the game which was, at one point, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/efootball-2022-just-released-but-its-already-worst-rated-game-on-steam">Steam's worst-rated game of 2021</a>&nbsp;is perhaps a touch questionable.

<p>Elsewhere in Konami news, the company's gaming CEO Steve Sutherland was recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241010529209/en/Konami-Gaming-CEO-Steve-Sutherland-Awarded-AGEM-Memorial-Award-for-Excellence-in-Commercial-Gaming-Professionalism" rel="noopener" target="_blank">handed a trade association award</a> for "excellence in commercial gaming professionalism".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Logitech has released the Astro A50 Wireless 5th Gen headset, an audio-based marvel that will sit atop a gamer’s head as if it were a crown. This versatile, sumptuous device offers unparalleled audio quality, stellar comfort levels, and intense customisation options – but all that is reflected in the price. If you’ve been sitting on the fence about this device because of the price point, hopefully, this Astro A50 Wireless headset review can set your mind straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pretty-penny-gorgeous-peripherals">Pretty Penny, Gorgeous Peripherals</h2>



<p>The Astro A50 Wireless headset is now in its fifth generation, and this latest evolution is a superb one. Logitech has packed so many features into one device with the new Astro A50, allowing users to take advantage of the company’s proprietary LIGHTSPEED technology and PLAYSYNC Audio mechanics.</p>



<p>That means that the wireless connectivity of the Astro A50 is lightning fast, and thanks to the enhanced base station, you can connect it to three devices at once and switch between them at the tap of a tactile button – it’s brilliant.</p>



<p>It’ll run up quite a bill, though. The Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset floats around $300, which makes it one of the most expensive gaming headsets on the market, but believe me when I say it’s worth every penny. From the broadcast-grade omnidirectional microphone to the Pro-G Graphene drivers, every inch of the Astro A50 Gen 5 headset is <strong>premium</strong>.</p>



<p>It comes in at just 363 grams, which means that the hulking frame of the A50 is decisively misleading. It looks like it should be much heavier, but it’s a wonder to wear it for hours on end without suffering from any fatigue. No matter what game you’re playing, you’ll be soaking up pinpoint spatial sound while taking advantage of phenomenally comfortable padding around the ears and the top of your head.</p>



<p>It has now been more than 12 years since the first Astro A50 headset was released, and from content creators to competitive esports players, it has become a firm favourite of so many gamers worldwide. The Gen 5 release represents the cherry on top; the icing on the cake in the form of a true multi-dimensional headset that’s a must-have for the multi-platform gamer.</p>



<h2 id="h-into-the-performance">Into the Performance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset looks good in black or white, but how does it perform?</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’m in love with the Astro A50’s magnetic charging dock. As a forgetful gamer, I’ll leave wireless accessories out until their batteries run flat, but since testing the Astro A50, I haven’t once managed to leave it hanging on a monitor or sitting on my desk. It’s <strong>satisfying </strong>to click the headset into the stand and have it sitting in pride of place on a nearby shelf.</p>



<p>The status indicators on the base unit are super helpful, too. Even when you’re wearing the headset, a slight glance to the base unit will give you an indication of the battery level. With up to 24 hours of playtime on a full charge, you’ll find it hard to run the headset into the ground, which is fantastic.</p>



<p>The <strong>one drawback </strong>I have is that my PlayStation and Xbox consoles are across the other side of the room to my PC, so it’s almost not possible to have them connected to the base unit unless I use a really long USB-C cable. It means I can’t use the PLAYSYNC technology effectively, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me, as I’d have bought this <strong>to use it</strong> <strong>exclusively </strong>on PC games.</p>



<p>On all platforms, you can take advantage of the ‘mixamp-like’ audio mixing features, and on PlayStation and Xbox, you can use Dolby Atmos or PlayStation 3D Audio for better depth of sound. </p>



<p>The Astro A50 Gen 5 really shines brightest on PC, though. This is where you can utilise the G Hub software to fully tweak the device (G App is useful elsewhere), and you’ll get 24-bit audio by default without needing to worry about the HDMI 2.1 AV passthrough requirement.</p>



<p>I found that when playing a shooter like Escape from Tarkov, where every sound matters, I was picking up footsteps and audio cues much clearer, and the directional clarity was second-to-none. I’ve been around the houses when it comes to headsets, and the Astro A50 Gen 5 is without a doubt the cream of the crop.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Logitech’s Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset is an audio experience in a tangible form. It sounds phenomenal, feels great on your head, and offers enough features under the hood to make the price point worthwhile. When you throw in the high-tech and attractive base unit, you’ve got one hell of a peripheral package that any gamer should be proud to own.</p>

                <p>Giant spiders have been a fantasy trope for a long time. From Shelob in The Lord of the Rings to the arachnids in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-review/1900-6238632/" data-ref-id="1900-6238632">Dragon Age: Origins</a> and its subsequent follow-up games. But later this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-gone-gold/1100-6526915/" data-ref-id="1100-6526915">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will buck this trend by excluding spiders from the entire game.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1fz1yyu/comment/lqzsrqc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reddit thread</a>, a BioWare associate community manager confirmed that there are no spiders in The Veilguard. This marks a significant change for the franchise, since the arachnids were so common in Origins and also present in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-ii-review/1900-6301579/" data-ref-id="1900-6301579">Dragon Age 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-review/1900-6415949/" data-ref-id="1900-6415949">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>.</p><p>No one seems to have asked the obvious question about whether there's an in-game reason for the absence of spiders. In the real world, Saint Patrick's Day is partially based on the myth that Saint Patrick drove all of the snakes out of Ireland. If someone rid Thedas of all its spiders, shouldn't they get their own holiday? It seems only fair, even if it's just an excuse to get drunk in-game.</p><p>Just because the spiders are gone doesn't mean The Veilguard will be lacking in fearsome enemies to fight. One of the recently revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-unleashes-an-epic-dragon-battle/1100-6526689/" data-ref-id="1100-6526689">gameplay trailers depicted an epic battle</a> between the player's character Rook and a blighted dragon. Perhaps whoever got rid of the spiders should have dealt with the dragons first.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 31.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/mario-luigi-brothership-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s a little odd to think it, but since the turn of the century, Mario’s been as much of a role-playing powerhouse as a platforming icon. Between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/17/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review/">Mario + Rabbids</a>, there’s actually been more new RPGs than jump man adventures, and that lead is only going to be extended next month with the release of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – Making Memories in Concordia – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tffEKtODS4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>it’s actually been nine years since the last new Mario &amp; Luigi game, with a couple of remakes during the Nintendo 3DS’s twilight years. The original developer AlphaDream closed down after the last of these remakes failed to perform, leaving the series’ future in doubt. However, it’s lovely to see it get another chance. We don’t know the name of the studio yet – Nintendo being as mysterious as ever – but some of the original developers were noted as being involved.</p>


<p>This new game sees the most iconic Italian brothers since Romulus and Remus thrown into another adventure in strange lands. Concordia has been shattered into islands, and this dynamic duo are the only ones that can help the local partner characters Connie and Snoutlet –&nbsp;not a pig –&nbsp;drag the realm back together again.</p>
<p>With an island adventure before them, they’re going to need a boat. What they end up with is Shipshape Island, a ship that’s also an island, able to traverse the seas and search for new islands to launch Mario and Luigi at from a cannon. Each island then needs to be linked back to Shipshape by finding a magical lighthouse and connecting their beacons together.</p>


<p>We got to fire ourselves at two islands from the game, showing that early evolution of introductory gameplay, as well as some of the pair’s new tricks. Landing on Twister Island, and needing to reach one of the locals who’s now stranded up on a clifftop, the famous twisting vines having withdrawn because nobody’s dancing anymore… and nobody’s dancing because there’s a serious hair gel shortage. It’s a real struggle, but thankfully it’s not that tricky to find Spiralia, the one person who knows how to make hair gel, and get them back to their shop, even if they work in the middle of a forest that’s full of bugs they are absolutely petrified of.</p>
<p>It’s an absolutely barmy series of situations in isolation, and I hope there’s a bit more heft to the overarching narrative of the game. Still, this allows the familiar Mario &amp; Luigi tandem gameplay shines through. Just getting around the world is a quirky little challenge, as pressing ‘A’ makes Mario jump and ‘B’ makes Luigi jump, who is invariably right on his heels, and you can get the pleasing one-two jump as you lead the pair around (though it’s far more forgiving than I remember the GBA original being). There’s some environmental puzzling here, as helping Spiralia requires you to carry her past meandering bugs, hopping over ledges and passing her back and forth between the two brothers.</p>
<p>Later, on Merrygo Island, a new Luigi Logic system shows up, with the taller brother able to take more of an independent role in certain scenarios. It could be helping you chase after collectibles that float around, and Luigi splitting off to go man a gong trigger, while Mario heads up to get a view of the surroundings –&nbsp;Merrygo Island is home to a huge circular maze, which needs to be shifted and moved around to let the pair pass through.</p>

<p>Then there’s the brotherly baddie bashing in combat. Similar to Paper Mario, every encounter is triggered by running into enemies in the world, sending you into battle with the possibility that you can get a free attack (or that the enemy does). From there you’re in a fairly standard turn-based system, picking from a jump attack, hammer attack or a special shell attack. The twist is that every single attack has Mario and Luigi teaming up, with active button presses for the two characters boosting your damage. From an acrobatic launch into the air, to winding up and hitting hammers together for a whirling dervish of damage, or the back and forth passing of a shell to build up to a shell attack, it’s a quick little QTE that’s nice and straightforward. That said, it is visually and mechanically quite repetitive with the limited abilities available this early in the game, and I’m definitely looking forward to more shell attacks later on.</p>
<p>More difficult to grasp is the timing of button presses when defending and possible countering enemy attacks. They all have multiple attack types to learn, and you have to read not only what attack is coming, but which brother it’s going to target. This is where the real learning curve comes in the game’s combat, and I was often getting caught out, especially with return attacks as enemies swoop back onto screen.</p>

<p>A further factor is the Plugs, consumable modifiers that boost various abilities alongside levelling up and grabbing new gear. You can apply multiple plugs and they can provide boosts to make counters more easy, give your attacks a dizzy effect, boost damage against flying enemies, drop an extra spike ball on an enemy with an Excellent rating, and more. Each plug has a set number of charges before needing to be replaced, but you can swap them in and out pretty much whenever you like. It’s a neat little system, relying on finding collectable energy in the world to craft them.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more that we didn’t get to really explore. Shipshape island will naturally be a hub for the game, and there’s some little back and forth minigame challenges to find around the different islands that we only really dipped a toe into. There’s also some fun team up abilities for the world exploration, with Mario and Luigi able to effective start tangoing, and then turn into a flying saucer when they jump. It’s a hell of a trick that would have the Strictly judges lose their minds, but more practically it will let you hover across wider gaps in the world.</p>
<p>If there’s one aspect I’m less enthused by, it’s the art style, which honestly might have worked best on the 3DS as opposed to the Switch. It’s a bit too heavy on the thick outlines, the picture quality a bit too soft, and there’s also this odd colour gradient to Mario and Luigi’s red and green tops and hats. Maybe it will grow on me with more time spent in the game, but it’s not one I’ve instantly loved.</p>
<p>It’s lovely to see Mario &amp; Luigi return, a role playing counterpart to Paper Mario, just like the back and forth of 3D and 2D Mario platformers. I’m curious to see how safe or adventurous the wider game will be, but it’s already clear that there’s plenty of unusual character to meet amongst the Concordians. Also… did I mention that Snoutlet, the sassy pig that’s definitely not a pig, actually lives in Luigi’s hat? I’m here for that. More games should have hat pigs (that aren’t pigs).</p>

			<p>According to a rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh07V_QF5Oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by YouTuber RebsGaming, Halo Infinite 2 was in development at 343 Industries before Microsoft decided to drastically change the franchise's plans. The YouTuber's anonymous source says that right after the release of Halo Infinite (December 2021), 343's campaign team began working on the sequel in the Slipspace Engine. The team reportedly had 'high hopes' for the gameplay improvements that could have been introduced in Halo Infinite 2.</p>
<p>However, plans changed completely when there was a leadership <a href="https://wccftech.com/head-of-halo-infinite-steps-down-as-microsoft-starts-a-343-industries-restructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change</a> inside 343 Industries in September 2022. with Bonnie Ross being replaced by Pierre Hintze. The new leadership decided to switch to Unreal Engine for future Halo games and canceled the Halo Infinite 2 project. The team was asked to start learning Unreal Engine 5, which lasted until early 2023 when Microsoft's big round of layoffs hit 343 Industries hard. RebsGaming's source was also affected, so they do not know if the team is still working on a direct sequel to Infinite or not. The game was fairly well received upon launch; it got an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Halo Infinite is, in my opinion, the best game of the series. While still faltering in the narrative, character development, and exposition, it improves earlier titles. Combat is entertaining and engaging, with improvements made across the board, but mention must go to new abilities like the grappling hook. The move to an open world helps the game stand apart, with added freedom to take the fight to your enemies and a vast arsenal of weapons and vehicles to bring into battle. While it slips up on a few occasions, from somebody who has never been part of the Halo fan club, this has given me a glimpse of what could be great things to come.</em></p>
<p>Still, it's official now: Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-has-multiple-projects-on-the-way-made-with-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded</a> 343 Industries to Halo Studios, and the team has multiple games in development with Unreal Engine 5. In the meantime, Infinite is <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-getting-third-person-mode-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> some new stuff soon, including a third-person view.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-cryptic-studios-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Neverwinter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Star Trek Online&nbsp;</em>developer Cryptic Studios has been hit by another round of layoffs, with an unknown number of staff being let go from the studio this time around.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cryptic-studios-is-laying-off-staff-at-the-end-of-october" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Developer report</a>, a number of Cryptic employees, including artists <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7248093634103803905/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amelia March</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mauricio-tejerina-758619_i-will-be-leaving-cryptic-studios-at-the-activity-7248056180013510656-5q3n/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mauricio Tejerina</a>, have confirmed that they're being laid off on business social networking platform LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Cryptic art director Thomas Marrone subsequently <a href="https://x.com/thomasthecat/status/1843662460315980227" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed the layoffs</a> via social media a couple of days ago, adding that "some wonderful people are being let go" and that "their loss will be deeply felt" at the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cryptic-studios-layoffs-star-trek-online.jpg?itok=i7H52S9k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cryptic-studios-layoffs-star-trek-online.jpg?itok=dnG6HGZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cryptic Studios is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Star Trek Online</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter&nbsp;</em>and others.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Cryptic Studios has been hit by layoffs, either. Back in November last year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cryptic-studios-layoffs">let an unknown number of personnel go</a>, citing an "organizational change".</p>
<p>That decision was likely part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">restructuring effort</a> by Cryptic's parent Embracer, which saw the holding company cut a huge number of jobs and outright close or sell some studios (including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a>).</p>
<p>Supposedly, however, that restructuring program is over, having concluded with Embracer announcing its intent to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">split into three separate companies</a> back in April.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the reason behind these latest Cryptic layoffs isn't entirely clear, and neither Embracer nor Cryptic have announced anything through official channels, so no clear reason has been given by either company.</p>

<p>Big studios like Microsoft and Sony, as well as indie outfits like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s ZA/UM and&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>developer Airship Syndicate, have been hit by layoffs.</p>

<p>A new DLC for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the ‘Martial Arts Pack’, has been discovered online.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-dlc-martial-arts-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ComicBook</a>, if you head over to the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> page of Dragon Ball Sparking Zero and click the DLCs tab, you will observe some new changes in the section. Since yesterday, the developers have added 4 types of downloadable content for the game. Three have already been announced: the Anime Music Pack 1, Anime Music Pack 2, and Ultimate Upgrade Pack. However, another DLC called Martial Arts Pack was added, which people have yet to learn about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-dlc-revealed-via-steam-backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> highlights a Reddit post by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1g0ehsh/sparking_zero_book_released_in_japan_includes_a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zeucleio</a> that reveals a Dragon Ball Sparking Zero companion book was released in Japan, and the Martial Arts Pack DLC is part of this book. Players who purchase this book are provided with a key code for their respective platforms. Upon using this code, players are provided with the Martial Arts Pack in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what does the Martial Arts Pack include? Many players speculated that it could be a Dragon Ball Sparking Zero cosmetics pack or for characters from the original Dragon Ball Saga. However, it’s none of those. Players who use this code are provided with early unlocks for Bardock, Future Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Gohan. They also receive Bardock’s Z costume and the Super Sparking! ability item. Interested players can check out the Amazon listing for the companion book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4087798216">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sparking Zero has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-tops-all-dragon-ball-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topped</a> all Dragon Ball games on Steam.&nbsp;<span>If you are new to the game, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-attack-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attack</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-movement-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Movement</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-defense-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Defense</a>&nbsp;guides before entering the PvP mode</span>.

The developer said it can make tuning changes “faster and with more frequency while working on the balance of the game.”</p><p>Live Tuning Update #1 reduces ball trajectory height for lobbed passes and crosses in Rush matches (Ultimate Team’s eye-catching new mode for FC 25), and reduces the accuracy of first-time lobbed through passes and lobbed through passes taken at severe angles across all gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But it’s the end of the game-breaking speed boost exploit that will be of most interest to core FC 25 fans. This speed boost glitch saw players accelerate unintentionally quickly using a simple combination of input commands, which in turn caused chaos especially in Ultimate Team’s ranked PvP mode, Division Rivals, and the ultra hardcore FUT Champs mode.</p><p>All that was required was a press and hold of L1 on PlayStation or LB on Xbox then a tap of the Sprint button, which would see your players explode beyond bemused defenders and into space. Hopefully with this live tuning update the exploit will be gone for good.</p><p>The live tuning update follows the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25-title-update-2-tackles-the-horribly-unresponsive-menus">FC 25 Title Update 2</a>, which made a relatively small number of changes to the game just a week after launch. But EA Sports clearly has plenty more work to do getting FC 25 up to scratch, with unresponsive menus and gameplay as well as overpowered defending and dodgy passing among the many community complaints.</p><p>Wondering what's changed in FC 25? Here's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ea-sports-fc-25/EA_FC_25_Changes:_Everything_New">list of everything new</a> - we've also got the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ea-sports-fc-25/Best_EA_FC_25_Tactics_Codes">Best EA FC 25 Tactics Codes</a> to help you prepare your game plan, plus a breakdown of <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ea-sports-fc-25/Skill_Moves_and_How_to_Perform">every Skill Move in FC 25</a> and how to perform them.</p><h2>EA Sports FC 25 Live Tuning Update #1 Patch Notes:</h2><p>Made the following changes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced ball trajectory height for Lobbed Passes and Crosses performed in Rush matches.</li><li>Reduced accuracy of first time Lobbed Through Passes and Lobbed Through Passes taken at severe angles.</li></ul><p>Addressed the following issue:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>[PS5/PC/XBSX|S Only] Reduced instances of players accelerating unintentionally quickly when a Sprint is requested.</li></ul><p>In order to ensure this update has been applied, shut down and relaunch EA Sports FC 25 when you see this message in game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<section><p>The first Mario &amp; Luigi game on a Nintendo console looks like a promising mixture of goofball humor and surprisingly deep RPG hooks.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The handheld Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series has always been defined by its limitations. The first game's unique control scheme, mapping A to Mario and B to Luigi, was a clever twist on the timing-based combat of Super Mario RPG, built to work on a system with just two face buttons. Later iterations maintained its heart and humor with additional elements, but it has always been the smaller, more modest handheld Mario RPG series in contrast to the Paper Mario series on consoles. Based on a hands-on preview with Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, it looks as if the sweet little handheld series is finally being given the premium treatment on the hybrid Nintendo Switch, without losing its charmingly goofy sense of humor.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been almost a decade since a new Mario &amp; Luigi game released, so it's only natural that Brothership would be a significant visual upgrade over anything we've seen before. Even still, the new look is immediately striking, thanks to a beautiful, bright and cheery animated style that lets the brothers squash and stretch like Looney Tunes characters. Mario &amp; Luigi has always focused heavily on the dynamic between the two brothers, so this element lets the animations emphasize their personalities. Mario as always is the steadfast hero, while Luigi is more of a well-meaning but overconfident goofball.</p><p dir="ltr">This time, the super bros are magically plucked from their homey Mushroom Kingdom to a mysterious new land called Concordia. This land was once a single world held together by the glowing threads of a magical tree, but the tree became corrupted and the islands split apart. Mario and Luigi have come into possession of a new sapling to restore the world tree, which they house on their floating sea vessel. So they set off from island to island to link them back together with the tree. It's a sweet concept that emphasizes bringing people together.</p><p dir="ltr">The people of Concordia have a distinct look that can only be described as: plug faces. They look like the plugs of your electrical outlet, albeit with some distinctive features to stand out from each other. Likewise, joining an island back together with the main world tree involves connecting a shimmering plug-like device, so there's certainly a theme at play here.</p><p dir="ltr">Sailing is done automatically and surprisingly reminded me of a cross between two different Zelda games: Wind Waker and Spirit Tracks. You choose a set of currents to ride along, and you'll journey in a circle on that current repeatedly until you scope out a destination using your spyglass. Since the ship doubles as your home base and it travels independently once you chart a course, you can roam around and do some shopping while en route to your destination. While the major mission-critical islands are obvious, there is a sense of discovery as well, since you can find other islands or landmarks to explore using your spyglass. And the feeling of sailing across the open ocean in a brightly colored landscape was Wind Waker through and through.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you arrive at a mission island, you need to find its lighthouse, which will come down to completing a themed quest. In the first island I visited, the Concordians were struggling from severely bad vibes, thanks to their Groovemaster dance leader being too ashamed to show his face due to a bad hair day. So Mario and Luigi had to venture into a scary forest to find the vendor who made the finest-quality hair wax, restore the Groovemaster's confidence, and get the citizens dancing again.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381881-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381881-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381881"></a><figcaption>Mario &amp; Luigi join the islands of Concordia back together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381881-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png"></figure><p>Traversing the world lets you jump independently as Mario and Luigi as always, but this time, Luigi operates more automatically. If you clear a gap as Mario, Luigi will follow automatically without needing to precisely time and stagger his own jumps. The platforming still doesn't feel great, exactly--this certainly won't be mistaken for a real Mario platformer--but automating Luigi definitely helps alleviate some frustration I've felt with past games. You can also tap L when prompted to activate "Luigi Logic," which sometimes activates special contextual actions to complete a puzzle, and other times just lets him take care of busywork like smashing boxes to find some coins. This definitely makes Luigi a second-banana to Mario, but he doesn't seem to mind.</p><p dir="ltr">When you encounter an enemy in the world, you can get a boost by initiating with a well-timed jump. That launches you into the battle screen, where Mario and Luigi operate with their own buttons for jumps and dodges. The Mario &amp; Luigi twist on timing-based combat has always involved controlling both brothers simultaneously and carefully reading enemy attacks to know which brother they're targeting. That's present here too, and on top of that, your attacks are their own canvas to show off the brothers' animated antics. Most of your timing prompts will involve some interaction between the two--for example, a hammer attack might bounce back, only to have Luigi smack your hammer with his own for an extra finisher. These had a nice level of variety to them, with different animations triggering based on which brother you're using, which attack you're using, and which enemy you're targeting.</p><p dir="ltr">I was, however, slightly disoriented by the way the menu confirmation works. Mario's button prompts are always mapped to A and Luigi's are always mapped to B, as usual for the series. But when selecting an attack from the menu, A is confirm and B is cancel regardless of which brother you're selecting. That means remembering that when choosing a Mario attack, you use A to confirm and then A to perform the timing prompts, but when choosing a Luigi attack, you use A to confirm and then immediately switch to B for the timing prompts. I'm sure it would come to me with practice, but during the short preview session, I got my wires crossed and flubbed the timing on more than one occasion.</p><p dir="ltr">After a short break, we visited another island, which was a little later in the game and had some more complexities at play. The centerpiece of this island was an enormous circular maze in the center, filled with enemies, and different areas that could be used to rotate the interior or exterior of the maze to find your way through. This time, Mario was able to climb to a tall perch, giving you a bird's-eye view, while Luigi stayed behind and manned the rotation. It wasn't extremely difficult to solve, but it provided a little satisfying friction.</p><p dir="ltr">More difficult than the puzzle were the new combat encounters, but this second island was also meant to show off another new feature. A set of special passive abilities called Plugs could be equipped, giving you specialized benefits like 100% critical chance against certain enemy types. These are purchased using a special currency found by exploring the world, and the abilities themselves can be prepared ahead of time or hot-swapped during battle. What made them stand out was how they could be combined for much more powerful, almost game-breaking effects. With just two plug slots, I could equip one that guaranteed a critical hit on a flying enemy, and another that rewarded critical hits with a powerful explosion that hit surrounding enemies. When combined, I could simply target a flying enemy in the center and make short work of the whole field. I was told that more slots open up as you go and the abilities continue to stack, and just from the small taste of this system I could imagine tinkering with combinations to craft my own powerful strategies. They do come with some limitations, like a set number of uses before they need to recharge. But as a nice quality-of-life feature, you don't use a charge of an ability if it couldn't have triggered. For example, if you keep your anti-spike ability equipped and hit a non-spike enemy, that won't count against your uses. This effectively reduces the need to babysit your abilities between each turn.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381882-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381882" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381882-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381882"></a><figcaption>Luigi has a brilliant flash of "Luigi Logic"</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381882-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381883-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381884-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381885-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381886-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381887-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381888-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_06.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381889-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_07.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381890-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_08.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381891-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381883,1300-4381884,1300-4381885,1300-4381886,1300-4381887,1300-4381888,1300-4381889,1300-4381890,1300-4381891" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381883-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381884-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381885-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381886-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381887-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381888-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_06.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381889-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_07.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381890-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_08.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381891-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_09.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381883-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381884-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381885-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381886-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381887-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381888-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_06.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381889-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_07.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381890-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_08.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381891-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_09.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you gain levels, you'll continue powering up your stats, including the fan-favorite "Stache" stat. And as a new wrinkle, every eight levels you also pick from a list of specialized, permanent upgrades. One might give you an extra HP for each level from then on, while another might permanently boost your EXP gain. These can't be re-rolled, so it gives you a deeper level of decision-making about how you want to shape your Mario and Luigi strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">Though we didn't see the feature in action, we were told that tethering new islands will allow NPCs to move freely between all the other islands you've joined, opening up new side quests and other opportunities for exploration. Each island seems fairly quick to complete initially, but the ability to go back and find new quests suggests a potentially deep layer of exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">Just how deep it goes remains to be seen in the full game, but what I've seen so far is certainly impressive. The Mario &amp; Luigi series has long been a de facto second-tier Mario RPG, the little sibling of the dual series. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is an opportunity to come into its own on a bigger stage, and thanks to a comical animated presentation and some surprisingly deep RPG hooks, it's finally moving beyond its own limitations.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has unveiled a rather fabulous custom Xbox console and controller, inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>It's honestly a really great looking piece of kit. The console itself features a "timeworn yet beautiful design" in a golden hue. The controller, meanwhile, has a leathery look to it and gemstone-like buttons. As a huge Indiana Jones fan, I wanted this kit in my house yesterday.</p>
<p>But, here's the catch. Microsoft has locked this console, quite literally, in a puzzle box, and only if you solve the puzzle will you then be entered into a sweepstake to actually win the console and controller. Oh, there will also be the chance to win one via some kind of social media engagement on Bethesda's channels. But, otherwise, this console and controller will not be for sale. Sad.</p>

<p>"Forgotten ruins, Adamic puzzles and hidden treasure await any adventurer up to the task in this clever and challenging puzzle. Fans and families can visit the Microsoft Experience Centers in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/locations">London</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/store/locations">Sydney</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations">New York</a> to experience a stunning display for the holidays from 12th November through 6th January," reads an Xbox blog post on the Indiana Jones-themed hardware.</p>
<p>"What better way to experience the game than with your newest discovery of this console and controller? Don't forget to ask yourself as you investigate, decrypt and untangle this puzzle: What would Indy do?"</p>

<p>This is not the first time Xbox has kept one of its custom consoles behind a sweepstake of some description.</p>
<p>In November last year, Xbox announced a competition in collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures to promote the Timothée Chalamet-fronted Wonka film. Winners got a range of chocolate goodies including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-giving-away-an-edible-chocolate-controller">Wonka-inspired Xbox Series X and an edible controller</a>.</p>
<p>Also last year, it hosted a giveaway which saw some Xbox fans presented with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-pizza-scented-controller-in-collaboration-with-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">pizza-scented Xbox wireless controller</a>, as part of a promotion for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> movie.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Battle Royale karting game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stampede-racing-royale">Stampede Racing Royale</a> has burst into a full free-to-play launch on PC via Steam with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> – should that be Dave the Driver? – collaboration to celebrate the release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stampede: Racing Royale ???? PLAY FOR FREE ON STEAM!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0EJki9N-5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The pitch for Stampede Racing Royale is pretty simple: it’s Mario Kart, but a battle royale. 60 players will join the starting lobby and then race through three rounds, first to avoid the cut and then to race for the win in the final round.</p>
<p>The game on Steam is skipping past the Early Access branding, but it’s a counterpart to the Xbox Game Preview version available on consoles and the Microsoft Store on PC, which is keeping the Game Preview label. There will also be the biggest update yet for the Game Preview build, with new content, features and community-driven changes.</p>
<p>There’s six new tracks, six new karts (plus one Dave the Diver kart), and more than 250 new customisation items. They’ve added a new ‘Wrapid’ special event to unlock an exclusive kart wrap, and there’s a reward for logging in for 7 days straight.</p>

<p>For the moment-to-moment racing, a new boost system has been implemented to accumulate boost via drifting, airtime and just passively, with players able to deploy it themselves. A new Jelly Block power-up will drop gelatinous cubes on the track to slow and blur the vision of anyone that runs into it. Add some new round modifiers, like Hard Mode, where players can be instantly eliminated by running into hazards, and there’s plenty of scope for added variety.</p>
<p>In a curious move, the game is going far beyond just being free-to-play. Sumo Leamington want to built a bustling community first, and so have completely removed in-app purchases from the game. They’re also gifting all racers 3,000 Star Chips&nbsp;–&nbsp;the in-game currency – which is enough to unlock all of the cosmetic content.</p>
<p>It’s a bold move, but alongside the Dave the Diver collab, it should hopefully help gain the game a good bit of attention. Season 0 will extend through to early 2025, with Sumo looking to make more changes for the eventual arrival of Season 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-mod-unlocked-framerate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero mod was released online today promises to make the experience much smoother, at least in offline play.</p>
<p>The mod developed by Zetto, which can be downloaded for free from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonballsparkingzero/mods/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, removes the 60 FPS cap in the PC version of the game, allowing the game to run at an unlocked framerate without speeding up the game.&nbsp;For the mod to work properly, the <a href="https://ko-fi.com/post/Dragon-Ball-Sparking-Zero-UTOC-Signature-Bypass-P-D1D314G19U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparking Zero UTOC Signature Bypass patch</a> is required.</p>
<p>Considering how <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-pc-system-requirements/">undemanding the Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO PC system requirements</a> are, many players should be able to take advantage of this mod to improve the experience. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-interview-with-jun-furutani-discussing-the-series-return-game-modes-netcode/">August</a>, during Gamescom, I asked the game's producer Jun Furutani about high refresh rate modes and was told that the team wanted to offer the same type of experience on all platforms, so all versions of the game run at 60 frames per second. During the same interview, Furutani-san also commented on balancing, play modes, character roster, and more.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO launches tomorrow, October 11th, on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide. The game is already available for all those who purchase the game's Deluxe Edition. You can learn more about the game by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-hands-on-ps5-preview/">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-announces-open-playtest-for-mysterious-new-switch-online-feature.1005858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-new-feature-playtest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a playtest for a brand new Nintendo Switch Online feature, and recruitment for said playtest begins today, although you'll need a little extra something if you want to take part.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-gb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on its website</a>, Nintendo says that the aptly-named Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program pertains to "a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service" that'll be available on the Switch.</p>
<p>You'll only be able to take part in said test if you have an Expansion Pack addon for your Switch Online subscription, and you'll also need to be at least 18 years of age starting from yesterday (October 9th).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-new-feature-playtest-games.jpg?itok=jGSY-RiJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-new-feature-playtest-games.jpg?itok=1GRdwF5w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo Switch Online is about to get some kind of new feature, although we're not sure what it might be yet.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also only be able to access the test if you're based in the UK, the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. Those applying from outside Japan will be picked "on a first-come-first-serve basis", Nintendo says, while those within Japan will be selected via raffle "if there are many Japanese applicants".</p>
<p>Recruitment starts today at 10am Eastern and runs until October 15th, and the playtest period itself begins on October 24th, ending on November 6th.</p>
<p>Of course, this being Nintendo, the Japanese gaming giant is cagey regarding exactly what the new feature it's testing might be. However, given that you need an Expansion Pack addon to access it, we can make a few educated guesses.</p>
<p>Since the Expansion Pack offers a number of retro games you can't access with a basic Nintendo Switch Online membership, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online">Game Boy Advance games</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/european-n64-titles-will-be-slower">N64 titles</a>, it's possible Nintendo is trialing a brand new system for the Expansion Pack service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-playtest.jpg?itok=A3XkEYy7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-playtest.jpg?itok=NcUwLOuP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could GameCube games be on their way to Nintendo Switch Online?</figcaption></figure><p>The obvious first choice if this is the case would be the GameCube, since there are many games for that system, like&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros. Melee&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, that are unavailable on modern consoles.</p>
<p>Nintendo could also be trialing the release of DS games for Switch Online. We know that porting DS games to modern systems is possible thanks to the recent release of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/dominus_collection/eu/en-eu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Castlevania: Dominus Collection</em></a>, after all.</p>
<p>In any case, you'll be able to apply for whatever this Nintendo playtest happens to be starting from 10am Eastern today. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24266327/metaphor-refantazio-persona-handheld-heritage<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus’ <em>Persona</em> franchise is largely a console series, but it has a strong handheld heritage. There were excellent portable versions of <em>Persona 3</em> and <em>Persona 4</em>, and <em>Persona 5</em> <em>Royal</em> on Nintendo Switch was great, too. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a new fantasy JRPG from the team behind those beloved <em>Persona</em>s. And while the game takes place in a different universe, many of the core elements are present in <em>Metaphor</em> — which means that it’s just as great of a handheld experience.</p><p>I might be understating it to say <em>Metaphor</em> is <em>Persona</em>-like. The game’s UI is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24026398">exceptionally flashy</a>. You’ll spend a lot of time talking with your allies and improving your bonds with them. Days tick by as you navigate sprawling dungeons and spend time with your companions before a looming deadline. The main characters even go through epic transformations where they brutally rip an organ out of their body as a mysterious voice talks in “thous” and “haths.” Once, while taking notes about the game, I called it <em>Persona</em> instead of <em>Metaphor</em>. It’s that similar.</p><p>But that means so much of what makes <em>Persona</em> games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/17/23403042/persona-5-royal-nier-automata-nintendo-switch-review">great portable titles</a> works for <em>Metaphor</em>, too. Battles tend to be quick, meaning if you have a few minutes, you can blast through several to clear a dungeon floor. Doing activities in one in-game day is enough to feel like progress. Some parts of the game feature long bouts of text, but when I’m playing just before I go to sleep, seeing what happens next can feel like an exciting chapter in a great book.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m playing <em>Metaphor</em> on the Steam Deck. The game is listed on Steam as Playable instead of Verified, and while it is indeed playable, performance is inconsistent, especially in town areas I’ve visited. (The towns are pretty busy places, with lots of characters and things going on.) I actually capped the game at 30fps in settings, even though it can run higher, just because I didn’t want to deal with varying frame rates.</p><p>But fortunately, <em>Metaphor</em> isn’t a game that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metaphor-refantazio-a-sublime-game-let-down-by-bizarre-technical-choices">demands perfect performance</a>. In dungeons, you can attack enemies in real time to try to get the jump on them, but I found that frame rate dips didn’t hinder my ability to pull off a successful barrage. All battles are turn-based, anyway, and some frame drops didn’t make much of a difference to me there.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m more than fine dealing with some issues; being able to take <em>Metaphor</em> anywhere I want is amazing. I play the game pretty much every night before I fall asleep, I play it on the couch on the weekends while my new baby naps, and I even took my Steam Deck on two recent business trips just so I could sneak in some sessions when I had spare time.</p><p>There’s one more way <em>Metaphor</em> is like the <em>Persona</em> series: <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/heres-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-beat-metaphor-refantazio#:~:text=How%20Long%20Does%20It%20Take,ll%20add%20even%20more%20playtime.&amp;text=Metaphor%3A%20Refantazio%20is%20a%20lengthy,looking%20to%20mainline%20the%20story.">it’s absolutely massive</a>. But a game that’s dozens of hours long is a lot more manageable when you can play whenever and wherever you want.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
