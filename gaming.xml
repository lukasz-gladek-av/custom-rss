			<p>Today, Techland has confirmed the final PC system requirements for Dying Light: The Beast. The new entry in the popular first-person open world action zombie game was originally scheduled to launch on August 22, but the Polish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a slight delay to September 19 in order to apply more refinements and tweaks.</p>



<p>The requirements are quite a bit higher than those of Techland's previous game, 2022's Dying Light 2: Stay Human, indirectly confirming the upgrade of the underlying Chrome Engine that the developers have been touting.</p>

<p>When it comes to features, the game will support all the latest upscalers from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel, and other features, such as NVIDIA Reflex 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raytraced Global Illumination and Reflections</li>



<li>Ultra-wide resolution support</li>



<li>Upscaler and Frame Generation: Intel XeSS 2, NVIDIA DLSS 4, and AMD FSR 3.1 &amp; 4 (on select devices)</li>



<li>Latency Optimization: NVIDIA Reflex 2, AMD AntiLag 2, and Intel Xe Low Latency</li>



<li>In-depth customization options</li>
</ul>



<p>Interestingly, Techland has released separate Dying Light: The Beast specs for PC laptops.</p>

I guess the simplest way to describe Jitter is that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a>, the hectic spaceship hijacking game from Suspicious Developments, but you are the spaceship, not the hijacker, and also, you can glue pieces of other ships onto yourself, like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/captain-forever">Captain Forever</a>, and also, this looks a bit like Lemmings on the Game Boy. Boil that down, and we have a brand new subgenre, the Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike, which... let's maybe forget I wrote the words "Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike". Let's proceed without further reflection to this video showcasing the combat.

<p>
If the above description confuses and alarms you, there's a cleaner one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877660/Jitter/">the game's Steam page</a>. "Jitter is an immersive sci-fi exploration and survival game set on a mining colony and its outskirts in the Main Asteroid Belt," it reads. "You assume the role of an experimental AI that maintains ship functions and engages with the crew on board. As you explore the mining colony, you will take on new missions, expand ships and bases using various modules, add survivors to your crew, engage in space fights, and repair the damage left by enemy fire and onboard accidents."
</p>
<p>
Cue impressive scenes of your greenish top-down AI core chewing through asteroids like a lemming through a baguette. Shoo, lemming! That's my lunch, not an asteroid, and since when do lemmings eat asteroids, anyway. 
</p>
<p>
No time for lunch, though, because it's time to talk about simulation systems. As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a>, you'll organise the generation and flow of power and oxygen around your craft as you expand it, ensuring that you still, for example, have the means to swiftly fix hull breaches while adding gun turrets to the design. It might sound like it requires a shedload of menus, but the largely mouse-based controls are quite simple for a game of this fiddliness. There's a demo on Steam, if you'd like to try for yourself.
</p><p>
If the idea of playing an AI seems dry, may I draw your attention to the line above about your crew. It consists of named humans with fetching character portraits and bespoke abilities. You'll shepherd them through boarding actions, opening airlocks and tactically clicking rooms to have them survive against greater numbers. Beware: if you lose one of the story-critical ones, it's game over. This seems to rule out the possibility of being an Evil AI, alas, though there's definitely scope for venting the odd humanoid in a fit of cybernetic pique. 
</p>
<p>
I've enjoyed what I've played of Jitter, though it's a bit too processing-intensive for my work laptop, with all manner of physics-enabled celestial body bouncing around the playing field. There's no release date yet, but developers Berko Games posted in June that they're now focussing on "the final major updates before our Early Access release".</p>
<p>Their practical difficulties include living in Ukraine, a country that has been fighting off a Russian invasion for three and a half years. "It's not easy working under drone and missile strikes, but your attention and support should remain focused on the game itself," the developers comment briefly in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2877660/view/541108949283242521?l=english">a recent update</a> about the game's NPC vessel behaviour.

		<p>Fall is here, which means a big moment is approaching: the end of sandal season. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm going to be wearing those things as my primary  non-running transport until there's literal snow on the ground, but I can tell its days are numbers. I've found myself putting on "normal" shoes with some regularity, while the sandals pout in the corner. "It's going to be 68 tomorrow, don't worry." Or "I can't take the kids to school in sandals, friend. Doing so when it's so chilly would be <em>scandalous</em>." The days are also numbered for the above ground pool, though stubbornly I'm using last year's surprise 80s days in September as reason to keep that chilly bad boy filled up.</p><p>-pk, who was somehow not spoiled on <em>Bananza</em>'s fun endgame reveal!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>SUBSCRIBER POD:</strong> A little tease of a three-hour travel pod for next week, which hopefully is a nice incentive to think about becoming a subscriber!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Co-Op Corner (feat: Popucom)</em> – Over time, it's become clear that Chia and I really get a kick out of playing games with one another, especially when we can fuck with each other, too. <em>Popucom</em> really struck us when we played a demo earlier this year, and I gotta admit, last week's stream kinda cemented Popucom as a dark horse game of the year contender.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount has officially acquired the rights to produce a Call of Duty movie. In an announcement on Tuesday, it was said that Paramount will create a live-action film based on the long-running franchise.</p>



<p>The news comes just days after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-seeking-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial rumors began to circulate</a>.</p>



<p>Paramount CEO David Ellison said that, as a “lifelong fan” of Call of Duty, the opportunity for his company to develop a movie on the franchise is a “dream come true”.</p>



<p><strong>“Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on&nbsp;Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve.”</strong></p>



<p>Ellison added that he can “promise” that Paramount will be <strong>“resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy&nbsp;of&nbsp;this one-in-a-million brand.”</strong></p>



<p>Activision President Rob Kostic said that, with Paramount, the studio has found what he believes to be a “fantastic partner” to bring the series to the big screen.</p>



<p><strong>“The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started,”</strong> Kostic said. <strong>“Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans&nbsp;of&nbsp;the franchise.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as who’ll write, direct, and star in the film, that information won’t be revealed for some time. Even a release date is far too off to be announced at this time. </p>



<p>The deal, according to sources at <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, is for just one movie. However, there are opportunities to expand further.</p>

Into the Unjust will see Helldivers venture into subterranean Terminid lairs, hostile territory that cuts troopers off from their usual Super Destroyer support unless they find a gap in the structures. Just what secrets lie behind the mysterious Gloom shroud that has been seen on several Hive Worlds? You'll have to find out for yourself, but at least there's some neat <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/">new armor and weapons you can equip</a> to help you in your fight.</p><p>As for the update, this will include the usual selection of gameplay tweaks, bug fixes, and new content. Hive Worlds with randomly generated cave systems will be introduced here, giving players a chance to discover "disgusting flora and fauna" amidst advanced Terminid species. These planets also feature acid lakes that you don't want to take a swim in, destructible walls in the cave systems, and dark zones where multi-legged horrors will be hiding.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Dust Devils Warbond Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the new gameplay modes will also task you with taking control of a mobile oil rig to siphon the mysterious oily substance from these worlds, and for the new enemy types, developer Arrowhead is teasing four new Terminid breeds. Rupture Spewers can vomit a lethal substance on players, Rupture Warriors hide in the dark away to protect their organs from UV radiation, and Rupture Chargers can burrow through the ground to ambush Helldivers. Finally, Dragonroaches attack from the sky with an acid bombing run.</p><p>For the tweaks and fixes, Arrowhead has resolved the issue with one of the iconic Halo weapons in the ODST Warbond. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halos-assault-rifle-is-causing-helldivers-2-to-crash/1100-6534292/">The MA5C Assault Rifle was causing the game to crash</a> if a party leader had it equipped while on the bridge of their super destroyer, but this has now been patched.

            <p>
A live-action film adaptation of Call of Duty is in the works at Paramount, having signed a deal with Activision Blizzard.
</p>
<p>
Paramount - now under media company Skydance - has announced the news (thanks <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-1236503796/">Deadline</a>), with CEO David Ellison a big fan of the series. Activision will be a creative partner on the film.
</p>
<p>
"As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true," said Ellison. "From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I've spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honour and a responsibility that we don't take lightly."

<p>
The film will follow the studio's 2022 film Top Gun: Maverick. "We're approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve," continued Ellison.
</p>
<p>
"I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honours the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand - thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation."
</p>
<p>
President of Activision Rob Kostich added: "Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering. With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honour and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple - to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise."
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is ripe for a cinematic adaptation, both for its action-packed setpieces and millions of sales.
</p>
<p>
It will follow other game adaptations in recent years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">Nintendo's multiple projects</a>, Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">The Last of Us TV show</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">FromSoftware's massive Elden Ring</a>, classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">Sega racing game OutRun</a>, and horror games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-has-earned-itself-a-movie-adaptation-from-m3gan-and-five-nights-at-freddys-production-company-blumhouse">Phasmophobia</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-the-medium-will-be-adapted-to-film-courtesy-of-it-and-annabelle-writer-producer-gary-dauberman">The Medium</a>.

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14c9629533367/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you somehow missed it, today is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> Eve Eve. Yes, it's a term that I've just made up, but I've been waiting for this one for the past seven years, so you'll have to forgive me for counting down the days as if I'm on the run up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Team Cherry's surprise announcement two weeks ago might have been too short notice to break out the advent calendar for the countdown to <strong>4th September</strong>, but it was plenty long enough for me to start reminiscing over the last seven years of waiting. Because, when I really thought about it, it might be one of the most hilarious-looking development timelines that any studio has managed to muster.</p>
<p>If, like me, you have been following this one for yonks, then Team Cherry's famed updates (or lack of them) will be old news, but with a mere two days to go, I thought it might be fun to take a stroll down memory lane and reminisce about the news beats in Silksong's development cycle that had us all donning our clown makeup and taking to the nearest Direct Live Chat to frantically type "SILKsONG WHEn??"</p>
<p>I've only taken the biggest developments for the following recap — let's forget about how we all lost our minds over every single license update on the Silksong Steam page — but it paints a pretty hilarious picture of how long the Silksong fever has had us on tenterhooks. We might have hung up our multicoloured wigs and put away our red noses, but gosh, we had some good times together, didn't we?</p>
<p>Let's start this quick recap with the most jam-packed year of them all...</p>
<h2>2019</h2>

<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/hollow_knight_silksong_is_coming_to_nintendo_switch_as_a_console_exclusive">Hollow Knight: Silksong is officially revealed</a> - 14th February</strong></h4>
<p>Team Cherry might have given us the best Valentine's Day of 'em all back in 2019 when it officially lifted the lid on Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1095979129432813569">announcement tweet</a> has since pulled in 41 thousand likes, while the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c">reveal trailer</a> has racked up 4.7 million views — hey, seven years of waiting will do that!</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/03/team_cherry_provides_hollow_knight_silksong_update_new_characters_revealed">Team Cherry showcases new Silksong characters</a> - 19th March</strong></h4>
<p>Just one month after the reveal, Team Cherry was back with another update, this time showcasing a handful of the colourful cast of characters we'll meet in the sequel.</p>
<p>We got official descriptions for Lace - "a dangerous foe, cloaked in mystery, who’ll delight at causing Hornet’s swift, skewered demise," Shakra - "a warrior seeking her master, who vanished under strange circumstances", Trobbio - "Master of the Stage, the Brush and the Voice", Sherma - "An optimistic pilgrim on a spiritual journey" and Garmond and Zaza - "A rambunctious older bug and his noble steed, on a quest to discover a new home".</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/team_cherry_shares_more_hollow_knight_silksong_details_will_launch_when_its_ready">Silksong appears at E3's Nintendo Treehouse: Live</a> - 26th June</strong></h4>
<p>Gosh, remember when the updates came this thick and fast?</p>
<p>Hot off the back of a bunch of Silksong gameplay being shown off in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8lvHT_IQbM">Nintendo Treehouse</a> presentation at E3 2019, Team Cherry shared a blog post packed with bonus Silksong details, and our first look at the Greymoor area, which the team described as "one of the biggest" they've ever created.</p>
<h2>2020</h2>

<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/06/team_cherry_discord_riddle_reveals_a_new_hollow_knight_silksong_character">Another Silksong character is officially revealed... via Discord</a> - 17th June</strong></h4>
<p>Team Cherry was all fun and games back in the day, and it kept the Silksong hype going throughout the dark days of 2020 by sharing riddles in the game's Discord channel.</p>
<p>This one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/h9ovt5/oh_god_not_another_one_of_these/">riddle</a> in particular gave us our first look at another NPC, Huntress - "a towering old predator, awaiting her children to come".</p>
<h2>2021</h2>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/random_edge_magazine_is_teasing_a_world_exclusive">Even more details pop up in EDGE Magazine's "World Exclusive"</a> - 2nd January</strong></h4>
<p>After a pretty quiet 2020, Team Cherry spilled the beans on a bunch of Silksong details in a "world exclusive" with EDGE Magazine.</p>
<p>This included info on Hornet's questlines, Crests and 'Tricks', but it didn't include a release date. The wait continued.</p>
<h2>2022</h2>

<h4><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/team-cherry-kind-of-shares-update-about-development-status-of-hollow-knight-silksong"><strong>Team Cherry says Silksong's release "</strong><strong>can’t be too much longer</strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/team-cherry-kind-of-shares-update-about-development-status-of-hollow-knight-silksong">"</a> - 11th May</strong></h4>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong picked up the Unity Award for Most Anticipated Game in 2022, and Team Cherry got us all excited when it announced that the game's release "can't be much longer, surely".</p>
<p>The worst part of all this? We believed it!</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/new-hollow-knight-silksong-trailer-features-in-xbox-showcase-out-in-the-next-12-months">Xbox Games Showcase reveals Silksong will release in "the next 12 months"</a> - 12th June</strong></h4>
<p>Well, this might be the biggest clown meme moment of them all.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong made a surprise appearance in the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase 2022, with Microsoft revealing that the title will be available as a day one Game Pass release, "in the next 12 months". So that puts it as launching at some point before mid-2023, right? <em>Right</em>?</p>
<h2>2023</h2>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/hollow-knight-silksong-no-longer-releasing-in-the-first-half-of-2023">Team Cherry confirms Silksong isn't launching in the first half of 2023</a> - 10th May</strong></h4>
<p>And so we arrive at perhaps the funniest back-to-back developments in the entire timeline. As is turns out, that "next 12 months" release window from Microsoft might have been a <em>little</em> off, with Team Cherry's marketing and publishing rep, Matthew Griffin, taking to <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680">Twitter</a> to reveal that "development is still continuing".</p>
<p>Hey, at least he let us know that we could expect more details "closer to release", so that's... helpful.</p>

<p>As a surefire sign that we were collectively losing our minds at this point, Griffin returned to <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696">Twitter</a> to reveal that, yes, Silksong is a real thing. What's more, he promised that it "will release". <em>That's it</em>.</p>

<p>No, it was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it Silksong appearance in a sizzle reel accompanied by a 2025 release window. It would be coming to Switch 2 at <em>some point</em> this year. News!</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/hollow-knight-silksong-will-launch-on-switch-2-in-2025">Hollow Knight: Silksong "special announcement" finally reveals release date</a> - 21st Augu</strong>st</h4>
<p>We did it! It finally happened! A two-minute gameplay trailer and a brief graphic of mist parting on a 4th September release date was enough to make me, and everyone else in the world, it seems, jump for joy.</p>
<p>I'll remind you again, <em>it's just two days away</em>!</p>

<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/team-cherry-provides-one-last-silksong-update-before-launch">Team Cherry gives one final update for Kickstarter backers</a> - 2nd September</strong></h4>
<p>Okay, one last (?) update before we all get our hands on the damn thing.</p>
<p>Team Cherry provided a final <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/4473863">Kickstarter update</a> for all those who backed the game many moons ago, stating that Switch 2 players will have to download the free upgrade pack from the eShop at launch to "unlock the platform's enhanced features".</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And that's just about it! After seven years of being drip-fed information, Silksong is very, very nearly here.

You can let me know whether you share my excitement in the following poll.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-report</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Ubisoft is currently working on a&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake, that said remake is tentatively scheduled for next year, and that a fourth mainline&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>game is also in development.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a>&nbsp;(who, as per, cites "those familiar with the game's development"), the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake is "tentatively targeting a late 2026 release date", and it's going "incredibly well".</p>

<p>That project is joined by&nbsp;<em>Rayman 4&nbsp;</em>(which almost certainly won't be its final name), which, according to Henderson, is currently in the preliminary planning stages. Henderson's sources apparently say that&nbsp;<em>Rayman 4</em>'s existence will depend on whether the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake does well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-legends.jpg?itok=GvjAqt3Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-legends.jpg?itok=AAqfixo0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rayman Legends&nbsp;</em>remains the most recent full platforming entry in the series.</figcaption></figure><p>Henderson's report is bolstered by the fact that, in celebration of&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>'s 30th anniversary, Ubisoft confirmed yesterday that the franchise is still active, and that teams at the developer's Montpellier and Milan studios are "currently working together" on&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>'s future.</p>

<p>Producer Loic Gounon says that fans shouldn't expect news from Ubisoft on what's in the works for&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>"too soon", but reassures those hopeful for a new&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>game by saying the franchise is "in good hands".</p>

<p>Of course, Gounon's comments don't confirm Henderson's report; for all we know, the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake could be canceled at a moment's notice, especially if recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a> elsewhere in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-remake-canceled-bioshock-4-story-report" rel="nofollow">industry</a> are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to know that&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remains in Ubisoft's thoughts. Let's just hope the studio chooses to revive him in a form marginally less offensive than his appearance in that one <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-rayman" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">really weird NFT game</a> from late last year.</p>

More at eleven.</figcaption></figure><p>As Gounon says, it's likely to be some time before we hear anything more about Ubisoft's plans for&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>, so you'll have to stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the series' latest mainline title,&nbsp;<em>Rayman Legends</em>, is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242550/Rayman_Legends/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-CUSA00069_00-RAYMANLEGENDS001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rayman-legends/C26K4DVGR45B" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rayman-legends-definitive-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (as well as all of those machines' successors thanks to backwards compatibility), and if you haven't played it yet, you really should.</p>

Backbone’s newest gamepad has the same phone-hugging design as its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">2020 predecessor</a>, but comes with a handful of distinct features — the most notable being that it can be paired via Bluetooth to any number of devices, not just phones. The rechargeable controller just got its first temporary price cut, going from $169.99 to $149.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fbackbone-pro-usb-c-mobile-and-wireless-controller-for-cloud-gaming-remote-play-and-mobile-games-on-any-screen-black%2FJ3R84TZYPV" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. Best Buy indicates this sale will expire at the end of the day.</p><p>The Pro features more robust grips and bigger analog sticks (they’re ALPS, not Hall effect, sadly) while retaining the original’s hallmark feature, which is that Android and iPhone models with a USB-C port can be inserted into the controller, from which you can launch into Backbone’s polished dashboard. It effectively turns your phone into a console, with the ability to snap/record clips, chat with friends through the platform, and livestream, if you wish. It also has a USB-C port for passthrough charging, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and two customizable rear paddles.</p><p>The Pro offers more versatility than the original (the Pro is a solid wireless Steam Deck controller), and can perform a cool party trick, if you have the right hardware and subscriptions. If you start an Xbox cloud game streaming session from your phone, you can resume it from a TV that supports the Xbox app, and easily switch the Pro to control it there instead via Backbone’s mobile app.</p><p>While few competitors attempt Backbone’s multipurpose pairing, some outshine the Pro when it comes to being able to fit more devices, namely iPads and other tablets. The <a href="http://amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">GameSir G8 Plus</a> is $79.99 and can fit an iPad mini or a Nintendo Switch.

The B580 is a reasonably priced midrange graphics card aimed at gamers who are content playing games at 1080p resolution, although some games might perform well at 1440p.

My colleague <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/668845/all-trails-gaia-gps-cal-topo-backpacking-review">Elizabeth Lopatto put AllTrails through a real-world test</a>, up against its biggest competitors in the space, Gaia and CalTopo.

These are JBL’s high-end earbuds that include a charging case with a built-in screen on the front. The screen does a decent job at replicating some features that you’d otherwise find on a smartwatch. For instance, it’ll show who’s calling, and let you either answer or reject the call. It can also alert you when you’ve received a text, although it won’t show the contents on its screen (that’s either a plus or a minus, depending on who you ask). In terms of sound quality, former <em>Verge </em>reviewer Chris Welch preferred Apple’s AirPods Pro and Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 to these, but at almost half-price, JBL’s set is worth considering. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23712032/jbl-tour-pro-2-earbuds-smart-case-review">Read our review</a></span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/768973/backbone-pro-bluetooth-gaming-controller-intel-battlefield-6-deal-sale#comments">2<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/768973/backbone-pro-bluetooth-gaming-controller-intel-battlefield-6-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <p>February 1st, 2021. Until yesterday, that was the last time Ubisoft had posted anything on the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rayman-legends">Rayman</a> Tweeter account. That outstanding streak has been broken because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platforming series</a> has turned 30, promting the publisher to reaffirm that a team of devs is still busy working on Rayman's future, with news to come, er, not very soon.</p>
<p>Before you shout at me for writing about a games company posting that, yes, they still plan to make video games in the future, this is also a chance to highlight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGyqe1t_JU&amp;t=2s">Rayman Alive 2025</a>, a pretty hefty community showcase of fan projects helping to keep the aged limbless being's legacy alive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an appearance at the end of that fan-run event, Rayman producer Loic Gounon and composer Christophe Heral did all the thanking you'd expect, while also providing that brief update on Raymond Man's status. "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman," Gounon reaffirmed. "Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>Heral then whipped out a rather delightful banjo and delivered some sweet tuneage while Rayman stood on a plant leaf next to him, blankly staring into the void. Ubisoft added that the likes of exclusive concept art and behind-the-scenes dev interviews will be put out in the coming months.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>👊 🎉Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy 🎂🥳</p><p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p></div>— Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Anyway, this served as the climax of Rayman Alive 2025, which is organised by <a href="https://x.com/VnheardVoices">Vnheard</a>, creator of unofficial Raymanimated series <a href="https://x.com/Rayman_SL">Rayman: Scepter of Leptys</a>. There were cameos from a whole host of Rayfan projects throught the showcase, including Rayman: Origins mod <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/617018">Ales Origins</a>, fan comic <a href="https://x.com/clairiphi/status/1962604349277843650">Rayman Nightmarish</a>, and <a href="https://raymanbeatbox.tonocatmeow.com/">Rayman Legends Beatbox</a>, the latter of which you can fire up in your browser and have Rayman shred some fat bass guitar riffs as you work.</p>
<p>There's a full list of featured projects in the description, and as ever with these sorts of community showcases, there's a chance you'll find something you dig in there. Hey, given how long it might be until Ubisoft do a Rayman tweet again, the Rayfans'll need it.</p>

              <p>Los Angeles’ Anime Expo 2025 describes itself as North America’s “largest celebration of Japanese pop culture.” The 34th such event finished recently, with the four-day spectacular seeing an extraordinary 410,000 people show up, and it even played host to a Sukeban (the Japanse female pro-wrestling league) World Championship Fight. Also, of course, it featured squillions of attendees showing up in some superbly good cosplay. As ever, <em>Kotaku</em> heroes Minerablu were there to capture the very best fits.</p> <p>Given the anime focus, costumes obviously skewed that way, but gaming still got a look-in. Look, it’s not like it’s possible to stop at least&nbsp;<em>one Elden Ring</em> outfit getting into the gallery. (The really shocking thing is that there’s not a single person sporting an outfit from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> in this latest collection!) That does mean we get some superbly original stuff, including the most stunning Derpy from&nbsp;<em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>. I imagine the next few cosplay galleries we post are going to contain a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more characters from that movie as the sewing catches up.</p> <p>So click on for the finest fits from Anime Expo 2025. And check back soon to see a video of the event, too.</p>

<p>Players searching for the Red Dead Redemption 2 companion app on Google Play Store or Apple App Store will find that Rockstar has delisted the application. </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption fans are being greeted with multiple unfortunate updates today. Firstly, the actor for Rains Fall, Graham Greene, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-actor-graham-greene-sadly-passes-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed away at the age of 73</a>. We have now learned that the companion application for RDR2 has been removed after being available for seven years. </p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-s-companion-app-is-no-longer-available-for-new-users">Red Dead Redemption 2’s Companion App is No Longer Available for New Users</h2>



<p>As revealed through Rockstar Games’ support page (via <a href="https://gamerant.com/red-dead-redemption-2-companion-app-taken-down-app-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameRant</a>), the Red Dead Redemption 2 Companion App is no longer being offered on the <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/LHn4jGRxywezllJLdXSjq/unable-to-find-the-red-dead-redemption-2-official-companion-app-on-the-apple-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/6BIENOLOLrjTdQ965aD7G7/unable-to-find-the-red-dead-redemption-2-official-companion-app-on-the-google-play-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Play Store</a> since August 19, 2025. Those who had previously downloaded the application will be able to access it through either their Apple or Google account’s purchase history. Moreover, players who purchased the Red Dead Redemption 2: The Complete Official Guide within the app will be able to access it there.</p>



<p>The Red Dead Redemption 2 companion app was released in 2018. It connected directly to the platform you were playing on and provided real-time interactive information on your smart device. Players could pan and zoom on the map, set waypoints, and mark areas of interest. They were also able to access Arthur Morgan’s core info and stats in real-time. Arthur’s in-game journal, stat tracking through Social Club, a complete digital game manual, plus an optional digital version of the Red Dead Redemption 2 Complete Official Guide from Piggyback, and more were available through the app. </p>



<p>In other news, the Red Dead Redemption 2 actor has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-actor-admits-misleading-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to misleading fans</a> with an ‘exciting news’ comment. Additionally, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-could-launch-on-switch-2-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a> has suggested that RDR2 could launch on Switch 2 this year.

Game Pass is one of the most successful video game subscription services on the market, and that doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon. The service boasts a library of hundreds of games that players immediately gain access to upon becoming a subscriber. However, Game Pass is continually adding more games all the time, growing the library little by little.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're a current Game Pass subscriber or someone interested in subscribing to the service, you'll likely want to know what future games are arriving in the library. As of right now, several games have official release dates for Game Pass, while other games are confirmed for the service but don't have a concrete launch date yet. Below, you can see a list of every upcoming Game Pass title we know of in 2025, 2026, and beyond.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s nothing in this world as cool as a giant robot. The first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/11/daemon-x-machina-review/">Daemon X Machina</a> made that explicably clear. So, it’s something of a surprise to find that Titanic Scion, the brand-new entry in the anime-fuelled mech series, initially swaps out the mechs of the first game and replaces them with Exosuits. It’s suddenly more Anthem than Armoured Core, and while that’s initially something of a disappointment, it makes way for a faster, more immediate combat experience that gives you a ton of customisation options as you set forth on a mission for revenge.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0USA3oKgsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Entering Titanic Scion is entering a war that’s been raging for hundreds of years. Founded in revolution and colonisation, the world of Daemon X Machina saw humanity split itself across two planets, Earth Prime and the ‘blue planet’. A further rift was then caused by an anomaly which saw some people born on the blue planet with special abilities, with society branding them an Outer.</p>


<p>Society’s cruel treatment of them led to an uprising, with the Outers eventually taking control and enacting a strict military regime, separating themselves from the rest of humanity in the Garden, a space station set above the Ground. After years of war and conflict, revolution and response, it’s little surprise to find the humans fighting back under the title of Reclaimers. That’s where you come in, though not in quite the way you expect.</p>
<p>There’s a well-featured character creator here, with a bunch of preset options, male and female body types, and the ability to customise your face with a strong selection to choose from. There’s then three accessory layouts which really give you the choice between having a giant poncho or not, but overall I was very happy with how my hero turned out.</p>


<p>You’re an Outer. The opening sees you being rescued by your teammate Nerve, who pulls you out of a machine that was just about to erase your thoughts and turn you into an unthinking killing machine. In doing so, you’re both now the most wanted traitors in the Garden, and there’s a thoroughly chaotic jaunt through the bowels of the Outers’ station as you attempt to escape while learning the controls.</p>
<p>You do so by hopping into an Arsenal – this time out, a personal mech-suit – which allows you to install and equip various offensive options, from blades and assault rifles to lances and energy shields. Downing enemy Arsenals lets you loot their equipment, but only one, forcing you to make some tough decisions about what to take and what to let go. Fortunately, Titanic Scion gives you a rundown of each item’s stats compared to your own, so you can still make a choice on the fly, even with bullets and explosions filling the air around you.</p>
<p>Looting and tweaking your loadout is key to progressing, and there’s so many things to equip and tinker with that I think people will be able to get their Arsenal feeling and performing exactly the way they want it to. You can carry two weapons per arm, with both offensive and defensive options, and then there’s a shoulder-mounted weapon and auxiliary items.</p>
<p>The new two-handed weapons are brutally slow, but the resulting damage they’re capable of made them an early favourite of mine. Whatever you pick, being able to swap between the different weapons in your loadout on the fly means that you’re able to deal with enemies in whatever way you want or need, as long as you haven’t brought four swords with you.</p>

<p>Locking on is hugely important during battle, as is your radar, and if you don’t keep moving and searching out all the enemies, it’s very easy to become overwhelmed. Combat can feel messy at times, but target indicators help you to find your enemies as you and your teammates tear them apart. There’s multiplayer for up to three players, and you can run through the story together, but only if you’re at the same point. Solo players get to enjoy the assistance of the AI characters, and while they do their bit, it’s not a patch on playing with a group of friends.</p>
<p>After being blasted out of the Garden, you fall to the Ground, discovering that the barren wasteland isn’t completely made up of junk, dust and monsters when you’re rescued by Forge and Toby. Though you’re not totally sold on being helped by a human – turns out people from the Garden are kind of dicks – you’ve little real choice but to follow them, and join up with their Gym.</p>
<p>It’s called a Gym thanks to the Coliseum. Controlled arena battles are held here, with Forge owning what feels like the most backstreet premises in the post-apocalyptic landscape. He convinces you to become one of his fighters – make that his only fighter – and after a short tussle you end up joining up with him and allying yourself with the local freedom fighters known as Reclaimers. It’s fair to say they don’t like you, but they like what you’re capable of.</p>

<p>Returning fans might decry the move to exosuits, and in some ways, it feels like it should reduce the scale of the game. However, that’s tempered by the move to an open world, and you still gain the ability to call down Heavy Armour later in the game. Getting around is so reminiscent of Anthem, especially if you’re blasting around in your suit, but given that I’m one of the few people in the world who still has Anthem installed, that’s a clear positive. You’re not limited to just using your suit either, and you can explore the open world with different vehicles or even alien horses, which weirdly make the game feel more like Dynasty Warriors than Daemon X Machina, as you can charge into battle with a lance.</p>
<p>While enemy suits drop equipment, Immortals, the monstrous creatures you come across on the Ground, drop parts and development opportunities, as well as elements that you can Fuse with your character, intentionally creating mutations in your DNA. You’re going to spend a great deal of time in menus min-maxing your setup. That is right up my alley, but I can see it wearing some people out. There’s a touch of Borderlands to how Titanic Scion’s looting and loadouts feel, but it’s nowhere near as over-the-top with its loot and the different options you have.</p>
<p>There’s such a mix of influences and similarities to other games: Anthem, Armored Core, Xenoblade Chronicles X and Borderlands, but Titanic Scion comes away feeling like its own thing. Running around the open world is an absolute blast, and I love the anime-fuelled visual design and the setting that the team have created. That’s buoyed by the awesome guitar-heavy soundtrack, which adds a healthy dose of adrenaline to everything you do.</p>
<p>Performance on Switch 2 is, annoyingly, merely fine. It runs at a locked 30fps most of the time, though occasional drops happen while driving in one of the vehicles. It feels as though there should be a 60fps option here, especially when the demo’s PC and Steam Deck performance suggest that it should be possible. Here’s hoping that they add in some further graphical options or find a little more performance to achieve it.</p>

                <p>Long gone are the days of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky</a> being billed as a massive disappointment, as not long after its ninth anniversary the game appears to have no problems pulling players back in. Last week the game's latest major update, Voyagers, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-skys-voyagers-update-adds-custom-ship-building-and-more/1100-6534325/">went live</a>, adding in a laundry list of features as the game's updates tend to do. With that, it also seems to have brought in a large influx of players, as the game has hit its highest number of players since launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Hello Games co-founder and No Man's Sky programmer Sean Murray took to X to acknowledge the fact, <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1962598264387108899" rel="nofollow ">sharing a screenshot of the game's concurrent player count</a> at the time of posting. Murray's own screenshot showed 97,986 players all in-game at once, but <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a> actually shows it went a bit higher than that yesterday, reaching 98,285 players. That's still less than half of the game's player count peak of 212,613 it achieved at launch, but an impressive figure considering few games see this kind of resurgence so long after release.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHZLz1MW0aE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Voyagers update was, as usual, a hefty one, with the standout new feature being the addition of a new class of starship, the Corvette.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Huntr/x may be a fictional K-pop group, but Netflix has managed to capture one part of real-world K-pop stardom in its official </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> merchandise: photocards. These little pieces of cardboard usually depict fans’ favorite K-pop idols in anything from professional headshots to candid photos you might find on their camera roll. While Netflix is only now really hitting the merchandise angle hard after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-derpy-artist-kids-all-ages-animation-2000621394"><span>animated musical’s runaway success</span></a><span>, one thing it planned ahead for was that fans might want photocards of their favorite members. I even got one of the lead singer, Rumi, when I saw the film at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>sing-along showings last month</span></a><span>. Now, the film’s soundtrack CD is out, and each disc comes with one random photocard of one of the members sealed inside. And since fans love to collect things, the random photocard inside the album has got people buying multiple copies, reselling, and trading like they’re prized </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards.</span></p> <p><span>Because the photocard is randomized, the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack is basically a blind box. Huntr/x has three members, so there’s a 33 percent pull rate for each card. So it’s entirely possible you could buy three copies of the album and get the same photocard each time, like this TikTok user did:</span></p>   <p><span>That’s how the dice fall sometimes. All these collection crazes are essentially gambling, and while the odds of getting all three Huntr/x photo cards are better than those in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>TCG pull, you can still end up spending a pretty penny on multiple copies of the album trying to complete the set. This has made unboxings a new trend within the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>community, much like you see in most TCG fandoms.&nbsp;</span></p>

         <p><span>Unfortunately, this also means that we’re starting to see resellers </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/226950263213?_skw=kpop+demon+hunters+cd+photocard&amp;itmmeta=01K459CDHAKAXC06RYPMFCKCVQ&amp;hash=item34d74a31ad:g:nEQAAeSw6INos~Fc&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1e00N5FWhjTc9V9pI53JjABq5WC9KmiL4ZgdVBpZUY8teNZwcWWlaL7vBKUzypUdUm1F1n55tsaNWQlkEr6eMb2qB9PLELWiX%2Beb1wk%2FfK4tvlegg3QrdH%2BDTltwkDUUMFH%2BCXYQ%2BnFikC0lzc5LRm5ETHV%2Bd0sLdohWpqEbMOMKJLOGb9Ttw%2B%2BwlpTWgIxzGq2i3jGzKtQimfQu3U6o8rh24%2Bzp3Guisao6hcJMx0Ioyycy%2BsUEdsaimtBaRcOU5tGmaPnlsjQWEHnBLZ3efAF%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_TYsamhZg"><span>upcharging for opened copies that have a confirmed photocard</span></a><span>.

Even as a pretty big fan of the movie and its fictional girl group, I can’t stomach the thought of spending that much to try and complete the set.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During a new interview, Gearbox CEO revealed how Borderlands’ iconic comic-book-inspired art style came to be. </p>



<p>With only 10 days left until Borderlands 4’s release, players have started learning new tidbits of information. Most recently, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-trophies-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete list of trophies and achievements</a> for the game surfaced online. Now, the developers have revealed how they zeroed in on the game’s beloved art style. </p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-devs-started-working-on-a-new-art-style-right-before-the-alpha-milestone">Borderlands Devs Started Working on a New Art Style Right Before the Alpha Milestone</h2>



<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/01/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-the-art-style-swap-that-saved-borderlands-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameInformer</a>, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford discussed how Borderlands’ art style was developed and the numerous hurdles they had to overcome to achieve it. When development began for the original game in 2005, the devs were working on six different art styles, which varied from safe to over-the-top.</p>



<p>At the start, they felt that “it’s kind of got to be realism or there’s just no market opportunity.” However, it “just wasn’t exactly right for what the look and feel and vibe of what Borderlands was supposed to be – it didn’t match the gameplay.” Adam May, the art director for Borderlands 4 and a character modeler for the original game, revealed that when Fallout 3 was released, the developers realised that they were in the “same visual place” as Bethesda’s title.</p>



<h2 id="h-random-doodles-led-to-the-creation-of-borderlands-beloved-art-style">Random Doodles Led to the Creation of Borderlands’ Beloved Art Style</h2>



<p>At that time, May was sitting next to a concept artist for the original game, Scott Kester, who used to doodle “illustrated graffiti” during their free time. One of the characters created in these doodles eventually evolved into Captain Flynt, marking the birth of the iconic Borderlands art style that players know and love. With the help of Kester and executive producer Brian Martel, May transformed these 2D sketches into 3D game art and then pitched to Pitchford. </p>



<p>It was a sticky time for them as the game was on tight deadlines and was about to reach its alpha milestone. At that time, they pitched the idea of working on a brand new art style for Borderlands, and Pitchford miraculously agreed to give them two weeks to work on it. The CEO immediately regretted the decision, as he felt that the idea these guys were working on would have to be rejected, given the time constraints. </p>



<p>After the two weeks had passed, Pitchford entered the room, afraid of the inevitability, but to his surprise, the art team had worked wonders. As soon as he laid eyes on the new art style, he felt “it’s f—ing right; It’s right”. “It feels right. And it’s like everything we knew about what was wrong was confirmed when we felt it was right.”</p>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-the-drawing-board">Going Back to the Drawing Board</h2>



<p>As soon as the new style was finalized, Pitchford knew it would take considerable effort to get it approved by 2K. Surprisingly, after the bit of back and forth, they agreed, and then most of the stuff had to be redone from scratch. The game was in development for several years at that point, and changing the art style meant leaving almost all the levels and characters behind. Only Trash Coast and one other level remained, and the rest was rebuilt. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Borderlands franchise has always prided itself on its multiplayer and inclusivity. The games are still wild rides if you play them by yourself, but let’s see if Borderlands 4 maintains its co-op, split-screen, and crossplay focus for the newest sequel.</p>



<p>I think Gearbox is very excited about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>. Not only did Randy Pitchford bring the game’s release date forward (an unheard-of move), but we raved about it on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive preview</a>, and Randy thinks it can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>!</p>



<p>If you’re excited about Borderlands 4 and want to know if you can play with friends across different platforms, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-borderlands-4">Is There Crossplay in Borderlands 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Borderlands 4 team, assemble. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4 has complete crossplay functionality across every platform the game is launching on.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy Borderlands 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. Pretty much every major multi-platform market box is ticked off for this one. It’s great to see the Nintendo Switch 2 getting involved in third-party conversations, and if you are buying Gearbox’s newest title on Switch 2, you can play it with people on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and vice versa!</p>



<p>As Handsome Jack would say: “Butt Stallion says ‘Hello.” It’s not a relevant quote, but I love it.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-in-split-screen">Can You Play Borderlands 4 In Split-Screen?</h2>



<p><strong>Gearbox has confirmed that Borderlands 4 also has split-screen multiplayer, but it’s more limited compared to general crossplay.</strong></p>



<p>All this information is via the Borderlands 4 <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a>. Under a section discussing the shooter’s co-op options, here’s what it says: “Borderlands 4 supports up to 4-player co-op online across all platforms, as well as <strong>2-player splitscreen couch co-op on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S</strong>.</p>



<p>To reiterate, split-screen gameplay is only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>You’re out of luck if you want to do this on the Nintendo Switch 2 or PC. The FAQ doesn’t explain why this is; the only thing we need to know is that this is the case. End of story. We can lock that answer up in the vault and move on.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-if-borderlands-4-has-cross-progression">Do We Know If Borderlands 4 Has Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>We unfortunately can’t say for certain if Borderlands 4 has cross-progression.</strong></p>



<p>The FAQ covers a variety of topics in great detail. However, one aspect not covered is cross-progression: The ability to transfer your save file across different platforms. Free-to-play live-service games commonly have cross-progression, but for now, we’ll have to put a question mark next to this one until we get clarification.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Borderlands 4’s crossplay inclusions sell you on the game? Is the franchise the perfect multiplayer title? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Also, tell us which new Vault Hunter you have your eyes on.</p>
