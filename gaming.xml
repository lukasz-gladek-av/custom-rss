            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> studio Hazelight has invited two players to Sweden to see its next game after they completed a secret level so challenging, "there are barely people on our team that can make it."
</p>
<p>
Laser Hell, as the level is known, can found toward the end of Split Fiction's Isolation chapter, specifically during the Maximum Security level. In order to access it, players are required to enter the binary code found on a bit of Skotos signage using the elevator floor buttons nearby. With that done and both players in place, the elevator begins its descent into Laser Hell.
</p>
<p>
This rock-hard secret area is essentially a five-stage laser gauntlet, requiring players to navigate its perils and get to the end unscathed. Success, if it ever comes, is rewarded with a video message from Split Fiction director Josef Fares, congratulating the victors on crossing the finishing line. "Wow, amazing," he says. "This challenge, there are barely people on our team that can make it... It took us a lot of time to finish it... This is a crazy, crazy achievement."

<p>
And how do we know about Fares' secret message? That's thanks to the skills of two Chinese content creators, E1uM4y and Sharkov, who <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ExXuYaE7E/">both recorded their journey through Laser Hell</a> for all to see. But it doesn't end there. Fares continued by promising the first pair to complete the secret area would be invited to visit Hazelight for an early look at its next game - and he's now <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068">confirmed he'll be sticking to his work in a post on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Congrats to 'sharkOvO' and 'E1uM4y' for finishing the secret challenge Laser Hell in Split Fiction," he wrote. "VERY impressive! I will keep my promise and invite you both to Sweden for an early look of our next game. We'll be in touch!"
</p>
<p>
As to what that new game is, it's currently being kept firmly under wraps - in large part because it's still very early days. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-_n3vqsAQ">recent conversation with the Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Fares said he was "fully-focused and excited on the next thing that we already have started", confirming it had only been in development for around a month.
</p>
<p>
Whatever it is, it'll be one to keep an eye on. Split Fiction, the follow-up to Hazelight's much-loved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>, launched to massive critical acclaim earlier this month, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">five star review from Eurogamer</a>, where we called it "one of most inventive and joyful co-op games to date". And it's resonated with players too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">shifting over 2m copies since its release</a>.

Their three-minute video showcases not only what a successful run looks like but also the hellish tasks that await inside it. Split Ficition’s Laser Hell level is a gauntlet of demanding platforming challenges that see players dodging up and around a series of laser rooms, but it is doable — and there’s a special video for those who see it through to the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As demonstrated in E1uM4y and Sharkov’s video, reaching the end of Split Fiction’s hardest level rewards Mio and Zoe with a clip recorded by Hazelight’s own Josef Fares. After opening the video with applause, he says he’s “super amazed” by anyone who was able to beat the level while joking that his praise isn’t for “you guys who are looking (at) this on YouTube.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Wow. Amazing. You have to understand, this challenge, there are barely people on our team that can make it,” Fares says in the video. “It took us a lot of time to finish it. I’m telling you; this is a crazy, crazy achievement you have done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a feat worth celebrating indeed, but wait, there’s more! Fares promises that the first pair of players who manage to beat Split Fiction’s Laser Hell level and confirm their success will be flown out to Hazelight in Sweden for an early look at the studio’s next game along with a few “other surprises.” It’s a promise that the director personally followed up on and confirmed in <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Congrats to ”sharkOvO” and ”E1uM4y” for finishing the secret challenge ”Laser Hell” in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/splitficton?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#splitficton</a>.

All you need to do is input a binary code listed under a Skotos label at the location shown, have your partner stand beside you, and you’ll be taken down to a room where you’ll surely spend countless attempts trying to see Fares’ video in person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what exactly Hazelight will be showing E1uM4y and Sharkov, those details remain a mystery. Fares recently shared that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-dev-calls-ea-a-good-partner-as-hazelight-begins-work-on-next-game"><u>the studio has been working on its next project for around a month</u></a> but declined to spill much in terms of its story, name, or release plans. We do know, at least, that the Hazelight team is “very excited” about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction launched earlier this month for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S and quickly became yet another co-op success for the studio. After securing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-sells-one-million-copies-in-48-hours"><u>1 million sales in just 48 hours</u></a>, Mio and Zoe’s story pulled a total of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-hits-2-million-sales-after-just-1-week"><u>2 million in just one week</u></a>. We’ve yet to hear any more information about sales stats, but it sounds like Hazelight is very happy with how Split Fiction has performed so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-scratch-coding-and-discipline-at-the-heart-of-animal-well<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, Chicago-based, solo independent developer Shared Memory, headed up by Billy Basso, released its first game: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Offering a combat-free approach to the exploration platformer genre (also known as a Metroidvania), Animal Well garnered a wealth of acclaim and praise for its highly stylized design ethos. Once the project was complete, its file size clocked in at a microscopic 33MB. Even compared to other independent games at this scale, shipping a game that takes up less than one-tenth of a gigabyte on a hard drive signifies a feat of technical wizardry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Appropriately, Basso hosted a talk titled, “Developing at 5MB per Year: The Making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” at the Game Developers Conference this week. Focused on both the scratch coding he used to code the game and the discipline required to stick with a seven-year project, Basso spilled some of his secrets to making such an impressive—and small—game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, he broke down the tools he used for various parts of the game, saying, “I used Visual Studio for code. That actually covers a lot of development because you don’t really get a level editor when you’re not using Unity or Unreal, so there’s a lot of good data in the game that’s hard-coded in C++ files. I did make my own custom level editor that’s kinda built into the game that can be toggled on and off.” For the sprite and pixel art, he used the program Aseprite for the pixel art, mentioning that he modified the program itself on GitHub after coming up with a bespoke animation format. And for audio production, Basso used Reaper, another common choice for smaller developers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-s-ceo-cto-promise-stability-after-runtime-fee-debacle" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity's CEO, CTO promise 'stability' after runtime fee debacle</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But here is where Basso began to deviate from his peers. Addressing the discipline and workflow side of managing a solo project like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for nearly a decade, he said, “For design and sort of task-tracking production stuff, I would just open up text files in Notepad on my desktop.” The crowd chuckled a little before he followed up, “I wouldn’t even name them or save them. I’d just type things in them and then when all the tasks were complete, I would close and then Windows would warn me ‘You might wanna save.’” This got even more shocked laughs from the packed convention hall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Returning to the development tools he used, Basso demonstrated the various modes of his homebrewed level editor. Using a tool that resembles Super Mario Maker’s level editor, he showed the palette of every sprite and tile in the game, adding “I could just pick one and sort of paint them around. [Designing levels] was just a matter of drawing these sprites and making the screens with all the basic kind of Photoshop-y tools.” Basso described a handful of Photoshop-inspired tools like the eye dropper and paint bucket. He even went into the Photoshop install files and extolled the application’s paint bucket icon because he liked that tool so much.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-technical-magic-behind-doctor-strange-s-portals-in-marvel-rivals" target="_self" data-discover="true">The technical magic behind Doctor Strange's portals in Marvel Rivals</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exactly 256 rooms in ">Exactly 256 rooms in <span>Animal Well</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He used these tools to fit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s world into a 16-by-16-room grid, making exactly 256 separate rooms. Basso said, “I couldn’t create any more because every room had a one-byte ID to it, so it only had 256 possible values.” That was a deliberate choice on his part to avoid any kind of scope creep where possible. Instead, he says he focused on getting the absolute most out of each of the rooms, adding, “I just focused on making every room as dense as possible. It was kind of a fun constraint.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> received glowing praise thanks in no small part to its dense, efficient use of its detailed world map. Cramming the entire map into a one-byte system feels appropriate for a game that was hailed by players for its Swiss watch-like complexity and attention to detail.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Charlie's a Milwaukee-based games, food, travel, and tech reporter with work also featured in the likes of IGN, CNN, NPR, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-lays-off-90-of-project-sigil-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The future is uncertain for Wizards of the Coast's dedicated virtual tabletop platform. It has recently been announced that the tabletop company has laid off 90% of employees working on Project Sigil, their Unreal-powered VTT dedicated to playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Project Sigil Lay-Offs</h2>

<p>Andy Collins made the Project Sigil layoffs public via a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andy-collins-912a953_today-approximately-30-talented-developers-activity-7307907059092443137-SFhR/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn post</a>. The post stated that more than 30 employees, himself included, were laid off from the team. Those employees made up 90% of the team dedicated to Project Sigil. Collins expressed his disappointment but reiterated that there are still people working on the project.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-sigil-town-map.jpg?itok=sR497zHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-sigil-town-map.jpg?itok=UF3Ui36F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A recent report from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/542716/wizards-sigil-vtt-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Polygon</a> corroborated these layoffs. The post includes an email from Dan Rawson, Senior Vice President of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and Hasbro Direct.</p>

<p>The email states that they are scaling back their plans for Project Sigil. It was originally imagined as a large, standalone game with "a distinct monetization path." But since that was deemed untenable, they have scaled back the development team accordingly. Rawson also confirms that the laid off employees will be receiving severance packages, career placement services, and internal opportunities.</p>

<p>The silver lining for consumers is that Sigil will be sticking around as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a> feature. All materials developed for the project will be available at no additional cost to users. This means if you want to make a virtual miniature or your own battlemap using Sigil's software, it is just another tool in your virtual toolbelt. Assuming you have a premium subscription to the platform, of course.</p>

<p>Collins is a long-time employee of Wizards of the Coast. He joined the company in 1996 as an editor and designer in their R&amp;D division. His accolades include the sci-fi setting of Alternity, the d20 <em>Star Wars</em> TTRPG, a <em>Sage Advice</em> author on <em>Dragon Magazine</em>, and the revision team on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 3.5 Edition.</p>

Yet the game still manages to re-create the rich setting of the video game on your table, both mechanically and aesthetically. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your tools in your bid to corner the dystopia underworld are three different unit types and a fun action selection system. Once used, your each action type needs to be refreshed before you can take it again, presenting players with difficult desicions around order and timing. Many actions involve units on the board: Solos are combat figures that secure territory, Techies can supplement your combat forces while also completing missions there to gain points, while Netrunners compete in a taut risk versus reward minigame for bonuses. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Board Game Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The beauty of this system is the way these subsystems dovetail neatly to give you a wide strategic space to explore. Each unit type spearheads an overall approach you can specialize in, or you can mix and match to try and gain an edge. The game is interactive and dynamic and you'll need to read the situation and tailor your tactics accordingly in the tussle for area control. To top it off, there are fine production values to enjoy, with detailed miniatures and a suitably neon-spangled board depicting Night City. And if you get the bug for the game there's a range of expansion content to add in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review">Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City board game review</a>.

"We are not yet the Netflix of Games, but that's exactly where we're heading."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get there, Tascan feels the company must ruffle feathers. The former Epic exec, who replaced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-generative-ai-proponent-mike-verdu-has-departed">outbound Netflix exec Mike Verdu</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in July 2024, suggests the game industry has entered an era of stagnation and is crying out for change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've been in the industry for a long time and we know there have been headwinds, unfortunately. Some of them are of course associated with cost [...] but what I see is also, over the last 10 years, we haven't seen a lot of disruption in terms of format and gameplay," he says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-prioritizing-ai-workflows-enhanced-performance-and-expanded-platform-support-in-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity prioritizing AI workflows, enhanced performance, and expanded platform support in 2025</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While nothing is guaranteed. If we continue doing the same stuff, there is a big chance we'll get the same result. With Netflix and games [we] have an opportunity to drive real disruption and real innovation with regards to how games are distributed, on what platforms, how we interact with them, and how we engage with the community."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To that end, Tascan says the company wants to forge deep connections with players by creating "Only on Netflix" moments. The hope is that a few of those experiences will have debuted by the end of 2025, providing subscribers—all of whom can access the company's game roster at no extra cost—with a taste of what's to come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We want to give people] new ways to play and new ways to experience stories, by trying to blur the lines between linear and interactive. We've been saying that for 30 years [in the game industry] for the old people in the room, but I feel that we are at that point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I say sometimes to the team we have a golden ticket, so what are we going to do with it? I feel like this is a place where we can experiment and do things that hopefully will make history."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tascan believes success for Netflix would benefit the wider industry, helping to create a "blue sky in a place where there are dark clouds."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-m-worried-about-the-death-of-art-what-will-generative-ai-cost-us-in-the-end-" target="_self" data-discover="true">'I'm worried about the death of art:' What will generative AI cost us in the end?</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Netflix Games must prove its worth or risk being viewed as a &quot;distraction&quot;">Netflix Games must prove its worth or risk being viewed as a "distraction"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on how Netflix intends to execute on that vision, Shroff explains the company is taking some cues from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the wildly popular battle royale title is something of paradox, surrounding players with the familiar trappings of shooting mechanics and multiplayer action while simultaneously offering something distinctly 'new' by incorporating metaverse elements in the form of celebrity skins and evolving seasons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That juxtaposition is something Netflix Games hopes to replicate in its own way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You'll see us doing a lot of things that are perhaps a little bit familiar and recognizable, and then there is this idea of then pushing them into the unexpected and getting a little bit uncomfortable. We like to say we're uncomfortably excited," says Shroff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The familiar might be a title that leans on a big recognizable properties like Squid Game or a deal that brings a huge franchise like Grand Theft Auto to Netflix Games. Both of those things have, of course, already materialized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those safer bets might then allow the company to take bigger swings in the form of new IP—such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the cooperative life sim </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/spry-foxs-spirit-crossing-comes-to-netflix-later-this-year">unveiled by internal studio Spry Fox earlier today</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-workers-in-the-us-and-canada-launch-industry-wide-union-to-fight-for-dignity-and-respect-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Game workers in the U.S. and Canada launch industry-wide union to fight for 'dignity and respect'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just want to be really intentional about where we choose to [use IP] and how we do that, and then with the unexpected I think the focus is going to be on innovation," continues Shroff. "We're here to really push the boundaries of what's possible. [...] We want to challenge what you think a game can be."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shroff feels Netflix Games must display that sort of "bullishness" in order to move forward. Part of that drive will also see the company prioritize titles that can be played on the big screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The other focus area is what we're calling party games. We really want to reimagine what social engaging experiences can unfold in the living room," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company wants to explore that market by doubling down on the idea of smartphones as versatile and outlandish conduits of play—enabling Netflix's party game experiences to "spill out into the living room."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With [smartphones] you have a second screen, you have a gyroscope, you have a speaker. You have so many ways to interact—along with the fact that you have information that perhaps is only available to you—so as people are playing there's all this amazing social gameplay that can unfold," adds Shroff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're really looking at pushing the boundaries of what party games—or couch play, as we call it—feels like."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The size and scale of the family market evidently isn't lost on Netflix. Tascan explains Netflix Games is also committed to becoming a "destination for kids," and believes that providing parents with a safe place filled with high-quality games will be a huge boon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains 15 percent of the Netflix subscriber base is already engaging with children's programming, and believes it would be foolish of the company not to think about how its game experiences might serve that audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's evident that Netflix doesn't intend to discount a single portion of its userbase. Tascan explains he wants Netflix Games to reach "hundreds of millions of people," and that means matching the wider ambition of Netflix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says anything less could run the risk of turning Netflix Games into an unwelcome "distraction."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/niantic-says-pokemon-go-location-data-wont-be-given-to-saudi-arabia-government/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Pokémon Go , along with the rest of Niantic’s games business, is soon to be under new ownership after it was sold to Scopely for $3.5 Billion. Now, in a new interview, Niantic—soon to be Scopely—senior product directory Michael Steranka has addressed a number of concerns some players have about the game’s acquisition, including Pokémon Go player location data and who has access to it.</p>



<p>Steranka sat down for an hour-long interview with Pokémon Go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS3HawhQy78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTuber TrainerTips</a> to talk about why the game was sold, what will change, the idea of in-game pop-up adds, and, yes, player location data being shared with the Saudi Arabian government.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Scopely is owned by Savvy Games Group. Savvy is a video game investment company and developer that is backed by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. With the game being sold, some have posted to various social media channels worried about data getting back to the foreign government. Steranka says that players don’t have to worry about it.</p>



<p>“That all stays in the US,” Sternaka said regarding player location data and scanned locations. “It never leaves the country. And it’s not something that ever gets shared up with Savvy or otherwise. In fact, Scopely itself is sort of wholly owned and operated independently as well. So, there’s enough layers of separation there that you can trust all of your data stays within the servers in the United States and also, like I mentioned, we actually scrub all that data and get rid of it after its no longer needed to run the game.”</p>



<p>The scrubbing of the data comes from a revelation earlier in the same interview. Steranka says that “contrary to popular belief”, the company doesn’t store any player data “beyond what’s needed to actually operate the game.”</p>



<p>He added that all of the data will remain “fully encrypted and protected” in the same ways it has since the game first launched in 2016.</p>



<p>The rest of the interview is highly recommended as Steranka talks about how the game will grow after the sale, the level of involvement of The Pokémon Company, Remote Raids, and more.</p>

            <p>
Cult classic 90s point-and-click horror adventure I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is - in a slightly unexpected turn of events - making the jump from PC to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch next Thursday, 27th March, courtesy of Nightdive Studios.
</p>
<p>
As well-read sorts will no doubt immediately recognise, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is based on author Harlan Ellison's influential post-apocalyptic short story of the same name. Its point-and-click adaptation - developed by Cyberdreams and The Dreamers Guild - released in 1996, building on the original narrative using an extensive outline penned by Ellison himself.
</p>
<p>
As in the short story, I Have No Mouth's game adaptation focuses on the last five human survivors of an apocalypse orchestrated by a sadistic AI - all kept alive and tortured by that same artificial intelligence (here voiced by Ellison) for over a century. It follows each character's final trial and the personalised psychological torments inflicted upon them by the computer, each unfolding over its own chapter and playable in any order.

<p>
With freedom perhaps now finally in reach for each captive if they can satisfy the murderous AI's whims, players must confront story shaping moral dilemmas as the trials unfolds. That's alongside the kind of disturbing, provocative horror themes that helped set the game apart from its point-and-click contemporaries back in 1996 - themes that saw I Have No Mouth garner strong critical acclaim on release, despite it ultimately proving to be a comemrcial flop. 
</p>
<p>
I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream's console release is built on remaster specialist Nightdive Studios' earlier PC version, itself well over a decade old at this point. "Over the last couple of years," the studio explains in its announcement, "we've seen a lot of love for the original game and Harlan Ellison's short story across social media platforms... It only felt right that we helped make this title more accessible and further preserve its legacy."
</p>
<p>
And if that appeals, I Have No Mouth will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch when it launches next Thursday, 27th March.

<p>In Forever Skies, players return to Earth as a scientist to discover what caused the loss of humanity’s home and what has changed. Earth has suffered an ecological disaster that forced humans to build massive towers to escape the problems of the surface, but that was not enough leading to an exodus from the planet. As the scientist you will pick through the ruins to find lost technology and repurpose it, as well as find ways to create food, and survive against Earth’s new inhabitants. Players will be living on airship that can be upgraded and customised, acting as the base of operations for the scientist.</p>

		<p>Developer Twirlbound and Saber Interactive have confirmed a release date for the lighthearted action adventure The Knightling, with the date set as August 25th. The Knightling will be available for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch. The game’s story puts players in the shoes of The Knightling, a knight in training, whose mentor Sir Lionstone has disappeared.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukI149d4r9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In The Knightling, players will be tasked with exploring the land of Clessia to find Sir Lionstone, armed with a magical shield to face all dangers. Clessia is a land filled with monsters and bandits that will do what they can to stop you, as well as a load of puzzles that will uncover long lost secrets of the world. All of this will hopefully lead you to find Sir Lionstone, and restore some order to the world.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/the-knightling-is-set-to-be-a-fantastical-shield-bearing-indie-hit/">The Knightling is set to be a fantastical shield-bearing indie hit</a></h2>
<p>In our The Knightling preview, Dom said, <em>“I love the look of The Knightling. It’s clear, it’s characterful and there’s just something adorable about the Knightling’s big eyes and the chunky world. The audio definitely helps with the atmosphere too, from the mumbled words everyone utters to the ebbs and peaks of the orchestral soundtrack. It creates a fantastical world with an economy of design that’s refreshing, but it’s nonetheless utterly beguiling, despite the simplicity. I am massively excited to play more of The Knightling – it’s light-hearted, action packed, and full of character, and a change in pace to the glossy Unreal Engine 5 open worlds elsewhere. This gorgeous landscape is also yours to explore, with&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">a demo available on Steam right now</a>.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/a-grand-unified-theory-of-suits-and-suits-la/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>If you are remaking <em>Suits</em>, as <em>Suits LA </em>is attempting to do to increasingly poor results each week, the first question to answer is: which <em>Suits </em>are you remaking?&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of its run, <em>Suits </em>was many shows. That variety and capacity for reinvention helped it become an unexpectedly beloved streaming hit, but also contributed to an unevenness that likely kept it from becoming <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/07/suits-usa-network-season-three-review.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>a respected TV classic</u></a>. It was a romantic melodrama that never wanted its audience to fear for a second that its central couples would not end up together. It was a slightly grating buddy comedy, where every character was fluent in the movie and TV references from the bro canon. At its worst <em>Suits </em>was like being locked in a fraternity common room during pledge week. It was a silly law drama where corporate and criminal law work much like science and engineering in <em>Star Trek</em>: there was no legal position so dire where a problem could not be solved by a blue folder passed across a table followed by a character saying something like, “Does this mean what I think it does?”</p><p>At its peak, though, <em>Suits </em>was a show about ethics versus ambition, decency versus duty. These tensions were initially embodied by its main character, legal super-mind and fraudulent Harvard grad Mike Ross, and the mentors and foils that surrounded him at his high-powered corporate litigation firm. A poor college flameout who wanted to do good by serving the law, Mike’s idealism was juxtaposed with his mentor Harvey Specter’s ruthless devotion to victory and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZm7NIrmk5s&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">material reward</a>. Mike’s emotional streak was contrasted with Harvey’s mentor and Mike’s boss, Jessica Pearson, who always had to take a more detached view as the head of the firm. Finally, Mike’s poverty and lack of status was contrasted with his sometimes nemesis Louis Litt, whose fawning credentialism and vast insecurity drove his toxic ambition.&nbsp;</p><p>More interesting than those conflicts, however, was one the show never fully reckoned with. Before anything else, <em>Suits </em>was a show about loyalty. And loyalty, <em>Suits </em>demonstrated across nine seasons, is where corruption often begins.</p><p>It’s there from the start: Mike Ross’s life was derailed in part because he gave his loyalty to a bad friend. When Harvey invests in Mike despite the fact Mike never got a law degree, he becomes deeply loyal and attached to Mike, and that increasingly compromises not just him but everyone around him. Forced to choose between exposing Mike or protecting Harvey and the law firm they all work for, slowly every member of the cast becomes party to Mike and Harvey’s lie. By the middle of the show’s run, there were times when you could easily have made the case that everyone involved should be barred from practicing law and maybe half of them should go to jail, and yet <em>Suits </em>was always there making their mutual corruption look high-minded. Character are constantly pledging some version of, “If anyone wants to get to you, they’ll have to go through me, and I’m not backing down from a fight.” Which sounds awesome until you remember that everyone is basically guilty of even worse than what they’re being accused of, and ultimately they want to keep their really nice jobs and their growing personal fortunes.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Harvey Specter and Mike Ross in the first episode of Suits</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a while, <em>Suits </em>presents Mike as someone who is trying to use the law to do good, in contrast to Harvey’s combativeness on behalf of rich and frequently evil clients. But Patrick J. Adams plays Mike with a nasty, childish streak that never quite meshes with his appeals to morality and justice. At time the mask comes off completely, like when he meets a nurses’ union rep at his grandmother’s care facility. To explain why she’s threatening a strike, she shows Mike all the off-the-book extra care nurses give patients like Mike’s grandma… and Mike uses that info to get the nurses in legal jeopardy for breaking care protocols, forcing the union to accept the contract the hospital chain was offering. Unsurprisingly, some members of the audience <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/17grsks/i_really_hated_that_head_nurse/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>were on Mike and Harvey’s side here</u></a>, illustrating the degree to which <em>Suits </em>places its audience on the side of the rich and powerful.</p><p>What makes Mike tolerable as a character is that <em>Harvey</em> loves him, and via Harvey the show treats Mike as a difficult little brother and not a toxic autodidact. That judgment counts for a lot because as the show goes on, despite its original design, <em>Harvey </em>emerged as its moral center.</p><p>The world of <em>Suits </em>is mostly filled with lousy people serving lousy causes, and those people are the ones with the money that give you access to lives of comfort, luxury and excitement. Harvey is an unapologetic sell-out, but what’s compelling about him is watching him negotiate the terms of that sale. It includes his talent and energy as a legal mercenary, but it does not include his integrity or that of the people around him. When the latter move into conflict with the interests of a case or a client, Harvey turns on a dime. And in that framing, Harvey becomes relatable as the kind of boss, coworker, or person that many of us wish we had in our lives, or were ourselves. Someone who places the best parts of his character off-limits from work, from the judgment of others, and from his own ambition. It’s a seductive fantasy: that you can prosper in a fallen world working in service to the devil and yet keep him from your own shoulders.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Real Suitors see this and get excited.</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is not really a tenable moral position and this eventually doomed <em>Suits </em>to a stale formula of meaningless wars of office politics waged between the wealthy retainers of the growing oligarchy. Ultimately the contradiction was resolved with Mike’s exit from the show to go to Seattle to start a very different law practice than he and Harvey worked at. When it was time for <em>Suits </em>to end its run, Harvey and his intrepid secretary-turned-wife Donna left New York to join Mike and his wife, Rachel. They were all going to become wealthy Atticus Finches, just out of frame.</p><p>The show was well into anticlimax by that point, but before it tied everything up in marriage knots, it had produced at least one tremendous season of television and a few great ones. It managed that by asking what integrity meant in a setting where friendships, political alliances, professional obligations, and career goals were constantly reconfiguring themselves and exerting tension in new and interesting directions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Suits LA</em>, after three episodes, is struggling mightily to recapture any of this. In many ways it feels like a continuation of where the show left off in its struggling final season, with a new cast going through the motions of <em>Suits </em>plotlines without any of the history or relationships stakes that made them interesting.</p>

And it currently costs less that $10. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195673" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="11 Minutes Of Saturday Morning Cartoon Roguelike Gameplay" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="694" data-playlist="195673,196307,196539" data-current="195673"><div><p>11 Minutes Of Saturday Morning Cartoon Roguelike Gameplay</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195673/195673_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195673/195673_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195673/195673_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195673/195673_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21182.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mikamobile.com/about/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mikamobile.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developed by tiny indie studio Mika,</a></span> <em>Zombieville USA 3D</em> is a sequel to the studio’s extremely popular <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zombieville-usa/id304871622?platform=ipad&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zombieville-usa/id304871622?platform=ipad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Zombieville </em>and <em>Zombieville 2</em></a></span>, both early mobile game successes released in 2009 and 2011, respectively. Those games were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D and level based</a></span>. <em>Zombieville USA 3D </em>is, as the name implies, in 3D and is much bigger, featuring a large cartoon town overrun with deadly zombies. You start with a single pistol and survive as long as you can while racking up cash. When you die, you return to a hub, have the chance to spend your money to buy permeant upgrades, and then return to the fray. </p><p>It’s a simple formula found in plenty of other roguelike games, and <em>Zombieville USA 3D</em> doesn’t really shake any of this up in a major way. Instead, the small team behind it have focused entirely on making a really, really good version of this kind of game with slick visuals and satisfying action. A big reason the combat feels so good is because of excellent feedback via energetic animations. Everything you do, from walking and running to shooting and hacking or smashing enemies to bits looks great thanks to a slick art style and snappy animations that have a nice bounce to them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the game’s lead developer on Reddit</a></span>, who has mostly worked as a VFX artist and animator, the idea is that these “juicy” and “extra” visuals will help <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> stand out among all the other games on Steam. And, in my case at least, it worked. When I was scrolling through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776">Steam’s Spring Sale</a></span>, I randomly spotted this game in the “Under $10” section and its art and animation immediately made me click to see more. A few hours later I had played a ton of <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> on both my PC and my Steam Deck.</p><p>On Steam Deck I recommend knocking the visual settings down to medium and locking the FPS to 60 to get more battery life and a very stable experience. Once I did that,<em> Zombieville 3D USA </em>played perfectly on Valve’s portable PC. On my desktop PC, though, <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> looks even better with raytracing and high-resolution options.</p><p>Regardless of how you play it, <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is a fantastic little indie zombie shooter that even supports online co-op. It demonstrates that a successful game doesn’t have to be massive or completely reinvent the wheel. Sometimes, all you have to do is perfectly nail a simple gameplay loop and make sure your game looks cool as heck and you’ll end up with something special that catches people’s eyes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is currently available on Steam for $8</a></span>. It’s price will increase to $10 this weekend. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’s the leader of the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE which is trying to save the world from the Shinra megacorporation that is destroying the planet. He’s also a no-nonsense activist known to give a rousing speech or two when the going gets tough. Unlike Sephiroth, he gets right to the heart of what he’s trying to say, doesn’t bloviate about why bad things are actually good, and speaks to real issues with the kinda gusto you need to change the world. If somebody speaks with clarity in favor of the common good, you can probably put it as a caption under Barret’s face and I would believe it to be a genuine screenshot from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="427b5f6e3181cb9dadd4e13a2ef62e45" data-recommend-id="image://427b5f6e3181cb9dadd4e13a2ef62e45" data-format="png" data-width="737" data-height="738" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky post that shows Barret with a speech bubble above a separate post that reads &quot;“I can’t believe they are damaging Elon musks private property”  Why can’t you believe this.

Sephiroth posters, meanwhile, will come looking for you. They just spent 30 minutes coming up with a 300-character diatribe, and they’ll be damned if someone isn’t going to at least be subjected to it long enough for them to hit the block button. But Barret posters, I see you, I hear you, and I know you’re fighting the good fight against these insufferable fucks.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
