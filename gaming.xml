			<p>A team of modders is working to add multiplayer to Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man on PC, and they've got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8e-Q2l_ek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a> to prove it already works. The original game, of course, offered no such feature, and neither did the sequel, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-co-op-mode-teased-by-miles-morales-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-lived rumors</a> and the fact that you do actually collaborate with the other Spider-Man (both Peter Parker and Miles Morales are playable <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the game</a>, and you can swap between them while in the open world), but only as an NPC.</p>
<p>However, Insomniac did at least toy with the idea several times. Back in 2021, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-new-multiplayer-game-pve-melee-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a multiplayer game with PvE (player versus environment) melee combat. That turned out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-leak-spider-gwen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man: The Great Web</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game that leaked as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac's hack</a>. The game would have allowed five players to take the roles of various members of the Spider family, including Spider-Gwen.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Marvel's Spider-Man, though. Modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-remastered-code-includes-co-op-multiplayer-mode-references/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified</a> multiplayer references in the game's code as early as two years ago. There might have been some hooks they're now using in the project. The team has shared the following FAQ on its Discord:</p>
<p><em>When is this mod coming out?</em><br>
<em>No release date as of yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there PVP?</em><br>
<em>No, it currently isn't a feature to fight other players in Multiplayer but it may get looked at in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the Player Limit?</em><br>
<em>The Player Limit in Spider-Man Multiplayer is 16 players.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a mod for MSM1 or MSM2?</em><br>
<em>This is a mod for MSM1, however we will look into porting to MSM2 once it releases.</em></p>
<p><em>Does the main story work?</em><br>
<em>Some main story missions do work but we're working on free roam content currently and will look into main story more at a later date.</em></p>
<p><em>Do mods work?</em><br>
<em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Can my friends see my mods?</em><br>
<em>Friends can see your suit mods so long as you both have the same suit mods installed. If you don't then the person who doesn't have the suit mod installed will not be able to see the person with the suit. Additionally if you use animation mods it's better for all players to have it installed.</em></p>
<p><em>How long has this mod been under development?</em><br>
<em>This mod has been in development since August 2024.</em></p>
<p><em>How does connecting to players work?</em><br>
<em>You create a lobby, and then other players can either join via a Steam invite or you can add the host's IP and join that way.</em></p>
<p><em>What platforms are supported?</em><br>
<em>Steam and Epic Games Store versions are the supported Marvel's Spider-Man copies in which multiplayer will work.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Spider-Man Multiplayer Trailer (Mod)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nu8e-Q2l_ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, there's many ways this could go wrong. Mod teams blow up all the time, either due to insurmountable technical hurdles, internal drama, or just plain old real life commitments (they're not professionals, after all). Sony could also kick the Marvel's Spider-Man multiplayer mod to the curb to prevent it from being released. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did it</a> for the Breath of the Wild mod, effectively killing it.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of instances where this actually worked<span><span>—more or less.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-together-reborn-co-op-mod-is-finally-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyrim Together</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sekiro-online-mod-pvp-coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sekiro multiplayer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wccftech.com/just-cause-3-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Cause 3 multiplayer</a> are some of the most famous examples of multiplayer mods successfully added to single-player only games</span>.</span> Another interesting project to keep track of is '<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberMP</a>,' which plans to introduce multiplayer to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

			<p>While 2024 didn't see the release of new entries in staple franchises like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, the past 12 months were still very good for action games fans thanks to the release of a variety of very solid games coming from both veterans of the genre and newcomers that left more than a few players surprised with the high level of competence shown in their debut titles, so high that it is almost difficult to tell that they haven't been developed by studios with more experience in the action games genre.</p>
<p>Here are the five best action games released in 2024 on PC and consoles, alongside a few other games that, while not as good as the best five, definitely deserve to be mentioned for their quality and for what they brought to the genre as a whole.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>
<h2>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Prince-of-Persia-The-Lost-Crown-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Prince of Persia series has always been at the forefront of the action games genre, but for a very long time, the series has been away from the spotlight. The long-dormant franchise, however, was finally brought back this year with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and what a way to come back it is. Returning to the roots of the series, the game developed by Ubisoft Montpelier is an amazing Metroidvania game featuring an engaging story and extremely solid gameplay mechanics that make it not only one of the best action games released in the past few years but also one of the best Metroidvania games ever released. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action games features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Blade (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Stellar_Blade-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like with Black Myth Wukong, the hype surrounding Stellar Blade was definitely bigger than what one may have expected for a debut title of a developer who had released only mobile games up until this point, but in the end, like for Game Science's first game, Korean studio Shift Up proved they had what it takes to make a compelling action game. While the over-sexualized character design may be offputting for some players, there's no denying that the Korean developers knew what they were doing, enriching the obvious inspiration from Yoko Taro's NieR series with some light RPG and Soulslike mechanics that make the game a joy to both look at and play. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review.</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<h2>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hellblade-II.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninja Theory released quite a few games over the course of the years, but none managed to become commercial successes, except for Hellblade: Senua's Saga, a narrative-focused game that offered solid action combat in the vein of the previous titles developed by the studio. With Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Ninja Theory doubled down on everything that made the original game so unique, keeping the oppressive atmosphere and combat system and turning it up to eleven with one of the most impressive visual showcases of the generation powered by Unreal Engine 5. A remarkable game that is definitely not for everyone, but one that is worth experiencing for those looking for an extremely immersive experience. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</em></p>
<h2>Black Myth Wukong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">8.5</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/black-myth-wukong-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Right from its out-of-the-blue announcement in late 2020, it was clear how Black Myth Wukong was going to be an extremely popular game, as the trailer showcasing the pre-alpha build reached 2 million views on YouTube and over 10 million views on Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili in just 24 hours. Being the very first PC and console game by an unproven developer, however, there was the chance that all the hype could have been for nothing, but Game Science proved detractors wrong by releasing a solid action game inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. While being based on the popular Journey to the West novel may have contributed to the game's huge popularity, especially in China, Black Myth Wukong is definitely a game that fans of the genre should experience, even if it doesn't exactly attempt to break the mold to offer anything innovative. Here's what I had to say in my review:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>
<h2>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dead Rising is among the many CAPCOM series that were put to the side following the disappointing performance on the market of their latest entry, but the Japanese publisher has been showing over the past few months that it is finally willing to bring some of these franchises back to their former glory. In this regard, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster couldn't have brought back Frank West's iconic first adventure in a better way, as exploring Willamette Parkview Mall and killing zombies with all sorts of makeshift weapons has never been so much fun.</p>
<p>While the basic experience feels a little dated, and the visual remaster leaves something to be desired in some ways, the quality-of-life improvements make this remaster-meets-remake a game that is worthy of experiencing both for veterans of the franchise and newcomers. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a solid remaster that enhances the original game with some welcome gameplay and quality-of-life improvements that go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable than ever. However, the remaster falters in the visual department, with dull colors that pale in comparison to the vibrant visuals of the original. Still, there's plenty to like in the Deluxe Remaster, as Frank West's journey to Willamette remains as engaging as ever, though the mostly faithful recreation of the original gameplay feels a little dated compared to its sequels.</em></p>

The 2001 Dreamcast game introduced a new brooding antihero in Shadow the Hedgehog, and expanded the <em>Sonic </em>mythos into some dark territory. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t a one-to-one retelling of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, however. After two movies and a TV show, the live-action series has its own established lore, so the third film makes some pretty big changes to the original storyline while still keeping the darker tone and themes of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>intact. Well, when it’s not doing the corny dance breaks and cheesy one-liners, at least. If you’ve never played <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, you might be curious just what was changed for the big screen, so here are a few of the major differences between <em>Sonic 3 </em>and <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Spoilers ahead!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-recommend-id="image://65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-recommend-id="image://65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The most glaring difference between <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>and <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>is the absence of Rouge the Bat. The Dreamcast game had two dueling stories: Hero and Dark. The Hero story followed Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles as they attempted to thwart Eggman’s latest plan to rule the world, while the Dark side followed Eggman’s story alongside those of two new companions: the Ultimate Lifeform Shadow the Hedgehog, and a double agent government spy named Rouge the Bat. Rouge has yet to appear in the live-action universe, but she acts as Knuckles’ rival and Shadow’s teammate in the video game continuity. Elements of her story in <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>still exist in <em>Sonic 3</em>, with the heist segment in the second act an obvious stand-in for her level Security Hall, but there’s no sign of the treasure hunter in the movie itself.</p><p>There have been reports that Paramount plans to give Shadow his own spin-off, and since Rouge didn’t show up in the movie based on her debut game, this would be the most logical place for her to appear next.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-recommend-id="image://5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-recommend-id="image://5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The <em>Sonic </em>movies have established that the speedy anthropomorphic animals saving the world are aliens from other planets. It was eventually revealed in <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em> that Shadow has some alien DNA in him in the games, but he was initially presented as a creation made by humans when he debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure 2. Sonic 3</em> fully commits to the alien backstory, revealing that he was found 50 years before the events of the film when a mysterious meteor landed on Earth. The GUN forces who investigated found Shadow inside and began running experiments on him in a hidden facility on Earth, rather than the Space Colony Ark orbiting the planet seen in the games.</p><p>Shadow’s backstory in the games is a bit more complicated, to the point where I’m not surprised they simplified it for the film’s shorter run time. In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Shadow is revealed as an invention by Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather. The hedgehog was meant to be the Ultimate Lifeform, capable of unlocking the key to immortality. In <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, it’s revealed that, in desperation, Gerald made a deal with an alien despot called Black Doom, who used his own DNA to help the professor finalize Shadow’s creation. In return for Black Doom’s help, Shadow would assist the Black Arms alien invaders take over the world. Shadow doesn’t know where he came from in <em>Sonic 3</em>, so it’s still possible that the Black Arms will play a role in a future film as his origins are revealed, but Gerald Robotnik didn’t create him in this continuity; he merely led the project that researched him after he fell to Earth. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-recommend-id="image://9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-recommend-id="image://9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the games, Gerald was deeply invested in finding the key to immortality because his granddaughter, Maria Robotnik, had a terminal illness called Neuro-Immune Deficiency Syndrome. This led to the creation of Shadow and his prototype called the Biolizard, immortal creatures made with the hope that they could help facilitate similar breakthroughs for humanity. However, Maria seems to be a perfectly healthy kid in <em>Sonic 3</em>. I suppose, since Gerald isn’t creating Shadow in this timeline, there was no need to include her sickness as a motivator for his research. The sibling-like relationship between Maria and Shadow still hits many of the same notes, however. In both continuities, the two become inseparable friends that bond even as Shadow is being subject to experiments every day. Eventually, Maria’s death at the hands of GUN agents leads Shadow to try to destroy the world in both the games and the movies, but she lived her life as a healthy young girl in the films.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-recommend-id="image://b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-recommend-id="image://b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though Maria <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">does reach a tragic end</a></span> in <em>Sonic 3</em>, her death is slightly different than it is in the source material. In most versions of the story, whether that be the games, anime, or comics, Maria is shot by GUN agents. In the live-action universe, Maria is nearly shot as she and Shadow attempt to make their escape after GUN shuts down the project and puts Shadow into stasis. However, the GUN agent that had her in his sights is interrupted by Commander Walters, who gets into a scrap with the shooter, leading to a shot being fired into a tank containing deposits of Shadow’s Chaos energy, setting off an explosion that results in Maria’s death. I imagine Paramount didn’t want to put a scene of a child being shot by the military in its widely distributed feature film, though elements of the original scene remain, as her death was still caused by GUN shutting down the project and attempting to eliminate loose ends.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-recommend-id="image://8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-recommend-id="image://8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jim Carrey plays two Robotniks in <em>Sonic 3</em>. The eccentric mad scientist Ivo “Eggman” Robotnik who he’s played in every movie thus far, and his grandfather Gerald Robotnik. In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Gerald was long dead and had brainwashed Shadow to carry out his revenge-fueled plan to destroy the world in his absence. The movie version of Gerald is still alive, and able to manipulate Shadow and his grandson into doing his bidding. Eggman has gone his whole life without family, so he’s more than happy to help out his grandfather to make up for lost time, and Shadow’s grief for Maria is so strong, he’ll do anything if he’s told it will be in her honor.</p><p>Gerald dies at the end of the movie, though it’s in a much different way than he dies in the games. Eggman kills Gerald in a frankly anticlimactic fight inside the Eclipse Cannon space station, where in the games he’s killed by a firing squad after his descent into madness.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-recommend-id="image://ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1041" data-height="586" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-recommend-id="image://ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1041" data-height="586" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rouge is one big character who doesn’t appear in the film’s main story, but there’s another key player who doesn’t show up when they do in the games: Amy Rose. The pink hammer-wielding hedgehog shows up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285">in the post-credits scene</a></span>, but in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, she tagged along with Sonic’s crew, and was eventually the person who reminded Shadow of his true memories of Maria, rather than the distorted ones Gerald gave him to carry on his revenge plot. Since Amy’s not around and Shadow isn’t brainwashed, his turn from villain to hero comes from a different source: Sonic. After the two enter their super forms and beat each other senseless, Sonic comes to his senses and has a heart-to-heart with his rival about the futile nature of revenge, eventually reminding Shadow that even if Maria is gone, his love for her still lives on, leading to the sick as hell team-up as the hedgehogs save the day.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-recommend-id="image://9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2068" data-height="1159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-recommend-id="image://9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2068" data-height="1159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Eggman and Shadow use the Eclipse Cannon, a superweapon developed by Gerald Robotnik, to destroy part of the moon. This is meant as a show of power to make the people of Earth surrender to Eggman’s rule. In <em>Sonic 3</em>, however, our heroes divert its aim away from Earth, so instead of a direct hit on the moon, the cannon slices off the southern end. It looks like the world is just gonna let it stay that way, too, as you can see the severed section hanging out in the moon’s orbit in the post-credits scene.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-recommend-id="image://bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-recommend-id="image://bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In the final few minutes of the film, Sonic and Shadow team up, use the Master Emerald to take on their super forms, and save the world from cataclysmic destruction. This also occurs in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but while the movies have the two face an army of Gerald’s robots, the speedy hedgehogs fight something else as a final boss in the game. As a last-ditch effort to destroy the world, The Biolizard, the prototype for the Ultimate Lifeform, fuses with the Space Colony Ark and attempts to keep it on a collision course toward the planet. The Biolizard isn’t mentioned in the movie and seemingly doesn’t exist in the film universe, so while the final battle still has most of the elements that matter, our heroes are squarely focused on fighting Gerald in the climax. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-recommend-id="image://f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-recommend-id="image://f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After our heroes divert the Eclipse Cannon from Earth, the facility becomes unstable and self-destructs. To prevent the explosion from contaminating Earth’s atmosphere, Eggman and Shadow sacrifice themselves to move it away from the planet. Shadow was presumed dead at the end of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but was revealed to have survived in <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. Eggman, meanwhile, survives the events of the Dreamcast game and lives to bother Sonic and his friends another day. If Carrey’s version of the series villain is well and truly dead (there’s no tease of his survival like there was at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>), then that’ll be one of the biggest deviations <em>Sonic 3 </em>makes from the source material.</p><p>It’s still unclear how the movies will go on without him, but given the sendoff the character got, it would feel cheap to bring him back. We’ll know more when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 </em>premieres in 2027</a></span>. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the smooth always comes with the rough, and the past year really has been a rocky one for the things we love and the people who make them.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From layoffs and studio closures to costly consoles, underwhelming adaptations and struggling sequels, these are the biggest disappointments in 2024. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gaming Industry Layoffs and Closures</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The games industry found itself facing a crisis in 2023 as many publishers and studios, both large and small, made scores of staff redundant in an effort to cut costs.

A PvP hero shooter, its long and costly development meant it arrived long after the genre had peaked in popularity. But, despite being developed by many FPS veterans hailing from the likes of Bungie and Activision, what could have been PlayStation’s next big multiplayer phenomenon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">struggled to stand out from the likes of Overwatch and Apex Legends</a> thanks to its lacklustre character kits and standard fare objective design. From the outside Concord simply looked like another typical hero shooter, which meant few wanted to see what was going on inside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not an exaggeration to say that almost no one turned up for its August release – it achieved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam">a high of just 697 concurrent players on Steam</a> during its first week. Less than two weeks later, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">Sony pulled Concord from sale</a>, refunded players, and shut the game down. By the end of October, Firewalk Studios was closed for business. It all sadly means Concord is gone without a trace. Well, almost – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-ill-fated-concord-animation-shows-potential-of-this-world-and-characters-creator-says">an episode of Amazon’s Secret Level</a> animated series serves as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-secret-level-episode-explained#episode-13-concord">a prequel</a> to the ongoing Concord in-game story that never happened.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A similar, thankfully less tragic story also happened earlier this year with Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. After months of poorly-received marketing, Sucide Squad launched as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">critical </a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">commercial bomb</a>. As with Concord, much of Kill The Justice League’s failings were due to chasing trends that players have long since largely tired of – in this case, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2024-is-the-year-live-service-shooter-trends-need-to-die">Destiny-style live-service shooter grind</a>. It didn’t help that Suicide Squad resembled Crystal Dynamics’ ill-fated Avengers game from a few years back, which similarly annoyed players for being a repetitive multiplayer PvE game. In Suicide Squad’s case, it was a shattering fall from grace for a studio that previously made beloved single-player Batman games. Many of us just wanted more of that best-in-class superhero action with a villainous twist, but sadly Warner Bros’ chase of live-service revenue seemingly got in the way. Not that it paid off - an initial lack of sales and dwindling players has contributed to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">significant revenue decline</a> for the company.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hardware Hiccups</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/ps5-pro-1728648448665.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">PlayStation 5 Pro</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The time-compressing effect of the pandemic years has disguised the fact that, yes, we’re already at the midpoint of the current console generation. Right on cue, Sony delivered its mid-cycle refresh PlayStation 5 Pro, and it’s safe to say that practically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/polls-ps5-pro-price-reveal">no one was pleased by its $700 price tag</a>. That’s not just down to the cost of living squeezing everyone’s wallets – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ps5-pro-reveal-full-technical-presentation">Mark Cerny’s presentation</a> that apparently showcased the console’s ability to render The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered so much better than the base console was basically the “They’re the same picture” meme from The Office in action. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s definitely time for the PS5 Pro to prove why it costs $200 more than the regular PS5, the initial results have been pretty disappointing. Rather than eliminate the need to decide between quality and performance modes, developers have added even more options to Pro-patched games, with confusing names such as ‘Fidelity Pro’ and ‘Versatility’. Remember when you just plugged in a console and it worked? Halcyon days. Plus, all the Pro’s extra power can’t even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">make Bloodborne look any better</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least Sony fans got a console, though. After months of rumours that Nintendo was due to announce its successor to the Switch, the company announced a brand new piece of hardware: an alarm clock. Yes, the Alarmo is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-switch-2-nintendo-just-released-a-100-interactive-alarm-clock-called-alarmo">a $100 clock with game-themed alarms</a> and a motion sensor that can detect when you’ve got out of bed. It’s hardly the Switch 2 we were hoping for. And even when it comes to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">Nintendo’s history of weird hardware</a>, Alarmo is far from the most interesting or bizarre. A true disappointment from the house of Mario.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Unreliable Reliables</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/acolyte-ep-4-blogroll-1718749369038.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: The Acolyte</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over in the realm of television, things have largely been bright thanks to the likes of Arcane, Shogun, and Fallout. But 2024 also saw some traditionally reliable shows struggle to maintain their quality. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-bear-season-3-review">Season 3 of The Bear certainly wasn’t bad</a> – it once again provided some solid character drama and beautifully-shot kitchen nightmares. But, compared to the incredible highs of the first two seasons, this third chapter fell significantly short. Its frustratingly slow pace clashed with the lightning speed of previous years, and the focus being almost entirely on Carmy’s inner crisis forced valuable characters like Sydney into the sidelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, we saw this year’s Star Wars project struggle to hit the highs of The Mandalorian and Andor. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-acolyte-season-1-review-disney-plus">The Acolyte</a> was built on a fascinating premise that delved into the galaxy’s past, exploring the late High Republic era. It was packed with Jedi and featured one of the coolest lightsaber battles in the entire franchise, but even that couldn’t save the series from its sloppy and often infuriating storytelling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Acolyte’s saving grace could have been Manny Jacinto’s Sith lord The Stranger, who sports one of the most menacing helmets in all of Star Wars. But while deeper exploration of his character could have resulted in a much-improved season two, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-acolyte-wont-be-renewed-for-a-second-season-on-disney-plus">we’ll never get to see that</a> thanks to Disney axing the show entirely. This isn’t just a Disney problem – Netflix has also continued its habit of cancelling shows after barely giving them a chance to realise their full potential. 2024’s Netflix cull included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jeff-goldblum-netflix-series-kaos-cancelled-after-one-season">Kaos</a> and Dead Boy Detectives, which join last year’s Lockwood &amp; Co in the “cancelled after a single season” club. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Awful Adaptations</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/yakuzadragon-thumb-1727718807880.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Like a Dragon: Yakuza</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s Fallout was a stellar exercise of how to adapt a video game for television, with Amazon’s wasteland show being among our TV highlights of 2024. But it seems like Fallout’s success isn’t a guaranteed indicator that every Amazon video game show will be fantastic, as proven by the dreadful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video">Like a Dragon: Yakuza show</a> that landed on the service several months later. Featuring no karaoke, far too little Majima, and far too much melodrama, Like a Dragon totally failed to capture the stark contrast between serious and silly that the Yakuza games thrive on.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t just Japanese RPGs that were treated poorly for TV this year, though. Famed Japanese manga Uzumaki also received its long-awaited animated adaptation, and the results <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uzumaki-full-series-review-adult-swim">couldn’t have gone any worse</a>. The four-part Adult Swim show turned Junji Ito’s monochrome horror into a rushed mess that sprinted to the finale, undermining plot points, character arcs, and scares on the way. The biggest disappointment, though, was the severe drop in animation quality following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uzumaki-review-adult-swim">visually rich episode one</a>. Uzumaki transformed from beautifully chilling into a low-budget nightmare in the space of a week – it was a rug-pull scarier than anything Junji Ito could write.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Box Office Bombs</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/borderlands-movie-criticism-uwe-boll-1723718855132.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Borderlands</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, terrible adaptations weren’t limited to the small screen. One of the biggest box office bombs of the year came in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black">Borderlands</a>. Gearbox’s wacky looter shooter was transformed into a hideously miscast Guardians of the Galaxy rip-off for its live-action big screen adventure. Many of the games’ best-know qualities, such as its sweary sense of humour and love of turning humans into piles of goopy gore, were toned down to the point of vanishing completely. The result was bland, recycled MCU-ish ideas geared toward mass marketability. In short: a complete disaster. Unsurprisingly it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disastrous-borderlands-movie-ends-its-theater-run-with-just-31-million">died an unceremonious death</a> when it launched in cinemas – with Lionsgate’s CEO saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lionsgate-ceo-on-borderlands-movie-nearly-everything-that-could-go-wrong-did-go-wrong">“nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s arguable that an FPS like Borderlands was never going to survive the transition to cinema. A sequel to the most profitable comic book movie of all time and the first R-rated film to pass a billion-dollars at the box office, though? Surely a second Joker was going to be an easy win. Not so much. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-folie-deux-review-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-todd-phillips">Joker: Folie à Deux turned out to be a miserably dull follow-up</a>, with director Todd Phillips undoing almost all the good he established in the first film. When not even Lady Gaga can save your kinda-sorta musical from its snoozefest courtroom drama scenes, you know you’re in trouble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the classic-mould movie buff, though, almost certainly the biggest disappointment of the year is Megalopolis. The years-in-the-making, self-financed magnum-opus from The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola was (perhaps, if we’re honest, somewhat predictably) an indulgent catastrophe. Some people have seen method in the madness (including our own reviewer, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/megalopolis-review-francis-ford-coppola-adam-driver">gave it a 9/10</a>) but for many this opulent fable set in a futuristic, Rome-like New York City was a bloated, pretentious, dull mess. Quite how the creator of the quintessential Mafia movie got here may prove to be one of the universe’s greatest mysteries.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From studio closures to box office catastrophes, 2024 has had some real low points. It’s hard to find a silver lining in some of them, and we continue to hope that the industries that make our favourite things will turn a better corner in 2025. But in other instances it’s the downs that make the ups shine brightly – and you can find many of those bright stars in our roundup of the best reviewed games of 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Somehow, over 25 years of Halo content has leaked online, showing off some of the classic designs of the game before it was even released. The leaked content seems to have originated from a <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-co-developer-certain-affinity-was-acquired-by-keywords/">Halo Studios</a> collaboration<a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1872256501982839002%7Ctwgr%5Ec6b6f375408eaad6b9e74c85bc73019a4ea93aac%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fover-25-years-of-classic-halo-content-has-leaked-online%2F"> with modders</a> who are fans of the franchise, where they aimed to restore cut content from previous Halo titles. This included the Halo 2 E3 2003 demo, which was released last month. The demo that was showcased at E3 2003 is available on the Steam Workshop after being added on November 9 as a mod for Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</p>
<p>The mod team has been working alongside Halo Studios since last summer to restore content from the games that never made it to the final cut. This includes multiplayer maps that were specifically designed for the PC port of Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>
<p>There is a lot of content to sift through, and Halo fans are going to have a field day with the content that is now available, thanks to the modders from Digsite. One of the most significant pieces of Halo content that has resurged, thanks to their efforts, is the Macworld demo from 1999. It was supposedly meant to be restored for Halo: The Master Chief Collection, but that didn't happen. This demo shows that Halo was originally meant to be a third-person exclusive title for Mac, but it eventually shifted perspectives and ended up going to Xbox instead.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that the content that has leaked online is legitimate, but a former member of Digsite said that none of the current or former members of the team are responsible. There is over 100 GB of content for Halo fans to explore, even though it's uncertain at the moment who even leaked the content in the first place, as it's been confirmed that no one from Digsite would do so.</p>
<p>Additionally, a significant amount of members from the Digsite team have quit the project as there has been a dispute over the team doing the work for free and that they haven't been given sufficient pay or resources to continue working on such a hefty project.</p>
<p>Lots of <a href="https://x.com/BajatomicBlast/status/1872350986280558818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1872350986280558818%7Ctwgr%5E432819c51648dcc4b0d99ffec9d1c81373e28c4c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fover-25-years-of-classic-halo-content-has-leaked-online%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments</a> from the team at Digsite can be found on social media, especially X. They have spoken about how the Halo E3 demo was reportedly more important than anything else they worked on, but they are still not getting paid for their efforts.</p>

                <p>It's been hard to keep up with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-vr-games/2900-5339/">VR games</a> in 2024, and that's a good thing. The Batman Arkham series got a great new entry, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-arkham-shadow-review-i-am-batman/1900-6418308/">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>, exclusively on Meta Quest 3. Metro Awakening introduced itself as a VR rendition that acts as a prequel to the Metro series, while Skydance's Behemoth is betting on dark fantasy, building upon the ideas of the underrated The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners games. The psychedelic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/thumper-review/1900-6416533/">Thumper</a> got a spiritual successor with Thrasher, and there's even been a quality remake of an old VR game, Arizona Sunshine, after a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arizona-sunshine-2-review-the-walking-shred/1900-6418163/">sequel</a> in 2023.</p><p>From the outside, VR seems to be going through a pivotal period. If you look at 2023, the space was already gearing up for this momentum with Asgard's Wrath 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-nexus-successfully-translates-acs-earliest-adventures-into-first-person/1100-6518430/">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a>, and the VR version of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/">Resident Evil 4 remake</a> releasing in the latter half of the year. But these are all big bets considering that the space remains a niche market; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66980483" rel="nofollow ">motion sickness</a> continues to be one of multiple issues. Though some games have been better at offering more accessibility options, the platform is far from suitable for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/virtual-reality-accessibility-disabilities/" rel="nofollow ">disabled players</a>.</p><p>While game releases have been a highlight, the same can't be said for the companies behind them and the headsets themselves. Sony reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pauses-playstation-vr2-production-to-clear-backlog-of-unsold-units" rel="nofollow ">paused production</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-review-running-in-place/1100-6511528/">PSVR 2</a> in March to clear a surplus backlog of units, and PlayStation London Studio (which was behind the likes of Blood &amp; Truth and PlayStation VR Worlds) was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24084509/playstation-layoff-900-workers-feb-2024" rel="nofollow ">shut down</a> in May. Meanwhile, Meta <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-laying-off-workers-within-reality-labs-division" rel="nofollow ">laid off</a> workers within the Reality Labs division; shut down <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216240/meta-ready-at-dawn-echo-vr-shutdown" rel="nofollow ">multiple games</a> since last year, as well as the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216240/meta-ready-at-dawn-echo-vr-shutdown" rel="nofollow ">Echo VR</a>, which the company acquired four years ago; canceled plans for an Apple Vision Pro <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/meta-reportedly-cancels-plans-for-high-end-mixed-reality-headset/">competitor</a>; closed down the augmented reality studio <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-will-shut-down-augmented-reality-studio-spark-angering-creators-2024-8" rel="nofollow ">Spark</a>; and put the VR version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on hold <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-san-andreas-meta-vr-cancelled-release-date-gta-6-1851623636" rel="nofollow ">indefinitely</a>.</p><p>It's unclear how long Meta will continue to fund VR game development, which could be a meaningful hit to the industry, given its publishing branch was responsible for games like Among Us VR, Rock Band VR, and Batman: Arkham Shadow. With Sony <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either" rel="nofollow ">reportedly</a> cutting back on investment in VR development, with only two first-party titles in the pipeline, it's uncertain whether or not a release calendar like 2024's will happen again, or if we're witnessing a swansong in disguise.</p><p>Aces of Thunder, Hitman: World of Assassination, and Zombie Army VR are only a few games that were delayed to 2025. Throughout 2024, there have been numerous examples of not only delays but generally rough launches. Bulletstorm VR was deemed unplayable until a series of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-vr-gets-hefty-patch-following-broken-launch" rel="nofollow ">patches</a> improved anything from physics to visuals and enemy AI. Two anticipated horror games, Madison VR and Phasmophobia, were <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/horror-madison-vr-release-delay-psvr-2-steamvr/" rel="nofollow ">delayed</a> multiple times. For the latter, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r_4kVzpsYY">reviewers</a> have advised avoiding it until the port quality improves--in a similar fashion to the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvFDiv1FI4">Hitman 3 VR Reloaded</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvFDiv1FI4">Inverse</a>, developers pointed out some of the issues VR developers face: engine-compatibility issues with games originally built in certain versions of Unity, the use of reprojection to artificially boost frame rates at the cost of image quality (leading to blurry visuals), and demanding VRC processes (a virtual reality checklist of technical requirements that each game must pass during certification). Even QA testing is more taxing than usual. In interviews with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240413184350/https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/12/26/vomit-and-ginger-candy-inside-the-vr-qa-process" rel="nofollow ">Game Informer</a>, testers mentioned the process is physically demanding, while it can take a while to get used to testing in VR, especially for longer periods of time, with one former developer saying he'd often feel "detached from reality" for the first two weeks at the job.</p><p>Looking ahead, some studios continue to show active investment in the space. In an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240713051000/https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/04/capcom-keeps-bringing-resident-evil-to-vr-heres-how-and-why" rel="nofollow ">Game Informer</a> about the VR rendition of the Resident Evil 4 remake, producer Masato Kumazawa said that one of the reasons for releasing VR versions of Village and RE4R for free is to help expand the VR market.</p><p>"VR also matches with the Resident Evil franchise really well," director Keisuke Yamakawa said. "I would like VR to get much more popular with the public. Since headsets can still be quite expensive and heavy, I would love for the kits to continue getting lighter and more affordable to make it more [approachable] to the general audience.”</p><p>Headsets are indeed getting lighter, but the cost of entry is still high. The Meta Quest 3 256 GB model costs $499, in contrast to the PSVR 2 at $549 and the Pico 4 Ultra at €600 (around $630). Out of the three, the PSVR 2 isn't wireless, and it originally required a PlayStation 5. Sony launched a PC adapter back in August priced at $59. If you have a decent PC that can run VR games, the catalog is greatly increased, and so is the longevity of the headset as a result. Speaking of which, there are a number of PC-specific headsets out there, such as the Valve Index ($999) and the Vive series (starting at the $600 to $700 price range). But the aforementioned headsets are by far the ones driving the mainstream interest at the moment. (The Apple Vision Pro, starting at $3,499, is undoubtedly not targeted at the average consumer, so I'm not counting it here.)</p><p>There's also market fluctuation to consider. Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro are ceasing sales by the end of 2024. So is the Meta Quest 3 128 GB model, which has already been <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/and-it-s-gone-discontinued-meta-quest-3-model-already-selling-out-online" rel="nofollow ">selling out online</a>. The company hopes to replace these gaps with the Meta Quest 3S, released in October at the price of $299. However, this model has some hardware compromises, such as using the Quest 2's per-eye single-display setup, as opposed to the Quest 3's dual-display setup, resulting in a lower resolution and bulkier lenses.</p><p>In terms of games, the occasional oddities, such as Triangle Strategy presenting its campaign as floating dioramas in mixed reality, continue to surprise. Smaller studios deserve attention, too--The Exit 8, Sushi Ben, and Umurangi Generation VR all stood out in 2024. Genres like rhythm games continue to thrive, with more studios betting on adaptations, like Metal: Hellsinger VR and Spin Rhythm this year, and existing games receiving ongoing updates.</p><p>Beat Saber continues to get both free and paid songs, and Synth Riders has a mixed-reality mode on Quest 3. But it's hard to look at the landscape to find that many of the games that fiddled with genre novelties couldn't withstand the passage of time. Rock Band VR, Audica, and Dance Central<em>,</em> all Harmonix joints, haven't had official support for years. Sure, Just Dance VR was released back in October, but new games feel more like fleeting replacements rather than new entries in emerging subgenres.</p><p>With 2025 around the corner, the future is uncertain. Meta seems more invested in the so-called metaverse aspect of the headset, pushing an ecosystem that's more suitable for meetings and networking, with avatars for jumping on "got a minute?" calls or built-in calendar apps that can be synced with Google and Outlook, or using your headset during <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/travel-mode-lufthansa-airplane-flight-entertainment/?srsltid=AfmBOorEId3uWbQMgy9HTuXsubyv_1J4D77vOkHTrxemyUj3wAqpQUoC" rel="nofollow ">flights</a> or <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-v71-update-horizon-os-refresh-calendar-remote-desktop/" rel="nofollow ">train rides</a>, rather than video-game experiences.</p><p>Community efforts like Flat2VR continue to innovate by adding VR support to a plethora of games. The modding team started with highlights like the Half-Life 2: VR mod, and has since <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/flat2vr-studios-announcement/" rel="nofollow ">formed a studio</a> working on licensed adaptations in an official capacity, such as Trombone Champ: Unflattened. The modding scene, particularly on PC, continues to be a standout. You can now play Halo: Combat Evolved in VR with full motion controls, while other people have been working tirelessly to achieve the opposite, such as a flat version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-alyx-review-catch-these-hands/1900-6417437/">Half-Life: Alyx</a>.</p><p>VR might still have a niche audience, but the interest in its future isn't fading. Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gorilla-tag/">Gorilla Tag</a> have amassed over 12 million lifetime players and maintain a million daily active users, with the game's interest being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-gorilla-tag-became-a-generational-obsession-and-conquered-vr/1100-6526437/">spearheaded by Gen Alpha kids</a>. We can only hope that future development focuses more on video games, for both adult and younger demographics, rather than digitizing even more daily-life aspects, especially with work as the focus. As the PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 3 get closer to two years in their life cycles, I hope more studios can look back at 2024 as a bar to surpass instead of a ceiling that will forever be out of reach.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

The 2024 release calendar was spotty at best, and even some of the more notable games that did come to the handheld hybrid, of which there were strikingly few, struggled to run on the nearly eight-year-old tech. Eight years, incidentally, is almost the stretch of time between the launch of the SNES and the PlayStation 2. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,195670,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Nintendo has found a way to keep the Switch alive—just barely—heading into 2025, but this year mostly felt like being in line at the DMV, waiting for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408">glimpse of the Switch 2</a></span> only for the office to close just before you got called to the front desk. While everyone else was focused on the future, Nintendo was stubbornly attached to the Switch’s present, going so far as to wage an all-out war on Switch emulation enthusiasts and ROM pirates alike to stop the platform from completely transforming into a hacker’s paradise.</p><p> 2024 was most notable for what we didn’t see or get than for any actual moves or announcements Nintendo made. No news about the Switch 2, other than it will be revealed in the next few months and will be backwards compatible with the existing one. No major <em>Mario</em> or <em>Zelda</em> game; instead we got two great but flawed smaller spin-offs from those franchises. No major changes to the Switch itself, as best evidenced by how much of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248">a laggy slopfest the eShop still is</a></span>. Not even a price drop for the $300 portable gaming tablet from 2017. </p><p>Instead, the Switch’s 2024 was best spent continuing to play the best indie releases around, almost all of which came to Switch. It was also a good year to continue exploring in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> which, almost two years later, is still the system’s most ambitious and sprawling achievement. Anyone getting a Switch for the first time this holiday season ahead of the Switch 2 announcement might elicit pity, if not for the fact that Nintendo’s current console still has one of the best catalogs ever assembled in the history of gaming. </p><h2 id="h761639"><a id=""></a>The Hardware</h2><p>What’s left to say about the Nintendo Switch? The promise it offers of gaming on the go or on a big display is as compelling as ever, though its ability to truly deliver a smooth and seamless gaming experience has eroded  with time. The difference between how even mid-range to smaller games perform on Switch versus other platforms like PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC has only continued to grow. Framerate hiccups, visual detail, and loading times have all gotten worse, while rival portables like the Steam Deck and Asus Rog Ally offer fewer tradeoffs at a slightly higher price, at least when it comes to third-party ports and indie releases. </p><figure id="" data-id="83d3fbca6fe9591536240ef0931d01c1" data-recommend-id="image://83d3fbca6fe9591536240ef0931d01c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1003" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An alarm clock sits on a table.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And whither the Switch 2? Nintendo’s much-speculated-about successor has yet to be revealed but, if an ongoing torrent of alleged leaks are to be taken seriously, appears to be a more straightforward upgrade to the existing hardware than Nintendo’s done in quite some time. Whatever gimmicks it may offer, like magnetized Joy-Con that stick to the side of the screen rather than sliding on, don’t seem to be central to the pitch of the new console. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048">It might even be called the Nintendo Switch 2</a></span>.</p><p>I’m not supposed to be spending this section on the state of the current Switch writing about the future one, but it’s a more accurate depiction of what most of 2024 has felt like for current Switch owners: pinning for what’s behind the red curtain as we growing increasingly impatient and frustrated with what’s already in our hands. As for things Nintendo actually did announce this year, there was a clock. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">It’s called Alarmo</a></span> and it uses motion sensors to serenade users with video game music. Reviewers got their hands on it early but the actual thing won’t ship until early 2025. Fans did get a gold, Zelda-themed Switch Lite this year. It’s probably the best-looking special edition one yet. </p><h2 id="h761640"><a id=""></a>The Software</h2><p>Although the Switch hardware is hanging on by the skin of its teeth, the UI, interface, and general feel of actually navigating the home screen, eShop, and app-only features has grown increasingly grim. It’s sluggish, poorly optimized, and messy. The sleekness of the central row of tiles belies a stark lack of options when it comes to customization or getting any kind of meaningful information about your system, games, or the wider Nintendo ecosystem at a quick glance. </p><p>The eShop is a special point of pain. I quietly sigh every time I have to open the store to go and buy a game, check what’s on sale, or try to see what just came out. It feels like it takes a minor marathon for the store to boot up, and then even longer for the actual parts of it to individually load. Finally getting into the shop is just the start of the headaches, with shovelware and cheap rip-offs of famous games crammed throughout the catalog as you scroll. It’s not great, and it doesn’t help that Nintendo has seemed very unresponsive to the legitimate issues with it. It’s an ominous sign for how the digital purchasing experience may or may not end up changing when it comes to the Switch 2.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a652cf54674939b3eac957f64b47040" data-recommend-id="image://2a652cf54674939b3eac957f64b47040" data-format="png" data-width="859" data-height="631" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows eShop scams.

A parade of Game Boy Advance classics added throughout 2024 included<em> Golden Sun 1</em> and <em>2</em>, <em>F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past </em>and <em>Four Swords</em>, and<em> Metroid Zero Mission</em>. <em>Mother 3 </em>even came to the service, though only in Japan. An eclectic batch of retro games joined the rest of the catalog as well, from <em>Super R-Type </em>on SNES to <em>Vectorman</em> on Sega Genesis. Xbox Game Studios brought over a bunch of games like<em> Killer Instinct</em> and <em>Perfect Dark</em>. And the original Game Boy library was inundated with<em> Mega Man</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> games.</p><figure id="" data-id="79dcf79bd120dd1b0c388ba3da9cb6ec" data-recommend-id="image://79dcf79bd120dd1b0c388ba3da9cb6ec" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Samus fights a giant alien.

A big appeal of the Expansion Pack was access to new DLCs like the additional <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>courses, but as Nintendo first-party releases have stalled and its online multiplayer games get quickly abandoned, that particular perk has languished. It’s also still a major blow to Nintendo’s retro offerings that none of the games can be purchased separately as Sony now allows with its PlayStation Classics. It’s 2024 and fans still have to pay $50 a year to rent <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time </em>running on a Nintendo 64 emulator.</p><p>However, the biggest addition to Switch Online this year wasn’t a game at all.

Additionally, Nintendo used Switch Online to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">launch a playtest</a></span> for a secret project that seems like a mashup of an MMO and <em>Minecraft</em>. The service has also been used to offer week-long free trials of various eShop games like<em> Cursed Golf </em>and <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. Switch Online is more valuable than ever, but still lacks the one thing its competitors have going for it: access to a Netflix-like library of new games. </p><h2 id="h761642"><a id=""></a>The Games</h2><p>Nintendo is masterful when it comes to making an off year feel like it’s still full of big games. The Switch’s 2024 calendar was a mix of remakes and smaller spin-offs buoyed by a good year for indie games. The first half of the year ramped up with <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em>, and <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. It then brought things home with<em> The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="4e09cd6f6b657310be9c0ee6579731c0" data-recommend-id="image://4e09cd6f6b657310be9c0ee6579731c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="829" data-height="466" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and a Koopa talk to a dragon.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The quantity was there in 2024 for sure, but it definitely felt like a second-string year while Nintendo rested its starters. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> experimented with really neat and novel ideas but fell just short of greatness. <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership </em>was a great RPG-lite sequel that didn’t quite manage to truly transform the series the way other Switch games have for their respective franchises. The best game Nintendo put on the Switch in 2024 was arguably <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, a remake of a two-decade-old GameCube game that, in another universe, would have come to the platform without the HD upgrade simply the via Switch Online back catalog. </p><p>Fortunately, the Switch also had another banner year for indie releases to fill in the gaps. Some of 2024's top games—<em>Balatro</em>, <em>1000xResist</em>,<em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>,<em> Animal Well</em>,<em> Arco</em>,<em> Botany Manor</em>, <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, and <em>Neva</em>—all arrived in a timely manner, even if their ports to other consoles were delayed. Microsoft’s multiplatform push also saw the Switch get <em>Pentiment</em>, the excellent Renaissance-era murder mystery RPG, while some third-party GOTY contenders like <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> and <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> were present day-and-date. </p><p>The Switch’s 2024 library didn’t reach the same heights as it has in past years, but there was still plenty to play, an incredible feat for a console that should have been replaced long ago. And there’s still more coming. Ports of<em> Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>arrive early in 2025. <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, announced ages ago, is also still set to come to the platform, as will <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, the next game in the hit franchise after an unprecedented year off from new Pokémon games. Nintendo is clearly saving its best for the launch of the Switch 2. In that context, a quiet year for the current Switch was still way better than it had any right to be. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-lacks-faith-in-the-series%E2%80%99-biggest-mysteries.1069932/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-religion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Early in the prologue of 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, your spymistress Leliana sets the tone:</p><p>“‘<em>Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just. Blessed are the righteous, the lights in the shadow. In their blood, the Maker’s will is written.</em>’ Is that what you want from us? Blood? To die so that Your will is done? Is death your only blessing?”&nbsp;</p><p>There are many such lines of raw, uncut Catholic agony sprinkled throughout the game—and Leliana, a roguish party member from the first game who returns with style, is an ideal herald for such painful evangels. After all, she represents one of the core themes of <em>Dragon Age</em>: the struggle with one’s faith.&nbsp;</p><p>As a fully paid-up recovering Catholic who now worships a Goddess suspiciously Marian in nature, I relate to <em>Dragon Age</em>’s Chantry church, its eponymous Chant of Light, and the moody Caravaggisti tones it’s all sketched in. It truly is I Can’t Believe It’s Not Catholicism, replete with Swordlady Jesus, Absent Daddy Figure, The Apocrypha with Political Implications, and Wildly Off Key Yet Weirdly Moving Music.&nbsp;</p><p>But the beauty of the series’ portrayal is that it speaks to faith in the more general sense as well. Faith in a cause, faith in oneself, reaching into the darkness of the future and praying that history doesn’t bite your arm off. You must have faith to believe in any cause, and you must struggle with it, knowing you will never receive a final answer. <em>Dragon Age </em>is a highly theological series that nevertheless understands faith as a pillar of even the most thoroughgoing secularism.&nbsp;</p><p>The centrality of this idea to the series makes the ruthless elision of faith in <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> dissonant in ways that would annoy a devout Chantry sister. That absence is baffling considering the game’s story is almost <em>entirely </em>about would-be gods: Solas/Fen’Harel, Ghilan'nain, and Elgar’nan, the story’s three main villains. <em>Veilguard </em>builds a tower of lore atop the <em>Trespasser</em> DLC’s decade-old revelations about the Evanuris, the Elven pantheon. They were not ‘true’ gods, but ascended mortals who commanded powerful magic—and with it, an empire that Solas sought to topple.&nbsp;</p><p>The nature of this revelation is cosmic, to put it mildly. These are the Elven peoples’ gods, whom the Dalish, in particular, are raised to both revere and preserve the memory of. Now, two of them, the aforementioned Elgar’nan and Ghilan'nain, have revealed themselves to Thedas as power-mad panto villains hellbent on blighting the planet and cackling in sexy accents. You’d think this would occasion a crisis of faith somewhere in the same postal code as Leliana’s multi-game struggle with her own faith in the Maker.</p><hr><p>Leliana appears to your Grey Warden in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> as a woman on a mission from God (i.e., the Maker). The Maker, she says, speaks to her and urged her to join the Warden and their gang of misfits on their quest to save the world. But that wild claim is tested again and again; the guardian spirit of the Temple of Sacred Ashes challenges her directly.&nbsp;</p><p>“And you… why do you say the Maker speaks to you, when all that the Maker has left? He spoke only to Andraste. Do you believe yourself Her equal?”&nbsp;</p><p>Leliana responds with doubt and struggle, faith’s truest handmaidens. In the end, she avers, “I know what I believe!”</p><p>But the <em>truth </em>of the claim is left ambiguous. Who do you believe? Leliana or the spirit?&nbsp;</p><p><em>Dragon Age </em>is good at this sort of thing. Leliana again struggles with her faith after the destruction of that very Temple, several years later, claims the lives of Divine Justinia—think of her as the Chantry’s pope—and countless other believers who were trying to stage a peace conference between the warring Mages and Templars. No wonder she asked if death was the Maker’s only blessing.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>And further along in <em>Inquisition</em> you meet a figure out of the game’s mythology: Corypheus, one of the Magisters who—stay with me here—broke into the Fade, that realm of dreams, and assaulted the Golden City that sat at its heart. According to Chantry lore, this indiscretion supposedly precipitated the Maker withdrawing from the world and cursing Thedas with the Blight—an oily corrupting evil that nurtures the zombie-like darkspawn who plague the world. But during Corypheus’ best monologue, he thunders to you about his evil plan and concludes, “Beg that I succeed. For I have seen the Throne of the Gods, and it was empty!”</p><p>Proof that there’s no Maker, surely? Well, who do you believe? An evil would-be god who’s high on his own supply? Or your own faith that the Maker has some grander plan here? Or neither, if your Inquisitor’s inclinations lay elsewhere?&nbsp;</p><p>The game does not answer this question for you; you can only draw your own conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, you meet Divine Justinia herself in the Fade, later on. Her spirit guides and even saves you. Or… is it really her? Perhaps it’s just some spirit of Curiosity or Virtue that’s filched the late Divine’s memories. When you ask her, she is deeply equivocal, telling you, in essence, that the ‘truth’ of her nature is for you to decide. There are no Answers.</p><p>Only more mysteries.</p><p>Whom or <em>what </em>do you believe? And how do you wrestle with the doubts and contradictions thrown your way?</p><hr><p><em>Veilguard, </em>rather astonishingly, does none of this.</p><p>The game’s best segments involve Solas’ memories—specifically, his regrets. They’re brilliantly written, and make for some solid gameplay that allows your Rook to literally, physically explore the deepest, most forgotten history of the realm that made Thedas everything it is today. It’s bitterly satisfying, often dark, always moving.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to one memory, your party gathers to discuss the theological implications of what they’ve witnessed. Emmerich remarks that, if true, this memory of Solas’ might disprove the entire Chant of Light. And Rook? Well, they can respond with some variant on “whoa, that’s crazy.” And then it’s never brought up again.&nbsp;</p><p>The same is maddeningly true of Bellara, whose response to the gods she was raised to believe in being evil mortals is, at least early on, more bathos than pathos. There is one (1) conversation she has where she expresses anxiety about how Elves might face even more discrimination and abuse from humans because of Elgar’nan and Ghilan’nain’s depredations. Rook is afforded one (1) possible response to this, and then the matter never surfaces again. Not even in Minrathous, where the word “alienage”—the ghettos to which Elves are confined in human cities—is never mentioned.</p><p>The truth of the Evanuris is profoundly consequential, theologically and politically. The flame that the Dalish had striven to keep alive for centuries was a wicked lie—to the point of being a cruel joke. Their myths were nothing more than the propaganda of tyrants. Solas’ revelations offer a profound challenge to the Chantry’s teachings. Yet no one seems to struggle with this. Ever.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Dragon Age </em>never made fools of the faithful. There was always somewhere for faith to live, and it was revealed to be the fountainhead of virtue as well as evil. For every zealous, abusive Templar, there was a true Champion of the Just; for every conniving sister, there was someone like Leliana or Seeker Cassandra, for whom faith was an inspiration to do good in the world. And there was something quite beautiful about the fact that your Warden, your Hawke from <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, your Inquisitor, could explore ancient secrets few were privy to, yet only find more mysteries than answers. This is a realistic and respectful reflection of faith—it’s a beautiful, lifelong struggle.</p><p><em>Veilguard, </em>by contrast, is a parade of Final Answers that the game has little interest in exploring. While there are hints of doubt entertained about Solas’ regrets, there is an overriding sense that you are, essentially, looking at objective recordings of history.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>This is in stark contrast to something Solas himself said in <em>Inquisition</em> about the Fade—the realm of dreams and spirits where these memories play out in <em>Veilguard</em>. Your Inquisitor can ask him what he’s seen in the Fade, and he gives an example drawn from the series’ own history, such as the Battle of Ostagar, which opened <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>. Teryn Loghain MacTir left King Maric (and your Warden) to die to a horde of darkspawn by calling an early retreat.</p><p>You can excitedly ask Solas what ‘really’ happened. But, he says, there is no Truth to be found. Only the reflection of peoples’ experiences and memories. Thus, some view Loghain as a hero who saved the army from a vainglorious suicide march by a naïve king, and others view him as the traitor who condemned the king and the Grey Wardens to death. There is no truth, only perspective. The elemental stuff of history.</p><hr><p>To have faith is to know that silence is sometimes as eloquent as song. The <em>Dragon Age</em> series makes much of the absence of the Maker—the one true god, according to the Chantry. The Chantry, as the name implies, is all about song. Its biblical equivalent, the Chant of Light, is meant to be sung (though, as anyone familiar with the droning non-singing of Catholic liturgy knows, the definition of ‘music’ is quite loose here too). But for all that, it’s still important to wrestle with the Maker’s lack of an answer, as Leliana did in that <em>Inquisition</em> scene.</p><p><em>Dragon Age</em>’s earlier games thematise silence beautifully. When the series presented you with mystery, it enjoined you to embrace the silence and think with it, to embrace the beauty of all you didn’t know and might never know. <em>Veilguard</em> is quite noisy, however. It barrages you with cosmic truths that are inarguable. The answers that seemed to elude believers like Leliana. This would be more manageable if you could wrestle with those answers, but that isn’t forthcoming either.</p><p>For all these cosmic revelations in <em>Veilguard</em>, neither of the two Dalish-raised members of your party—Bellara or Davrin—seem interested in engaging with the obvious questions. The Evanuris are simply evil and must be defeated. There are no Andrastians to struggle with their faith in the Maker. The only Chantry in the game—an Imperial Chantry, no less—is mostly a combat zone. There are no Hahrens or Keepers to struggle with Elven faith. We meet exactly one believer in the collectivist Qun, in a game that takes place in Northern Thedas where the endless war between the Qunari and Tevinter is far closer and impactful.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>It's not a coincidence, I think, that <em>Veilguard’s </em>best bits are places where the game finds space to portray doubt and struggle, and just a little of that all-too-precious silence. After Solas’ sudden but inevitable betrayal—which necessarily occurs after you unavoidably send one of your companions to their deaths—your Rook is riven with doubt and recrimination. It’s a long dark night of the soul in a Fade prison where you’re tormented by the consequences of your leadership. At last, the flagellant’s whip from <em>Inquisition </em>had returned. And it is here, of course, where you confront a terrible truth: your beloved mentor, Varric, had been dead this entire time. In the Fade prison, Varric himself—or perhaps another spirit wearing his memories?—helps you come to terms with this.</p><p>Even if it, by itself, wasn't enough, I still found myself saying: “There, at last, was the <em>mystery</em> I was waiting for!” Yes, it was objectively true that Solas had messed with your Rook’s mind, hiding Varric’s death from you and manipulating your memory of him. But who was this in the Fade?&nbsp;</p><p>As in previous games, you’re left asking the most important question <em>Dragon Age </em>ever asks: whom, or <em>what</em>,<em> </em>do you believe?</p><p>We learn a lot from such questions. But even this pivotal moment couldn’t redeem the fact that such struggles were too thin on the ground throughout <em>Veilguard</em>; it was a rare point of light amidst a relentless procession of Answers that you can’t even begin to wrestle with.&nbsp;</p><p>My recent replaying of <em>Inquisition </em>spoke to my spirit in a way <em>Veilguard </em>didn’t—a spirit battered by the events of a brutal November, a rending of the ideological sky that has me questioning my own future as a trans woman in rather existential terms. <em>Inquisition’s </em>approach to faith soothes the broken heart of a believer who still wants to believe, even when the sky itself is torn apart. It is a balm in the way that a good song is when it gives voice to your exact mood.&nbsp;</p><p>What much of <em>Veilguard </em>offers is not uninteresting, but it felt strangely unequal to the current moment, despite all the ingredients being there. The terror of ancient evils continuing to haunt us, the shattering of old certainties, institutions that were never supposed to fall, failures so systemic that the only hope seems to lie with those of us in the cracks. And yet, the lack of any kind of struggle with faith—theological or political—makes it all feel soulless at times.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>There was one other notable exception, and it’s worth closing with.</p><p>Neve Gallus, <em>Veilguard’s</em> enchanting noir detective, had a storyline that ended up making me cry precisely because of how much ground it managed to make up in the faith department, despite it being a thoroughly secular story.&nbsp;</p><p>She’s on the hunt for an old foe, a cultist who is tormenting the residents of the Dock Town slum in Minrathous. The cultist had slipped through her fingers before, in part due to the city’s enduring corruption. She has a crisis of faith. What good are her efforts to save the day and help Dock Town when people like that damned cult leader can just keep coming back and hurting people without ever experiencing a single consequence?</p><p>“Sometimes it feels as though the city itself stabs me in the back,” Neve says with painful relatability.</p><p>I lost it then. That was the first time <em>Veilguard </em>broke me. It was the cry I needed, when this cruellest of Novembers came stealing hope away. The second time I broke was in the Fade, faced with Varric’s mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>The point of these struggles with faith is not to find an Answer. It is to cry and find a reason—your very own reason—to <em>keep going</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siltterhead-is-good-actually"><h3>Wait A Second, Slitterhead Rules</h3></a><p>Slitterhead is a beautiful PS3 game dropped through a time portal, and one of the most original games of the year.</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24317923/xbox-game-pass-best-games-2024-microsoft-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Even if it wasn’t the strongest year for Xbox exclusive games (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301358/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-launch-day-issues">and some of those exclusives had their issues</a>), Game Pass was still an extremely good deal for console owners. Mostly, it’s the variety; the subscription service continues to offer a great mix of new blockbuster releases, along with smaller indie games and older titles to round out the package. This year had everything from <em>Call of Duty</em>’s big coming-out party on Game Pass to a stop-motion adventure game to an expansion to one of last year’s biggest RPGs.</p><p>Here are nine great games to check out if you’re a new subscriber or just looking for something new to play.</p><p><h3><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></h3></p><p>Now that Activision Blizzard is under the Microsoft umbrella, the publisher’s biggest franchise is part of Game Pass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">And <em>Black Ops 6</em> is the first new release to debut on the subscription service</a>. That includes all of the game’s various modes: the cinematic single-player campaign, and multiplayer outings like Zombies.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Bethesda Softworks</cite></p></div><p><h3><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show</a> had seemingly everyone thinking about a return to the wasteland, and Game Pass is a great way to jump in since it has every game in the series from <em>Fallout 3</em> on. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/28/24141907/best-fallout-3-4-76-new-vegas-start">There’s a lot to choose from</a> — but I’d recommend <em>New Vegas</em>. Not only does Sin City offer up a great location for a <em>Fallout</em> game but it’s also going to be a big part of the upcoming second season of the show.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24131922/harold-halibut-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Harold Halibut</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’re looking for something a little more laid back, <em>Harold Halibut</em> might be just the thing. A fairly traditional adventure game, <em>Harold Halibut</em> sets itself apart with a slow and steady pace, a fascinating sci-fi world, a dry but charming sense of humor, and stunning visuals featuring real stop-motion animation. It’s the kind of game where you really want to slow down anyways, to soak in all of the small details.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23724560/humanity-review-ps4-ps5-steam-vr"><em>Humanity</em></a></h3></p><p>One of the best puzzle games of the last few years is now on Game Pass. <em>Humanity</em> seems a little weird at first, as you control an ethereal Shiba Inu in order to guide mindless swaths of humans through increasingly complex mazes. But once you get accustomed to the way things work, <em>Humanity</em> offers up some of the most satisfying brain teasers you’re likely to find. Plus, the ghost dog sure is cute.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a></h3></p><p>Reception has been mixed on this one, but it’s definitely worth checking out. <em>The Great Circle</em> blends together elements of adventure games and immersive sims, with the whip-cracking style of Indiana Jones. That makes it something of an acquired taste, but if that just so happens to be <em>your</em> taste, well, the flavor is delicious.</p><p><h3><em>Nine Sols</em></h3></p><p>In a great year for roguelike action games, <em>Nine Sols</em> still manages to stand out thanks to combat that’s so good it completely makes up for an underwhelming story. It’s the kind of action that really rewards being patient and learning to parry, which makes it all the more satisfying when you win a bout. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">the wait for <em>Silksong</em></a> continues to drag on, <em>Nine Sols</em> could be just the thing to fill in the gap.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24058364/persona-3-reload-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’ve somehow finished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">the sprawling fantasy RPG <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, there are thankfully plenty of excellent older titles from developer Atlus to check out. And this year, <em>Persona 3</em> — which originally launched on the PS2 and helped usher the series into a new era of popularity — got an excellent remake that helps bring it in line with its more modern successors.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">The original <em>Hellblade</em></a> was as terrifying as it was uncomfortable — and that hasn’t changed with the sequel. Instead, the developers at Ninja Theory have expanded the scale, improved the action, and somehow made the horror elements even scarier. It’s also a rare short blockbuster game, something you can complete in around 10 hours.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24262053/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-review"><em>Starfield: Shattered Space</em></a></h3></p><p>The first major expansion for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a> is a good excuse to jump back into this sci-fi universe. While I wish <em>Shattered Space</em> was a little weirder and leaned more into the cosmic horror side of things, it’s still unlike anything else in the main storyline. The expansion is also largely self-contained, so you can spend your time exploring one big planet instead of constantly jumping around the galaxy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>But what makes Astro Bot worthy of such high praise as a single player game?</p>



<p>The game takes players on a journey through dozens of levels spread across more than 50 planets and six galaxies. Each planet offers something fresh, whether it’s unique level design, new abilities, or inventive challenges. The gameplay encourages creativity, requiring players to think differently to save the lost bots scattered throughout the universe.</p>



<p>But Astro Bot isn’t just another platformer; it’s a heartfelt love letter to PlayStation’s storied past. Levels like “Free Big Brother” and “Luna Sola” evoke the joy of classic collectathons and rotating levels, while others, such as “Machine Learning” and “Dude Raiding,” pay clever homage to iconic franchises like Horizon and Uncharted.</p>



<p>It’s not all about nostalgia, though. The game introduces innovative mechanics to keep the experience fresh. Abilities like shrinking to mouse size or using a penguin to swim effortlessly add layers of fun and variety, ensuring no two levels feel the same.</p>



<p>At the heart of it all is Astro, the game’s irresistibly charming mascot. With his joyful personality and endearing design, he ties the experience together, leaving players eager for more adventures.</p>



<p>With its imaginative gameplay, delightful world-building, and heartfelt nods to gaming history, Astro Bot isn’t just a standout game — it’s a testament to what the single player genre can achieve.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-browser-workaround-discovered</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yet-another-ps5-browser-workaround-discovered-following-sony-crackdown.1069902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-browser-workaround-discovered<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enterprising PS5 players have once again found a way to access the console's hidden browser feature, circumventing crackdowns Sony recently put in place to attempt to stop people using the last method that worked.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/12/27/ps5-browser-new-workaround-december-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Lifestyle</a>, Sony recently implemented a fix for a browser workaround wherein users could include Google or Bing search links in messages they sent to one another, thereby allowing them to access the browser via those links.</p>

<p>Those links are now automatically removed whenever a message containing one is sent, but clever PS5 players have found another way to access the console's browser, and amusingly enough, it still involves sending a message with an embedded link.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-browser-workaround-grinning-player.jpg?itok=4Eg96P1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-browser-workaround-grinning-player.jpg?itok=h9r1YB5d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'd better not be accessing the PS5's browser, friend.</figcaption></figure><p>The latest workaround, per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1hn1iit/how_to_use_google_on_ps5_not_patched/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redditor Andreo_11</a>, involves messaging another player a link to Wikipedia. After receiving said link, all you need to do is search for the Wikipedia page on Bing, and you'll find a link to the search engine on that very page.</p>

<p>The Redditor doesn't say whether or not this works for Google, but at the very least, you can still access all your favorite websites through Bing using this simple trick. Whether or not Sony decides to patch it out in future is another matter, of course.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why Sony wants to stop people accessing its console's web browser, it's likely because the browser is the main method by which many PS5 users mod or jailbreak their consoles, and, well, let's just say Sony doesn't look too kindly on such behavior.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-browser-workaround-bing.jpg?itok=6_46ygPk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-browser-workaround-bing.jpg?itok=d9xivkDw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Wikipedia page for Bing is a big part of the latest PS5 browser workaround.</figcaption></figure><p>This new workaround comes after Sony <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hk1qxa/psa_sending_googlecom_urls_is_now_a_breach_of_the/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly sent breach-of-conduct emails</a> to users who were utilizing the previous message-based trick, with that workaround apparently falling under the "sharing malicious URLs" provision of said code of conduct.</p>

<p>Of course, since the new workaround also involves sending links in messages, there's no guarantee Sony won't go after you for using this one as well. Player discretion is very much advised.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Microsoft's Xbox line allows you to use the company's Edge browser with no impediments. Nintendo, of course, doesn't allow you to use the Switch's browser, although it does have one hidden away, and accessing it isn't particularly difficult.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Infold Games has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1 update, as well as the kind of content you can expect when said update lands.</p>

<p>The cozy open-world adventure's first major update will bring the Shooting Star Season with it on December 30th, and the season will run until January 23rd, introducing plenty more stuff to do and collect.</p>

<p>Infold says that the Shooting Star Season will usher in "shimmering meteors" that shoot over the skies of Miraland, bringing with them "festive decorations" that should give your surroundings an even more relaxing and chilled-out feel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.1-shooting-star-season.jpg?itok=KapKM2ZH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.1-shooting-star-season.jpg?itok=JB8KMyZ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can look forward to new activities and more when&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1 drops.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the new decorations, you can also look forward to new storylines being added to the game, as well as new platforming challenges to test your prowess. Don't worry, though; they'll almost certainly be just as low-stakes as the main game.</p>

<p>Infold is also promising new "time-limited events" to enjoy in Version 1.1, and it wouldn't be an <i>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</i>update without new outfits to get excited about as well. The ones shown off in the trailer look suitably breathtaking.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the outfits and other content being introduced in Version 1.1 will also be time-limited or whether you'll be able to unlock them after the season ends on January 23rd. Since this is the game's first update, we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1, which shows off a couple of the new outfits you'll get the chance to unlock in the update, right here.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it's a cozy open-world adventure game that emphasizes platforming, exploration, and relaxation over combat.</p>

<p>The game has a storyline to pursue, but you're just as welcome to spend time with Miraland's locals, take part in some minigames, or just vibe at your own pace.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has obviously managed to strike a chord with its player base; Infold's game managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million downloads within its first few days</a>, and while many of those players will simply have been curious, that's still a whole bunch of downloads.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. If you'd like to know whether Miraland is worth exploring, be sure to take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion" rel="nofollow">our very own Brittany's pre-release impressions</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nier-automata-sales-cross-9m-as-eighth-anniversary-looms.1069893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone as the game nears its eighth anniversary, publisher Square Enix has revealed.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NieR_JPN/status/1872522683411558507" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on the official Japanese X account</a> for the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise, it's revealed that the game has managed to surpass 9 million copies sold. That's counting both physical shipments and digital sales, of course.</p>

<p>The announcement post (for which we're using machine translation) is a fairly brief and impersonal one, simply thanking fans for their continued support and hoping to rely on them for more support in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-automata-sales-9m-engels.jpg?itok=L4xfP_7e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-automata-sales-9m-engels.jpg?itok=8UjADv7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has crossed 9 million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>The sales milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has sold another million copies in less than a year; back in February, it was revealed that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-achieves-8-million-copies-sold" rel="nofollow">crossed the 8 million sales threshold</a>.</p>

<p>In general, it seems like sales are pretty steady for&nbsp;<em>Automata</em>; it had hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-has-sold-over-75-million-copies" rel="nofollow">7.5 million sales in April 2023</a>, so it's trundling along at a pace that Square Enix will no doubt be pleased with, especially given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">need for reliable sellers</a> at this point.</p>

<p>So, what's driving&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata</em>'s success? Well, it's a pretty well-liked game, to start with. Over on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/3540/nier-automata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, 93% of critics recommend the game, and although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/nier-automata-review-robots-in-love" rel="nofollow">our very own Sam's review</a> is somewhat less effusive, he still praises its "unique, shocking, and interesting" story, as well as its final ten hours or so.</p>

<p>The game is also enjoying something of a resurgence elsewhere in gaming right now; it's had crossovers with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Stellar Blade</em></a>, fighting game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-2b-from-nier-automata-dlc-on-top-of-vane-and" rel="nofollow"><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-nier-crossover" rel="nofollow">battle royale game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-nier-crossover" rel="nofollow">Naraka: Bladepoint</a>&nbsp;</em>in the last year or two, among others.</p>




<p>If you've somehow missed out on&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>up until now, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA04551_00-GOTYORHADIGITAL0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/NieR-Automata-BECOME-AS-GODS-Edition/BPPZVT8BZ15N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nier-automata-the-end-of-yorha-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's also playable on current-gen consoles thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility.</p>

With the industry’s biggest publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">increasingly chasing massive, broadly appealing games meant to be played forever</a>, it was heartening to see old formats come back with some new tricks. And these successes could provide the blueprint needed to pull the video game industry out of its current tailspin.</p><p><em>Persona</em> developer Atlus has once again innovated on the turn-based RPG with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>. What makes <em>Metaphor</em>’s combat interesting in a way that’s hard to replicate with traditional turn-based RPGs is that Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety. Characters have access to powerful summons, each with their own abilities, along with strengths and weaknesses that enemies also share. Hitting an enemy’s weakness or having your own exploited results in monumental shifts in the momentum of battle. Every attack becomes consequential, as you don’t know what will work against your foes or what they have to work against you.</p><div><p>Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety.</p></div><p>Despite dominating with games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> in the late ’80s and through the ’90s, turn-based RPGs have largely been left behind. (With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">the notable exception of the <em>Dragon Quest </em>series</a>, which consistently sells beaucoup copies in Japan.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180709/final-fantasy-16-eikons-naoki-yoshida-interview">Modern tastes</a> have evolved to prefer the active, frenetic, and combo-dependent combat of the action RPG over the passive, implied action of turn-based games.

To get them to stick, players not only have to be okay with the idea of failure as progression but also have to be invested enough in the game’s wider world to want to keep playing through it multiple times. For every <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"><em>Hades</em></a>, there are hundreds of games on digital storefronts that blur together into smears of generic fantasy dungeon crawlers.&nbsp;</p><div><p>[Balatro is] catnip for the players who can’t resist “number go up.” </p></div><p>One of the reasons<em> Balatro</em> became an instant success was because it didn’t have that hurdle. Poker is known all over the world and hasn’t really changed much in the centuries since its invention.<em> Balatro</em> took advantage of that familiarity and combined it with great humor and an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085031/balatro-jokers-break-the-game">ingenious progression system</a> that made it catnip for the players who can’t resist “number go up.” More than that, <em>Balatro</em> feels more permissive than its roguelike cousins. The best runs in <em>Hades</em> are typically the result of lucking into specific boons or items, whereas <em>Balatro</em> is lousy with jokers, card modifiers, perks, and more that make scores get stupid fast. <em>Balatro</em> took home a slew of Game Awards, and it probably would have won Game of the Year if not for that one meddling robot.</p><p>Speaking of… perhaps the biggest example of 2024’s Return trend is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>. Developed by Team Asobi, <em>Astro Bot</em> is a full-sized, standalone expansion of the PS5 pack-in game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> that takes the little robot’s adventures beyond the confines of the PS5 console and into the wider universe. At its core, though, <em>Astro Bot is </em>a mascot platformer reminiscent of the games from PlayStation’s earliest days like <em>Crash Bandicoot </em>and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em>. Indeed, <em>Astro Bot</em> pays homage to those very characters, featuring them as robots to rescue along with other characters from PlayStation’s 30-year history.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>is stuffed with so many items and secrets to collect. That kind of mechanic can get tedious in games suited to “modern” tastes like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, as finding things feels no better than ticking off a box in the slow march to 100 percent completion. But each of Astro’s powers — like the dog jetpack or the shrinking mouse — inject whimsy into the act of collecting.&nbsp;And when I do find a secret, I’m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.</p><p>Mascot platformers fell out of favor, especially with PlayStation studios, despite initial success. Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch have transitioned away from the lightheartedness of Crash Bandicoot and Sly Cooper to make “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">serious</a>” games for “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai">mature</a>” audiences, and PlayStation’s recent catalog reflects that overall trend. <em>Astro Bot</em> is an outlier in form and tone and parlayed that uniqueness into a shower of accolades. It would be such a missed opportunity if Sony didn’t respond to that success with similar projects.</p><div><p>When I do find a secret, I’m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.</p></div><p>Over the last two years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">prolific layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">studio closures</a> have left tens of thousands of developers unemployed, in large part because companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/18/23311082/embracer-group-acquisition-lord-of-the-rings-hobbit-limited-run-games-tripwire">spent too much money</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">on getting bigger</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">developing huge</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/02/10/skull-and-bones-is-a-70-game-because-its-quadruple-a-says-ubisoft/">expensive games</a> that may have made sense years ago but no longer do. Companies dumped hundreds of millions of dollars and considerable development resources into the next live-service shooter in hopes of replicating <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>’s runaway success and profits. But as those games continue to top the monthly video game spending charts, refreshed by a steady cadence of new content, the idea that a newcomer like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds"><em>XDefiant</em> could compete at that same level</a> becomes increasingly remote. This leaves studios with an expensive product nobody wants to play, along with a pipeline of upcoming games too sparse to make up the difference.</p><p>But the way out of this precipitous (and avoidable) decline doesn’t necessarily mean giving up on the big multiplayer or open-world projects. Capcom, for example, has proven that “por qué no los dos” can be a winning strategy. The company has boasted record profits <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/capcom-hits-new-record-for-sales-and-profits-in-2023-2024-financials"><em>the last seven years</em></a> with a diverse catalog composed of heavy hitters like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes, and <em>Street Fighter, </em>along with smaller, weirder games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23979909/dragons-dogma-2-release-date-trailer-capcom"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom"><em>Kunitsu-gami: Path of The Goddess</em></a>. Contrast that with Square Enix <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/square-enix-president-bemoans-weak-final-fantasy-sales-and-says-his-restructure-is-existential-our-winning-formula-is-no-longer-effective/">reporting less-than-expected profits</a> after it <a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-servers-ending-free-ps5-square-enix-concord-1851714395">failed</a><em> </em>to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040124/square-enix-foamstars-ai-art-midjourney">make<em> Foamstars</em> happen</a> on top of releasing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">three</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">different</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030282/final-fantasy-14-new-class-pictomancer-ffxiv-fan-fest-tokyo">AAA <em>Final Fantasy </em>titles</a> in a 12-month period. Capcom has the right idea <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e241213.html">and is doubling down on it</a>, stating that it plans on “re-activating dormant IPs that haven’t had a new title launch recently” after revealing new entries in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320133/okami-2-announce-game-awards"><em>Okami</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody"><em>Onimusha</em></a> series.</p><p>But more than just appealing to gamer nostalgia, these success stories — which also extend to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">survival horror</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft">Metroidvanias</a> — offer a healthier alternative to the trends the big publishers and studios are pursuing. (Nintendo, of course, is always exempt from these generalizations.) While there will always be an appetite for big online shooters or bespoke open-world games with hours of Hollywood-acted voice and motion performance, these breakout releases of 2024 prove (or should at least remind decision-makers) that there is so much worth to also be found in smaller, quirkier, and most importantly, cheaper projects. If the big publishers want to staunch the bleeding of the last two miserable years, they could take the lessons Capcom, <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Metaphor,</em> and <em>Astro Bot </em>provide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
