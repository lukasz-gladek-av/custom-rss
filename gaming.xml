			<p>Although the Xbox Series X machine learning hardware is not on the same level as the PlayStation 5 Pro's, it has some use cases, but Microsoft never showed any interest in using it.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> addressed a point of discussion that's been circulating on social media in the past few days, suggesting that Sony, with the PlayStation 5 Pro, has finally caught up with Microsoft regarding machine learning, saying that having machine learning hardware in the console, and not doing anything with it doesn't exactly mean catching up. The around 100 TOPS of the Xbox Series X are in reference to INT4, which is usually not used for machine learning upscaling. Still, there's nothing preventing Microsoft from developing a machine learning model that could run on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but the company just doesn't seem interested in doing so. The Series consoles' machine learning hardware could have been used, for example, to run <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-showcases-auto-sr-automatic-super-resolution-the-first-os-integrated-ai-upscaling-technology-powered-by-npus/">Auto SR</a> for Xbox 360 backward-compatible games, as the company developed a model that can operate on 40 INT8 TOPS MPUs, something that would have been easily manageable by the current generation consoles' machine learning hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #187: Concord Dead, Indiana Jones Hands-On, Horizon PC Tested, 'Disaster Remasters'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtY1se3Nvj8?start=5683&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given that the Xbox Series X|S architecture was developed back in 2016 when machine learning was on the horizon, it's not surprising that it wasn't used for anything. Things, however, are definitely set to change in the future console generation, especially after seeing the excellent results the first iteration of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution</a> is capable of achieving.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-physical-edition-launches-for-ps5-in-december.1031013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The physical version of celebrated action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, so mark your calendar if you've been waiting to check this one out on disc.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854901792414241099" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by physical game company PM Studios, the physical version of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>arrives on PS5 on December 12th. Naturally, the PC version's not getting a physical edition; after all, when was the last time your PC had an honest-to-goodness disc drive?</p>

<p>If you're worried that the physical version of the game will just be one of those empty-box-with-no-actual-disc-inside deals, you needn't be. PM Studios <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854909999048458693" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has confirmed</a> that the box will, in fact, contain a proper disc, and not just a code.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date-staff-spinning.jpg?itok=pSoRRQjZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date-staff-spinning.jpg?itok=pWIyjJ0C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A physical version of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally on the way next month.</figcaption></figure><p>The physical version of the game will contain a code for the Deluxe Edition upgrade, which will net you an extra staff and set of armor, as well as an additional curio. You can claim this equipment from the Keeper's Shrine menu.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s physical launch is anything like as successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m">as the digital version was</a>, then we can likely expect this release to break a couple more sales milestones, which will no doubt make developer GameScience happy.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience and based loosely on the classical novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>

<p>Rather than Wukong himself, you control the Destined One, a distinctly simian warrior whose destiny is to follow in the footsteps of the legendary trickster god. Along the way, you'll meet plenty of colorful characters and visit lots of beautiful locations inspired by classical Chinese mythology.</p>




<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike, so you can expect tough boss fights and plenty of semi-linear exploration, although the game goes a little easier on the difficulty than the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The physical version of the PS5 release is due to arrive on December 12th.

Then, it flips a coin to see who goes first. Players place their Pokémon on the board and whoever won the coin toss gets to pick a card and then...nothing. <em>Pokémon</em> card battles revolve around energy, and you get one energy at the start of each turn, unless you’re going first when you skip it entirely. And without it, the the adorable little creatures are useless unless they happen to have a special ability attached to them. Most do not, however, leaving whoever goes first immediately hamstrung. </p><p>Instead, it’s the person who goes second who gets draw their first energy and get the attack rolling. A Farfetch’d with one energy can immediately start hitting for 40 damage. If you’re opponent plays <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">an EX card on their first turn</a></span>—special, more powerful variants of existing rare <em>Pokémon</em> cards, they get a head start on racking up the energy needed to use gaming winning attacks. From that point on, whoever went first is just playing catch-up.</p><p>It’s already become an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glo6d2/just_why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glo6d2/just_why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">established meme</a></span> within the <em>TCG Pocket</em> community that this sucks. It’s not just that going first in the game doesn’t convey the usual card game advantages; it’s that going first is basically a fake turn that doesn’t actually let the player engage with the most important mechanic in the game. <em>TCG Pocket</em>’s first PvP event going live earlier this week made made the pain point even more pronounced as top-tier decks steamrolled everyone. </p><p> “If this event has shown me anything,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glygha/one_advantage_however_is_that_you_can_concede/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glygha/one_advantage_however_is_that_you_can_concede/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player writes on Reddit</a></span>, “if you go first against any of the top 3 decks right now you will more then likely loose unless they draw like shit.”</p><p>“While it’s hard to achieve a true 50/50 between going first and going second, if not impossible,” argued another, “this game’s balance between the two is atrocious, surely you could get closer than this, it feels like a good 70-30 split, if not worse.”</p><p>Card games have tried to balance the first-mover advantage in different ways. <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> doesn’t let whoever goes first draw a card in the first round, a consequential move given the big deck sizes and the importance keeping up momentum with new resources to deploy. <em>Hearthstone</em> deals with the issue by letting the second player mulligan an extra card and get a one-time extra mana boost. <em>Marvel Snap</em> side-steps the issue entirely by having both players play their turns simultaneously. And while the table-top version of <em>Pokémon TCG</em> still stops the first turn from attacking, it at least lets you attach an energy and get your hand rolling.</p><p>Someone will always have a slight advantage in <em>TCG Pocket</em> depending on the turn order. That’s why there’s a coin flip to help make that as random as possible. But it would still feel way better if the player who goes second got to do something extra, rather than just penalizing whoever goes first. It’s possible as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">new cards are added</a></span> to the game, the turn one advantage of playing extra cards will be more valuable—that’s even more likely given another of <em>Pocket</em>’s big changes from the full TCG: letting Trainer cards be played on that first turn.</p><p>But for now it’s only easily exploited by water decks running <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=aBlvs1ab1gc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=aBlvs1ab1gc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Misty trainers and Articuno EX</a></span>, and all of those players are scumbags anyway. <br></p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket encourages you to open packs, perform Wonder Picks, battle the AI and real-life opponents, and complete Missions. The latter is very interesting as Pokémon Pocket has unadvertised Secret Missions—but we know what they are and what they reward you with.</p>



<p>I don’t know what it is, but knowing a secret most people don’t is invigorating. It doesn’t make you feel special, but it’s cool having exclusive knowledge unknown to anyone else. Most of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s mechanics and functions are out in the open—even the famous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-bent-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bent Pack Trick</a>—but the community is largely in the dark about Secret Missions.</p>



<p>Daily Missions and Premium Missions are all well and good, but if you didn’t know, Pokémon TCG Pocket has several Secret Missions that take weeks to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-secret-missions-does-pokemon-tcg-pocket-have">How Many Secret Missions Does Pokémon TCG Pocket Have?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Secrets no more. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket has seven Secret Missions </strong>for you to chase, and believe me when I say—it could take you a <em>long time</em> to even finish one of them.</p>



<p>Depending on your propensity to procure Poké Gold, it’s conceivable that weeks pass before you tick off any of the missions. Each Secret Mission revolves around collecting cards in the Genetic Apex set. It’s entirely feasible more missions are added in Pokémon TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next expansions</a>, but for now, let’s concentrate on the initial Secret Missions.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pokemon-tcg-pocket-secret-mission-amp-rewards">Every Pokémon TCG Pocket Secret Mission &amp; Rewards</h2>



<p>To complete every Secret Mission in Pokémon TCG Pocket, you need to <strong>own every card in the Genetic Apex set</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a brutal proposition as this requires a ton of luck, time investment, and probably money. Without further ado, check out the list in full, their requirements, and your luxurious rewards for managing each impressive feat.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Secret Mission Name</th><th data-align="center">Mission Requirements</th><th data-align="center">Mission Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Complete the Kanto Pokedex!</td><td data-align="center">Complete the Kanto Pokedex by collecting all 151 Kanto region Pokemon cards.</td><td data-align="center">Mew</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 1 (Charizard)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Gloom, Pinsir, Charmander, Rapidash, Lapras, Alakazam, Slowpoke, and Meowth.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 2 (Mewtwo)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Bulbasaur, Cubone, Golbat, Weezing, Dragonite, Pidgeot, Ditto, and Porygon.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 3 (Pikachu)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Squirtle, Gyarados, Electrode, Diglett, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Eevee, and Snorlax.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Gym Leaders of the Kanto Region 2</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Brock, Misty, Lt.

<p>As you can see, these missions must be swiftly cleared. You get some of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s best cards, but you also get much-needed consumables: <strong>Hourglasses and Shop Tickets</strong>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has commented on the state of the AAA video game market, saying "it's hard and getting harder." He gave this answer in response to a question from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-take-twos-packed-2025-and-why-pc-is-increasingly-crucial-for-aaa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> about what he perceives to be the challenges of the AAA space today, against the backdrop of games like Star Wars: Outlaws coming up short in terms of financial performance.</p><p>"I think it's hard and it's getting harder. And that's true of all entertainment businesses as they begin to mature," he said. "The quality threshold that the consumer demands always goes up."</p><p>Zelnick claimed Take-Two is uniquely positioned to succeed in this challenging market because its core goals are to be the "most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient company in the entertainment industry."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1844545125" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>Five years is a milestone lifespan for any game, especially a live service title, so how does <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> continue to evolve and keep up with an ever-changing, ever-competitive space? Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to several of the development team about this new mode and the history of the Apex games so far, as well as discussing the new limited-time Launch Royale mode that takes you back to the very beginning to round off 2024.</p>
<p>"We've changed the game a lot since launch," design director Evan Nikolich told me. "Season 20 last February was a big change to the armour work, the pick ups and other things. It came around 'what would it feel like if we went back? What's the difference between the game we play today and the new game?" When asked why now was the right time to release Launch Royale, Nikolich said that it was now a good time for reflection on how far Apex had come. "It was a good time to show how much we've changed and evolved, and to celebrate our history. As we close out the year and head into another anniversary season there will be more change, so why not look back and reflect a little bit?"</p>
<p>Launch Royale is a limited-time mode that takes you back to the original Kings Canyon map almost exactly as it was when Apex Legends exploded overnight after shadow-dropping in 2019. This includes the first eight Legends as they were back then (no upgrades, plus their first sets of abilities) and original weapons that all worked together to mark the start of the Apex games.  Even the mode's teaser trailer, dropped on X the day of the new season launch, was an intentional callback to the first season's shadow drop.</p>

<p>Depending on when you first dove into the Apex games, Kings Canyon's original format may well be one you're fond of (as I am myself). It's been a long time since the original has been actively playable, but are there any new map secrets for players to look out for? Mode and Events lead Mike Button suggested the introduction of fresh Easter eggs had to balance bringing back a map fans were familiar with.</p><p>"You should see all the things you remember from the OG map, but it's not a full rebuild," Button told me. "We went back, with everything we could pull and dust off from that time." Kings Canyon has had a number of iterations over the years so it's worth noting that this version isn't the pure original build of this map, as some issues needed to be resolved by the map team to bring it to today's quality standards. "It should be as remembered," Button continued, "so if there were secrets in that OG map that people remember fondly, head into the map and search them out!" For me, after numerous evenings spent diving into this mode back in the day, the map is definitely how I remember - and even some older, playful strategies still work like sniping from the skeleton laying around Skull town.</p>

<p>Launch Royale as a mode has been an idea for a while, the team said, but Season 23 provided the best opportunity to bring it to life as its themes aligned for the game's Events team to finally bring it to life. As someone who was there for the original season, the goosebumps that crawled up my spine during my first match reminded me of just how important Kings Canyon was and is for Apex. Was it an easy job for the game's team to ensure their work still captured that same feeling now?</p>
<p>"It took time," Button said. "You want to get it right, especially something like this where there's a lot of nostalgia and you want to match people's memories. Some things we thought would be easy were super hard and some things we thought would be hard were easy, it was figuring it out to make it happen.'</p><p>Kevin Wolski, Senior Technical Game Designer, was part of the team that put together Launch Royale and was surprised how easy some parts were to bring back, including the weapons that ended up being the easiest to bring back to their original designs. Part of this was made easier by Respawn delving into an archive of game data that helped remind the team how specific things functioned back then. The Legends themselves, however, were harder to bring back, Wolski said, as they've evolved a lot more.</p>
<p>"For example, Lifeline's Revive Shield is something we had to dig up and make work again because her revive Drone ability has changed so many times," he noted. "It was a super fun process to dig all this stuff [up] and find 'can we even make Lifeline's Revival Shield work again? Do we even have these things left over? It was kind of like an archeological dig in certain ways."</p>

<p>It's not an exaggeration to say that the original Kings Canyon map was and is still an extremely important map for Apex, as it's where everything began. "Original Apex was taking a lot of old and existing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> spaces, stitching them together and getting the original Kings Canyon put together as quickly as possible," Nikolich said, highlighting that lessons were rapidly learned from this process.</p><p>The team quickly learned that stitched together deathmatch maps created high elevation points and 'death bowls', as Nikolich likes to call them. Lessons learned from this can be seen reflected in later maps, such as World's Edge and Olympus. "We've seen with Storm Point the ultimate compounding of the live game community but also our hyper competitive community as well," he said.</p>
<p>As a regular Apex player, its five years and 23 seasons have flown by. But for the team, each new update has provided plenty of lessons, not least from developing the continuously-evolving game in such a competitive field, and doing so while also maintaining a large player base. "We've definitely had some wins," Nikolich said, highlighting how important listening to the player base and aligning their taste with your own on the development side had been.  "The big one is that you've got to listen to the players," Nikolich continued. "As we've grown, being able to engage with players and get really good at listening to them is still something we're learning how to do every day as not everything hits all the time. So, we keep working on it."</p>

<p>A big example of how community feedback has helped evolve Apex and shape it into its current iteration is its Ranked mode. "[There have been] lots of lessons learned there and I think we're aligned, we're getting there," Nikolich said. "We've tried to be very responsive to the ranked changes, we've been on quite a journey with that. We're right on the forefront of 'what does it mean to be a ranked competitive game?'. We're not a Counter-strike or a Valorant where it's just two teams, so we've been on that journey for a while and [we're]  definitely trying to listen to the players [about things like] placements vs kills, combat and what does it mean to be a good ranked competitive Apex player?"</p><p>"When we've been out this long and been making so many changes, we can't be scared anymore," lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese said. "Nothing is sacred, challenge the status quo. What worked five years ago might not be working now. It's always looking internally at what we've done and always trying to push to greater heights. Sometimes that means making incredible risky changes and seeing how the player base likes or dislikes it. Then responding to the feedback they're giving us."</p>
<p>"This season and last season were showing that we're not scared to make even more rapid changes than we've done in the past," Canavese continued. An example of this is the reworked Lifeline that's dropped this season with multiple new abilities including gliding with the DOC drone and the introduction of Rift Relics as special ground loot coming from cosmic rifts littering the skies. "Even now we're continuing to learn and evolve, I'm really excited for the future and what that mentality will net us as we move forward," he teased.</p>

<p>Season 23 introduced the second rework of a Legend, with big changes to Lifeline. As well as a new base look (AJ is rocking the purple hair) her abilities also got an overhaul. "We've had a lot of safe changes we used to make in the past to try and make sure we keep things balanced," lead Legend designer Devin McGuire told me. "But they didn't hit with excitement or fervour, and characters fell under the radar when they were launched." Rampart's launch in Season 6 was one such example of this, which didn't land with fans despite care given to try and balance how powerful her Amped Cover Tactical would be. "We've been taking steps to be a less conservative with our changes to allow Legends to shine, to find the spots that hit with players and then peel them back into their rightful spot," McGuire said.</p><p>"Fast forward to something like Lifeline, back in the day we never would have considered adding a secondary passive that was also a movement ability," he continued, referring to her new ability to glide with DOC. "But the game has changed, it's evolved, sped up - people are more skilled and are evolving with the way the game has. Taking those risks for something that is fun and helps drive combat is something we have learned through this experience. We're now less afraid to do [this] because we know how to tune changes back if they get out of hand by knowing how movement abilities affect the game."</p>
<p>With a current roster of 26 Legends, it's hard to think that there are still places for the design team to go when bringing in new characters, but Devan suggested there are almost limitless possibilities when it comes to creating new ways to fight. "There are still areas we want to explore, there are more areas in the Recon space and the Control space of how to handle the field which isn't just putting down a big area you can't get through - we're actively looking there for opportunities. "Skirmishers and Assault characters are things that come naturally to us - anything that has movement on it is naturally a fun thing in Apex and there are lots of different ways to express movement that can lead to an ability or character's identity." Still, with such a large character roster, it takes longer to develop a unique take. "It takes us more time to find and carve out that niche amidst the cast already while not stomping on others toes or that's done better in that space already," McGuire concluded.</p>
<p>Where would the Legends be without their weapons in the Apex arena? Dead probably. But for the game's team, the same concerns apply when adding new guns, or revamping old favourites. "We have to be very careful about making sure that any addition is providing interesting new gameplay, that it's not another version of a gun we've already got," Canavese said. "We take it really seriously when adding content and that's why you may have noticed we've slowed down a bit on the weapons, because now we've got a healthy roster and we like the ecosystem it has given us.</p>
<p>That's not to say that further changes aren't possible, however. "Weapons that are still close to the same version of their former selves that I certainly want to look at are things like the Volt," he continued. "It's one of those great weapons that does what it does and does it well, but I think there's more we can do with it - we just don't know what that is yet." That promise of more seems to run throughout Apex Legends which, five years in, has plenty of life in it still.</p>

			<p>If you're trying to decide whether you should be playing Baldur's Gate 3 on PlayStation 5 or PC and are feeling a little bit daunted by the specification requirements on PC, don't panic. It's been tested and confirmed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-baldurs-gate-3-on-ps5-is-effectively-the-pc-version-at-ultra-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those over at Eurogamer</a> that the settings on PlayStation 5 are essentially the same as the settings on PC if you were to play it on Ultra. Of course, many people are unable to do so, as the game is very graphically intensive, the world is expansive, and there are lots of visual effects that you need to contend with. Baldur's Gate 3 has been out on PC for quite a while, and since the start of its release, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-available-for-mac-and-consoles/">a number of fixes</a> to work on making the performance of the game better for rigs of all capabilities. While there was some concern about how Baldur's Gate 3 would run on PC, it's been confirmed that it runs fine in Act Three, but it suffers some of the same issues that the PC version does.</p>
<p>While the game is very obviously tailored with a Keyboard and Mouse in mind, the game works just fine with a controller on both PS5 and PC. At the start of the game, it's quite tolerable, and although it looks a little bit odd, it works. However, the more abilities and items you unlock and use, the more complicated your radial menus will get, which can make the interface incredibly overwhelming.</p>
<p>Although this doesn't really affect the performance of the game on PS5 in any way, it does make it a little bit more finicky to work with. Visually, the PS5 version is very similar to that on PC, and it looks almost the same as how it would if the game was being played on PC in ultra settings. Compared to other games on the console, this comes as quite a surprise. As explained in the article by Eurogamer, there are only two options available for image quality on the PS5, with the game being native to 1440p, with no signs of reconstruction or dynamic resolution. If you're unsure whether you should be playing the game in Quality or Performance mode, it doesn't really make much difference.</p>
<p>The Performance mode on PS5 looks very similar to the Quality Mode, but there is a little bit of artifacting and fizzing artifacts in areas that feature a lot of fine detail. This is to be expected, especially considering how they've tried to keep the game running at the highest quality.</p>
<p>When it comes to the performance of the game, the Performance mode of Baldur's Gate 3 on PS5 targets 60fps. For the vast majority, it does do just that, especially if you're inside or in enclosed spaces, even during combat. However, there are some areas that will start to struggle. Even on PC, the city in Act 3 struggles massively, so it's not a surprise that it struggles on the PS5, too. From the tests that Eurogamer ran, it seems that the performance drops to the low twenties when it's at its worst. They've also mentioned that there is a fair amount of screen tearing when the frame rate starts to dip from 60. There is, of course, the option to play the game using the Quality Mode, which easily sees Baldur's Gate 3 run at a target of 30fps. Regardless of being in Quality Mode, you will still see some issues in Act 3, with how densely populated the city is.</p>
<p>Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 has been confirmed by many to run fine on PS5, as long as you can get over the radial menus and get used to how janky they become later on down the line.</p>

<p>In order to cut costs, you have to spend money. Unity revealed on Thursday that it had to spend $205 million as part of its restructuring efforts — which included mass layoffs — throughout 2024.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/16c99346-58d4-4022-924d-7cfefa4f7054.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to the company</a>, the money was spent mostly on “incremental” separation costs for the employees being let go. This included $127 million worth of “incremental stock-based compensation”. </p>



<h6 id="h-related-unity-s-new-ceo-nets-millions-months-after-layoffs-and-scandals">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-salary-new-bonus/">Unity’s New CEO Nets Millions Months After Layoffs and Scandals</a></h6>



<p>“Of the incremental employee separation costs, $15 million are within cost of revenue, $46 million are within research and development, $52 million are within sales and marketing, and $92 million are within general and administrative,” Unity said.</p>



<p>The company added that in they also had $45 million in restructuring costs related to office closures.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Unity announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to let go 25%</a> of its workforce. The decision was made to allow the company to “focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability”, according to CEO Jim Whitehurst.</p>



<p>The layoffs and changes came after Unity announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-to-charge-game-devs-per-game-install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial change</a> to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-apologizes-again-announces-major-changes-to-runtime-fee-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runtime fees</a>. A change that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-cancelling-controversial-runtime-fee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately reversed</a> after backlash.</p>



<p>As part of its earnings call, Unity revealed that it’ had $1.4 billion’s year-over-year revenue for the quarter fell to $446.5 million from $544.2. That’s despite operating expenses falling from $520.3 million to $461.6 million. Overall, the company reported a net loss  of $124.5 million for the third quarter.</p>

Growth in Microsoft’s subscription service has stalled in recent years, and the day one release of the latest entry in Activision’s phenomenally successful first-person shooter series was seen as a make or break moment for Game Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has yet to say exactly how many new subscribers Black Ops 6 brought through the door, although CEO Satya Nadella has confirmed that Game Pass set a record for new subs on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie, who has worked on Call of Duty for 16 years, said Black Ops 6’s release on Game Pass has helped convince players who were “on the fence” to give the game a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we've seen is it's allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, 'I haven't played in a while' to actually come back and try the game," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That will be music to Microsoft’s ears, given it’s desperate to expand the Call of Duty audience in the long term. Analysts have suggested the company was willing to sacrifice Black Ops 6 launch sales on Xbox for a potential bigger overall player base, which it intends to monetize long-term with the release of battle passes and cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've gotten to the point now where Black Ops and Call of Duty have been around so long - I've been working on it for 16 years," Leslie added. "And really the challenge for us is how do you bring along the fans that love Call of Duty, but how do you create an environment where you can welcome new fans in?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trick now of course is to convince Game Pass players to stick around and keep paying that monthly subscription.

These co-op missions are set during the game’s campaign, but with different characters who are off doing other missions that tie in to the events that follow main character Titus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Operations mode restricts a squad to one Space Marine of each class. So, for example, it is impossible to have an all-sniper team (developer Saber has said this is a deliberate design decision to encourage “strategic variety.”)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is Space Marine 2 will actively matchmake you into a group with a player who is the same class as the one you have selected. In-game, there is an area of the Battle Barge where players must “assemble” before an Operations mode mission kicks off. The countdown only begins when all three players have selected a different class. This means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together">you can end up in awkward standoffs where two or more players want to be the same class</a>, each waiting for the other to blink first and switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a frustration that often bubbles up on Space Marine 2 Discords, subreddits, and on social media as players work to level up certain classes above others. Staff at Saber have said class matching is on the cards, but modders have already gone one step further and removed the class limits in Operations mode entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astartes Overhaul, from Tom, aka Warhammer Workshop, is perhaps the most significant mod yet for Space Marine 2. This massive upgrade to Space Marine 2 gameplay, available to download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/89" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus</a>, lets players select any squad configuration without class restrictions, among many other changes that affect the balance of Operations mode. So, if you want an all-sniper team, you can have it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/sm2-1731072484969.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2 modders have unlocked customization options currently unavailable otherwise.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, the changes Space Marine 2 mods make to the Space Marines themselves, whether it’s a purely aesthetic customization not normally possible or certain classes using weapons and equipment they’re not supposed to, can be seen online by other players in public PvE sessions. While Space Marine 2 uses dedicated servers, a lot of the game elements are client-side controlled. So if you’re playing with random players, there’s a chance you might see things like Bulwarks wielding Thunder Hammers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-update-40-secretly-clamped-down-on-pvp-modding-publisher-confirms-but-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-pve-modding">Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment has confirmed to IGN that it has no problem whatsoever with PvE modding</a>, but Tom is playing it safe. He recommends those who use the Astartes Overhaul mod stick to private lobbies “to minimize disruption to other players' games.” “Keeping the Overhaul in private lobbies helps ensure a positive experience for all players,” he continued. “Your support in keeping things balanced is hugely appreciated!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No class limits in Operations isn’t all the Astartes Overhaul mod does. It even adds allied reinforcements to the Operations missions.

			<p>Gaijin Entertainment has not one but two games enhanced for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's newly released PS5 Pro console</a> at launch: the first-person tactical multiplayer WWII shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/military-online-shooter-enlisted-open-beta-is-now-available-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enlisted</a>, originally released in 2020, and the vehicle combat multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/cross-play-between-pc-ps4-xb1-is-finally-out-in-war-thunder-after-over-a-year-of-talks-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">War Thunder</a>, which has been continuously updated since 2013.</p>
<p>To learn how both games have been improved to leverage the most powerful console hardware currently on the market, we interviewed Gergo Horvath, a Graphics Programmer on Gaijin's proprietary Dagor Engine for over four years. Horvath admitted that the PlayStation 5 Pro's improvement over the PS5 is smaller than that seen in the previous generation between PS4 Pro and PS4, but he believes the console achieves its goal anyway, mainly thanks to PSSR, which he reckons is superior to AMD FSR and on the same level of NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>While the ~45% faster rendering is impressive alone, the real game changer, in my opinion, is the addition of the Machine Learning Architecture that made PSSR possible. By being able to render in lower resolutions and yet get the same visual fidelity we can free up a tremendous amount of resources. This tech will be especially useful when paired with ray tracing.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>I’d say the difference between the PS5 Pro and the PS5 is less substantial compared to the difference between the last-gen console and its Pro counterpart. In the PS5 Pro, we have little to no change in CPU performance, and while the GPU got a nice boost, the difference is much less significant: the PS4 Pro had more than doubled the nominal power of its predecessor's GPU (in terms of TFLOPS). With that being said, back then, the goal was to achieve 4K gaming. This time, it looks like the main focus was on providing substantially better ray tracing. Goal achieved in both cases.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game? Can you share specific details on the target resolution and frame rate and whether there will be multiple modes to choose from?</strong></p>
<p>For the PS5 Pro’s release of Enlisted, we have switched from a fixed resolution to using dynamic resolution together with upscaling techniques for both the Base and the Pro version of the console to make sure we have a stable frame rate at all times while the internal rendering resolution is automatically adjusted. This made 4K@120FPS gaming possible for PS5 Pro players. On the PS5 Pro, this will mean higher rendering resolution, which will lead to more detail rich and sharper visuals. With the faster memory, we could use higher resolution textures and better looking global illumination, which together enhance details even further.</p>
<p>Upscaling from the internal rendering resolution to the display’s resolution is taken care of by our own TAAU implementation for Base PS5, but we are using PSSR for the Pro version. PSSR, of course, does a better job. For the PS5 Pro’s release of War Thunder we’ll offer the opportunity to play the game at 4K@120FPS resolution from day one. More visual updates will follow with the next major update release in a week, and even more are under development.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to other upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>We’re currently using it in Enlisted. During development and playtesting, we’ve found PSSR to be on par with NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS, the other two ML based super resolution methods. While in my opinion PSSR produces less blur, ghosting, and unwanted flicker compared to AMD FSR. These technologies are constantly improving, so I find it impressive that the first version of PSSR is already head-to-head with other more mature solutions.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say we are about 75% to being maxed-out for Enlisted. We’ll give our estimate for War Thunder later when we’ll have all our visual updates implemented.</p>
<p><strong>The big controversy about Sony's new console is pricing. Based on the hardware, do you believe it to be fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>It’s always up to the gamers to decide whether the console pricing is up to their expectations or not. Calculating a “fair price” by assessing hardware alone does not make much sense, as gamers usually make their decision based on new experiences offered by a device, and not based on the hardware alone.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date">last month's Version 5.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.2 officially arrives on November 20th, alongside the long-awaited Xbox Series X|S version of the game. There's still no word on when - or, at this point, whether - the game will be appearing on Switch, however.</p>

<p>In any case, Version 5.2 will introduce two new Saurians to get to grips with: Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. They'll help you to reach new areas, find hidden treasure, and even engage enemies in combat, and they'll be introduced alongside two new Natlan clans, the Flower-Feather Clan and the Masters of the Night Wind.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.2-release-date-iktomisaur.jpg?itok=BM4koSco 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.2-release-date-iktomisaur.jpg?itok=2_tjJBUa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adorable new Saurians are waiting for you to discover them when&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.2 arrives later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>As you've probably guessed, this update's two new characters each hail from one of the above clans. Chasca, the Peacemaker of the Flower-Feather Clan, is a five-star Anemo bow user who can "float and attack mid-air".</p>

<p>She's joined by Ororon, a four-star bow user who wields the Electro element. He can deal damage, taunt enemies, and even boost your team's gliding speed, making him invaluable in exploration as well as combat.</p>

<p>Both characters will debut as part of the first half of Version 5.2's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-celebrates-version-40-release-with-lyneys-gameplay-trailer">Lyney</a>. In the second half of the update's cycle, you can expect reruns of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zhongli-conducts-in-lovely-genshin-impact-anime-style-trailer-teasing-upcoming-concert">Zhongli</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-reveals-handsome-new-characters-neuvillette-wriothesley">Neuvillette</a>.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to new story quests, a brand new boss to take on, and "an array of quality-of-life updates" to make your&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>gameplay experience smoother.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/humankind-developer-amplitude-studios-splits-from-sega-and-goes-indie.1030866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amplitude-studios-sega-split-indie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Humankind&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Endless Dungeon&nbsp;</em>developer Amplitude Studios has announced that it's split from Sega and gone independent, with the studio describing the move as a return to its "roots".</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1124300/view/4465975096247320950" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>&nbsp;(which can be seen across all of Amplitude's games on the platform), Amplitude says its journey with Sega "has been amazing", but that ownership of the studio has returned "to some of our original founders and members of the team".</p>

<p>According to Amplitude, its parting with Sega happened on "good terms", and the studio remains committed to "working closely with our players", which it says is still very much at the "heart of our philosophy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-endless-legend.jpg?itok=q48AdpjT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-endless-legend.jpg?itok=ZeWbq08T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Endless Legend&nbsp;</em>developer Amplitude Studios has said goodbye to its former owner Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned Steam post, Amplitude founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis says the studio currently has two projects in development, describing them as "exciting", although he doesn't elaborate on what they might be.</p>

<p>He also says Amplitude is "backed by strong and meaningful franchises", and that the decision to go independent allows the studio to "be more agile in our approach".</p>

<p>Amplitude Studios was first founded back in 2011, with ex-Ubisoft staffers de Waubert de Genlis and Mathieu Girard setting up the company. The first game released by Amplitude was 2012's&nbsp;<em>Endless Space</em>, which kicked off the&nbsp;<em>Endless&nbsp;</em>series of strategy-focused games.</p>

<p>Said series continued with 2014's turn-based 4X game&nbsp;<em>Endless Legend</em>&nbsp;and tower defense roguelike&nbsp;<em>Dungeon of the Endless</em>, which was released in the same year. Following these releases, Sega snapped up Amplitude in 2016.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-dungeon-of-the-endless.jpg?itok=WdVRWsbJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-dungeon-of-the-endless.jpg?itok=h_pO6JOy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amplitude Studios is working on two new games, although we don't know what they are yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Amplitude's first game under Sega's wing was 2017's&nbsp;<em>Endless Space 2</em>, a followup to the developer's debut game, and that was followed up by an experimental visual novel,&nbsp;<em>Love Thyself - A Horatio Story</em>, which is again set in the&nbsp;<em>Endless&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>It wouldn't take long for Amplitude to return to strategy development, though, with 2021's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/humankind">Humankind</a>&nbsp;</em>(not to be confused with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ancestors-humankind-odyssey"><em>Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</em></a>) attempting to rival&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>in terms of scope and system complexity.</p>

<p>The studio's most recent project is&nbsp;<em>Endless Dungeon</em>, a successor to-come-reimagining of <i>Dungeon of the Endless&nbsp;</i>that features a new 3D art style and plenty of additional mechanics to wrap your brain around.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's creative director has commented on how Game Pass positively affected the game's launch, saying it helped improve player numbers in multiple ways.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bbbc.news.twitter%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D&amp;at_link_id=67BD7544-9D06-11EF-9772-A1520462CD00&amp;at_link_type=web_link&amp;at_campaign=Social_Flow&amp;at_format=link&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;at_ptr_name=twitter&amp;at_bbc_team=editorial&amp;at_link_origin=BBCNews&amp;at_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, Miles Leslie said Game Pass helped convince people who were "on the fence" or "had some of that friction" to consider playing the game. He added that some people who might not have played a Call of Duty game in some time might have been convinced to "come back and try the game" thanks to Game Pass.</p><p>"We've gotten to the point now where Black Ops and Call of Duty have been around so long--I've been working on it for 16 years," Leslie said. "And really the challenge for us is how do you bring along the fans that love Call of Duty, but how do you create an environment where you can welcome new fans in?"</p><p>Black Ops 6 launched on October 25 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">set a number of records for number of players</a>, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella specifically mentioned Black Ops 6 helping to drive Game Pass subscribers at launch. Anyone who has Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) or PC Game Pass ($12/month) can play Black Ops 6 as part of their subscription for as long as their membership remains active. The game is also available for direct purchase on Xbox, as well as PlayStation and PC.</p><p>Before this, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he anticipated Call of Duty helping to drive Game Pass subscribers for Microsoft, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">only for a period of time.</a> As Zelnick sees it, releasing a major new game into a subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">makes little sense and is a "lost opportunity" for sales.</a> Zelnick, of course, runs a third-party publisher and has his own set of unique opinions for his business that might not compare directly to Microsoft's own business objectives.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft putting Black Ops 6 could lead to up to six million in lost sales; he estimated that 25% of existing Game Pass subscribers would have bought it anyway. Pachter said Microsoft could see as many as four million new Game Pass subscribers thanks to Black Ops 6.</p><p>Microsoft has not yet provided any specifics on Black Ops 6 unit sales. The game is also available on PlayStation and PC, where it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">enjoying strong year-over-year sales compared to 2023's Modern Warfare III.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 welcomes its first major update, the Season 1 launch, on November 14. It adds new multiplayer maps and modes, along with more guns and even a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-lets-you-become-a-gruesome-killer-with-power-drill-melee-weapon/1100-6527640/" data-ref-id="1100-6527640">power drill melee weapon</a>. November 14 is also the day when Black Ops 6 gets integrated into Call of Duty: Warzone, and when the new Warzone map, Area 99, arrives.</p>

href="https://t.co/azHqjVVSAu" rel="nofollow ">official inZOI Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"First, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to inZOI fans around the world. Your immense love and interest mean everything to us. I was especially touched by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/inzoi-blew-us-away-with-just-how-much-stuff-you-can-do-gamescom-2024/2300-6464969/">the wonderful reception we received at Gamescom</a>, and it was incredible to see everyone creating such unique Zois during our 'inZOI: Character Studio' demo period," Kim said.</p><p dir="ltr">After expressing gratitude to the many players who tried out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-upcoming-the-sims-competitor-shares-dev-roadmap-and-stunning-character-creator/1100-6523036/">the game's Zoi creator</a> during a community test-run of the feature, Kim detailed the reasons behind the delay.</p><p dir="ltr">"After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have decided to release inZOI in early access on March 28, 2025," Kim revealed. "We apologize that we couldn't bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI--a game that we will be nurturing together from its early access birth. This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible."</p><p dir="ltr">As incredible as it looks, inZOI has several other competitors in the life-sim genre. Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/life-by-you/">Life By You</a> was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-by-you-the-highly-anticipated-life-sim-has-been-canceled/1100-6524334/">canceled</a>, another life sim called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118520/Paralives/" rel="nofollow ">Paralives</a> is set to enter early access sometime in early 2025, and EA has reaffirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wont-drop-sims-4-support-when-project-rene-comes-out/1100-6526534/">its commitment to improving The Sims 4</a> while also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-project-rene/">Project Rene</a>, a multiplayer Sims-like experience. Still, inZOI includes a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-gamescom-trailer-shows-the-joy-and-pain-of-everyday-life/1100-6525913/">plethora of interesting features</a>, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-life-sim-inzoi-you-can-crash-cars-ride-rollercosters-and-commune-with-ghosts/1100-6526125/">Zois crashing their cars to communing with ghosts</a>, that--combined with its stunning visuals--have players eager to get their hands on the game. But Kim says the wait will be worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">"Until the release date, we'll continue working to improve any areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation," he explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Kim ended his letter with a promise to keep fans updated on the game's future, and said the development stream is striving to create a life sim with a healthy lifespan.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come."</p>
