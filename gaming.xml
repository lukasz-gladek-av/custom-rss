In the world of Umamusume: Pretty Derby, racehorses are reborn as cute anime girls, complete with equine ears and tails. The franchise started off in 2018 as an anime, followed by a Japan-only release of the mobile game in 2021. In the game, players can talk to, train and manage horse-girls like Special Week and Mejiro McQueen, sharing in their triumphs and losses. As a result, the Umamusume franchise has inspired a cult following, and apparently many fans have become interested in the real-life Japanese racehorses behind their favorite characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in their enthusiasm, it seems that some fans may have caused distress to their favorites and their owners in real life. As previously reported by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/umamusume-pretty-derby-devs-urge-fans-to-not-pester-real-life-racehorses-3224393/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>, Cygames shared guidelines for those who want to visit real-life racehorses in Japan, reminding people that you can’t just rock up to a ranch and that horses are easily startled by loud noises and camera flashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 9-point guideline was created by the <a href="https://uma-furusato.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Racehorse's Hometown Information Center</u></a>. The first two points urge would-be visitors to check with the center for tour availability and to confirm tour times before visiting. The rules also remind visitors to follow the instructions of ranch staff at all times, to refrain from smoking on-site, and not to enter stables or pastures without permission. The rest of the rules are centered on the horses’ wellbeing — don’t make loud noises and refrain from touching, feeding or taking flash photography of the horses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/image005-1752142593002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby's English language launch has exploded.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Cygames has been fostering strong connections to the Japanese horse racing world — it often shows up alongside and provides support for racehorse-related exhibits at events in Japan, and has donated to the Retired Racehorse Association of Japan (source: <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20240304-27999/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>).

            <p>The infamous stapler used by GameStop that ruined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch day for some customers has now been put up for auction.</p>
<p>As we reported previously, one retail store in New York was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-ends-in-disappointment-for-some-as-major-retailer-accidentally-staples-receipts-into-consoles-screen">stapling customers' receipts to the console's packaging</a>, damaging screens in the process.</p>
<p>Now - in an offer of goodwill, but also something of a publicity stunt - GameStop has put the stapler up for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731">auction on eBay</a>, with proceeds benefitting Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a charity founded over 40 years ago, and has raised over $9bn for 170 children's hospitals.</p>

<p>The stapler is being offered alongside a Switch 2 console and a certificate of authenticity for the bundle.</p>
<p>Reads the certificate: "The black stapler used by a GameStop associate who, in a moment of launch night excitement and misjudged enthusiasm, stapled a receipt directly to a customer's new Nintendo Switch 2 box - puncturing both cardboard and screen in one swift motion. Features authentic field-use wear throughout and retired immediately from service, the stapler now stands as a retail legend born from a half-second decision."</p>
<p>The included console is also the first to be stapled, though GameStop assures the screen has been repaired. It will arrive in the original, stapled packaging, and also include the actual staple "carefully extracted and preserved".</p>
<p>As per eBay, the item is in "used" condition: "The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended." At the time of writing, the auction stands at almost $109K, with another six days until it ends.</p>
<p>Following the launch day incident, GameStop stated staplers "have been confiscated" and that their use was "isolated to one store".</p>

<p>Despite this stapling incident, the Switch 2 launch was a success for Nintendo. With 3.5m units sold worldwide in its first four days on sale, it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware ever</a>.</p>
<p>And if children are unable to afford a Switch 2, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-president-says-children-should-engage-with-its-characters-elsewhere-if-they-cant-afford-a-switch-2">plenty of other ways for them to engage with Nintendo characters</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-ruining-stapler-now-up-for-online-charity-auction-by-gamestop]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has announced that they are ending the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Switch Online</a> subscribers, removing them from sale on 30th January 2026.</p>
<p>Any vouchers purchased prior to the end of the programme will still be valid for use for the usual 12 months before they expire, but no further vouchers will be sold after 11:59 PM in your local market on 30th January 2026. So the vouchers will last until 30th January 2027.</p>


<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were introduced as part of Nintendo Switch Online, a popular way of getting Nintendo’s games at a discount, outside of rare sale periods. Purchased in a pair for $100 / £84, you could then redeem these vouchers against two games from a curated catalogue of titles. With games often priced at $60 / £50, this could net a combined saving of $20 / £16. Potentially even more, as the £60 Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also a part of the program, and the new and upcoming titles, such as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, can also be included.</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall for this program when Nintendo announced increased game prices for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers can only be redeemed against Switch games, as it stands, so the aforementioned Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Tears of the Kingdom would then need a further upgrade to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>

<p>The value of the offer can also be seen to be diminishing for savvy gamers who are happy to wait for Nintendo to put parts of their back catalogue on sale. At those times, games can drop to around £30, which is obviously a much larger discount.</p>

<figure><a title="GameStop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9650f1602f54c/gamestop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Remember when GameStop made the news following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">unfortunate incident involving a newly-bought Switch 2 console and a stapler</a>? Yeah, one store thought it wise to staple receipts onto the Switch 2 box, puncturing the cardboard and damaging the screen of the Switch inside.</p>
<p>It wasn't a good look for the company, but now, GameStop is looking to turn the whole thing into a positive by auctioning off the stapler and the damaged Switch 2 on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">eBay</a>, with all proceeds going to Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.</p>

<p>And y'know what, fair play! Yes, it's a massive publicity stunt to save face, but it's a decent one at that, and bidding has already reached <strong>$108,895</strong> at the time of writing with over 6 days remaining.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">GameStop tried to make light of the whole situation</a> in the days following the staple incident, but wound up getting into even more trouble when it became evident the company used someone else's photo without providing credit. It posted a joke announcing restocks of the Switch 2 along with the tagline "Staples not included", but the photo used belonged to Janelle Jones of Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Water under the bridge, and all that. GameStop gets a lot wrong, but this might be one of those rare occasions in which it's made a pretty good decision. Keep going.</p>

            <p>It's been years, Gerry from the Riviera, but you can finally stop knocking on a certain Duchess' door in the hopes she'll let you see whether some Elven staircases are as spirally as you remember. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> modder has used REDKit to open those doors and had a crack at making a lore-accurate interior for Beauclair Palace, the posh setting of the fantasy game's Blood and Wine expansion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's the latest in an ongoing series of location revamps by snappily-named modder "OlivierR45455566465", after getting their hands on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s handy modding tools. They've previously done stuff like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9563?tab=description">restoring Kaer Morhen</a> to the glory it might have had before it hosted ten million witchery fights. The modder also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9835">rebuilt the manor</a> that ends up a bit on fire in the game's other DLC, Hearts of Stone.</p>
<p>For the last few months, OlivierR's been working on this latest project, which is all about letting players waltz through some doors to explore "an expanded and book-accurate Beauclair Palace". It's something folks have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher3/comments/ro58s8/are_there_any_known_mods_to_explore_inside/">requesting for years</a>, and to make it possible, the modder's built a full interior for the upper section of the palace.</p>
<p>These newly explorable sections comprise two main buildings, with the likes of the three-floor main tower, plus the Duchess' bedroom and throne room. That's in addition to a bunch of areas described in the Witcher books, such as the knights' hall, the library, and a secret chamber. You can also take a gander at the treasure room or just chill in one of the many living rooms.</p>
<p>"Even though I had to work under severe restrictions, due to the fact I was once more working inside an already built exterior, I have tried to remain as faithful as I possibly could to the books and the game, both in the aspects and in the content of the modifications I made," wrote OlivierR.</p>
<p>They've even taken extra steps like setting up a bunch of new NPCs with their own routines to patrol the rooms, tweaked the volume of each area, and "corrected some structural inconsistencies" the palace had. Plus, some dynamic changes will happen when you finish certain Blood and Wine quests.</p>
<p>Once the mod's installed and you've launched the game with Blood &amp; Wine enabled, you'll be able to wander into the palace at any time. It's a cool addition to the sightseeing I know I always do whenever I arrive in Beauclair, even though I've already seen every nook and cranny of not-France a million times.</p>
<p>Plus, it makes sense Gerry would want to reminisce about his adventures in bookland. Now all we're waiting for is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-literally-called-weeee-lets-you-leave-your-flat-via-a-big-slide-like-a-bin-batman">massive palace slide</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fancy-snooping-around-the-witcher-3-palace-from-blood-and-wine-well-this-mod-gives-it-a-book-accurate-interior]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-just-a-week-after-krafton-fired-studio-co-founders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-just-a-week-after-krafton-fired-studio-co-founders.1240122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just a week after Krafton replaced the co-founders and leaders of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer Unknown Worlds, the company has now confirmed that the game’s early access release will be delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>There’s been plenty speculation over the reason why Krafton removed the studio leaders last week, with a $250 million bonus on the line and the possibility that Subnautica 2’s release could be delayed. Having reviewed the purchase agreement for the studio in 2021, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> is able to report that the $250 million bonus was due to kick in if Unknown Worlds was able to hit a revenue target by the end of 2025. With no Subnautica 2 launch this year, the studio is unlikely to hit that target, and so employees could miss out, per Bloomberg’s anonymous sources.</p>


<p>So it’s no surprise now that Krafton is adamant that the firings and delay have absolutely nothing to do with any kind of bonus agreement, while founder Charlie Cleveland claims that the game was ready for an early access release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/embed/inset/iframe">a blog post on the series subreddit</a>, Cleveland said, “We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">In a contrary statement, Krafton said that the delay stemmed from feedback from early tests and “It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations.”</p>

<p data-component="paragraph">Meanwhile, in a town hall meeting with new CEO Steve Papoutsis, he said, “The desire of Krafton is to have the very best version of <em>Subnautica 2</em> available for its early access. While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, ‘Hey we should launch this,’ that wasn’t where both parties aligned around.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">That does seem to suggest that an Early Access was plausible with the game as it is now. However, he added “it’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">It’s an ugly mess for a game that was one of the most highly-anticipated titles on Steam for this year (or any year, to be honest).</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">But at least the co-founders are now free to go and make more games. Signing off on his blog, Cleveland says, “I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends.”</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> is being delayed into 2026 by its publishers Krafton, which would lead to the survival game's studio missing out on a previously agreed $250 million bonus, meant to be shared among employees. The revelation comes via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout">a report from Bloomberg</a>, and could finally explain why Krafton ousted the studio's most senior figures last week. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Three higher-ups at the studio were summarily <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">kicked out last week</a> and "replaced" with the CEO of Striking Distance, Steve Papoutsis. The studio's original co-founder, Charlie Cleveland, was one of those who felt the sharp toecap of Krafton's boot, and has since said it came as a "shock". </p>
<p>In a letter posted to social media, Cleveland wrote that the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">"ready for early access"</a>. This is in contradiction to Krafton, who have spoken about delivering "the right game at the right time" and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-creators-offer-no-explanation-for-sudden-regime-change-instead-promise-no-loot-boxes">communicated via Unknown Worlds</a> that there would be an "update to our schedule". </p>

<p>However, during an all-hands meeting, workers at Unknown Worlds questioned new CEO Papoutsis about the reasons for a planned delay. And those clever sneaks at Bloomberg heard a recording of his response.</p>
<p>When asked about the coup and the intended delay, Papoutsis reportedly said: "While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, 'Hey we should launch this,' that wasn’t where both parties aligned around." (Let us award the producer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> some corpopoints for using "aligned around" instead of human language like "agreed".)  </p>
<p>When asked whether a delay was being enacted to avoid paying out the bonus, Papoutsis replied: "It’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that."</p>
<p>We've contacted Krafton for comment. They have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus">confirmed the delay to IGN</a>. A <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026">statement</a> on Unknown Worlds' website says the delay is meant "to give ourselves a little extra time." </p>
<p>"[The] events of this week have been quite a shock," said Cleveland in that letter to fans. "We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p>
<p>It's good at least to have a little clarity about the reasons why such a dramatic power shuffle has occured. The former Unknown Worlds leadership and Krafton disagreed about the game's readiness, and both parties had an incentive to be right. In this case, Krafton used a blugeon to settle the issue.</p>
<p>In April, Krafton <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-achieves-record-high-quarterly-sales-in-q1-2025/">reported record profits</a> in the first quarter of 2025, hitting $608 million in sales and $308 million in operating profit. Its CEO, Kim Chang-han, <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/it/11267646">received a bonus</a> last year of $3.9 million.</p>
<p>Subnautica 2 is the second most wishlisted game on Steam, only beaten by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> is officially delayed to 2026, publisher Krafton has confirmed to IGN. The news follows a report that claimed the delay may cost the development team a $250 million bonus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton, the Korean company behind smash hit battle royale PUBG, acquired the $500 million-valued Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds in October 2021. At the time, Krafton insisted Unknown Worlds would continue to operate as an independent outfit. Following its announcement, the hotly anticipated Subnautica 2 was set for an early access release later in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, last week, Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill, were replaced by former Striking Distance CEO, Steve Papoutsis, in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">a shakeup that shocked the Subnautica community and sparked concern over the sequel’s future</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleveland subsequently revealed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit</u></a> that while he and his colleagues believed Subnautica 2 was "ready for early release... that decision is in Krafton's hands." Krafton issued a community update of its own, suggesting a delay was incoming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, earlier this week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reported that Subnautica 2 was delayed to 2026 — just months before it was due to pay a $250 million bonus to the development team. Bloomberg added that the delay was “against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership,” and that the $250 million bonus would have kicked in if Unknown Worlds hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. Without Subnautica 2 coming out this year, hitting those revenue targets is unlikely, and the bonus won’t be paid out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Bloomberg:</p><blockquote>Unknown Worlds’ leadership planned to share the additional money with all of the studio’s employees, which number around 100. Staff who were at the company at the time of the acquisition were told they were eligible for bonuses ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to seven figures, the people said.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Krafton has made Subnautica 2’s delay to 2026 official, but in a statement to IGN, it insisted the decision had nothing to do with “any contractual or financial considerations.” Instead, Krafton claimed, the delay was about responding to feedback from playtests, and delay talks were already under discussion before Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were outed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Krafton’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>During playtests for Subnautica 2, we received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game's direction. At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release.</blockquote><blockquote>As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience. As a result, Subnautica 2’s Early Access launch has been rescheduled for 2026.</blockquote><blockquote>This decision was based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players. It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations. Additionally, the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans, the wait for Subnautica 2 goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sag-aftra-union-reach-tentative-agreement-with-game-companies-that-could-end-the-latest-voice-actor-strike">"tentative agreement" reached last month</a> between video game voice actors represented by union <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> and companies including Activision, Insomniac, and EA, the 11-month strike is now over. A new contract has been approved, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-video-game-agreement">"effective immediately"</a>. with 95% of participating union members voting in favour, with 5% opposed.</p>
<p>The terms of the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/2025%20Interactive%20Media%20%28Video%20Game%29%20Agreement%20Summary.pdf">Interactive Media Agreement</a> include increased performer compensation, including overtime rates, and "guardrails" against AI - "including consent and disclosure requirements for A.I. digital replica use and the ability for performers to suspend consent for the generation of new material during a strike".</p>

<p>“We are pleased that SAG-AFTRA members have ratified a new Interactive Media Agreement, which delivers historic wage increases, industry-leading A.I. protections, and enhanced health and safety measures for performers," said spokesperson Audrey Cooling, "on behalf of the video game producers that are party to the agreement".</p>
<p>Those enhanced health and safety measures, as <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-members-ratify-new-interactive-media-contract-conclude-year-long-strike">Game Developer</a> note, mean trained medical staff will need to be present at rehearsals and performances that plan "hazardous actions or working conditions". Employers also won't be able to request actors do dangerous stunts in auditions, and performers will have mandated rests.</p>
<p>In terms of AI protections, the new contract will ensure performers receive specified minimum payments for use of digital replicas made from their performances, higher compensation from the use of chatbots based on their performances, and payments when their performances are used in future projects.</p>
<p>Last January, SAG-AFTRA struck a deal with the <a href="https://www.replicastudios.com/">now-closed Replica Studios</a> to allow voice actors to license 'digital replicas' of their likenesses and voices. "We have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances,” said the union's director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland at the time, with union's announcement calling the move "approved by affected members of the union’s voiceover performer community”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">This drew criticism from several prominent actors</a>, including Deux Ex: Human Revolution's Elias Toufexis. "I would humbly consider myself one of the top voice actors working in games," the actor said back then, "No one asked me about this. No one reached out for my opinion. From what I'm seeing, no one asked any of my peers either."</p>
<p>The Interactive Media Agreement classifies these "Digital Replicas" as either "Vocal" or "Visual", defined as being capable of "algorithmically generating new performances" in the voice or likeness of a specific performer. The now-ratified contract requires clear consent from performers, including knowledge of a “reasonably specific description of intended use”, specifying things like genre, profanity, violent or sexual content, stunts, and whether the performer will be reprising a specific role.</p>
<p>There's also this bit, which I'm sure is necessary, but also makes for some fascinatingly grim reading.</p>
<blockquote><p>4) Deceased Performers:</p>
<p>(a) Consent that Performers grant during their lifetimes shall continue to be valid after death unless explicitly limited otherwise at the time of the initial consent.</p>
<p>(b) If Performer is deceased at the time Employer seeks consent, Employer shall obtain the consent of the authorized representative (e.g., their estate).</p>
<p>(c) If the deceased Performer’s authorized representative cannot be identified or located, consent may be obtained from the Union.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the contract is largely being celebrated as a victory for union members, SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-vas-are-starting-to-call-for-the-end-of-the-sag-aftra-strike.1195908/">received criticism from actors</a> for allegedly prolonging the negotiations process after the sought-for AI protections were in place, making it difficult for performers to get work.</p>
<p>My favourite characterisation I've read of these fairly dry stipulations was Chris Kerr's over at <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-proposed-ai-protections-will-let-performers-send-their-digital-replicas-on-strike">Game Developer</a>, who points out that performers now effectively have the ability to send their digital replicas on strike. If <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">James Earl Jones called me a scab I'd probably cry</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-over-with-new-ai-agreements-reached-over-digital-replicas]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a while since we heard anything about Marvel's Blade. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-announced-arkane-lyon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at the 2023 The Game Awards event, when we learned that Arkane Lyon, the studio behind Dishonored and Deathloop, would be behind it. </p>



<p>The only other thing we know about it is that Marvel's Blade <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkanes-blade-game-to-run-in-deathloops-and-dishonored-2s-void-engine-senior-lighting-artist-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be powered by Arkane's own Void Engine</a>, previously seen in the aforementioned games, thus making Arkane Lyon one of the few studios that still sticks to proprietary technology instead of switching to Epic's Unreal Engine 5, as so many big studios have done (CD Projekt RED and Crystal Dynamics, to name two).</p>



<p>But what is the development status of the game? Well, it seems like it just entered full production. The information was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timur222.bsky.social/post/3ltlhwfmlac2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by eagle-eyed videogame enthusiast and 'Internet explorer' Timur222, who discovered it in Arkane Lyon's 2024 financial document (written in French), where the studio wrote:</p>



<p><em>Game development activities exclusively for the ZeniMax/Microsoft group are continuing. The production phase of the AAA game project was able to begin at the end of 2024, following prototype validation.</em></p>



<p>Marvel's Blade is the only triple-A game in development at Arkane. There can be no confusion there, especially after Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed the Austin-based sister studio last year</a>. Given the average triple-A game development time and the fact that Deathloop launched in September 2021, the game's release window will likely occur between 2026 and 2027, probably in the latter year. </p>



<p>Needless to say, we'll report any other leaks or rumors ahead of the official unveiling. Stay tuned.</p>

The funding will go directly to the salary of the person hired to archive toy catalogs, a crucial task for the museum. But the other, earmarked for a new exhibit called "Beyond the Buzzer: Game Shows in America," has been cut. The museum plans to proceed with both projects, but scope, timing, and size is in limbo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jon-Paul Dyson, Strong Museum senior vice president and director of the International Center for the History of Electronic Games, told Game Developer that the museum receives around 700,000 guests a year and explained its funding comes from admissions and memberships, plus a trust that supports the museum. The grants aren't essential to the day-to-day functions of the museum, but enable it to take on special projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This work of preserving games, celebrating games and speaking about their importance, not just to people who love video games, but to people more broadly, even those who don't consider themselves gamers, is really vital work," Dyson said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rabindra Ratan, associate professor at Michigan State University's Department of Media and Information, told Game Developer that he and his team were awarded $1.6 million by the National Science Foundation's Future of Work program in 2021 to research and develop a program to "reduce issues of Zoom fatigue and other types of gender and race inequities in the games industry related to virtual meetings." Most of that money was spent on the research over the years, but when the grant was rescinded this year, they lost an unspent $200,000 they intended to use to finish the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were in the home stretch," Ratan said. "The main goal of the home stretch was to get our work out into the games industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ratan and the team did all the research and built out a virtual world that was designed to be a more effective meeting space — taking into consideration gender and racial disparities in the industry. Now, they no longer have the funding needed to fully realize their vision. The platform is publicly available still, and Ratan intends to put the research materials up online, but there's no longer the budget to pay students and professors to tie up the loose ends of the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our mission was to help promote equity in the games industry, and like in many industries that are impacted, the cancellation is part of what we see as an ongoing culture war against people who are trying to reduce systematic inequalities in those fields."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Public development grants in the U.S. have become an endangered species">Public development grants in the U.S. have become an endangered species</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rebecca Bria, assistant anthropology professor at The University of Texas San Antonio's College of Liberal and Fine Arts, told Game Developer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.neh.gov/publicquery/AwardDetail.aspx?gn=MT-304037-25">her virtual reality game project</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paccha</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was "severely impacted by the rescinding of the NEH grant shortly after the work began."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paccha</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a virtual reality adventure and puzzle game in which players act as a student archaeologist investigating different areas of the Peruvian Andes. It's co-developed by Bria and game developer and artist Bruce Carlisle. They explained they spent two years conceptualizing the game "while conducting preliminary research, digitizing ancient objects and spaces, and doing outreach in Peru to ensure community buy-in and active collaborations with descendant populations." Planning and applying for grants took two years, but they were eventually awarded $100,000 for prototyping from NEH. The grant finally arrived in February 2025. They were able to complete just two months of work before the Trump administration pulled the plug.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Grant opportunities to develop a game like ours — through NEH or elsewhere — are rare and competitive," Bria and Carlisle said. "Our award comes from the NEH program called 'Digital Projects for the Public,' which is extremely competitive. They have an intense peer review process, require an advisory committee of humanities scholars as well as partnerships with museums/universities and communities, and they often require applicants to submit multiple submissions and revisions to win. Unfortunately, not only did DOGE rescind our award but the NEH website indicates that the agency was made to completely discontinue the Digital Projects for the Public competition moving forward."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They said the NEH award was "vital" for the project&nbsp; to be able to "accurately and ethically present the people and artifacts of the Indigenous Andean past." The prototyping grant was the first step in a long process in acquiring future funding to produce the game. "Losing the award is devastating," they said. "Now that this NEH funding pipeline from Prototyping to Implementation has vanished, our trajectory for completing the game is also halted."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bria said the cuts stalled research, put partnerships (like one with the San Antonio Museum of Art) on hold, removed "financial support for community collaborators in the Peruvian village and archaeological site of Hualcayan where our game is set," and ended payments to game developer Carlisle, who is no longer able to work full time on the title as a result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, like other researchers and institutions impacted by the sudden axe to their already-awarded grants, they're looking for different ways to fund the game, be it through private funding or via the NEH program being reinstated. It's a baffling and devastating blow to projects, and a decision that will surely impact the study of video games—something that could have lasting impact.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The video game industry is at the forefront of experimentation and exploration in technological developments in many realms," Ratan said. "By limiting research in this industry, it is limiting science as a whole. There's a slightly more direct negative consequence here in hindering progress in the games industry, namely being that progress in the games industry leads to other industries."</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development]]></content:encoded>

<p>But more games will be made eligible</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e41d8659b2591/game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be ceasing sales of the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme from <strong>Friday, 30th January 2026 at 23:59 JST</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who might be unaware, Game Vouchers would come in pairs and would therefore allow you to purchase two first-party eShop titles at a discounted price. So in the UK, for example, a pair of Game Vouchers costs £84, granting access to two titles priced at £49.99 each, thus saving you approximately £16. Pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>No more, though! Nintendo had already announced that Game Vouchers wouldn't be compatible with the Switch 2, but now it's gone one step further and is bringing an end to the scheme entirely.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tgvkli&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>It's not all bad news, though. Sort of... Game Vouchers are valid for one year after purchase, and Nintendo has stated that it will be introducing more games to the scheme following the cessation of sales at the start of January.</p>
<p>We can't say for definite which games might be added, but we reckon there's a good chance we'll see the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, both of which are scheduled to launch in 2026. Then, of course, you've got the Switch 1 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> launching later this year.</p>
<p>It's a shame this will no longer be a thing, though. Hopefully Nintendo will offer up some sort of alternative for the Switch 2, because if it wants to continue pushing folks toward digital purchases, then it'll need to introduce an enticing deal for those hesitant to leave physical media behind.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 12.13pm: </strong>Krafton has told Eurogamer the decision to delay <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s early access release into 2026 was "under discussion" prior to any leadership changes at developer Unknown Worlds.</p>
<p>"During playtests for Subnautica 2, we received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game's direction. At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. "As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we've made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience. As a result, Subnautica 2's Early Access launch has been rescheduled for 2026."</p>
<p>Krafton's spokesperson stated the decision was "based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players" and affirmed it was not "influenced by any contractual or financial considerations".</p>
<p>Additionally, "the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio," Krafton closed.</p>
<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 10.07am: </strong>Krafton has delayed the release of Subnautica 2, right before the game's development team was reportedly set to receive a substantial bonus for reaching previously determined revenue targets.</p>
<p>Subnautica 2 is being developed by Unknown Worlds, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">Krafton acquired in 2021</a>. Word of the game's delay comes just a week after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">Krafton ousted key members of Unknown Worlds' development and leadership team</a>, including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated underwater sequel was slated for an early access release this year, however Krafton has moved that window back to an unspecified date in 2026. According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a>, this change happened mere months before Krafton was expected to pay the development team a $250m bonus, which would have applied had the studio met certain revenue targets by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Due to the game's delayed release, Unknown Worlds is now unlikely to be able to meet these targets, sources told the publication, meaning that it will miss out on the payout. According to Bloomberg, this delay was not supported by the former leadership at Unknown Worlds, who had planned to share the bonus with all studio employees.</p>
<p>Krafton stated it had delayed the release of Subnautica 2 to improve the game's quality following feedback from playtests. "It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations," Krafton claimed.</p>
<p>Last week, Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as chief executive officer Ted Gill, were all "pushed out" from the studio by Krafton. Following his dismissal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">Cleveland shared a statement on reddit</a>, where he called the events of the week "quite a shock". In this same post, he said Subnautica 2 was ready for its early access debut.</p>
<p>"And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton's hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings," Cleveland wrote.</p>
<p>"I want you to know that whatever happens to the founders, to the team and to the game, our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world... And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p>

</span></p><p>Now that Cleveland, McGuire and Gill have been removed from the company, Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis has been put in charge of Unknown Worlds. Earlier this week, Papoutsis reportedly said Krafton did not believe that Subnautica 2 was ready to be released in early access in 2025, and more content was needed.</p>
<p>In audio listened to by Bloomberg, the new studio head was further questioned about the motives for the delay beyond this, including if the $250m bonus was a factor. "It's a good question, and I would appreciate patience on this particular topic," Papoutsis replied during the meeting, adding he was not familiar with the specifics of Krafton's acquisition of Unknown Worlds or the contract itself at the present time.</p>
<p>"The desire of Krafton is to have the very best version of Subnautica 2 available for its early access," he continued. "While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, 'Hey we should launch this,' that wasn't where both parties aligned around." Papoutsis added: "it's never been told to me that we're making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Krafton for comment on today's report.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers]]></content:encoded>

Throughout the last thirteen years, he has made several controversial comments via social media, both on the games industry and various social issues. Sticking to the former, back in 2012, he famously gave his permission to a Minecraft fan to pirate the game if he could not afford it at the moment:</p>



<p><em>Just pirate it. If you still like it when you can afford it in the future, buy it then. Also, don’t forget to feel bad. 😉</em></p>



<p>At the 2011 Game Developers Conference, Persson was even more direct when telling his peers that piracy was not theft. He argued that if people stole a car, there would be one less in the world, whereas pirating a game simply means there is another copy in the world and possibly a new fan.</p>



<p>Now, the Minecraft creator has renewed his thoughts in light of the Stop Killing Games initiative. For context, the online petition is seeking to gather enough signatures to propose a bill to the UK and European parliaments to block game developers and publishers from making games that can eventually be 'killed' by permanently taking down servers. Last week, we covered one such example when Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that all services for BioWare's Anthem would cease on January 12, 2026. From that date onward, the game will be effectively unplayable.</p>



<p>The Stop Killing Games initiative has gained considerable momentum lately and is now nearing 1.3 million signatures, as you can see on the official website. Unsurprisingly, publishers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that if this were ever to pass, it would be 'prohibitively expensive' for them, which sounds like a hidden threat of even further price increases.</p>



<p>It is in this context that Markus Persson said: </p>



<p><em>If buying a game is not a purchase, then pirating them is not theft.</em></p>



<p>When asked what game developers and publishers should do instead of shutting games down, the Minecraft creator pointed out that old games used to allow players to host their own servers, which effectively kept those games alive even after the actual developer turned off their official servers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Persson <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gauged the interest of his followers</a> in him getting back to work on a spiritual successor to Minecraft. The response seemed positive, although it remains unclear whether this game will actually be made and, if so, when it could launch.</p>



<p>Besides that, do you agree with Persson's opinion on the subject?</p>

            <p>I did scan strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-scum">Space Scum</a>'s trailer a few times for the hint of a feature that didn't make me immediately think, ah yeah, that's just like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a> innit. This is a bit unfair of me. After all, your dudes sit on chess piece-like plinths in this one. That's innovation, right? Anyway, I like the art and the bloke from the trailer looks like he'd nut me if I dwelled on the comparison too long. With someone else's face. So, here's a trailer. There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2601980/Space_Scum/">Steam demo</a> from next month, although you can sign up for a playtest now.</p>

<p>The gang's all here. Turn-based battles. Procedural planets. Origins and character traits. Mercenary permadeath. Gear looting. Skill trees. The sci-fi setting does offer a few twists, though. I'm a fan of the enemy variety I've seen so far, for one. Space rats. Space lizards. Space bugs. All the stuff you don't want to find in your sacks of space grain, basically. Range combat also naturally plays a bigger part here, and you can specialise your mercs in things like hacking and turret use.</p>
<p>Also, look how furious and/or very hungry these rats are. Very emotive. A cornucopia of different ways to be aggravated, possess these rats.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Space Scum is a tactical, turn-based RPG, set across multiple procedurally generated planets, ensuring no playthrough is the same - though they all exist in the same gritty, Sci-Fi universe. You’ll choose your own custom origin and encounter different environments, enemy types, factions and missions, all based on where you go and what you choose to do. Of course, when all the choices are yours, so are the consequences…"</p></blockquote>
<p>Had I a say in such matters, I would probably look at the available footage for my game, cross-reference it against the word 'gritty' in my marketing blurb, come to the conclusion that the audience could probably work that bit out for themselves, and then choose literally any other word, preferably one more specific to the universe I've created here, lest someone assume my worldbuilding process consisted of choosing the word 'gritty' then working backwards from there. I'll play the demo though, sure. Looks fun. Full release is TBC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-scum-is-a-sci-fi-strategy-rpg-take-on-battle-brothers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda has <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new patch for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered to the Steam Beta ring. If you wish to download it, just switch to the beta tab in your Steam library.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 introduces a series of fixes to performance, quests, and gameplay. Arguably, the most interesting could be the allegedly reduced frequency of stutters when traversing the open world, which were really dreadful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at launch</a>. Here's the performance and visual related changelog:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drops in Black Rock Caverns</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drop south of Bravil Castle courtyard</li>



<li>Reduced the frequency of hitches in the open world.</li>



<li>General improvements to frame time in many locations.</li>



<li>Optimize the updating of character attachments.</li>



<li>Optimize rendering of water volumes in the open world.</li>



<li>Optimize light/shadow updates in several lairs.</li>



<li>Optimize waterfall particle FX and rendering.</li>



<li>Optimize the weather system.</li>



<li>Optimize the character animation system.</li>



<li>Fixed flickering shadows when using XeSS Upscaling</li>



<li>Fixed title properly restarting after purchasing the Deluxe Upgrade on PC</li>



<li>Fixed settings properly migrating between PC and XBOX</li>



<li>Fixed water disappearing after fast travel</li>



<li>Fixed cursor slowdown when enabling high frame rate V-Sync</li>



<li>Fixed shaders not preloading due to cloud save replication</li>



<li>Fixed long blackout during loading screens</li>



<li>Fixed weather VFX flashing while outside</li>



<li>Fixed motion blur artifacts while in the Oblivion Plane</li>



<li>Fixed NPCs not obeying the Wait action from the player</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, Bethesda Game Studios has introduced new difficulty options to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, specifically for Player Combat Damage and Enemy Combat Damage. Players can now select from “Novice”, “Apprentice”, “Adept”, “Journeyman”, “Expert”, and “Master” options in the Gameplay menu. The developers expressed the hope that the “Journeyman” setting would act as a better bridge between “Adept” and “Expert” for players.</p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered is currently still 20% off on Steam due <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the Summer Sale</a>, but the discount is only available for less than ten hours, so hurry up if you are interested.</p>

We've rounded up some of our favorite deals on PC components into the lists below, plus a selection of discounted pre-built gaming PCs. Prime Day runs until July 11, unless they sell out before then, so make sure you grab the discounted components while you can. For more deals on PC gaming gear, video games, and other electronics, be sure to check <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">GameSpot's Prime Day Deals Hub</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">AMD Ryzen CPU Prime Day Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529380-amd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529380" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529380-amd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529380"></a><figcaption>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529380-amd.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Some of the best deals are available for AMD's Ryzen CPUs, which are nearly 50% off on select models. The biggest discount is for the Ryzen 9 7900X 12-core 24-thread Unlocked CPU, which is down to $288 (was $550). This is a solid CPU that can work well for PC gaming, and since it's unlocked . However, if you're looking for something more powerful, the Ryzen 9 9950X is now available for $434 (down from $650), making it a great pick for anyone building an AMD-based gaming PC.

This model uses Intel's 14th Gen CPU technology and offers a max 6 GHz clock speed. It also features Intel's integrated graphics tech, meaning you don't technically need a GPU if you're building a new rig (though we suggest grabbing an Nvidia GeForce or AMD Radeon GPU if you're parting out a PC gaming desktop).</p><p dir="ltr">Several other Intel CPUs are on sale during Prime Day, and we've listed a few more below.

The 5060 Ti is a step down in terms of power from the 5070; however, the 16GB GDDR7 on this model is great for playing on 1440p or 4K displays. There's also a discount on an Asus-made RTX 5060 Ti with just 8GB GDDR7, which we'd only recommend to players sticking with 1080p resolution and max 60 fps frame rates, but is a bit cheaper at $400 (was $470).</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-3-125-slot-Military-Grade-Components-Protective/dp/B0DS6S98ZF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 12GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $685 (<del>$740</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-DisplayPort-2-5-Slot-Axial-tech-Technology/dp/B0F7WB6LSH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $430 (<del>$480</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-SFF-Ready-Graphics-2-5-Slot-Axial-tech/dp/B0F76KGH6B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $400 (<del>$470</del>)</li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Desktop PC Prime Day Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529383" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529383"></a><figcaption>Alienware Aurora ACT1250 Gaming PC</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you want to skip buying individual components, you can also grab one of several pre-made <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ij8sta" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC gaming desktops</a> that are discounted for Prime Day.

There happens to be a significant amount of Legend of Zelda-related items in these sales, so I've gathered some of the best and put together a little Prime Day gift guide for that Zelda fan in your life. Amazon has everything from games, books, and apparel on sale, so Hyrule is your oyster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Prime Day deals don't quite have what you're looking for, be sure to check out the <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/the-legend-of-zelda" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Store for more awesome Legend of Zelda gift ideas</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Some of the Best Legend of Zelda Gifts to Grab During Prime Day</h2><p id="video-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Video Games">Legend of Zelda Video Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Legend of Zelda video games are the bread and butter, and we wouldn't have any of these other snazzy gifts without them. While the discounts on these aren't as steep as I'd like, it's never a bad time to experience Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom for the first time. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the highest discounted of the bunch at 15% off, and I highly recommend it if you enjoy the classic top-down 2D style like I do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Breath of the Wild and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/Everything_New_In_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom_Switch_2">Tears of the Kingdom both have Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades available</a>, so if it's your first time dipping your toes into these masterpieces and you have the snazzy new handheld-hybrid console, you won't be disappointed. There are also quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-amazon-prime-day-switch-game-deals-2025">other Switch games on sale</a> if you're looking outside of Hyrule for games to play.</p><p id="books"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Books">Legend of Zelda Books</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of Prime Day is a buy 2, get 1 free promotion on dozens of physical media. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-books-are-heavily-discounted-for-prime-day">A handful of Zelda books are included in this at a discount</a>, so if you've had your eye on these, you can bundle and save for some great coffee table books. Of note, while the Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia is sitting at 55% off, it isn't included in the buy 2, get 1 free sale like Hyrule Historia and Art &amp; Artifacts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then you have the Legend of Zelda manga series, covering the stories from most of the games like Twilight Princess and Ocarina of Time. Another odd selection of these is included in buy 2, get 1 free, but the box sets of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-legend-of-zelda-books-and-manga">entire library of Zelda manga</a> is still discounted for Prime Day.

It originated in the incredibly cheesy and campy animated series from the 80's. Luckily for us, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-complete-legend-of-zelda-animated-series-is-super-cheap-for-prime-day">complete series on DVD is on sale during Prime Day</a> and qualifies for the buy 2, get 1 free promotion.

There are countless styles, sizes, and colors available and discounted for Prime Day, but here are some of my favorites. The Retro Kanji Link Portrait is an awesome recreation of the classic Link design and goes with any style. These are all 30% off, so if you've been looking to upgrade your wardrobe with awesome nerdy shirts Prime Day has you covered. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Other Great The Legend of Zelda Gifts</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are countless cool gifts to pick from, it really was hard to narrow down this list without making it too extensive. Below are some more of my favorite things I'd actually get for my home office, light the heart container light and the Majora's Mask LED neon sign. The ceramic ocarina actually works and comes with a song book with music from the games, as well as an easy explainer for how to play it. These are going for between 20% to 42% off for certain items and make great additions to bookshelves, desks, what have you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
