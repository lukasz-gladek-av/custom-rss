He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Daily puzzle games are seemingly everywhere right now, and starting today, you’ll be able to add a new stop to your puzzle rotation: <em>The Atlantic</em>.</p><p>The publication is launching a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/games/">new hub for its growing game offerings</a>, including already available games like <em>Bracket City</em> and <em>Caleb’s Inferno Crossword Puzzle, </em>as well as some new puzzles. You’ll be able to access the hub on both the web and in <em>The Atlantic’s</em> app.</p><p>Caleb Madison, <em>The Atlantic’s</em> director of games, gave <em>The Verge</em> a demo of most of the games available in the hub ahead of today’s launch:</p><div><ul><li><span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/games/bracket-city/"><em>Bracket City</em></a>, which <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2025/04/introducing-bracket-city-atlantics-new-game/682334/"><em>The Atlantic</em> licensed earlier this year</a>, requires you to solve clues nested in brackets that eventually resolve into a fun fact about that day in history.</span></li><li><span><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/games/stacks/">Stacks</a></em>, a new game, is kind of like <em>Tetris</em> meets <em>Wordle</em>, Madison says. You have a bank of words that you have to place in the correct order, on top of letters already on the board, to form other words. </span></li><li><span>In <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/games/fluxis/">Fluxis</a></em>, another new game, you try to figure out words that build off the previous word and incorporate some kind of characteristic. Madison showed me an example of needing to build an adjective off the word “checkerboard” — he went with “arduous.”</span></li><li><span><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/games/calebs-inferno/">Caleb’s Inferno Crossword Puzzle</a></em>, which is already included in the monthly <em>Atlantic</em> magazine and available online, is last game Madison showed me. <em>Caleb’s</em> crossword is a narrow rectangle instead of a square, but as you move farther down the puzzle, the clues get more difficult to solve.</span></li></ul></div><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Bracket City.</figcaption> <cite>Image: The Atlantic</cite></span></p></section><p>Madison doesn’t necessarily see <em>The Atlantic’s</em> games as replacing your visits to other daily puzzles. “I think people have a pretty ravenous diet for new games, so I don’t think coming to <em>The Atlantic</em> precludes any of these other amazing games that are at <em>The New York Times</em> or Apple News or LinkedIn,” Madison says. “What I feel like <em>The Atlantic</em> has to offer that’s different from those publications is a little bit more of a bespoken, artisanal aesthetic.”</p><p>Madison also tries to bring an “aesthetic narrative component” to games to help them feel “immersive and special.” <em>Bracket City</em>, for example, has some city-themed elements sprinkled throughout, like the “fan mail” email being <a href="mailto:mayor@bracket.city">mayor@bracket.city</a>.</p><p>Like with <em>The New York Times</em>, some aspects of <em>The Atlantic</em>’s games will only be available if you’re a paid subscriber. <em>Bracket City</em> and all of its archives are free. The full archives for <em>Stacks</em>, <em>Fluxis</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em>’s daily mini crossword will be behind a paywall, however; nonsubscribers will only have access to the three most recent puzzles for those games. All of the <em>Caleb’s Inferno </em>crossword puzzles are exclusive to subscribers.</p><p>Madison says he has “a lot of plans” for more games, including long-form games of some kind. “I’m trying to make no assumptions as to what that would look like and just forge forward creatively to see what a more layered day-to-day experience would be like.” He didn’t want to give anything specific away, but he says, “I am excited to innovate in the game space and bring unique and authentic, long-form game experiences to <em>The Atlantic</em> users and to people online.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/interview-ubisoft-on-assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-and-historical-authenticity-playing-with-history/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>At this moment in time, I have spent well over a hundred hours exploring <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, Ubisoft’s gorgeous virtual imagining of feudal Japan. Thousands of samurai have fallen beneath my blade, hundreds of doors have felt Yasuke’s shoulder-barging wrath, and every single NPC who can be bedded, has been bedded, by my amorous avatars.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JzywR97gUs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From a historical perspective, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> has delivered everything I could have asked for, providing a rich, textured, and unbelievably beautiful Japan to lose yourself within. This being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing With History</a>, I just had to know more about the work that Ubisoft put into crafting this historical marvel. That’s where Dr. Stéphanie-Anne Ruatta, the World and Historical Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows came in. Ruatta is a historian with a PhD in ancient languages and literature, and is currently the onboard historian at Ubisoft Quebec, having worked on <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a>, Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, and now, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. She took the time to sieve through my waffle and blathering to figure out if there was an actual coherent history question in there.</p>


<p>“Feudal Japan was one of the settings the team was the most excited to do and one that had been requested by fans for a long time” explained Ruatta, though turning those same dreams into reality would be no small undertaking. “Recreating the Azuchi-Momoyama period in Assassin’s Creed Shadows came with a unique set of challenges. One of the biggest was the natural landscape – Japan’s terrain, dense forests, mountainous regions, and varied elevation required us to rethink how we approached scale and traversal. Striking a balance between realism and gameplay meant adjusting the scale ratio to feel authentic without overwhelming the player, especially in areas with heavy vegetation or steep geography.”</p>
<p>As many an Assassin’s Creed Shadows player can attest, this is an almighty achievement. The game’s rendition of Japan just <em>feels </em>right, presenting a world map that condenses great swathes of landmass in a way that’s quick to navigate but still evokes a great sense of scale. Maybe we should ask Ubisoft to take a look at sorting out the M6 for us? It’d be great if traversing that roadwork-infested, pothole-ridden monstrosity took minutes and not days. Whilst I pondered the UK’s inadequate road network infrastructure, Ruatta ignored my glassy-eyed and vacant demeanour and continued.</p>


<p>“Another major challenge was the depth of research needed. From architecture and clothing to social customs and regional dialects, every detail had to be carefully considered to ensure credibility. Finally, making the world feel dynamic and alive across seasons added another layer of complexity. Implementing seasonal changes — like shifting foliage, weather patterns, and how NPCs behave — meant building systems that could adapt the environment in meaningful ways, both visually and mechanically. It was a technical and artistic challenge, but one that adds a lot of depth to the player’s experience.”</p>
<p>It certainly does. Of the many hours I’ve spent with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, a scary amount of time has been sunk into simply admiring the weather effects, agog at the sweep and sway of blossom petals as they descend from a living forest of trees.</p>
<p>So, that’s the world-building, what about the player characters? I’d made it my mission to avoid any and all gameplay previews prior to Shadows’ release – after all I didn’t want any dirty rotten spoilers. As such, I made the rather silly assumption that the player character would probably be Hattori Hanzō. Hattori is likely the most famous “ninja” from this era of Japanese history. Born in 1557 AD, during the Sengoku Era, he experienced his first battle at the tender age of 15. That’s right, whilst most of us were sat on bins outside newsagents trying to look cool, slurping on cans of coke and pretending lollipops were cigarettes, Hanzō was clambering over the battlements of Uto Castle during a night-time raid. Considering Hanzō is the archetypal assassin, I wanted to know, was he ever considered as a playable protagonist for Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</p>

<p>“We did consider making [him] playable in a flashback mission early in development, but ultimately found that approach a bit confusing in terms of narrative flow. Instead, we chose to focus on his deeper connection to the Assassin Brotherhood and Naoe’s past. Hanzo plays a very important role in the story. He’s not just a legendary figure, but a key character who helps anchor the game’s lore. His presence adds weight to the Brotherhood’s legacy in Japan and provides meaningful context for Naoe’s journey.”</p>
<p>He also looks completely badass, like a Shinobi Clint Eastwood, but even gruffer. Still, Naoe and Yasuke were a more than acceptable substitute. Indeed, I found myself far more drawn to Yasuke during my playthrough. Probably because I find stealth a little annoying, so the samurai’s approach of steamrolling into a fort and hacking off heads for fun was far more my play-style. Yasuke is an inspired player character choice: as a relative newcomer to Japan, he can see its culture through the eyes of the player, learning and discovering the world as his adventure continues. Though, the inclusion of Yasuke must not have been without its own challenges, as so little is known about his real-life historical counterpart. Did the development team face difficulties in researching this historically enigmatic figure?</p>
<p>“Yasuke is indeed a fascinating figure,” considered Ruatta, “and part of what makes him so compelling is how little we actually know about him. That scarcity of concrete historical detail posed a challenge, of course, but it also opened up a unique narrative space for us. Rather than being constrained by a rigid historical record, we had the opportunity to explore who Yasuke could have been, while still grounding him in the cultural and political realities of the time. We approached his character with a great deal of care, consulting with historians and cultural experts to ensure that our interpretation was respectful and informed. But ultimately, the gaps in the historical record allowed us to craft a story that feels both authentic and imaginative, something that fits naturally within the Assassin’s Creed universe.”</p>
<p>One of those imaginings is to present Yasuke as a cross between Batman and the Doom Slayer, hewing hordes of foes with effortless – but oh so violent and gory – ease. Amidst this bloodshed, I wondered how the developers approached the game’s arsenal of weapons with the same level of care and authenticity.</p>

<p>“We definitely aimed for credibility. Many of the weapons and techniques are based on real historical sources, and we worked with experts to get the feel right. But we also had to make some tweaks to keep the combat fun and cinematic. It’s all about finding that sweet spot between realism and gameplay.”</p>
<p>As our interview began to wrap up, I wanted to highlight gaming’s slight obsession with the Japan’s Sengoku period, from <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors">Samurai Warriors</a> and Shogun: Total War to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/onimusha">Onimusha</a>. Was there ever a desire amongst the team at Ubisoft Quebec to defy expectations and set Shadows in a completely different period of Japanese history, similar to Sucker Punch’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>?</p>
<p>“The development team explored several fascinating periods in Japanese history before settling on the Sengoku era for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Japan’s rich tapestry of historical epochs — from the Heian period’s courtly intrigue to the Edo period’s rigid social order — offered a wealth of narrative and aesthetic possibilities. However, it was the Azuchi-Momoyama period, the final phase of the Sengoku era, that ultimately felt like the perfect fit for the Assassin’s Creed universe. Its volatile mix of war, shifting alliances, and larger-than-life figures created the ideal backdrop for the franchise’s signature blend of stealth, action, and political intrigue, making it a natural choice for the game’s setting.”</p>
<p>That has been a big part of the appeal of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, certainly during my time writing this Playing With History series. After all, what better way is there to learn about history than by directly interacting with it yourself? I’m not sure there is one. Not unless you prefer thumbing through thick academic tomes, or trying to survive a dense documentary without reaching for your smartphone. In recent AC titles, Ubisoft has even included a mode called “Discovery Tour”, stripping out gameplay elements and simply allowing players to explore their virtual worlds with a focus on education. Can we expect this innovative feature to return in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</p>

<p>“We don’t have anything to share on that front at the moment”, confirmed Ruatta, “but in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we’ve continued the series’ tradition of bringing players closer to history through a feature called “Cultural Discovery”. Integrated into the in-game Codex, this section offers curated, encyclopaedic entries on the history, art, and culture of the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Written in collaboration with historians and enriched with imagery from museums and cultural institutions, it serves as a thoughtful and accessible resource for players who want to dive deeper into the world they’re exploring.”</p>
<p>It certainly does. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a treasure trove of historical facts and information, one that will surely encourage additional research outside of the game for many players. That being said, the details of some historical events are shrouded in too much mystery for us to definitively say what really happened – were there any such moments in Shadows?</p>
<p>“I think that the death of Oda Nobunaga at the hand of his vassal Akechi Mitsuhide is one of the most mysterious moments in history that still puzzles historians and specialists today. Why did it happen? There are many theories about this event, which makes it an interesting playground for our historical fiction.”</p>
<p>We’d like to thank Dr. Stéphanie-Anne Ruatta and team at Ubisoft Quebec for taking time to conduct this interview.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2's backward compatibility seems to be even better than anticipated before the system's launch, as several original Switch games run much better on the new console.</p>
<p>A new test shared a few days ago by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ModernVintageGamer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a> highlights how plenty of original Switch games run considerably better on its successor, such as Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom, The Wonderful 101 Remastered, Darksiders 3, Resident Evil 5, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and a few others.&nbsp;In the vast majority of cases, the games analyzed in the video had trouble keeping consistent framerates and hitting the 60 FPS mark, but on Nintendo Switch 2, they do so effortlessly, further highlighting how good backward compatibility is even for unpatched games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Back Compat - More 60fps Games Tested!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oG3G-gFuwQw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the system doesn't innovate the same way many other Nintendo systems did over their predecessors, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a solid console and a massive improvement over the original in pretty much every way, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4k when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy; with the major downside at the moment being a non-existent launch line-up and it simply isn't cheap, particularly as you will need an additional MicroSD Express card to make up for the poor storage capacity.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, modding site Nexus Mods announced a change in ownership that'll see its founder step back. Not much info was provided in the announcement as to who the new owners were, but it's now been confirmed to be a company called Chosen.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-announce-ownership-change-but-the-folks-taking-over-remain-a-bit-mysterious">reported</a>, the ownership change announcement penned by Nexus mods founder Robin 'Dark0ne' Scott didn't go into much detail as to the identity of those being handed the reigns. A Victor and a Marinus were cited as having "come on board to lead this next chapter", along with links to their Nexus Mods profiles that only offered brief bios.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We reached out to Nexus Mods yesterday in order to try and learn more about the identity of the new owners, and were provided with a statement by community lead Mathew Elliott.</p>
<p>"We didn’t go into too much detail about the new ownership in the initial post, but the community has been quick to put on their investigator hats, digging into the new owners’ identities, backgrounds, beliefs, even their favorite football teams, and speculating on what this might mean for modding," it said, "A bit of Reddit or Twitter sleuthing will surface most of what they've found." It added that the new owners are "very hands-on and are now embedded directly with the team in our offices."</p>
<p>The community sleuthing Elliott referenced was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-site-has-been-sold.1219452/page-2">this ResetEra thread</a>, which saw users RandomlyRandom67 and chocobalt conclude that the new owners are a company called Chosen, with co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-folmann/">Victor Folmann</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinus-elgaard/">Marinus Elgaard</a> believed to be the Victor and Marinus referred to in Scott's post. This has now been confirmed via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301">a stickied comment</a> on Scott's original post.</p>
<p>In it, Folmann, Elgaard, and Nikolaj Nyholm address Scott's post not mentioning Chosen by name, writing: "This post wasn’t about Chosen — it was about Robin and the legacy he built over 24 years. We’re the new owners and ultimate decision-makers at Nexus Mods. We’ll share more about ourselves when we’ve earned that right. For now, we’re focused on listening, learning, and making modding even easier, and yes, you’ll see us around in the community being active."</p>
<p>The trio assert that they don't plan to start charging for mods or revoking lifetime premium  subscriptions, adding in terms of monetisation in general: "We’re not changing the core model. No aggressive monetisation. No paid mods. If anything, we’re aiming for fewer ads, not more."</p>
<p>Chosen, which was only founded in January 2025, <a href="https://www.wearechosen.io/">state their aim</a> as being to "partner with founders to help scale what they’ve built—amplifying their impact, supporting their team and culture, and ensuring the business thrives for the long term." Basically, they look to be in the business of buying into or buying up community-focused platforms (their website cites previous work with the likes of EA FC community databases <a href="https://www.futbin.com/">FUTBIN</a> and <a href="https://renderz.app/">RenderZ</a>), and running them, with founders offered the chance to stay on board or take a "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313157405918294018/">quick, straightforward exit</a>" that Chosen claim shouldn't leave them worrying about their creation going down the pan.</p>
<p>Folmann's LinkedIn activity came under scrutiny following the aforementioned ResetEra sleuthing, including a 'Gaming startup monetisation cheat sheet' that mentions NFTs and crypto, originally <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/victor-folmann_gaming-startup-monetization-cheat-sheet-activity-7254843104778743824-072i?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB_mKVYB3dueA0zR9oGk-0S67NVqlS0qC40">posted seven months ago</a>. When a commenter fretted about these features being added to Nexus Mods, Folmann <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7254843103344287744?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%2C7340502971027271681%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%2C7340506104696623104%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287340502971027271681%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287340506104696623104%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%29">responded</a> "100% agree — not happening".</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/victor-folmann_fundraising-startups-founders-activity-7286004822758035456-HSyz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB_mKVYB3dueA0zR9oGk-0S67NVqlS0qC40"> post</a> from four months ago sees him predict that in 2025 "AI will enable solo devs to create $100M hits and 2-person teams to build AAA games", and claim "AI-powered modding will revolutionise game development".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nexus Mods and Chosen for comment.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how all of this plays out, but originally announcing the ownership change in a way that left folks needing to do some pretty in-depth detective work to find out exactly who was taking over seems a strange and counterproductive move on Nexus Mods' part, at least from a PR perspective.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade-2">Stellar Blade 2</a> will address the lack of narrative in the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a>, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/special/nboard/5/?n=214039">This Is Game</a>, director Hyung-tae Kim admitted the game's total number of cutscenes had to be cut due to cost-saving measures, but thanks to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>'s success this problem will be directly addressed in the sequel.</p>
<p>"In the early stages of development, we planned to include detailed settings such as the reason the main character changes clothes in the story. However, as production progressed, the cost of producing cutscenes became too much," stated Kim (via machine translation). "And eventually, for the sake of efficiency, we had no choice but to reduce cutscenes that supplemented the world view or character narratives outside of the main plot. That's how we were barely able to complete the game."</p>

<p>Kim elaborated the development resources for "narrative-centered games...has not yet been fully established in Korea". </p>
<p>"However, if we are given the opportunity to create the next work, I think we will be able to present it with a sufficiently rich narrative," he said.</p>
<p>Hyung-tae Kim confirmed Stellar Blade 2 was initially planned to be a DLC expansion to the original Stellar Blade, but due to the scope of this DLC it was rolled into a full blown sequel.</p>
<p>"As we were preparing the DLC, the volume grew more than expected, so we changed direction and proceeded with the next work," Kim explained. "However, there have been many changes since then.</p>
<p>"Currently, all manpower has been invested in the PC version, so it's hard to say that the next work has been developed much. Right now, we're in the R&amp;D period, thinking a lot about 'how we can show the vision of the next generation.'"</p>
<p>In a recent investor presentation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">Stellar Blade 2</a> was set as a 2027 release.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-on-xbox-series-x-hits-as-low-at-720p-resolution-but-delivers-better-performance-than-playstation-5-version.1220295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-720p-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Series X port of Final Fantasy XVI comes with some significant issues, but, at the very least, it offers more solid performance in Frame Rate Mode than the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the recently released port, highlighting how, in both Graphics and Frame Rate modes, Final Fantasy XVI on Xbox Series X renders at a much lower resolution than on PlayStation 5. In a scene set in Rosalith at the beginning of the game, the game renders at 1440p on PlayStation 5 and at 1224p on Xbox Series X, which is unusual as most games either run at the same resolution on both systems or at a slightly higher resolution on Xbox Series X. As such, the image tends to look blurrier on the system than on PlayStation 5, despite both versions using TSC MAA and AMD FSR 1. The lower resolution of the Xbox Series X port of Final Fantasy XVI, however, isn't the biggest issue of the port, as Digital Foundry highlighted how there are a lot of visual differences related to gamma presentation, brightness, and contrast. Other things look downright broken, like foliage rendering, so the port definitely needs patches to address these issues.</p>
<p>In Frame Rate Mode, however, Final Fantasy XVI on Xbox Series X fares a little better. While the resolution is dropped to 720p over the 1080p of the PlayStation 5 release, the game runs at a locked 60 FPS during traversal and combat, which the PS5 version doesn't achieve. Sadly, the lower resolution isn't the only element that had to be scaled down to achieve better performance, as the level of detail is also lower.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy 16 Tested on Xbox Series X|S - And There Are Issues" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjmzmgeqFYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Final Fantasy XVI is among the heaviest console games of the generation, it's not surprising to see how even the Xbox Series X cannot handle it properly without some significant cutbacks. While it is a shame the game launched in a far from optimal state on the system, it's still a good thing it finally did, as Clive Rosfield's adventure is one worth experiencing, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Crimson Desert would be released in Fall 2025 for PC and consoles. However, we still haven't heard any specific date.</p>
<p>That changed this morning when Korean website MTN <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061710543196451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an exclusive report revealing that Pearl Abyss is leaning toward a November 2 global launch. The game is said to be in the final stages of development, and provided that there are no unforeseen issues, this date should be confirmed in an official capacity soon. Needless to say, we've reached out to Pearl Abyss to check if they'd like to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at G-Star 2019 alongside DokeV and PLAN 8. Back then, it was supposed to be not too dissimilar from the studio's flagship product, the MMORPG Black Desert. Over time, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> it to a single player action/adventure game with a heavy focus on narrative, which inevitably caused a significant delay (the game was initially slated to debut in Winter 2021).</p>
<p>In the game, players will become Kliff, captain of the Greymanes, a band of mercenaries. Alongside his comrades, Kliff embarks on a perilous journey to defend the continent of Pywel from the snow-capped mountains of Kweiden to the lush plains of Akapen and the lofty ridges dotting the titular Crimson Desert.</p>
<p>Throughout the adventure, players will encounter dependable allies and countless foes who will stop at nothing to see you fail. They'll have to overcome many challenges to unravel the mystery surrounding an impending catastrophe and restore peace to the continent.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert features a massive open world that takes full advantage of the BlackSpace Engine. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at GDC 2025, the technology allows for accurate simulations of trees, grass, clothing, and hair, real-time physics and destructibility, volumetric fog, real-time lighting, detailed atmospheric scattering effects, dynamic weather, ray tracing, ocean and shallow water simulations, and more.</p>

And sometimes, you might even want to let other people try out that gear, even though you want to also use them. Well, a gear duplication glitch makes it easy to share the loot, for as long as it's around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first saw this thanks to the folks at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-has-a-new-exploit-which-allows-you-and-your-friends-to-duplicate-weapons-and-talismans-until-youre-just-as-godly-as-the-nightlords/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, who put together a quick guide on just how to tackle the duplication. It's actually fairly simple to execute; if two players try to pick up the same weapon, at the same time, they both pick it up. So now you have the original, and a duplicate. (Don't ask which is which, it'll freak everyone out.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is this fairly simple, it's easy to repeat and there isn't really a downside to "failing" it. If the pick-up gets messed up, you can just try again. In fact, the only danger is that you're basically stopping in one place and coordinating this drop-and-pick-up strategy, and in Nightreign, standing still is rarely advisable. The brief respite between days, or the alabaster alcove before the big Nightlord showdown, is probably the best time to do this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As PC Gamer noted though, they're not the first to stumble onto this trick. Various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDUPxRrjWR0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTubers</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lbfy3z/duplicating_items/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> users have posted about the easy duplication, too. The proverbial lid is off on this particular exploit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether FromSoftware will take any aim at changing it is anyone's guess. It is somewhat niche-use. There's no voice chat or anything to coordinate with random players online, so it's not exactly feasible to start dropping your best equipment and hope everyone's on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even for teamed-up players using Discord or some other method to chat, you'd still want to have equipment that other characters would want. Not only is Elden Ring Nightreign fairly generous in drops, at least in my experience, but each character tends to have their own wants and needs for weaponry. Unless you're rolling three Ironeyes, I suppose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The duplication glitch is nice for characters who want to double-up on specific weapons, like the Executor, but it's not some instant-win trick. For some fun and maybe sharing the wealth around if someone didn't manage to get any solid weapons by the final day, though, it might not be the worst trick to keep in your back pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The UK publisher, however, has worked on a range of successful titles including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Rise of the Golden Idol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Abiotic Factor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cityscapes: Sim Builder</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elliott feels the only thing uniting the company's slate is the Playstack logo on the splash screen. "Other than that; they are totally unique," he says. "The games bring something new to their audiences and excite players in totally different ways."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diversity is key for the publisher, which according to Elliott receives thousands of pitches each year, and that means developers looking to pitch should consider what makes their title truly unique before reaching out. Johnson agrees, and emphasizes that developers must "understand the intention of their game and the space it resides in."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-interactive-extends-partnership-with-nba-nbpa-wnba-and-wnbpa" target="_self" data-discover="true">Take-Two Interactive extends partnership with NBA, NBPA, WNBA, and WNBPA</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also vital to know what will realistically constitute success in a specific market.

"What is the potential sales-unit ceiling for the genre space?

Elliott says Playstack recognizes that developers need support to do their best work, but highlighting potential obstacles can make that process easier. "Our priority when green-lighting a project is figuring out how we may solve those challenges together. Is there a clear, shared vision for the game? Do we know why the team are confident that they can build this particular game? What gaps do we need to fill to help them succeed?," he says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-studios-boss-confident-marathon-won-t-repeat-the-mistakes-of-concord" target="_self" data-discover="true">PlayStation Studios boss confident Marathon won't repeat the mistakes of Concord</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honesty. That's the key word. Johnson says developers who are candid about their situation from the outset immediately stand out. "The biggest green flag is always transparency regarding what the game needs and when it needs it—having an honest, friendly relationship with each other is almost as important as having a quality game," Johnson continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Amazing things happen when a publisher and developer trust each other fully. Confidence in the creative vision is also key from the developer’s side—we're not here to comment on, or change, that vision—but we are here to support the realization of it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, transparency goes both ways. Johnson adds that developers should be wary of publishers that refuse to share key information, obfuscate the truth, or make grandiose claims they struggle to substantiate. If it seems like a company has something to hide or makes statements that feel too good to be true—there's a good chance something is amiss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to narrowing down the selection process, Elliott explains Playstack tries to hone in on projects that will be commercially successful right from the off. The company isn't expecting every title to amass millions of sales overnight—though Elliott does notes that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> became profitable within its first hour on shelves—but it does want to set realistic expectations around budget and scope. Right now, Elliott suggests developers with smaller budgets are a safer bet.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-proposed-ai-protections-will-let-performers-send-their-digital-replicas-on-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA proposed AI protections will let performers send their digital replicas on strike</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are a lot of costs involved in releasing a game, and we need to ensure that everyone earns a positive income from a successful release.&nbsp;Simply put, the higher the budget, the more the game has to sell just to earn a positive income," he explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We would guide indie games to pitch at sub $500k; and perhaps to have some choices that can reduce or extend from this budget. We run a comprehensive forecasting process for every title we sign; and we want to ensure that the cost of development is commensurate with the opportunity we identify. We are seeing budget asks into the millions—would we prefer to have four games at $300k; or one game at $1.2 million? It’s not impossible; but clearly the higher the ask, the more we have to weigh up with which games we move forward with."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Johnson doubles down on that assessment, but feels there's also another upside to working with devs at that scale: diversity of thought. We often hear that constraints breed creativity, and Johnson says there are generally more "interesting and unique" titles in the sub-$500,000 bracket.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Honest conversations are the key to success for Balatro publisher">Honest conversations are the key to success for Balatro publisher</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expectation management is a recurring theme throughout our exchange, and Elliott notes that Playstack attempts to clearly define the relationship between publisher and developer at a contractual level by defining milestones that will help build out the foundations of a title early on. The company also considers contract discussions an opportunity to align on marketing plans and release support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[When it comes to contracts], a lot of people worry about the revenue share percentage; and of course it’s important—but actually there's a lot more in a publishing deal than the royalty at the end.

During the contract phase we get to learn what it's like to work with each other on paperwork; but we really want to work together on a game, and getting into a more natural rhythm."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Elliott feels a publisher's role is to help a developer "engineer a hit." It's a take that chimes with a sentiment shared by Playstack communications director Wout van Halderen during a conversation with Game Developer at GDC 2025, where he explained that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> apparent overnight success was actually the result of a carefully crafted marketing plan. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-methodical-marketing-beats-behind-overnight-success-balatro">More on that here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We liked Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma a lot. So much <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-review/">so that Miguel said</a>,”It reinvigorates the Rune Factory formula on every level”. I also like it a lot, but I’ve been checking it out on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, where it’s joined the launch lineup in addition to the release on original Switch and PC. It’s not an exclusive, then, but it is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, it’s a brand-new title, launching almost simultaneously with the other platforms, and in a launch lineup without a whole heap of new things; that’s an important shot in the arm. Secondly, this is a game that’s relatively taxing on the original Switch, pushing it to its limit, but makes clear use of all that extra headroom on Switch 2. There’s also a small number of Switch 2-specific improvements that might just make this the best version of the game to own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRb4MwoDOWA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rune Factory 5 Guardians of Azuma drops you into the shoes of an amnesiac Earth Dancer – an individual capable of wielding mystical weaponry and reviving the land. You first arrive in Spring Village after falling off your dragon – hence the amnesia – and it soon becomes apparent that the village has suffered some form of calamity, it’s local deity having gone missing leading to the trees and blossoms all wilting away. Because you’re a helpful sort, you are tasked with reviving the village, releasing the deity, and clearing the village of blight. You do that through crafting, collecting materials and turning them into new buildings, farming, and through hacking monsters into little pieces. It’s a brilliant mix, and one which you’ll be glued to.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 version then is a great performer, but the handheld experience is not as strong as you might expect. The key upgrades are a higher resolution, improved framerates, and the ability to use the Joy Con 2’s mouse abilities, each of those features making it a clear jump above the Switch 1 edition.</p>
<p>If you bought the original Switch version of Guardians of Azuma, you can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for the £10 difference in price – it’s £60 on Switch 2 instead of £50 on Switch or PC. That’s a bit rich for us in the UK, as they’re making £10 equal to $10 and €10, so this upgrade fee is pricier for us than the £7.99 Breath of the Wild Switch 2 Edition, but then there’s also Fantasy Life i, where that game’s upgrade upgrade from Switch to Switch 2 is just $2.59 / £2.04. Your save from the original Switch will carry over, so if you’re holding off for the new console, you can carry your adventure over when you’re ready.</p>


<p>When playing docked, the Switch 2 version of Guardians of Azuma looks crisp and clear, though not potentially as crisp as you might hope. That’s the same story when playing handheld, with a further reduced resolution clearly helping performance, but impacting on image quality. It’s not as blatant as we’ve seen on original Switch over the years, or of the Switch 1 version of this game, but there’s a fuzziness that we’d hoped could be relegated by the new hardware.</p>
<p>Performance when docked is fantastic though, and feels incredibly smooth, especially when you’re out in the expanded worlds, fighting off the different monsters. The art direction and design is great here, particularly for the engrossing characters, and all in all, this is an attractive game that looks and performs great on Switch 2 when docked.</p>

<p>That’s a slightly different story in handheld mode. Combat and exploration are very smooth and respnsive, but there are points where you can make the game work a little too hard for the Switch 2’s lower power mode. Frame rates will drop, either when using fast travel to go to a new area, or when you’ve built up a very complicated village with lots of buildings and decorations. It’s still very playable, happening at slower points in the action, but as a showcase for the new console, I was just hoping for a little more.</p>
<p>Some of the best moments in Guardians of Azuma are when you’re customising and crafting your village, and it’s here that Maximum have added some mouse functionality, allowing you to place items or get your farming done just that little bit easier.</p>
<p>It feels mildly tacked on, but there are times where the development zone action is frustrating with a pad, because you want a level of precision that the controller can’t quite give you. That’s completely solved here, letting you place multiple tiles down, water your fields and sow your seeds with unrivalled speed; it’s a true proof of concept and I hope more games make some use of the feature. It’s a real shame it’s limited to this area though, as you can play through the game focusing on ranged weaponry, and being able to use the mouse would make life easier when aiming.</p>
<p>So, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma is a great game, and an amazing experience if you’re playing on Switch 2, but it isn’t <em>quite</em> perfect. Hopefully, a few patches will iron out the issues completely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hdr-calibration-settings-are-slammed-even-further-by-expert/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We were fairly surprised when we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 would feature HDR support, both built-in for the handheld screen and for the docked mode. However, its implementation is suboptimal, to say the least, and this is sadly not all that surprising.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> shortly after the console's launch, the edge-lit LCD display has just about mediocre HDR capabilities due to low peak brightness (around 450 nits). Furthermore, since it's not an OLED screen, it cannot benefit from that technology's intrinsic infinite contrast, which is always a boon for HDR presentation.</p>
<p>Docked mode doesn't have the same issues since it relies on an external display. However, it has other issues related to its calibration settings. We have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> this topic following a report from YouTuber My Life in Gaming, but now, the most renowned display expert on YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X84e14oe6gs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> his own video to dive into the issue of Nintendo Switch 2 HDR calibration.</p>
<p>I'm referring to Vincent Teoh of HDTVTest, widely regarded as the best YouTube channel when it comes to TV and display analysis. Teoh found several problems with HDR calibration on the new Nintendo console:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective HDR calibration depends greatly on whether the user's TV supports HGIG or source-based tone mapping. The test pattern adjustment for max TML (tonemap luminance) reliably works only on HGIG-enabled displays.</li>
<li>The adjustment steps are just too many when compared to other console HDR calibration menus, such as the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series S|X, and there's no numeric indicator to help.</li>
<li>The Nintendo Switch 2's default paper white setting is brighter than the reference white level of 203 nits recommended by the ITU-R BT.2408, the standard for 1000 nits HDR10 content. This results in a perceptually flatter image where midtones are pushed too high, reducing dynamic range and leaving insufficient headroom for specular highlights, translating into a less impactful HDR presentation.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the adjustment steps for the paper white setting change based on the max TML previously set, further complicating accurate HDR tweaking.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="I Measured Nintendo Switch 2's HDR Settings - No Wonder Most Games Look Awful. Here's The Fix." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X84e14oe6gs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How can the Nintendo Switch 2 HDR presentation be improved in light of all these issues? First, you should get an HGIG-compatible display, as that greatly affects how accurate HDR content viewing will be. If you must stick to a display that does not support HGIG, the best compromise is to set&nbsp;the max TML at 1000 nits and paper white around 200 nits to minimize clipping while preserving contrast.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a few settings to tweak. Switching the Nintendo Switch 2 console to dark theme mode reduces the influence of Automatic Brightness Limiter (ABL) when using OLED displays, preserving more consistent brightness and contrast. It's also important to set HDR output to “compatible software only” to avoid forcing HDR on SDR content. Lastly, the screen burn-in protection feature is redundant on modern OLED displays and useless on non-OLED displays, so it should be disabled.</p>

<p>The game, which serves as a complete remake of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/crash_team_racing">1999 PS1 original</a>, was developed by Beenox, a studio that has since been gobbled up by the <strong>Call of Duty</strong> conveyor belt. That said, Nitro-Fueled was well-received upon launch for its faithfulness to the original, but also got quite a bit of heat for its micro-transactions.</p>

<p>Activision has since released the incredible <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a> and the rather middling <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/crash_team_rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a>, both developed by the now-independent studio Toys for Bob. As the series now sits with Xbox, speculation is swirling that the team may have been commissioned to work on something Crash-related for the future, though this is unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>It's a great result for Nitro-Fueled though, and we're hopeful that the Crash Bandicoot series continues to thrive going forward. We wouldn't say no to a cheeky Switch 2 performance update, too. How about it, Beenox?</p><p><figure data-videoid="h4CCwRn9Ca8" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4CCwRn9Ca8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h4CCwRn9Ca8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4CCwRn9Ca8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed40239egtnimk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4CCwRn9Ca8">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

            <p>Beta test site and small game curator Alpha Beta Gamer have put out their Games To Get Excited About 2025 showcase, and (salt to taste, granted) it's exactly what it says on the tin. 110 curated trailers in an hour and five minutes, organised and timestamped by genre, with no paid adverts and no teeth-grindingly awful skits. They've also made a point to not include any cinematic trailers, although I haven't watched the whole thing yet. They might be liars. Are you liars, Alpha Beta Gamer? Wait, don't answer that. I've seen Labyrinth like fifty billion times, I know how this ends up.</p>

<p>Being a jiving hepcat iconoclast trailblazer, I immediately scrubbed through to the 'weird games' category, which reminded me how obscenely gorgeous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-living-things-is-a-stop-motion-artbook-puzzle-game-based-on-a-600-year-old-alchemical-manuscript">All Living Things </a>is, and also introduced me to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/troleu">Troleu</a>, in which you punch people for refusing to pay the fare on your trolleybus. The FPS section opened with <a href="https://rowye.itch.io/darkenstein-3-d">Darkenstein 3D</a>, which looks a bit like classic Medal Of Honor but with nazi-hunting and dog rescuing. And I also learned that speculative biology tale <a href="https://nomarsh.itch.io/scrimshaw">South Scrimshaw</a> is getting a second part. This was all through some very casual browsing, mind. I feel I should also point out that at no point was I assaulted by a.) a muppet, b.) a pair of shit shoes, or c.) Hideo Kojima.</p>
<p>"It’s a streamlined experience created to counteract the bloat of the mainstream Summer showcases," says ABG. And yeah, can't fault them on that at all. Do let me know if you spot anything especially groovy, or perhaps even the coveted double-groovy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Casino roguelike" AAA Simulator's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3358040/AAA_Simulator/">Steam page has a demo</a>, and also a boxout description I imagine I'd find extremely trite (in a Brewdog Punk IPA, Outer Worlds anti-capitalism-as-a-feature type way) if I hadn't already read designer Nic Vasudeva-Barkdull's much more convincing and considered thoughts on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicbarkdull_aaa-simulator-on-steam-activity-7336656661970874368-Nn3F">putting the game together</a>.

<p>Vasudeva-Barkdull says the idea came about when Blizzard's Rod Fergusson implored executives, in the wake of layoffs, to "be empathetic...these people aren't knobs and dials". It made Vasudeva-Barkdull wonder, he says, "what kinds of knobs and dials the executives of these companies actually have, and whether there could be game design that actually shapes your actions towards greed and callousness".</p>
<p>"My first instinct was that if a player were given a literal knob or slider to hire and fire people, along with an ever-increasing profit goal to meet, they would have no choice but to do evil things like mass layoffs in service of the bottom line," says Vasudeva-Barkdull.  "The design of the system wouldn't have it any other way. And that, I believe, is the core truth of simulating the corporate world. Any option which does not bring profit to the shareholders simply does not exist - in the simulation or in reality".</p>
<p>Incentivising player callousness by marrying it to efficiency or other incentives isn't a new idea, of course. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers Please</a> etc. But I do think there's something interesting in stripping away the narra-framing and telling a story <em>about</em> a system, albeit with some heightened surreality and a bit of silliness.</p>
<p>As for the demo itself? It made me grin like a guilty pickpocket roleplaying as a guilt-agnostic pickpocket, yeah. You fire people ten at a time. Hiring interns is abstracted as a buff where you "select five employees to receive minus 100% salary", itself very funny and horrible wording, but it feels especially nasty when you go to use it and actually have to click five employees with names and jobs shuffling their way around the studio. The interface and music are pretty charming, too. It all feels very cartridge-coded - much lighter and livelier than you'd probably expect from a business tycoon or management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>. The full thing is out September if you fancy it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the now-deleted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/1lawtma/im_about_to_cry_1000_hours_and_20_years_of_mons/">Reddit</a> post (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/distraught-pokmon-fan-lost-1000-hours-and-20-years-of-progress-during-switch-2-system-transfer-proving-need-for-pokmon-home-to-save-beloved-creatures">IGN</a>), user ThatOtaku26 states that their save file had Pokémon brought over from previous generations going all the way back to the GBA. They said that the transfer "went fine", with every other Pokémon game retaining their respective saves, but the file from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet</a> had disappeared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I just got a switch 2, did the startup and initial data transfer with no issues. My Scarlet save file is gone. It loads straight into the language selection and create a character screens. No data on my OLED. Just all gone.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5qpihwl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"THERE WAS NO ERROR IN DATA TRANSFER AT ALL. IT WENT FINE. ALL MY OTHER POKEMON DATA IS STILL THERE, BUT NOT SCARLET. I had mons from my original GBA up to current on there. Literally 20 years worth of data. There's nothing I can do. I don't even know if i wanna play anymore."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse, the Pokémon games are part of just a small handful of Switch titles that aren't compatible with the cloud save functionality offered by Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>The alternative is to use <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> to save the creatures that you deem to be of utmost value. Some Reddit commenters, including IAmTheWire, noted that the original poster should have considered this before performing the Switch 2 system transfer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ngl the fact that you didn't transfer all of your important Pokémon to Home first is on you. We've known that this is the only way to preserve your Pokémon for sure in this kind of circumstance or if your old Switch broke, otherwise they’d be gone forever. I'd have done it just to be safe if nothing else since it's so obvious and easy to transfer them back if something was to go wrong."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others, however, have been a bit more empathetic, with Grouchy-Cress-215 stating that "tears were shed" when the same thing happened to them.</p>
<p>It's not known exactly what happened with the save file in this instance. This writer booted up their own copy of Scarlet on the Switch 2 and picked up right where they left off on the OLED, but it seems that fate did not have the same plan for ThatOtaku26.</p>
<p>Take this as a lesson though, folks. If you've built up a collection of Pokémon dating back generations, then do consider using Pokémon HOME to keep the lovable critters safe in the (unlikely) event something like this occurs.</p>

			<p>Tetsuya Mizuguchi's signature games blend synesthesia through art in a playable medium. From Rez to Child of Eden and the cult classic <a href="https://wccftech.com/interview-tetsuya-mizuguchi-synesthesia-tetris-effect-rez-lumines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tetris Effect</a>, the rhythm and visuals work in tandem to create an experience unlike anything else. While this isn't the first Lumines title, it is the first to build on the creative framework of Tetris Effect: Connected, both in terms of audio and visuals. Hands down, this was by far the one demo from Summer Game Fest 2025's Play Days that I kept coming back to and thinking about long after my thirty minutes were up.</p>
<p>True to the long-running puzzle rhythm series, Lumines Arise focuses on the gameplay of dropping 2x2 squares built from two different colors and linking together matching colors in various squares. Both dropping the squares and linking them together result in musical notes and beats, letting the player remix tracks on the fly as they reach that puzzling nirvana. Each track has its own layers of color palettes and music, and, while the transitions aren't as smooth as in earlier games, they blend from one song into the next once you clear a certain number of boxes.</p>
<p>Unlike previous games in the Lumines series, Lumines Arise is focused on the musical styling of a single artist: Hydelic, who longtime Enhance fans would recognize as the composer of Tetris Effect: Connected's soundtrack as well. Speaking with one of the onsite devs, there aren't currently any plans to bring in licensed artists like Mondo Grosso (who was the backdrop for one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_xNTvN03TU">most memorable Lumines</a> stages of all time). This gives Lumines Arise more of a criterion collection focused on a single composer who has a knack for nailing a wide variety of genres. While I don't know the name of the track quite yet, one of the final demo tracks with a pair of chameleons headbanging to the bass drops had the best overall vibes of the whole session, with an energetic beat that gets elevated when you achieve a solid combo chain or Burst.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Lumines Arise plays out similarly to earlier titles. To assist players with chaining together squares and creating flashy combos, Lumines traditionally has a single upgrade when dropped, will link and destroy every block of matching color that's linked up and touched. This simple upgrade helps clear away trash and let a single matching color fall into place to hopefully create a chain of squares, but this is largely dependent upon the player's skill to have that foresight to link blocks together beforehand.</p>
<p>New to Lumines Arise is the Burst mechanic, a new twist that allows players to build up a meter over time and unleash a powerful Burst that essentially locks a square into place, permitting players to build on it and chain together larger and larger combos. As Bursts can be triggered any time once the bar is at least partially filled, it becomes a delicate balance between wanting to use the mechanic as often as possible versus saving it for a clutch moment when you want to skyrocket your combo count and potentially skip through a majority of a track you might not want to listen to (which in Hydelic's defense, I couldn't find a single track in my modest demo session that I wouldn't mind hearing again and again).</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise PS5 Preview Gameplay from SGF 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cjc9NUgbqv0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lumines Arise is one of those demos that kept lingering in the back of my head with the musical styling of Hydelic running through my thoughts with a few different renditions from the number of times I kept coming back whenever I had gaps in my schedule to get another run through the demo. In fact, my first playthrough of Lumines Arise's hands-on demo finished in roughly seven minutes with an S rank, although I didn't have the foresight to set up my capture card and record the run, so instead readers will have to settle for a not-so-smooth run captured below.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is currently on track for a Fall 2025 release across PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR 2, and PC, with a free demo available later this Summer.</p>
