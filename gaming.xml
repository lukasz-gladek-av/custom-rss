            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Still Plans First-Party Xbox Handheld, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-still-plans-first-party-xbox-handheld-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1429477</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As Microsoft continues to shape its vision for the future of the Xbox brand, it still plans to develop a first-party handheld device, even if “everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>In 2025, ASUS launched the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally series </a>of handheld gaming devices. The two new devices were more powerful versions of the previously launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/asus-rog-ally/" id="629">ROG Ally systems,</a> designed to make it easier to access PC game launchers, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075"> Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>



<p>Still, a new <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-the-next-gen-xbox-2027-locked-in-most-ambitious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Jez Corden </a>notes that plans remain in place for a first-party Xbox handheld, even if the next mainline Xbox console is the primary focus for now. </p>



<p>The next-generation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>platform is touted as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft’s </a>boldest effort in the gaming space to date, even after a game-changing quarter-century. As such, they’re not committing to a firm launch date for the next home console yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-changes-coming-soon-to-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally">Major Changes Coming Soon to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</h2>



<p>The report from Corden notes that Microsoft is testing a new NPU-driven highlights feature for the Xbox Ally X that automatically transforms gameplay clips into shareable videos. This feature is slated for a March 2026 release.</p>



<p>The next Xbox console is also set to take notes from the Ally X handheld by bringing multiple launchers, such as the Epic Games launcher and Steam, to the platform. Regardless of the hardware, the overall message remains the same: make Xbox accessible anywhere and everywhere.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Man Murders His Girlfriend But is More Concerned About ‘Missing’ GTA 6]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-murder-man-concerned-about-missing-game/</link>
            <guid>1429474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Robert Richens was apprehended by UK police last year for brutally murdering his former girlfriend. Recently, Richens appeared at Oxford Crown Court for sentencing, being sent down with a life sentence on February 6, 2026. In new footage captured by the police officers who brought Richens in, it was revealed that the killer had something else on his mind at the time.</p>



<p>In a clip that has gone <strong>viral</strong> in recent days, Richens was caught sobbing midway through being arrested, blurting out that he was going to ‘miss GTA’.</p>



<h2 id="h-callous-and-merciless-murder">‘Callous’ and ‘Merciless’ Murder</h2>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news/thames-valley/news/2026/february/02-02-26/man-jailed-for-life-for-murder--abingdon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Thames Valley Police</a> in the United Kingdom, itwas confirmed that Robert Richens, aged 35, was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 16 years, for the 2025 murder of his former partner.</p>



<p>Per the report, Richens had called emergency services on the morning of May 30 and stressed that he’d accidentally killed someone. Upon investigation, it was found that his former partner, Rachael Vaughan, had been subject to a ‘sustained assault’ that had left her lifeless.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip that surfaced recently on social media, showing Richens sobbing and lamenting the loss of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A man in the UK was arrested for murder, and his only concern was that he’d miss GTA VI as he’d likely get life in prison. </p><p>The police officer replies “You’ve got ages for that” 💀 <a href="https://t.co/by2KVdbLkn">pic.twitter.com/by2KVdbLkn</a></p></div>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/2020303229091999969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In the video, a police officer casually asks what GTA he’s referring to, and when Richens simply said, ‘Six,’ the officer brushed it off, suggesting he ‘had ages’ until the game came out.</p>



<p>Richens won’t only miss Grand Theft Auto 6, but likely Grand Theft Auto 7 too, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rockstar-games/" id="1648">Rockstar’s</a> release cadence is anything to go by. While UK prisons permit games consoles, they’re only allowed older units that cannot connect to the internet, which includes the likes of the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox.</p>



<p>During sentencing, the judge labelled Richens’ actions as callous and merciless for the crime he’d pleaded guilty to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS6 and PlayStation Handheld To Have Impressive Memory Specs, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/</link>
            <guid>1429471</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest round of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-6/" id="217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a> claims surfaced recently, alongside claims regarding the upcoming ‘PlayStation handheld’, dubbed Project Canis. In a series of posts on NeoGAF, reliable tech leaker, KeplerL2, divulged some tidbits about the upcoming next generation of PlayStation hardware, focused squarely on <strong>memory capabilities</strong>.</p>



<p>In the string of posts, KeplerL2 claimed that the PlayStation 6 could boast up to 30 GB of GDDR7 memory, using a specific configuration to fit it into the console. Elsewhere, the PlayStation handheld, KeplerL2 says, could have as much as 24 GB of LPDDR5X memory, putting it at least on par with the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X, arguably the most premium handheld on the market.</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-6-and-playstation-handheld-claims-surface-again">PlayStation 6 and PlayStation Handheld Claims Surface Again</h2>



<p>It’s once every few months that we’re seeing fresh information emerge regarding the next generation of PlayStation hardware.</p>



<p>In April 2025, we had claims come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from KeplerL2</a> that the upcoming PlayStation handheld won’t be as powerful as the PlayStation 5. In August, a fresh wave <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of technical specs leaked</a> for both devices, and in October, it was claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6 will be released</a> as early as 2027.</p>



<p>This new spate of information comes from KeplerL2 again, who has proven to be mostly reliable in the past for technical insights.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/amd-ceo-reveals-next-gen-xbox-could-launch-in-2027-%E2%80%94-ceo-says-semi-custom-soc-ready-to-support-launch-in-2027.1693009/page-9#post-271240975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a thread</a> on NeoGAF, KeplerL2 addressed a question around <strong>how </strong>Sony would ‘hit 30GB of GDDR7 with only 4GB modules on a 160-bit bus.’</p>



<p>Per KeplerL2, the tech titan would opt for 3 GB memory modules arranged in a clamshell configuration. It would reduce the memory bus but hit a higher memory speed overall and promote more bandwidth, as much as 640 GB/s (thanks to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/playstation-handheld-reportedly-with-24gb-memory-ps6-console-with-30gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videocardz.com</a> for the breakdown).</p>



<p>Additionally, KeplerL2 suggested that a ‘good amount of memory’ for the PlayStation portable (‘PS6 handheld’) would be 24 GB, which is more or less the industry standard right now for top-tier handheld gaming devices.</p>



<p>As always, these kinds of claims or suggestions should be taken with a grain of salt until we have it from the horse’s mouth.</p>







<p>What do you think? Can you see the PS6 launching with almost double the memory capacity of the PlayStation 5? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/</link>
            <guid>1429447</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is introducing a new Ringside Pass, similar to battle pass systems in other games. Now, the gameplay designer, Cornell Gunter, explains the benefits fans can expect from this new addition.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> is set to release worldwide on March 13. This year’s game features the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273">several match types</a> to WWE video games. However, there are also many changes coming to this year’s game, including the introduction of a<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-will-the-wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-work/" id="174147"> new Ringside Pass</a>, which changes how unlockables work in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-dev-says-ringside-pass-is-about-content-first-and-foremost">WWE 2K26 Dev Says Ringside Pass Is About Content First and Foremost</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/m935QSZHAfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JustBryan,</a> WWE 2K26 gameplay designer Cornell Gunter praised the changes that the new Ringside Pass will offer. He notes that Ringside Pass Premium will offer day-one DLC. He also notes that the new system is strictly about content rather than time-sensitive releases. </p>



<p>While it is divided into seasons, none of the benefits are time-limited. If a player returns to the game after several months away, they will still have access to all premium content. Overall, there will be 120 reward items per season.</p>



<p>“I’m very excited to see what the reactions are by the end of the lifecycle. Because I think people are going to be very, very happy with what we are able to achieve and what we brought to the table with the Ringside Pass,” Gunter said.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Team Vitality Wins IEM Krakow After 3-1 Victory over FURIA]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/team-vitality-wins-iem-krakow-beat-furia/</link>
            <guid>1429444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Vitality has lifted the trophy at IEM Krakow, extending a phenomenal record over the last year or so and sending FURIA packing at the final post. The victory came after a hard-fought battle in the Tauron Arena in front of thousands of fans, but Vitality’s final streak through FURIA was a masterclass to behold.</p>



<p>Only the opening round on Mirage was of any use to the Brazilian side, stumping up a tough 11-13 finish that quickly went squandered in the subsequent maps. By the third map, Team Vitality was dominating 13-2, showing why it was worthy of that all-important trophy and the $400,000 prize.</p>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-matches-iem-krakow-predictions">Team Vitality Matches IEM Krakow Predictions</h2>



<p>In our earlier coverage, our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/iem-krakow/" id="3570">IEM Krakow</a> predictions had Team Vitality sitting pretty in first place, and it’s always nice to be validated by the result.</p>



<p>Team Vitality has pushed onwards and upwards with a monumental, award-winning streak that has left the team being regarded as one of the all-time greatest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike</a> rosters ever created. In the last year, the organization has edged into double-digit territory in terms of trophies raised, and this latest one, secured at the first IEM Krakow event, is more ammunition for the cabinet.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the team’s last win came at the StarLadder Budapest Major in December, which yielded a 3-1 win over FaZe Clan and a $500,000 prize.</p>



<p>Krakow seemed in the bag for Vitality throughout much of the tournament. For die-hard fans of the brand, this was only ever going to go one way.</p>



<figure></figure>

As Anku, an Aymara boy with a unique gift, you’ll harness the power of color to shape the environment itself, uncovering hidden paths to navigate challenging and complex puzzles.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Single Player</strong> – Bring the world around you to life with the power of color in <em>Colorbound</em>, a vibrant palette-platformer. Join Anku on a heartfelt journey to reunite his late grandfather’s band by using color to shape the world around you. As you journey, you’ll solve puzzles, uncover secrets, and help a family of musicians come together one last time.</li><li><strong>A Farewell Tour For Your Grandfather</strong> – Anku’s grandfather was a beloved musician to his people, but his band has long since scattered. Now, with only memories and a special gift, Anku must journey across diverse landscapes to find the missing musicians, reignite their passions, and give his grandfather the farewell he deserves. Along the way, you’ll use color to brighten the canvas, turning obstacles into opportunities, and puzzles into music!</li><li><strong>Change Colors to Change The World</strong> – In <em>Colorbound</em>, you will collect colors onto your palette, which can be used to overcome logic and light platforming puzzles. From lush forests to forgotten cities, <em>Colorbound</em>‘s overworld offers a variety of mind-bending puzzles that span a variety of locations and aesthetics.</li><li><strong>Finding Balance</strong> – Not all colors behave the same way. Some may be lighter, allowing objects to float away once painted, while other colors are heavier and may drop down. Using this to your advantage can help Anku cross the treacherous terrain to reach his destination.</li><li><strong>Rooted in Culture</strong> – <em>Colorbound</em> draws inspiration from the Aymara culture of the Andes, blending traditional music and art styles with an indie-gem-inspired puzzle platformer experience. Informed by Panpipe Studio’s Chilean culture and heritage, <em>Colorbound</em> celebrates the rich culture of South America while delivering a universal story of love, loss, and the power of art.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

<li>Green letters are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li>Yellow letters are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>

</ul>



<p id="block-5e597b53-af1c-4c06-a00c-6c5a4694e9e0">The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>More changes could be coming to Xbox Game Pass, per a new report.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075">Xbox Game Pass</a> is currently a cornerstone of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/xbox-series-x/" id="28">Xbox </a>business. This past October, the cost of the Game Pass Ultimate tier increased to $29.99 per month after the company added nearly 50 games and committed to over 75 day-one releases per year.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge </a>reports that more changes could be coming to the subscription service. One potential change is Microsoft experimenting with bundling additional third-party services with Game Pass subscriptions. Game Pass Ultimate currently includes access to Fortnite Crew, Ubisoft+ Classics, and EA Play.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft </a>is considering merging <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>Game Pass Premium, the second-tier offering, with PC Game Pass. PC Game Pass is currently $16.49 per month and only allows players to access games on PC, rather than through the cloud or on consoles.</p>







<h2 id="h-still-don-t-expect-changes-to-game-pass-in-2026">Still, Don’t Expect Changes to Game Pass in 2026</h2>



<p>Tom Warren also states that he doesn’t expect any changes to the service this calendar year. Not only did Xbox make significant changes in October, but Microsoft is still seeing growth in PC Game Pass subscriptions.</p>



<p>Regarding the future of Xbox,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-says-next-xbox-console-may-launch-next-year/" id="173908"> AMD recently stated that the next Xbox console could launch in 2027.</a> It’s been said that the next Xbox in-home unit would be a PC-console hybrid. </p>







<p>In 2025, the brand entered the handheld market with the ROG Ally Xbox devices. Learn more about those <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-xbox-ally-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-differences-price-specs/" id="148540">here</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 6.46pm</strong>: In a statement to Eurogamer, Epic Games' senior communications manager, Brian Sharon, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place."</blockquote>
<p>Original story follows.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Horses developer Santa Ragione has responded to comments from an Epic Games Store executive claiming he "made provably incorrect statements about the game's content".</p>
<p>Posting the statement online over the weekend, Santa Ragione refuted claims that Epic Games Store "love" the studio, alleging the storefront had "ghosted" it when it withdrew support for its controversial horror game at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Santa Ragione's Horses was, of course, the subject of multiple headlines ahead of its release as Steam <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">refused to distribute the game</a>. Then, just before its release, it was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">banned from the Epic storefront</a>. This all put the studio into jeopardy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">with founder Pietro Righi Riva telling Eurogamer it could face closure if Horses didn't sell well</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">Santa Ragione claimed that it had received notification from Epic 24 hours before Horses' release</a>, explaining it would no longer distribute the game after its "review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines". Epic's email specifically referenced its policies around "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content", saying Horses contravenes guidelines prohibiting content that "promotes abuse and animal abuse", and "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour or [that is] not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated".</p>
<p>On this latter point, Epic said it had filled out an IARC Questionnaire based on the content it reviewed, receiving an Adult Only (AO) rating - a rating category it does not distribute on its storefront.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, however, Epic VP Steve Allison told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game">Game File</a> in an interview, "We love [Santa Ragione] [... but the studio's] answers were just different than... some of the moderators' were after they played through the game".</p>
<p>"Our time on this topic was limited, but it seems news of the Steam ban triggered an Epic review of the rating, which is usually produced via a self-reported submission to a ratings coalition," Game File's Stephen Totilo later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me7ljfxjes2i">clarified</a> on social media.</p>

"They do not 'love that studio', they have effectively ghosted us.</p>
<p>"The fact that the game does not deserve an AO rating is apparent from the widely available full walkthroughs on YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, as well as from its distribution on the Humble Store," the studio added.</p>
<p>Despite the issues distributing Horses, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/following-controversial-bans-from-steam-and-epic-santa-ragiones-horses-has-sold-18k-copies-and-repaid-debts">Santa Ragione has generated enough to repay the loans it took out in order to finish developing the game</a>, as well as the royalties owed to Horses creator Andrea Lucco Borlera.</p>

            <p>The creator of the Rayman series has once again teased that a remake of the original Rayman game is on the way.</p>
<p>In an interview with RetroGamer and spotted by the Rayman Merchandise fan account, Michel Ancel teased that while he "do[esn't] remember" the specifics, the remake "will be in HD and I think Ubisoft is adding a few more checkpoints and things like that just to make it a bit less frustrating".</p>

<p>"I think Rayman is still a fun game, and there's a lot of content," Michel told <a href="https://retrogamesofficial.com/">RetroGamer</a>. "The pacing is a bit slow because you have a big character on the screen. It also has pixel-precise gameplay, so it's not always easy, but it's interesting that the constraints of yesterday make it still feel original today.</p><p>"Even though it's complex, I think there's a kind of remake planned," he added. "I think it's a nice move, because [the lack of savepoints is] the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps now one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">second only to the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>, the unannounced Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-unannounced-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-popped-up-on-the-australian-ratings-board">even popped up on the Australian Classification Board</a>. The Australian government has rated it a 'G' - the equivalent to the UK's 'U' - for its "very mild impact" violence. It's reportedly coming to both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch, with Atari listed as both the developer and publisher.</p>
<p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, towards the end of last year, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-series-returns-to-life-on-its-30th-anniversary-but-dont-expect-a-new-game-soon">and provided a little teaser of what's to come</a>. In a video posted on the official Rayman X account, which had been dormant for years prior to the announcement, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>It's now unclear, however, if those plans have been scuppered by Ubisoft's "reset" in which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a>, including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. The news wiped<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years"> over a third off its share price</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has "aggressively" been cracking down on cheaters and already banned "tens of thousands of players so far".</p>
<p>That's according to Embark Studios' CEO Patrick Söderlund, who told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">IGN</a> in a new interview that while he wasn't "going to give a specific number" on how many players have been caught cheating, with "anywhere between 0.1 percent to one percent of any multiplayer crowd in a large-scale multiplayer game is cheating", the team had to work hard to "be a step ahead".</p>

</div><figcaption>Is Arc Raiders any good?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziFMFFkMJ2Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"We have been pretty aggressive on this," Söderlund said. "The game wasn't prone to so many cheaters in the beginning, but as with all multiplayer games that get successful, this becomes a component, unfortunately. For us as developers, just like a [Distributed Denial-of-Service] attack, it's one of these things that you just have to try and be a step ahead. To be very honest with you, it's not always easy because the minute you do something, the minute you come up with something, they've come up with something else to do."</p>
<p>That's not the only difficulty, either. Söderlund said that the banning process alone is "delicate" because "we need to make sure that we ban people that deserve to be banned".</p>
<p>"If you take general figures, anywhere between 0.1% to 1% of any multiplayer crowd in a large-scale multiplayer game is cheating, and therefore, to some extent, should get a temporary or a longer, or permanent ban," Söderlund explained.</p>
<p>"It could be a minor thing that you're trying. An aim bot that may get you a 24-hour suspension, to doing something that, frankly, means you shouldn't be playing the game anymore. So, we've put together a system. We've started banning players, and why do I know that? Because I see an influx of people trying to get to the studio, and to me. 'Oh, I didn't do anything'.</p><p>"We're seeing a pretty substantial change in that, but I know that we have banned probably tens of thousands of players so far, that I know. Again, we need to make sure that we get it right. That we are fair, and that, in the case where it's clear that we didn't get it right, that we can quickly remedy the situation so that player isn't affected in an unfair fashion or way."</p>
<p>It's this need to be fair that does, Söderlund admits, result in "a little bit more cautio[n] than what I think some people want for that specific reason".</p>
<p>"Regardless of how cautious you are and what systems are in place, there are always people that are going to feel like they're treated unfairly that, 'I didn't do anything,' and then there are absolutely people that will get caught or that are unfairly banned that we need to deal with. We try and look at it from that perspective, but we will continue to go after people that are doing things in the game that they shouldn't do."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raider-is-committed-to-skill-and-fun-not-unfair-advantages-and-is-refunding-gear-lost-to-cheaters-even-if-you-didnt-report-them">Arc Raiders committed to returning items to your inventory if you lose them to cheaters</a> shortly after launch, saying it was "committed to skill and fun, not unfair advantages". And you don't even have to be the person to have reported them, either.</p><p>While finding and losing gear in extraction shooters is a key part of the experience, developer Embark Studios said it was working to ensure that players who lose out due to "unfair play" are compensated, regardless of whether or not they're the one who reported the cheaters in the first place.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview</a>, we wrote: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p>Epic Games Store plans to be available on the next Xbox console at launch.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game">Game File</a>, Epic Games' Steve Allison said Xbox had "welcome[d]" the idea of including Epic's storefront on its hardware, adding "we're going to be there, like, on day one".</p>

<figcaption>Love &amp; Legends in Fortnite.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV4XiVb4aJQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"We definitely plan to be on the new hardware for Xbox, because, unless their policy or stance on it changes, [Microsoft] are telling us they’re going to welcome that," Allison said. "And we're going be there, like, on day one. That will probably require us to build in whatever their requirements are, some sort of software to support that."</p>
<p>To do this, however, Epic needs to design a dedicated app for the next Xbox console, and Allison admitted, "we haven't built the apps for those that we need to build".</p>
<p>If this comes to pass, it'll herald a significant change in the console ecosystem, which, up until now, has been extraordinarily closed to third-party sellers.</p>
<p>Allison went further, confirming Epic Games Store now averaged around 67 million monthly users last year – around half of Steam's, Allison thinks – and generating a record $400 million (£294m) in revenue from the sale of third-party games.</p>
<p>Consequently, Epic now intends to expand into other markets, including on iOS in Japan, mobile in Brazil, add more social features (forums(!), specifically), and make it easier to switch between EGS' PC offerings and EGS on mobile. We should also expect an update to the store's game launcher later this year, too.</p>
<p>"We're ripping out the guts. We're replacing the guts with modern guts. That are faster, it won't have, like, a two-second lag on your refresh, it won't take as much system resources in your tray, all that stuff's underway."</p>
<p>In a different interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/epic-wants-to-bring-its-store-to-the-next-gen-xbox-as-it-begins-to-show-serious-growth-weve-been-talking-to-the-folks-at-microsoft">WindowsCentral</a>, confirming Epic Games had "been talking to the folks at Microsoft" and expected "serious growth" as it continues to build its sales business, Allison hinted that its free games program can have a significant impact on the sale of <em>its</em> free games on <em>other</em> platforms, like Steam and consoles.</p>
<p>"We take it very seriously," Allison said about its free games program. "The team loves to highlight games that they think are awesome, that may have been underserved or missed by players.</p>
<p>"We bring in 10 million new players a year through the program. It's very consistent. It's the best customer acquisition spend you can ever make, from a dollars-per-new-user standpoint," Allison added. "It's really important for our players. I would never want to see us rug pull it away from people, it's kind of part of our identity."</p>

<p>What’s next for <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>? It seems to be the big question scratching everyone’s heads this year.</p>
<p>2026 is still a blank Sheikah Slate. Now that the Switch 2 console is in full swing and the Era of the Wild seems to be finally riding off into the Gerudo sunset, we’re truly in uncharted territory. We know there will be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film">Legend of Zelda movie</a> coming in 2027, but other than that, we’re just about as blind as a wayward Keese in a snowstorm on Snowhead. Who knows what’s going to happen in the first main, non-Partner Nintendo Direct for 2026, or if there will even be a Zelda game revealed in the coming months.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2lwtqns&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Fortunately, the legendary staff behind the series isn’t lost by any means. They know what they’re doing, and they’ve left us a mysterious but important clue behind. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">In an interview with 4Gamer</a> and the Koei Tecmo development team, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma shared that an enormous amount of inspiration took place when they co-developed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a> with Koei Tecmo and their new AAA Studio staff.</p>
<p>"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is the first Zelda title for the Nintendo Switch 2. To be honest, we wanted to be the first to do so,” Aonuma laughed, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/zelda-producer-aonuma-inspirations-for-next-game/">according to TheGamer's translation</a>. “However, the inspiration we received from this collaboration with Koei Tecmo may be reflected in the [next] Zelda we create. Please imagine this while playing Age of Imprisonment, and look forward to our Zelda.”</p>
<h2>But it’s not Imprisonment for you</h2>

<p>Hold on, before you groan and head for the back button in disgust, I know what you’re thinking. Many of you (not all) are a little weary of living in the Era of the Wild for almost a decade. And the last thing you want in a Zelda game is more repetitive hack and slash to boot, right?</p>
<p>That’s understandable. I’m 99.99% confident that’s not what the next Zelda will be about. I leave behind the 0.01% because, well, it’s The Legend of Zelda we’re talking about. What the Zelda team has in mind will always be mysterious to a point.</p>
<p>That said, I believe their inspiration with Age of Imprisonment in creating the next Zelda game has to do with a new narrative style. In fact, Age of Imprisonment could hold the key to solving the “Great Divide” between the old school and new school Zelda fan camps. Imagine a game in a brand new Hyrule era that finally joins the open-world and traditional Zelda formulas together into a unique cinematic interactive experience.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Allow me to explain.</p>
<h2>Think Legend of Zelda: The Video Game Movie</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26e52803511b9"><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26e52803511b9/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Sony Pictures</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s true, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> changed history. Not only did it revolutionise the open-world genre for the entire industry (looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>), it introduced full spoken voice acting into the series for the first time. This format encouraged stunning art direction and breathed life into characters like never before in a Zelda game. But there was a problem. The sheer freedom of open world movement limited the narrative potential to flashback cutscenes that the player finds scattered throughout the map, geographic lore hunting, and a creative, though somewhat disconnected final boss.</p>
<p>Its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, introduced a much stronger final boss experience with the return of Ganondorf and has plenty of geographic lore hunting, but it too was limited to cinematic flashbacks that can either elate or ruin a player’s experience depending on who you ask, what the found order was, and what the context consisted of in the player’s personal situation. Or perhaps, the scenes we do get are produced so extravagantly that we are only left wanting more.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain: they’re powerful enough to spark gigantic internet fights. That's open world for you. Do with that what you will.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>Now I arrive at Age of Imprisonment’s strongest point - the narrative.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to allow players to experience the ancient Imprisoning War firsthand and fill in the gaps left behind in Tears of the Kingdom with a staggering three hours' worth of seamless voice-acted cutscenes that surpass the limitations of Breath of the Wild, thanks to its more linear Purah Pad map format.</p>
<p>What’s fascinating is that the game isn’t completely linear. Unlike the previous Hyrule Warriors instalment, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, the battle challenges in Age of Imprisonment are incorporated into the main story with the map. There’s a lot of freedom to select battles without breaking the narrative. When you clear a certain amount of them, a story-locked milestone battle with cutscenes appears. Even the map itself interacts with you to pull you into the high-stakes tension of the Imprisoning War. You truly feel like you’re in the trenches with the characters and sharing in their blood, sweat, and tears as they push back against the Demon King’s overwhelming forces. This was intended by design.</p>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujubasashi explained that Age of Imprisonment’s “functionality and player experience came first, but even though the order may change, we put it together so that the scenario and terrain are well-rounded.”</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo director Aoyagi Kimiki further explained that Age of Imprisonment has “the appeal of a historical drama” with the Imprisoning War, an important event for Zelda fans. “We aimed to give the historical flow that was shared with us at the beginning its true form, and to create a structure that would allow players to feel that they were part of that history as they fought, as part of the Warriors experience.”</p>

<p>Could this mean that the narrative limitations of the open-world system will finally be conquered in the next Zelda game? That we’ll not only experience full-length cinematic cutscenes that flow naturally like a traditional mainline Zelda again, but we’ll get to live and interact in a living, breathing Hyrule Castle Town and experience the thrills of massive dungeon crawling and camping under the stars in Hyrule Field, too? Perhaps an entirely interactive, cinematic universe?</p>
<p>I dare you to imagine such a feat. That seems like an impossible fantasy right now. But if the Zelda team can achieve a feat like that, it would not only revolutionise Zelda games again, it would set an entire industry trend ablaze.</p>
<p>Then again, that’s routine for the Zelda team. They have a stubborn habit of making groundbreaking history.</p>
