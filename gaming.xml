Newcastle had lost and, to make matters worse, Adams’ journey home was being delayed by snow. That is, it kept covering his windscreen and he had to repeatedly stop and get out of the car to clear it.</p><p>Some kind of innovation was needed. There had to be something that would help people see where they were going.</p><p>As it turned out, there was; a few years later Adams invented his own windscreen wiper. He patented the design and became one of several people from around the beginning of the 1900s credited with conceiving of similar devices, although his version of the windscreen wiper never made it into production.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>3D driving games had quickly become Reflections’ specialty, but the team knew you couldn’t tread water in a genre long famous for being on the cutting edge of video game technology.</p></div><p>Nearly a century down the track, Newcastle upon Tyne developer Reflections had found itself riding high on a purple patch of PlayStation success, propelled by the popular Destruction Derby series it had developed for legendary British publisher Psygnosis. 3D driving games had quickly become Reflections’ specialty, but the team knew you couldn’t tread water in a genre long famous for being on the cutting edge of video game technology. Some kind of innovation was needed. Something that would help people see where the future of driving games was going.</p><p>As it turned out, Reflections founder Martin Edmondson had just such an idea – and, unlike their fellow Novocastrian’s windscreen wipers, Edmondson’s idea <em>did</em> make it into production.</p><p>And it completely redefined what a driving game could be, forever.</p><p>Founded in 1984, Reflections spent the bulk of its first decade building action games for early home computers like the BBC Micro and Amiga, but by the mid ’90s it would become a house of horsepower. Reflections established its panel-punishing prowess on PlayStation very early; indeed, the original Destruction Derby was released in October 1995. At this stage, it had barely been a month since the original PlayStation had officially launched in the West.</p><p>A highly praised sequel arrived just over a year later, with a raft of technical improvements, and in 1997 Reflections released the competent but unremarkable Monster Trucks (otherwise known as Thunder Truck Rally in North America). However, while the Destruction Derby series would continue, the partnership between Reflections and publisher Psygnosis would not.</p><p>Unshackled from its publisher commitments, Reflections pivoted to something else. That something else was Driver, and it was going to be something special. GT Interactive certainly thought so. By December 1998, it was so impressed the publisher literally bought Reflections entirely.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-sf-1719314533004.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>It's the original Driver San Francisco.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Driver, which first launched in June 1999, was unlike anything that had come before it. These days it seems less common for a game to come along and establish the foundations of what’s essentially a brand new sub-genre, but wind the clock back a couple of decades and it was happening with steady regularity. In the scheme of driving games, Driver was truly one-of-a-kind.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Driver did more than just take the brash, car chase gameplay from the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games and bring it to life in 3D.</p></div><p>Driver did more than just take the brash, car chase gameplay from the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games and bring it to life in 3D – it distilled the mayhem of some of Hollywood’s greatest ever car chase classics and made them <em>playable</em>.</p><p>Smokey and the Bandit, The Blues Brothers, The Cannonball Run, Bullitt – the team took inspiration from countless car chase classics. Martin Edmondson was particularly passionate about them; Walter Hill’s 1978 film The Driver was one of the first movies he ever saw at a cinema.</p><p>The Driver, a minimalist neo-noir action thriller set in the underbelly of LA, was not particularly successful upon its release – but it has amassed an admirable legacy. It didn’t just inspire Driver, that is; Nicolas Winding Refn’s 2011 film Drive respectfully shares several thematic similarities, it was a core inspiration for Edgar Wright’s 2017 film Baby Driver, and it’s been referenced on multiple occasions by Quentin Tarantino.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/the-driver-1719309397030.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"Better get new plates if you plan on taking it out again."</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Driver’s influence on Driver the game goes far beyond the name, too. The infamous garage test at the beginning of Driver’s story mode was directly inspired by a strikingly similar scene in The Driver, where Ryan O’Neal’s unnamed getaway driver meticulously mangles a Mercedes (all while still keeping it drivable) in a calculated display of his precision driving abilities. The twist in Driver is that players are <em>punished</em> for denting the car. Ironically, doing so will trigger the very same car crash sound effect <em>specifically used in this very scene in The Driver</em> (alongside a host of other car chase movies from the ’70s and ’80s, mostly from 20th Century Fox).</p><p>Driver’s garage test is regarded by some as harder than any mission in the game that followed, although I can’t imagine that’s a sentiment that any Driver fan who actually played the game’s finale would share (‘The President’s Run’ is <em>monumentally more difficult</em> than the garage test). <a href="https://x.com/MrLukeReilly/status/1805566497772945505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playing and completing the test for the first time in many, many years</a>, I can’t help but wonder whether its reputation as an uncommonly gruelling challenge is a little overblown. Admittedly, Driver was essentially a religion for me during the last year-or-so of the original PlayStation so I’m not the best gauge – but I’ll note my 15-year-old son needed just four cracks to beat it, playing on original hardware. So I can’t say it stumped him, either.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-garage-1719314484732.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Show us what you can do!</figcaption></figure></output><p>That said, if you did in fact bounce off Driver because of its unfriendly first mission, you missed out on an absolutely amazing and unprecedented driving experience.</p><p>Sliding behind the wheel of a slate of '70s muscle cars as former race driver-turned-undercover cop Tanner, it was your job to lay rubber across four US cities – Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York – all in the name of high-speed justice. Each of these cities are fascinatingly distinct. Sun-drenched Miami features lengthy causeways and addictive bridge leaps, while San Francisco is packed with drastic elevation changes, trams, and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. LA’s missions occur exclusively at night, amplifying the seediness (and again paying homage to The Driver, in which director Hill deliberately shot all the chase sequences for at night). New York is a dense maze of grids and tunnels, framed with high buildings.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/driver-ny-1719563982485.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The maps were incredible, but so too was the handling. Driver’s hulking American pony cars and land yachts weren’t exactly rapid or nimble by typical gaming standards for the time, but they were nonetheless outstandingly satisfying to throw into elbows-out powerslides and over huge jumps (where the era-accurate suspension would often see them bouncing a second time as the soggy springs absorbed their All-American bulk).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>From its flying hubcaps to its fabulous funk soundtrack, Driver’s dedication to bringing the spirit of ’70s and ’80s car chases back to life on PlayStation was dazzling. </p></div><p>From its flying hubcaps to its fabulous funk soundtrack, Driver’s dedication to bringing the spirit of ’70s and ’80s car chases back to life on PlayStation was dazzling. Sentimentally speaking, it’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/luke-reillys-top-30-games-of-all-time">one of my favourite games of all time</a>. Depending on what mood you catch me in, it may be my outright favourite, ever.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/driver-la-1719563740027.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Driver was a game I wished existed, and then suddenly it did.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For clarity, Reflections didn’t <em>quite</em> break through alone. Angel Studios’ Midtown Madness did, after all, speed onto PCs in 1999 also (a few weeks before Driver hit PlayStation). An open world racer set in Chicago, Midtown Madness set the tone for taking traditional racing to the streets. Open worlds would become the studio’s area of expertise, and Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego) would later flex that strength in the likes of Midnight Club, Smuggler’s Run, and Red Dead Redemption.</p><p>Still, that Ubisoft has let the legacy of Driver languish since the release of 2011’s much-loved Driver: San Francisco is downright depressing. A groundbreaking achievement in every way, Driver deserves so much better.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That Ubisoft has let the legacy of Driver languish since the release of 2011’s much-loved Driver: San Francisco is downright depressing.</p></div><p>Today, Driver is a relic. In 1999, however, Driver was truly ahead of its time. A pioneer. Contemporaneous audiences agreed. Or, at least, the ones that could pass the first mission did. It’s one of the top 30 best-selling games on PlayStation, ever. Wedged roughly somewhere between the acclaimed super sequel Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 and monster hit Resident Evil 3, Driver was certainly no sales slouch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-miami-1719314583493.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>It sold faster than a speeding Bullitt.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In other words, it’s more than some curio in the history of open world driving games that some gamers may otherwise believe began with the likes of Grand Theft Auto III.  </p><p>Perhaps you disagree. After all, all Reflections had to do was assemble four, enormous free-roaming city environments (the likes of which had never been built before), craft AI that could respond and effectively pursue players through them (which didn’t exist), compliment it with a class-leading vehicular damage system (that few racing developers of the era seemed capable of matching), and throw in a full replay editor for players to create custom car movies (on a console with 2MB of RAM).</p><p>Easy, right?</p><p>Well, in the words of Driver’s own tricky tutorial: show us what you can do.</p><p><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

From Super Mario All-Stars on Super NES, to the Classic NES Collection on Game Boy Advance, to modern HD remasters like Metroid Prime and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Nintendo has never been shy about capitalizing on its history. As we move into an increasingly digital era, Nintendo has also been noticeably slow to adopt a single, cross-generation digital library akin to PlayStation and Xbox. We've seen lots of speculation over whether Nintendo will finally break this trend as it moves into the era of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch successor</a>--and recent remasters like Luigi's Mansion 2 HD show why it's so necessary that the company follows through with this pro-consumer move.</p><p dir="ltr">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD is a remaster of a 2013 3DS game, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review-weegee-board/1900-6418246/">pretty good one at that</a>. I enjoyed revisiting the 3DS game on a modern system and felt it was paying homage to its history. But it's precisely because this appealed to me as a historical artifact that I couldn't help but think about what it means for my digital collection. Luigi's Mansion 2 is, so far, the middle chapter of a series that has already grown past it. It's nice to have the game unshackled from the 3DS, but that won't matter if its destiny is just to get shackled to the Nintendo Switch instead.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To be blunt, Luigi's Mansion 2 is good but slight. It's an enjoyable little chapter and a neat way to see how the Luigi's Mansion series has developed, but it's lower on the tier list of vital remasters than games that are older, more in need of modernization, or just difficult to find. The mere existence of an HD remaster of Luigi's Mansion 2 shows how Nintendo is filling its release calendar, which is a fine strategy as the Switch lives an especially long time for a console. And it's far from the last. At its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5478/">June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, the company announced a remaster of Donkey Kong Country Returns, a game that was already ported to the 3DS shortly after its initial release on the Wii and is now making the journey to Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not been especially forward-facing in its online tools. It's clear that when the 3DS was released, the company hadn't fully developed its online infrastructure to last into the future. This spate of Wii U and 3DS remasters may be because that account system was not built for the future, Nintendo wants to untether its games from the dual-screen and 3D functionality, or some combination of both.</p><p dir="ltr">But there are hopeful signs that the company is learning. Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said last year that the formation of a single unified "Nintendo Account" will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-says-transition-from-switch-to-next-console-will-be-smoother-than-before/1100-6518543/">smooth the transition</a> into the next console. While previous hardware had each set up their own distinct account systems, which tied your digital purchases to them, the Switch Online service seems to be under the umbrella of your overall Nintendo Account. That means that when we move to the Switch 2--or whatever it may be named--your account will come with it. Nintendo will at least recognize which games you already own digitally. Backwards compatibility with new hardware is its own distinct technical challenge, and Bowser stopped short of confirming it, but the new system recognizing your existing digital library is a necessary first step.</p><p dir="ltr">And that's a step that is more important now than ever before. Nintendo has already been slow to adopt a modern approach to your digital library, which has been frustrating, but its library of stellar games and years of goodwill has carried it through. Falling behind for another entire generation would be much harder to forgive. Not to mention, it would do damage to the company's own reputation and value proposition going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">To understand why, we just need to look at the words of one of Nintendo's console rivals. Xbox head Phil Spencer gave a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-no-world-where-starfield-is-so-good-people-sell-their-ps5-and-move-to-xbox-phil-spencer-says/1100-6513821/">blunt assessment</a> of its own console business, saying that when it lost the race between PS4 and Xbox One, it created a ripple effect going forward. Since that was the generation that most consumers started building their digital library, he said, it was the worst generation for Xbox to lose. Consumers don't want to switch to a different console when they already have their digital library in an existing ecosystem.</p><p dir="ltr">Going even further back, its competitors have done more than Nintendo to offer their earliest games as part of your permanent collection. Hundreds of Xbox 360 games simply work on modern Xbox consoles, disc and all. Original Xbox games can be purchased and remain in your library, for example, and many are included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">as part of Game Pass</a>. To whatever extent this is an ongoing technical hurdle, it's one that others solved years ago while Nintendo continues to struggle.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo isn't going head-to-head with PlayStation and Xbox the way those two are directly challenging each other. For the last several generations, it has marched to the beat of its own drum and remained safely out of the power-console fray. But there's a lesson to be learned about how gamers perceive the value of their purchases regardless. Going forward, players expect their games to come with them. We don't need to buy a third version of Luigi's Mansion 2 on the next Switch, or a fourth version of Donkey Kong Country Returns. If Nintendo wants players to respect its long history of great games, it needs to let us build a digital collection that lasts.</p>

            <p>Saber Interactive has cancelled the public beta test for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 in order to "prepare for the full launch".</p>
<p>Citing that running a beta now "would take the development teams away from preparing for the full launch", the team acknowledged "this is disappointing news for some of you", and offered the limited Bolt Pistol skin as compensation to those who'd signed up to participate.</p>

<p>"Space Marine 2 is almost ready," the team said via an update posted to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4225021101189985804">Steam</a>. "We are now entirely focused on optimisation, polish and fixing remaining issues ahead of launch on 9th September. This means we will not run a public online beta, as it would take the development teams away from preparing for the full launch, and our priority is to ensure the best possible experience at release.</p>
<p>"We know this is disappointing news for some of you. As a thank you to those interested in participating, players who registered via the online signup before 28th June, 2024, midnight Paris Time, will receive the limited Bolt Pistol skin."</p>
<p>The statement closed on thanking players for their "understanding and continued support as [the team] works towards delivering the exceptional game you deserve".</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - which follows the continuing adventures of original series protagonist Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus (this time voiced by Clive Standen) - was originally due to launch in "winter" last year, but Focus announced a delay as part of an "update on execution of the line-up and partnerships" back in November. It's now set to release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 9th September 2024.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-will-include-a-pvp-mode-according-to-this-art-book-leak">a Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 art book has leaked online</a>, confirming the delayed game by Saber Interactive will include a PvP mode.</p>
<p>A YouTuber shared a full flick through the book, giving us a detailed dive into the game's various modes and customisations months ahead of Space Marine 2's scheduled release in September 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last weekend, Metallica graced the virtual stage in <em>Fortnite</em>, but the event was more than just a heavy metal concert. It was one piece in a weeks-long rollout of modes and content, which really drove home just how large and complex the game has become. The battle royale has steadily morphed into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">an entire ecosystem of games and experiences</a>, and the Metallica crossover might’ve been the most complex to date.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176228/metallica-fortnite-concert">The concert was the showcase moment</a>, and it was like going through an interactive version of heavy metal album art. Players were whisked away in a hot rod to a pyro-heavy concert stage before moving on to a gothic bell tower and a fight with a menacing puppet master. Like past virtual concerts featuring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/2/23978521/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem-chapter-5">Eminem</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a>, it was an attempt to mix the feel of going to a live show with something fantastical. “It couldn’t just be all crazy escapism,” says Daryl Atkins, executive creative director at Magnopus, the studio that designed the experience. “So we plotted a journey that started with the real — and then we went to somewhere impossible.”</p><p>According to Atkins, trying to nail the feel of an authentic live show was the starting point. “They’re not a high concept band like Iron Maiden, with big visuals to draw from that we could translate directly,” he explains. “Metallica are super low-key, it’s all about the music and the performance.” For this reason, the band was involved from the early stages of the design process, which included figuring out the set list and contributing motion capture footage for the developers to work with. The studio pitched the initial idea with concept art, but from there, Magnopus was largely left to figure things out. “We were given a lot of trust,” says Atkins.</p><p>The Metallica event was also an attempt to build on past shows with more interactivity pulled from various <em>Fortnite</em> modes. Players raced around in a car before platforming through the tower, literally riding lightning, and picking up a gun for a boss fight. This led to some design challenges. Unlike in a traditional video game, players couldn’t be left behind or else they’d miss being at the show with everyone else. “We have a dynamic respawning system so that it moves the spawn point with the music,” says creative director Dan Taylor. “So if you die, you respawn at the right point in the track. There are players trailing behind who will be pulled forward, and those who are ahead get pulled back. It balances everything out in a way that’s quite organic.”</p><p>The concert was the centerpiece of a busy period for <em>Fortnite</em>. The game introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163374/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked-battle-pass-fallout-magneto">its current <em>Mad Max</em>-inspired season in May</a>, which teased the band’s appearance. But things really kicked off in earnest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176228/metallica-fortnite-concert">in mid-June</a>, when a Metallica guitar was added as a battle royale weapon, a Metallica-themed race track appeared in <em>Rocket Racing</em>, and the band took over for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a> as the lead act in the music mode <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. After the first concert, Epic launched a new mode called Reload, which had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-new-mode-saw-over-a-million-players-this-weekend">more than 1 million players over the weekend</a>.</p><p>It’s a far cry from the simpler days of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music">Marshmello appearing onstage</a>. <em>Fortnite</em> is a more complex beast now, and every element — whether it’s the appearance of a character or a new mode — seems to be carefully planned. Emily Levy, director of strategic partnerships at Epic, says the goal is “to create moments that feel impactful and meaningful.” The latest concert was similar to how Eminem’s appearance was preceded by the throwback <em>Fortnite</em> OG, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23993686/fortnite-og-new-players-lego-fortnite">which lured many lapsed players</a> back. Right now, no moment in <em>Fortnite</em> exists in isolation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="xSiDkE"><strong>Director:</strong> Gil Junger<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt</p>
<p id="6onWCc">There are far more than 10 things to love about this quintessential teen romantic comedy. A soundtrack full of earworms. Breakout roles for Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Cameos from the bands Letters to Cleo and Save Ferris. And all of it in a modern Shakespeare retelling.</p>
<p id="P9vX5f">Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) falls for Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), but her overprotective father won’t let her start dating before her proudly outcast sister, Kat (Stiles), does. Lovelorn Cameron hires secretly sensitive bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to win Kat’s heart, but what happens when everybody in the movie catches feelings? Experience the cream of the crop of ’90s teen movies and watch <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em>. <em>—Susana Polo</em></p>

<p id="r9iyBv"><strong>Directors: </strong>Jim Henson, Frank Oz<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Stephen Garlick, Lisa Maxwell, Billie Whitelaw</p>
<p id="0dJyz6">Jim Henson is known for puppeteering, but to be into film puppeteering at all, you’ve got to be pretty open to out-there filmmaking. It doesn’t get more “out there” than leaping from puppet-driven musical comedies to an original fantasy film where half the cast speaks a constructed language and there are no human characters at all. Yeah, the Skeksis language played so poorly in test screenings that the lines were redubbed in English, but you get the point.</p>
<p id="EBHwuh">The story of Jen the Gelfling’s quest to heal the Dark Crystal and prevent the cruel Skeksis from ruling the world forever was a product of Henson’s post-Muppet ambitions of proving that film puppetry could be a true medium, not merely a novelty. Is <em>The Dark Crystal</em> good? That’s a complicated answer. Is it the product of an incredibly skilled production, led by a once-in-a-generation creative talent, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079265/dark-crystal-labyrinth-bundle-rerelease-jim-henson-cgi">that could not be made today</a>?

<p id="2JetTY"><strong>Director:</strong> Ridley Scott<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright</p>
<p id="TJnMhh"><em>Alien</em>’s greatness probably doesn’t need to be restated. But even if you know how good it is, or think you’ve seen it plenty of times, you probably owe this Ridley Scott masterpiece a rewatch. It’s the kind of movie that miraculously builds on its own legacy with each subsequent viewing, and only grows in impressiveness with each passing year. </p>
<p id="soSpnw">So rewatch <em>Alien </em>again. Compare every element of the movie against something sci-fi films (or any genre, for that matter) have done since, and marvel at how far ahead <em>Alien </em>comes out. In the nearly 45 years since that movie was released, no film has come close to matching how well it communicated the idea of being trapped in space with something more horrible than you knew could exist. No cast has ever had such perfect grizzled-trucker energy or crackly faces. It’s easy to look at movies from the 1970s and say they don’t make ’em today like they used to, and it’s true. But it’s also true that no one before or since has ever made ’em like <em>Alien</em>, and we should all probably appreciate that a little more often than we do. <em>—Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="qAHJLa"><strong>Director:</strong> Ron Howard<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Warwick Davis</p>
<p id="zaetMm">It may seem impossible now, but there was a time when Star Wars was new, and Hollywood was dying to do more stuff like it. Enter George Lucas and his buddy Ron Howard, who said: Let’s do <em>Star Wars </em>for medieval fantasy.</p>
<p id="xxulqW">The result, <em>Willow</em>, is a loosely structured fantasy adventure comedy with cutting-edge special effects that’s fun for the whole family (give or take a couple of black magic scenes that absolutely seared into the brains of young viewers). <em>Star Wars</em>’ Warwick Davis plays the titular hero — a hapless but hopeful basically-a-Hobbit — on a quest to save a baby from an witch, with the help of himbo swordsman Madmartigan, in maybe Val Kilmer’s most delightful role.</p>
<p id="igOg80"><em>Willow</em> is, frankly, phenomenally silly, but also phenomenally fun. There’s a magic wand and a fairy queen and a sorceress who’s been turned into a kind of Australian possum. Give it a watch. <em>—SP </em></p>

<p id="vitrB0"><strong>Director:</strong> Martin Scorsese<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Tadanobu Asano</p>
<p id="xhrOJe">Of all Martin Scorsese’s many terrific films, it’s hard not to feel that his 2016 adaptation of Shūsaku Endō’s novel <em>Silence </em>is one of his most personal and important. The film follows two Jesuit priests, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver), on a mission to find another priest who is said to have renounced his faith in 17th-century Japan. At the time, Christians in the country were largely forced into hiding at the risk of torture and death, making the priests’ journey particularly difficult. </p>
<p id="yQCQMk">While the movie serves as a fascinating look at this period in Japan, it’s even more affecting as a crisis-of-faith movie for Rodrigues. Garfield’s performance is absolutely haunting, as we see Rodrigues slowly lose not just his faith in God, but in everything he’s ever stood for or known himself to be. Garfield communicates all of this pain mostly without dialogue, with a constant war of expressions on his face and in his eyes between his faith and his despair. All of this makes <em>Silence </em>feel like Scorsese’s greatest statement on faith yet — particularly impressive when you consider that he made it in his sixth decade as a filmmaker. <em>—AG</em></p>

<p id="gbYiuC"><strong>Director:</strong> Michael Lehmann<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, Shannen Doherty</p>
<p id="XrLyBN">Michael Lehmann’s classic 1989 dark comedy about solving toxic high school dynamics via murder looks even more arch, mannered, and over the top now than it did back in its day, but it’s still a ridiculously fun movie, full of memorable one-liners, cinematography that pops off the screen, and familiar faces in their very young days. Christian Slater’s career-long Jack Nicholson impression has never been more pronounced than it is here. And after so many years of <em>Stranger Things</em>, it’s fascinating to revisit Winona Ryder from the era where her signature move was blasé teen angst instead of agonized mom angst. The dialogue has aged a bit, but the central conceits — that high school kinda sucked for most of us, and that people tend to be huge hypocrites about how they remember the dead — still land solidly, and with a lot of laughs. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="5qhAVl">If you don’t care about this movie, I don’t care about you. It might be a niche take, but I love an animal movie that doesn’t make the animals talk with weird humanoid lips. <em>Spirit</em> is the story of a wild horse who’s taken into captivity by American settlers in the pre-1900s western U.S., and it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/21540788/horse-girl-canon-movies-books-tv-shows-games">responsible for about one-third of my personality</a>. </p>
<p id="HhC5L1">Voiced by Matt Damon, Spirit is endlessly compassionate and filled with spunk. His journey to try to escape captivity and return to his horse wife is fraught with physical abuse that mirrors the way the settlers abuse the land out west, but Spirit never loses his drive. The film paints the settlers as evil and oppressive, and represents the Lakota man who takes him in as safe and respectful of his wildness — aka, it’s accurate.</p>
<p id="xhS7xk">This movie came out when I was 7 years old, and I remember sitting in the theater, quietly weeping for perhaps the first time in my life. I wasn’t having a meltdown or a temper tantrum. I was going through the very real range of emotions the movie evokes — fear when Spirit gets caught for the first time, rage when he’s branded, excitement when he learns to love riding, deep joy when he’s reunited with his horse baby mama, some blend of grief and anger at the realization that this situation happened to a <em>lot</em> of real-life horses.</p>

<p id="lYrsr2"><strong>Director: </strong>Michael Bay<br><strong>Cast: </strong>John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, Max Martini</p>
<p id="ptxt4l">Michael Bay’s Benghazi movie never really got a fair shake. Around its release, Republican politicians were still using the 2012 Benghazi attacks as a weapon against presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time of the attacks. Because of that, the movie got written off by many due to claims that it was nothing more than Republican propaganda. However, nearly a decade removed from that context, it’s much easier to fit the excellent <em>13 Hours</em> into the larger arc of themes Bay has spent his entire career chasing: Institutions of power care more about rules and norms than they do about human lives, and to save lives, it’s up to individuals to break those rules. </p>
<p id="mobI8k">Beyond the morals of the movie, however, <em>13 Hours</em> is just absolutely terrific, thrilling filmmaking. Bay basically turns the movie into his own personal version of the John Carpenter classic <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em>. What that means in practice is that Bay gives us about 40 minutes of discussion about the politics of Benghazi, the questionable U.S. presence in Libya as a destabilizing force for its government, and the indefensibility of the U.S. bases there. The other 100-ish minutes of the movie’s run time are then dedicated to some of the most expertly filmed firefights ever put on film, where tension comes through in waves and characterization is built beautifully in the brief quiet moments between gunshots. <em>—AG</em></p>

<p id="w3tute"><strong>Director:</strong> Spike Lee<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Danny Aiello, Spike Lee, Giancarlo Esposito</p>
<p id="Rmb9Rr">If you’re American, this movie is required viewing. <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, a Spike Lee joint, makes you feel everything it replicates on screen — the heat collecting on the concrete of a Brooklyn street, the tension between a Black man and his neighborhood racists, the joy of a summer block party with excellent music, the perpetual grief of police violence against Black Americans. </p>
<p id="oLsWSd">It’s no easy watch. The story centers on racial tensions between white police, Italian neighbors, and Black neighbors in 1980s Brooklyn, but the tone isn’t overly serious. Instead, Lee uses moments of humor and joy to underscore the multiple tragedies of the film, and the ending doesn’t tie things up nicely — in fact, it leaves you (or me, a white person) with a pit in your stomach that won’t go away until you start protesting in the streets. And that’s a good thing. After all, the film is (desperately, pleadingly) telling you to do the right thing.</p>
<p id="Br00zv">But there’s a boatload of merit to this film as a film, in addition to its merit as a required text to understanding race relations in the U.S. Like every other Spike Lee movie, the cinematography is unmatched, with his signature high-contrast colors and wacky, wide-lens, canted-angle shots to really capture the vibe of the late ’80s. The acting from Lee himself, Giancarlo Esposito, and Rosie Perez stands out, and the music is legendary —particularly Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power,” which they wrote for the film. <em>—ZH</em></p>

<p id="AtgaCi"><strong>Director:</strong> Ishirō Honda<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Akira Takarada, Momoko Kōchi, Akihiko Hirata</p>
<p id="fsECAg">If you haven’t seen the original 1954 <em>Godzilla</em>, it can be a real surprise how philosophical and principled it is, and how little of it is devoted to a giant rubber-suit monster stomping on Tokyo. (Though there certainly is some of that!) Like so many franchise starters, the first <em>Godzilla</em> is much more complicated and nuanced than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23906907/godzilla-apple-tv-show-monarch-monsters-review">most of the followers</a> that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22356658/godzilla-vs-kong-review">focused in on the kaiju fantasy action</a>. It’s well worth watching Ishirō Honda’s classic about war, weapons, humanity, and the price of technological progress, just to see where this story started, realize how it’s mutated, and appreciate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107076/godzilla-american-vs-japanese-movies-interpretations-monsterverse">how different Japan’s version of Godzilla has always been from America’s version</a>. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="xAahw9">Zombies. Trains. South Korean political commentary. What else do you need from a horror-action-thriller?</p>
<p id="V6E2Q9">Unlike <em>Snowpiercer</em>, the <em>other</em> scary train movie out of South Korea, <em>Train to Busan</em> is a really fun watch. That isn’t to say it won’t hit you in the heart, though — the tale follows a frankly shitty father as he attempts to be less of a shitty father by bringing his daughter to see her mother in Busan on her birthday. Unfortunately for them both, a zombie attacks the train and thus begins a zombie apocalypse that plays out within the train cars.</p>
<p id="m3SsdP">It’s a master class in locked-room storytelling, with plenty of the funny and shocking elements that have become endemic to Korean film. Ultimately, you’ll watch the main character grow out of his tendency to disappoint his family. More importantly, you’ll watch him fight a bunch of well-CGI’d zombies. It’s a great first foray into Korean film if you’re new to it, and a classic deserving of endless rewatches if you’ve already seen it. <em>—ZH</em></p>

<p id="yNVByw"><strong>Director:</strong> Greta Gerwig<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts</p>
<p id="Cgyhwb">In the wake of Greta Gerwig’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801761/barbenheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-double-feature-theme-connections">box-office buster</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23799502/barbie-movie-review-margot-robbie-ryan-gosling"><em>Barbie</em></a>, it’s an excellent time to revisit her earlier, more delicately planed, but just as emotionally engaged work — particularly <em>Lady Bird</em>, her coming-of-age movie starring Saoirse Ronan as a teenager trying to find her own identity amid her relationship with her mother. Reading a point-by-point plot summary makes <em>Lady Bird</em> sound mundane and scattershot, but the wistful, sometimes dryly hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking way Ronan plays the title character holds it all together. This one’s a slice of life that feels like real life — and like an arch, straight-faced comedy at the same time. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="eWU7Vo">I will <em>never</em> forget the first time I watched <em>Total Recall</em> as a child. The sight of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s pained expression as he wrenched an oversized tracking device out of his nose canal fascinated me almost as much as the sight of his eyes popping out of his face on Mars haunted my sleepless childhood nights. Its macabre practical special effects aside, <em>Total Recall</em> remains an irrefutable banger of a sci-fi action flick that still holds up more than three decades since it was first released. </p>
<p id="g8LIal">The reality-blurring romp about a salt-of-the-earth construction worker who <em>may</em> or may <em>not</em> be a Martian secret agent is packed to the brim with explosive action sequences, bizarre satirical world-building, and fantastic performances. If you haven’t seen <em>Total Recall</em> yet, don’t worry — you have. You just don’t remember it; you’re actually a Martian secret agent whose mind was erased because you got too close to the truth. This is all a simulation. I’m communicating to you from the real world. I’m just kidding... or am I?<em> —Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="8SnVOC">My father likes Westerns. A lot. To this day, I’ll often come down the stairs to find him watching some nondescript (to me), old-looking film with two dudes talking like they have something in their mouths and swinging pistols around their fingers. While he succeeded in getting me into horror before the age of 10, I can’t say the same for Westerns — until we found ourselves watching the original 1969 <em>True Grit</em> one evening. </p>
<p id="TJiULI">The story stars a girl — something I’d never seen in any of the John Wayne movies my dad liked — and she was competent, brave, and on a mission to avenge her father’s death. What better movie to watch with your dad?</p>
<p id="WEz23o">Well, the better movie to watch with my dad came out a few years later, when 2010’s <em>True Grit</em> was released. We watched it together as soon as we could, in theaters, and decided it deserved rave reviews. My opinion stands, having rewatched it several times over the last 15 years. The story is the same as the original, but this version has Jeff Bridges instead of John Wayne and a 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld instead of a 21-year-old Kim Darby. Between the more realistic age of the leading actor (the character of Mattie is 14) and the improved cinematography of the remake, the 2010 version of <em>True Grit</em> became one of my favorite movies, and a formative one at that. While the 1969 version is funnier and grittier, the drama of the newer remake is compelling and connected with me, a ’90s baby, in a way the 1969 version connected with my father, a ’60s baby. Both are well worth a watch, and both are free on YouTube. <em>—ZH</em></p>

            <p>Meta is no longer providing bug fixes or security updates the Meta Quest 1 headset.</p>
<p>In a message to Meta Quest 1 players entitled "changes to Quest 1 experience" seen by Eurogamer, the company confirmed that after its decision in January 2023 to stop releasing new features and new Meta Quest apps for Quest 1 on the Quest Store, it was now withdrawing hardware support, too.</p>
<p>It also advised that "if any security vulnerabilities are discovered in the future, private data that is directly stored on the device or accessible from it would be at risk of compromise".</p>

<p>"We'd like to let you know that starting 31st August 2024, we will no longer provide bug fixes or security updates for Meta Quest 1 headsets," the statement, which was sent out today, confirms.</p>
<p>"You will still be able to download new apps and continue using your existing apps as long as they are supported by the developer. However, if any security vulnerabilities are discovered in the future, private data that is directly stored on the device or accessible from it would be at risk of compromise.</p>
<p>"This update follows our announcement in January 2023, when we stopped releasing new features and new Meta Quest apps for Quest 1 on the Quest Store.</p>
<p>"We're excited about the future of Meta Quest and looking forward to providing you with more groundbreaking MR experiences."</p>
<p>The statement closed on inviting players to contact Meta Store Support if they have any further "general enquiries".</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beat-saber-support-on-meta-quest-1-vr-headsets-ending-this-year">last month Beat Saber also revealed it would no longer be supported on Meta Quest 1 VR headsets</a>.</p>
<p>According to an FAQ on the game's website, the developer is aiming to "raise the bar of what's possible", meaning it will focus on more recent and powerful devices instead.</p>
<p>Beat Saber will remain playable on Meta Quest 1 devices, but from 2nd November support will end. This means no multiplayer or leaderboard functionality, and no further updates, although the game will remain accessible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has announced the release of the Tower Raid Open Beta for Dying Light 2 with game update 1.17. The Tower Raid introduces a brand new co-op experience to the first-person action/adventure zombie game, inspired by the VNC Tower mission from the campaign.</p>
<p>The objective is simple: reach the top and grab the special loot waiting for you. Each time, you’ll have to traverse different floor combinations with different obstacles and goals. To additionally<br>
spice things up, there are different modifiers for each run. They will affect (positively or negatively) the player, the enemies, or even both.</p>
<p>The Tower Raid can be started via Jai's Board, which can be unlocked through the side quest “Lost Armory” (available automatically once you reach the Central Loop). When the Tower Raid is started, you (and your friends if you’re playing in co-op, which is highly recommended by Techland) are spawned inside the lobby of the Tower. This Dying Light 2 adventure will take you from the ground floor all the way to the roof, provided that you can defeat all foes. It's up to you how you deal with various encounters and if you search each floor for loot.</p>
<p>For the activity's completion, you will be rewarded with Jai's Reputation Points and Tokens, which can be used to buy new stuff from him (including the Tower Raid chest). Moreover, on top of the Tower, you'll find an Airdrop that contains a large amount of loot and an Exotic Weapon. Additionally, when you complete the Tower Raid for the first time each week, you’ll get bonus<br>
Reputation Points and Tokens.</p>
<p>The Tower Raid Open Beta will last until July 18. Next week, Techland will introduce a new Elite mode difficulty, which enables harder enemies and activates tactical stamina but provides better rewards. The update will also add three new floors, ten new modifiers, and four new rewards. On the third and last week, the developers will add another seven modifiers, three new rewards, and double Jai's Reputation Points gains when completing the mode.</p>

			<p>A new&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid Delta vs Metal Gear Solid 3 comparison video has been released, showing the massive upgrades players can expect from the remake.</p>
<p>Konami debuted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-new-trailer-provides-an-impressive-new-look-at-the-boss-more-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new trailer for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> during Microsoft's Xbox showcase earlier this month. This trailer showed some impressive visuals, and as discovered by Eurogamer's Digital Foundry, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-native-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown running at native 4K resolution</a>. Digital Foundry's analysis also included some comparison footage, highlighting how the remake will retain the Metal Gear Solid 3's original scene composition.</p>
<p>YouTube channel '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDebits</a>' has now released a comparison video of its own, in which the visuals of the original 2004 title are compared to the visuals of Delta as shown in the Xbox showcase trailer. This comparison video shows massive enhancements to the game's character models, animations, environments, gunplay, and the new camera system. We've included the new Metal Gear Solid Delta vs MGS3 comparison video below. Check it out and tell us what you think. Are you excited about the upcoming remake?</p>

<p>Officially announced during Sony's 2023 PlayStation showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta was first thought to be released sometime this year. Recent rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-slip-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have suggested that the game might slip to 2025</a>. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>We've included some additional details about the highly-anticipated remake below:</p>
<div>
<p><strong><em>Everything you love, and more</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music that made the original a sensation return, remade for modern consoles. This evolutionary leap breathes new life into every cutscene, and rebuilds every corner of the world.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Gorgeously rendered graphics</em></strong></p>
<p><em>With Unreal Engine 5, expansive stages are rendered with cutting-edge technology. Incredible new graphics bring the wild growth of the jungles, forests, and swamps to life in exquisite detail. Characters are rendered in such fine detail that facial wrinkles, pores, and even separate eye and iris movements are visible, allowing for rich and emotive facial animations.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-streaming-seems-to-be-available-directly-on-xbox-game-pass-for-certain-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>On February 21, 2023, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-to-bring-all-its-xbox-pc-games-to-geforce-now-including-activision-blizzards-if-the-deal-passes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with NVIDIA to bring its PC games to the GeForce NOW cloud platform. The move was ostensibly directed at regulators, who were in the middle of the regulatory process for Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but it was also very beneficial for consumers.</p>
<p>A few months later, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-is-coming-to-geforce-now-albeit-with-select-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took the obvious next step</a>, slowly starting to allow PC Game Pass subscribers to play games through GeForce NOW for select games. The list greatly expanded over time.</p>
<p>However, the integration between the two services might be about to get even tighter, even on the console side. Several users have <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-appears-as-a-option-on-the-store-for-xbox-cloud-streaming.914415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> seeing an option to stream games like Street Fighter 6, Resident Evil Village, and Call of Duty Warzone with GeForce NOW from their Xbox consoles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GRIonhZakAArLmQ-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This is surprising, to say the least. GeForce NOW is, after all, a competitor of sorts for Game Pass Ultimate, which includes the streaming feature based on XCloud. However, GeForce NOW is verifiably superior, offering peerless streaming quality with support for 4K resolution, HDR displays, up to 240 frames per second, integrated Reflex and <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-granblue-fantasy-relink-day-passes-and-cloud-g-sync-nvidia-reflex-support-for-60-120-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-SYNC</a> technologies, and support for ray tracing/DLSS, depending on the tier used. XCloud, on the other hand, is still limited to 1080p (Full HD) resolution and 60 frames per second. The difference is largely due to the server hardware used in the respective configurations. Whereas XCloud servers <a href="https://wccftech.com/xcloud-servers-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are based on Xbox Series X specs</a>, GeForce NOW's Ultimate tier <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-ada-powers-geforce-now-servers-5x-faster-than-xbox-series-x-with-rt-dlss3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runs on RTX 4080-class hardware</a>, which is estimated to be five times as fast.</p>
<p>Is this a sign of Microsoft yielding to NVIDIA's superior service and stopping investments in its own streaming technology? It's too early to say at this point. We've reached out to NVIDIA and only got a 'nothing to share at this time' response, which suggests an announcement might be on the way. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

			<p>Four years ago I reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/04/morbid-the-seven-acolytes-review/">Morbid: The Seven Acolytes</a>, a really enjoyable and challenging top-down Souls-like that contained some fantastic eldritch creature designs and an interesting range of combat approaches. Fast forward to today and I’ve now finished playing the Lords of Ire, a somewhat surprising sequel that shifts the perspective to a more traditional third person&nbsp;one. Given my positive experience with the first game I expected this one to have plenty of ideas of its own to warrant looking past the uncanny similarities with FromSoft’s output but was this the case?</p>
<p><iframe title="Morbid: The Lords of Ire Demo - Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ls32sPlxIVM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While changing the aesthetic so drastically could be a risky strategy the core designs are relatively faithful to the Lovecraftian nightmares of the original game. Given the smaller budget and resources of the developers the game holds up pretty well graphically too. The returning heroine, The Striver, makes for an imposing presence whilst NPCs are grotesque and memorable. A regular pattern of finding these in levels before they return to your hub makes for nice gradual progression with the first managing to make it back despite having had their legs and face chewed off by evil creatures. Sound design is solid too with attacks having a decent weight to them and atmospheric effects really setting the scene. Voice acting and music are good too.</p>


<p>The storyline and lore here is pitched somewhere between a continuation and a reboot of the original game. Once again you are a mysterious solitary warrior who must go forth and slay a series of monstrous acolytes to free the land from their tyranny. Rather than a fully continuous world the action takes place in a series of self contained zones that are accessed via the hub once unlocked. This feels very FromSoft and is a proven approach. Areas benefit from some well designed shortcuts and there are many threats and traps littered around the environment that will prove lethal to the unsuspecting adventurer. Each area has a very distinct design – in fact sometimes too distinct as there is a certain lack of tonal consistency here. Alongside the stereotypical snowy and fiery areas later environments take huge inspiration from the giants of the genre with a Gothic townscape that is straight out of Yharnam.</p>


<p>Combat takes a little getting used to as despite following many of the standard approaches of the genre there are some idiosyncrasies of its own. Standard light and heavy attacks abound with defending and counter attacking being a viable approach too. As you progress through the game, however, it becomes clear that much of the combat is heavily biased towards the riposte mechanic. This technique is activated through holding the block button and tapping light attack just as the enemy is about to strike you. Whilst many enemies can be defeated without this it becomes essential later on, especially against bosses whose HP pools are too large to whittle down. The positive to this approach is that it does reward learning enemy attacks and working out the correct timing but it does make mobs a test of memory rather than anything else.</p>
<p>At its best, Morbid: Lords of Ire sets waves of different enemies your way and working out the safest and most efficient way to dispatch them feels great. However, towards the end of the game there did seem to be long sections with the same basic enemy repeated ad infinitum and the pattern of riposting became monotonous. This is a shame as that section is capped off with some memorable environments and a really challenging final boss. These kinds of niggles perhaps show the difference between the solid Souls-like and the games that they are influenced by.</p>

<p>To combat the hordes of vile beasts you find a pretty extensive range of weapons of different types from close quarter brass knuckles to ludicrous two handed war hammers. Weapons vary in damage and impact, the latter of which affects enemy posture bars. The pattern of ripostes does make any build viable in theory but weapon upgrades are limited by the amount of runestones available throughout the level so once you invest in one weapon it becomes difficult to switch to another. I also found the issues with heavy weapons from the first game continued here as they were too slow and stamina intensive to be effective.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Morbid: Lords of Ire is not a game that’ll usurp the FromSoft throne in any way but it is a very solid and enjoyable second tier Soulslike that stands alongside titles like Thymesia and is well worth the relatively cheap entry price for genre fans. It takes clear influence from Sekiro in its parry based combat but is relatively accessible for players who might bounce off that game’s difficulty level.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-banned-from-twitch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Nick ‘Nickmercs’ Kolcheff has been banned from Twitch for the first time following the use of a ‘derogatory slur’ on the platform. The ban came suddenly and just days after the recent controversy surrounding Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm, who admitted to messaging a minor on the platform back in 2017, an event that led to his permanent Twitch ban in 2020.</p>



<p>Kolcheff was caught using a transphobic slur on stream, uttering the word ‘tranny’, which was quickly followed up with a decisive but temporary ban. He fired back on social media stressing that ‘next time (he’ll) use mental health disorder.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-under-fire-again">Under Fire Again</h2>



<p>It’s an entire year since Nickmercs was last in hot water for transphobic comments. Last June, he commented in response to transgender rights protesters, stating that ‘They should leave little children alone.’ It was a situation that unravelled and led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-call-of-duty/">his custom skin being stripped from Call of Duty</a> – but unlike the recent Dr Disrespect situation, many stood in solidarity with Nickmercs. When he returned to streaming after the event, he landed a record-high number of paid subscriptions on Twitch.</p>



<p>Recently, Kolcheff appeared on stream saying ‘there’s no such thing as trans people’, before ultimately uttering the slur that landed him his first-ever Twitch ban. </p>



<p>In the wake of Dr Disrespect’s recent scandal, during which he admitted inappropriately messaging a minor on the platform in 2017, Nickmercs spoke strongly against it, stressing that he can no longer support the veteran streamer. </p>



<p>It’s unclear how long Nickmercs’ Twitch ban will last.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-layoffs-hit-ubisoft-as-company-tries-to-deliver-roadmap.915045/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been announced that Ubisoft Toronto has been hit by a fresh wave of layoffs that have seen 33 employees lose their jobs. This comes as a result of Ubisoft trying to commit to delivering ‘on its ambitious roadmap’, a statement said. It’s the same reasoning we’ve heard time and again over the last eighteen months, as almost 20,000 industry workers have been made redundant worldwide. It almost always comes down to a restructuring or a re-alignment with a roadmap – and more often than not, it’s an ‘ambitious’ roadmap.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-repetition">Repetition</h2>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/">we posted an exposé</a> on the state of play at Ubisoft, talking about the internal tensions felt by teams everywhere. In November 2023, more than 100 employees were cut from the business, and before that, around 60 employees were impacted by layoffs across a series of offices in the United Kingdom and North America. In February, Ubisoft workers in France started striking to drive negotiations for better salaries.</p>



<p>This latest wave has struck Ubisoft Toronto, the studio recently brought on to work on the Sands of Time remake. In a statement <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/less-than-a-month-after-joining-work-on-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-toronto-lays-off-33-employees-to-ensure-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by PC Gamer</a>, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft Toronto has decided to conduct a targeted realignment to ensure it can deliver on its ambitious roadmap. Unfortunately, this will impact the roles of 33 team members who will be leaving Ubisoft. We are committed to providing comprehensive support to them, including severance and career assistance, to help through this transition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been a wildly unfortunate year and a bit for the gaming industry, with studios closing their doors after decades of business, projects being canned after years of work, and thousands of employees being turfed out without much warning. Ubisoft Toronto is the latest in a long line of studios to be hit by this trend.</p>

<p>Recently leaked images have suggested that Xbox consoles could be getting a direct integration with Nvidia GeForce Now in the near future. On social media, a series of shots surfaced showing the option to play certain games through GeForce Now, which is Nvidia’s cloud-based streaming service. Historically, Microsoft and Nvidia have partnered on this proposition, but this would be the first time that a native application has worked itself onto the Xbox platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-games">More Games</h2>



<p>On Twitter, known tipster ‘eXtas1s’ posted a series of images that showed players having the option to boot games through GeForce Now, alongside the usual offerings such as Game Pass or outright purchasing:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="es" dir="ltr"><p>👀🔥 OJOOO 🚨</p><p>¿Nvidia GeForce Now integrado en Xbox?</p><p>Parece que un acuerdo más grande se esconde entre Xbox y Nvidia, y su anuncio puede ser inminente.</p><p>Varios juegos desde la tienda Xbox da la opción de "jugarlo con GeForce Now". Profundizaremos en un vídeo hoy. <a href="https://t.co/blBFMVGXpm">pic.twitter.com/blBFMVGXpm</a></p></div>— eXtas1s 🎮 Noticias &amp; Rumores (@eXtas1stv) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/1806686104852025581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Translated, the post reads:</p>



<p><em>‘<strong>Nvidia GeForce Now integrated into Xbox?</strong> It seems that a bigger deal is lurking between Xbox and Nvidia, and its announcement may be imminent. Several games from the Xbox store give the option to “play it with GeForce Now.”‘</em></p>



<p>It was a while ago that Microsoft partnered with Nvidia to bring Game Pass titles and games from the Microsoft Store to GeForce Now. The platform from Nvidia allows users to stream games to almost any device if they own them through the Microsoft Store or Game Pass. However, this latest development could mean that games listed on Nvidia GeForce Now will be available to stream on Xbox consoles using a native application. </p>



<p>It’s no big secret that these tech titans are investing in the future of cloud gaming. Recently, we touched upon a discussion concerning blueprint images of Microsoft’s all-cloud-based console that was canned years ago – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-keystone-images-revealed/">Project Keystone</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-beat-em-ups-how-snk-aims-to-become-a-top-10-game-publisher<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Back in the day, SNK was one of gaming’s biggest names. King of Fighters and Fatal Fury were hugely popular beat-’em-ups in the 1980s and ’90s, while Metal Slug helped define the side-scrolling action game genre, and the company’s high-spec console, handheld and arcade hardware were the envy of many. </p><p>After two tumultuous decades in the 2000s, SNK received investment from Saudi Arabia’s Electronic Gaming Development Company in 2020 and was fully acquired in 2022. The investment has come under scrutiny due to Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, which includes allegations of unfair treatment of women and the LGBTQ community. In the aftermath of the acquisition, an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SNK lead insisted that the studio's new ownership "doesn't affect us in any way."</a></p><p>Shortly after the opening of a new development studio in Singapore in April, IGN spoke with SNK President and CEO Kenji Matsubara about the company’s vision, which includes becoming a Top 10 global publisher.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/snk-ceo-1719596433009.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SNK President and CEO Kenji Matsubara. Photo credit: Daniel Robson/IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Matsubara’s goal is ambitious, but the company does of course face extremely stiff competition. Depending on the definition, the world’s largest game publisher is currently Sony Interactive Entertainment, with the Top 10 also including Microsoft, Nintendo and Electronic Arts. The group also includes relative newcomers from China such as Tencent, NetEase and miHoYo.</p><p>“Setting such a lofty goal has helped me to identify the challenges that stand in our way,” he says. “What SNK currently lacks the most is development capabilities, so strengthening development capabilities will be essential. Beyond that, we can also consider acquiring other studios with strong IP, to add to our portfolio.”</p><p>SNK’s next announced game is <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a>, the first new entry in the Fatal Fury series in 26 years. After nearly three decades away, the new game is attracting a positive response from fans of fighting games – but Matsubara acknowledges this alone will not be enough.</p><p>“It will be necessary for us to develop titles in various genres and release multiple titles every year,” he says. “We are also working on genres other than fighting games. We are planning not only action games that utilize SNK’s legacy IP, but also action games that are brand new, and we hope to start releasing these over the next few years.”</p><p>Matsubara joined SNK in July 2021. In the three years since, he has made significant changes, strengthening the company’s development, sales and publishing divisions. Headquartered in Osaka, the company also opened new development studios in Tokyo and, most recently, Singapore, with another studio already open in Beijing. Last year, its Osaka HQ changed location as well, leaving its longtime home for a larger, more centrally located office close to Shin-Osaka bullet train station. In terms of marketing and sales, Matsubara has increased the company’s focus from Asia to include more proactive efforts in the West.</p><p>As a geographically central location in Southeast Asia with a high level of English proficiency, stable economy and growing pool of tech talent, Singapore is becoming one of Southeast Asia’s most prominent locations for game development. In recent years, companies such as Ubisoft, Electronic arts and Bandai Namco have opened offices there, while locally developed indie games such as Cuisineer and Let’s Build a Zoo are taking Singapore’s soft-power culture to the world. Gaming peripheral makers such as Razer and Secretlab, too, have built a strong reputation for the country, while gamescom spinoff event gamescom asia has been held there for several years. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>SNK Singapore Office Photo Gallery</h3></div></output><p>As we spoke with Matsubara shortly after the opening of SNK’s new Singapore studio, we asked the reasons behind this choice of location.</p><p>“When I joined SNK, we only had studios in Osaka and Beijing,” he says. “We soon set up a Tokyo studio, but we felt we needed to increase the number of studios and work on strengthening our development capabilities. When we look to Asia, Singapore is the most attractive place. Engineers there are knowledgeable about generative AI and machine learning, which have been attracting attention in recent years, and they are interested in joining the videogame industry. So Singapore felt ideally suited for game development.”</p><p>Each of these studios undertake different tasks while also collaborating on certain projects. While the Singapore studio finds its feet, it has been twinned with the Tokyo studio, while also taking advantage of local knowhow to contribute development research to the group as a whole.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/snk-singapore-office-head-1719596394266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SNK Singapore studio head Tang Hong Sing at the studio’s opening ceremony in April</figcaption></figure></output><p>“For now, the Singapore studio and the Tokyo studio work together closely, holding regular meetings and collaborating on title development. In the future, I would like the Singapore studio to become a standalone studio, and to develop AAA titles as a hub studio for Southeast Asia.”</p><p>Matsubara also explained that the Singapore studio has a strong R&amp;D focus, particularly in the fields of generative AI and machine learning, which will feed back into the rest of the SNK group.</p><p>SNK also has sales bases in China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. But even with all of these new development and sales offices, the company’s plans for expansion continue to unfold. As SNK works towards its goals, it plans to eventually either open outposts in North America and Europe, or to build partnerships in those regions with other companies.</p><p>While SNK has a very long way to go to realize its aspirations of cracking the global Top 10 publishers, it is clearly no longer just a Japanese company. By embracing a multicultural approach and dabbling in new genres, there’s a good chance it will release some cool games. That in itself will be an important first step in once again making SNK a household name.</p><p><em>Daniel Robson is Chief Editor at IGN Japan and is </em><a href="https://twitter.com/nomoredaniels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>on Twitter here</em></u></a><em>.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the Indian sci-fi epic <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em>, his stature becomes literal: In his role as the 7-foot-tall immortal warrior Ashwatthama, the 81-year-old towers over his younger co-stars, all of whom are draws in their own right. (A handy way for the uninitiated to measure the relative fame of an Indian actor is to note the length of their introduction in a movie — the bigger the name, the more elaborate the entrance.) The sheer amount of star power in this film is overwhelming, but that isn’t even the most ambitious thing about it. </p>
<p id="XEjX1f">Writer-director Nag Ashwin means for <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em> to be nothing less than the ultimate sci-fi epic. Its scope is huge, covering 6,000 years of mythological history. Its run time is long, telling the first part of a two-part story over three jam-packed hours. (To be fair, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22733349/dune-review-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet">Denis Villeneuve</a>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two"><em>Dune </em>movies</a> aren’t much shorter.) And its production was expensive — reportedly <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/kalki-2898-ad-exploring-nag-ashwin-prabhas-amitabh-bachchan-deepika-padukone-movie-1235942384/">around $72 million</a>, one of the biggest budgets ever for an Indian movie. The filmmakers hope it will be a crossover event akin to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23478046/rrr-ss-rajamouli-movies-top-gun-avengers-future">S.S. Rajamouli</a>’s record-breaking hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22996870/rrr-review-rise-roar-revolt"><em>RRR</em></a>, not only within India’s disparate film industries (Bachchan is known as a Bollywood actor, while co-stars Prabhas and Kamal Haasan work in Telugu and Tamil films, respectively) but internationally as well. </p>
<p id="s4PQUd">The film’s look, rendered almost entirely through CGI, will certainly feel familiar to Western audiences, with elements that recall the beloved sci-fi franchises Blade Runner<em>, </em>Star Wars<em>, </em>The Matrix<em>, </em>Dune<em>, </em>and especially <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a><em>. </em>The story is more specifically Indian, taking the Hindu myth of Kalki — the 10th and final incarnation of the god Vishnu, who will come to lead humanity into a new era of peace and justice — and transporting it to a dystopian sci-fi setting. But while references to magical weapons and folkloric heroes may go over the heads of all but the best-informed foreign viewers, the story’s arc follows the familiar beats of a Chosen One narrative. </p>

<p id="879ump">This first chapter of the <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em> saga spends much of its run time setting up its characters and world, beginning with a caravan of refugees arriving in the futuristic city of Kasi, the last outpost of civilization after droughts and pollution have rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. Life is cheap in Kasi, where a single chicken egg fetches the same price as a human being on the black market. The one exception is fertile women, who have become extremely valuable in this dystopian future world: Whenever one is discovered, she’s sold and shipped off to the Complex, a floating pyramid above the city, where a wealthy minority hoard the few natural resources that are left. </p>
<p id="FdFG9k">SUM-80 (Deepika Padukone) is one of these women, and one of hundreds who live as lab rats at the pleasure of Supreme Yaskin (Haasan), a 200-year-old tyrant who extends his life by extracting a serum from the wombs of impregnated female captives. The women die in the process, but no matter; their corpses are thrown into an incinerator, and new girls take their place. SUM-80, understandably, wants to live, so she’s hiding her pregnancy from everyone around her. But it’s been five months, and the sadistic doctors who run this so-called Project K will notice soon. </p>
<p id="qf2UDv">Things are grim in a different way outside of the Complex, though affable bounty hunter Bhairava (Prabhas) does his best to keep the mood light. Indian films typically blend genres, and although <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em> is more serious-minded than most Bollywood fare — there are no true musical numbers, sadly, though characters do lip-sync to Santhosh Narayanan’s original songs — Bhairava and his wisecracking AI companion Bujji (Keerthy Suresh) bring much-needed, Star Wars-esque comedic banter to the film. Bhairava is a Han Solo type, motivated by self-interest and the pursuit of cash, or “units.” Like Han, he’s also a ladykiller, as we learn when the similarly roguish Roxie (Disha Patani) enters the narrative. </p>

<p id="yh2pAB">At first, it isn’t clear how SUM-80, Bhairava, and 6,000-year-old badass Ashwatthama, who spends much of the movie hiding out in a cave, are connected. It’s never in doubt that they’ll meet up eventually, though, or that each of them will play their role in fulfilling the prophecy preached by a rebel group living in a hidden utopia known as Shambhala. Eventually, the action moves to the rebels’ sacred retreat. But first, SUM-80 must race across the wastelands, pursued by both Supreme Yaskin’s flunkies and Bhairava, who plans to exchange this precious hostage for admission to the Complex. </p>
<p id="m0x7k9">Some of the digital backgrounds VFX supervisor Praveen Kilaru and his team created for <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em> are absolutely stunning, and sci-fi fans who like nerding out on cool ships and badass vehicles will find a lot to get into here. (The design for Bujji, who can transform from a cool car to a cooler battle robot, is especially compelling.)</p>
<p id="kA5b7Y">But the fact that this is just the first part of a two-part story creates some serious structural issues. The first two hours of the film pass at a lively but unhurried clip, but the final hour tries to cram too much into an already overstimulating epic battle scene. It feels panicky and confused as it rushes through crucial plot developments and exposition. </p>

<p id="LOPOKK">Comparisons between <em>Kalki </em>and <em>RRR</em> are inevitable, if only because the former is nakedly trying to replicate the success of the latter. But Nag Ashwin’s film is missing a few of the elements that made<em> RRR</em> so charming: There’s no central bromance, no exhilarating dance sequences, and no sense of surprise. There is comedy, but it’s isolated in certain sections of the film, and there’s much less romance and music than audiences might expect. It’s still an entertaining ride, with some cool imagery and exciting chase scenes. But by channeling the gravitas of Western sci-fi movies, <em>Kalki 2898 AD </em>loses some of the range that makes Indian movies special. Its ambition is to be applauded. Its self-seriousness, not so much. </p>

            <p>Dune Imperium is a fabulous strategy game about becoming the biggest spice boy on a sandy planet I presume is called Dune. I love it despite never having read the Dune books or watched the Dune movies, because the digital version taught me everything I needed to know about Barry Harkonnen, Oscar Isaac, the tall guy from Guardians Of The Galaxy, and their insatiable pursuit of space nutmeg.
</p>
<p>Now the board game's first expansion is headed to the digital version of the game, and it's called Rise Of Ix for reasons I definitely understand.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rise Of Ix adds three new Great Houses - Moritani, Ecaz and Vernius - which have two new playable leaders each, all with unique special abilities. It also adds a new technology track to advance along, akin to the relationship tracks in the base game, as well as dreadnought ships which add a new layer of complexity to military conflicts.
</p>
<p>Dune Imperium is a deckbuilder and worker placement game, in which each player begins with two agents they can deploy on each turn by using cards, in order to accrue spice, moneybucks, water, or military strength. The aim is to gather victory points across up-to ten rounds of play, either by forming alliances with various factions (the Fremen, the Emperor, the red teleporty one, the purple one), winning battles against other players, or buying them via the card shop.
</p>
<p>I spent fifteen minutes playing half the tutorials in the digital version and then started actual matches, both against the computer and against a friend. Even as a total dummy, Imperium is graspable enough that I was able to conceive of and carry out a basic strategy from that very first match, which is all I need to have fun even if I'm losing. As it turns out, I do often lose, but the matches are typically close, with dramatic turnarounds and last-round comebacks. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure how Rise Of Ix's additions will interact with all those systems, but I'm excited to find out. The expansion is due to release second half of July, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1689500/view/4172103171348340066?l=english">according to the announcement</a>.</p>

He began working on a proposal for a potential follow-up, Alice: Asylum, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/04/american-mcgee-working-on-proposal-for-alice-3"><u>in 2017</u></a>, and encouraged fans to contact EA directly to show their support. His now retired <a href="https://www.patreon.com/americanmcgee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Patreon</u></a> contains all the other ways he incentivized fans to deepen their obsession, like referring to the fandom as "Insane Children" and eventually posting an <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/alice-asylum-v1-78703655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alice: Asylum design bible bursting with art</u></a>. </p><p>His otherworldly design is at least one reason why fans could never truly abandon Madness Returns, or the Alice series in general. They are a gorgeous testament to the fact that anyone can survive the worst thing that's ever happened to them.  </p><h2>Friendships and bonds</h2><p>Foxfire47 discovered Madness Returns' online fan base through McGee's Patreon in 2018. She remembers feeling McGee’s excitement for Asylum bleeding into her preexisting enthusiasm for the series, and it did the same for everyone she met over Patreon and Discord. </p><p>"Friendships and bonds were made through Alice: Asylum," Foxfire47 says. </p><p>When EA ultimately passed on the project, they were also rejecting an entire community that had put years and money into materializing a shared dream. But McGee had trained his fans to become personally invested, and an IP issue seemed small in the face of their dedication. </p><p>"After [EA rejected Asylum]," Foxfire47 says, "I feel that, as fans for Alice, we wanted to keep the spirit of the games alive. With the camaraderie of this community, we are always going to show our love for these games."</p><p>The community now sustains Madness Returns through YouTube videos with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoTP3Mm25f0&amp;t=959s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>millions of views</u></a>, pouty <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@goth_hisu/video/7290846213056793886?_r=1&amp;_t=8jieOM2PhSU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TikTok fancams</u></a> with hundreds of thousands of likes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/l59k1b/alice_madness_returns_cosplay_by_le_atlass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>detailed cosplay</u></a>, tattoos, and other tangible methods of worship. All of this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/yokxk8/alice_madness_returns_still_holds_up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>online word-of-mouth</u></a> has helped Alice fans succeed in an unprecedented goal. They are actively collecting new fans for an abandoned, 24-year-old franchise telling the strange horror story of an orphan teenager, Alice, who retreats into an hallucinated Wonderland. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I feel that, as fans for Alice, we wanted to keep the spirit of the games alive</p></div><p>"I bought Alice: Madness Returns, and I’m playing the first one for the first time because of your cosplay!" one commenter recently told popular TikTok cosplayer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessilyncupcake?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jessilyn Cupcake</u></a>. In recent years, she's made and shared several Alice cosplays with her eager followers, including Alice's <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessilyncupcake/video/7012329847284403462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ultramarine tea dress</u></a> and the yowling Hobby Horse hammer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessilyncupcake/video/7353442984311934250?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>from Madness Returns</u></a>. She first found Madness Returns in 2011, telling IGN that she "fell in love immediately.”</p><p>"It still feels modern and a fresh take despite being 15 years old," Jessilyn says. "I think [its] hack-and-slash-style gameplay with multiple weapons, costumes, and abilities is one of the best examples in a game, ever." </p><p>The game is an intoxicating blend of deadly and delicate, much like its most famous weapon, the lace-patterned <a href="https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Vorpal_Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vorpal Blade – a chef's knife for short-range combat</u>.</a> In Madness Returns, traumatized 19-year-old Alice must take on the child sex trafficker and psychiatrist <a href="https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Angus_Bumby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dr. Bumby</u>, who</a> tries to trick her into madness in order to commodify her body. But Alice learns to wield her fragile power against any abomination. </p><p>Alice's ability to work through her pain and tackle any problem, from <a href="https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Bitch_Baby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>baby dolls</u></a> that vomit to dangerous men, is part of her underdog appeal. And McGee accessorizes Alice's hypnotic visions with touches like the creamy, white bow behind her bloodspattered apron, and the crystal-blue butterflies in the misty, tree-covered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeLmMaL5irk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vale of Tears.</u></a> </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/jessilyncupcake-cosplay-1719613659360.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Alice: Madness Returns has inspired memes, art, coplay, and more from its dedicated fanbase. Source: Jessilyn Cupcake.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Though Madness Returns the game has been out for years, the most popular way for fans to publicly join together is by looking at the tiniest game details through a magnifying glass. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wqq_m/video/7111214136859593990?_r=1&amp;_t=8mA8lqlzqX8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>On TikTok</u></a>, a scene shows Alice hallucinates having her skull drilled open at the corrupt Rutledge Asylum. The camera lingers on swollen leeches in jars. Alice looks dazed in slow-motion, with makeup staining her skin like a bruise, and moved viewers supply the video with 43,000 likes. </p><p>"SAVE ALICE ASYLUM PETITION," says the most popular comment.</p><p>Madness Returns YouTube videos likewise prioritize analysis of the game's visuals and story. One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei4-s2F8hI0&amp;t=982s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>51-minute video</u></a> by video essayist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BoulderPunch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Boulder Punch</u></a> spends almost half of its runtime on series "highlights," praising its surreal platforming and aching orchestral score.</p><p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Blackrose128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>BlackRose</u></a> was among those captivated by its “beautiful, grungy artwork” when she recorded her first YouTube episode with it in 2023, leading her to recommend it to her 111,000 followers. </p><p>"I was immediately hooked," she tells IGN. "One particular part of the game that sticks with me vividly was when Alice became a giant after eating [enchanted Eat Me cake in] Queensland. I had loads of fun becoming big and terrorizing all the enemy card guards while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhuCks52XNM&amp;t=608s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>I laughed maniacally</u></a> for having so much power." </p><h2><strong>Master of the macabre</strong></h2><p>"The art direction of the two Alice games are definitely what struck me the most [about them] — that dark, gothic style that blends objects of childhood with violence and the macabre," says Maria, who runs the horror gaming YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eurothug4000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>eurothug4000</u></a>.</p><p>McGee's defunct Shanghai-based games studio, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/spicy-horse"><u>Spicy Horse</u></a>, specialized in the unique style that gave Alice life. Aside from the Alice series, the developer also (somewhat <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/06/american-mcgees-grimm-a-boy-who-learns-what-fear-is-review"><u>unpopularly</u></a>) turned several Brothers Grimm stories into platformers, while padding them with intriguing, cartoonish gore. But American McGee's: Alice is what truly established Spicy Horse as a purveyor of cute brooding. Madness Returns' art director <a href="https://www.kenart.net/portfolio/gameprojects.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ken Wong</u></a> was certainly inspired by it. </p><p>After Wong created Alice fanart in 2000, McGee took notice, and the two worked on designs together for several years. And on Madness Returns, "we saw an opportunity with the visuals to create something that was violent and horrific, yet also beautiful and full of imagination," Wong says. "Wonderland is such an amazing setting." </p><p>"I'm biased as the art director," Wong continues. "But in 2024, I think it's worth playing Madness Returns to experience a real visual feast. We were pushed to unleash our imaginations and explore some really dark places, and I think the game we created has some of the most beautiful environments and some of the most f'ed up characters I've ever seen in a game." </p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@leah___lbbh/video/7211327715461434670" data-video-id="7211327715461434670"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@leah___lbbh?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@leah___lbbh" rel="noopener noreferrer">@leah___lbbh</a> But recovering the truth is worth the suffering. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/seehergreatness?refer=embed" title="seehergreatness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SeeHerGreatness</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/alicemadnessreturns?refer=embed" title="alicemadnessreturns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#alicemadnessreturns</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/alice?refer=embed" title="alice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#alice</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/madnessreturns?refer=embed" title="madnessreturns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#madnessreturns</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/seehergreatness?refer=embed" title="seehergreatness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SeeHerGreatness</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Alice-Madness-Returns-7211327704958896939?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ Alice Madness Returns - °•💘💌 𝒜𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓎𝒶𝒽 💌💘•°" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ Alice Madness Returns - °•💘💌 𝒜𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓎𝒶𝒽 💌💘•°</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>Though the content of its story suggests defiance of its lineage, Madness Returns nonetheless shares its core with Alice in Wonderland, the idea that being a girl in an adult environment feels surreal. Because of this, actress Susie Brann, who voiced Alice in both games, tells IGN over email that she "wanted to bring to life the Alice [she'd] read about as a child."</p><p>"I saw her as frank, polite, well brought up, curious, honest and adventurous," says Brann. "I was aware that there was a great disparity between the innocence and truthfulness of Alice and the horror that was going on around her. But being aware that she had experienced real horror in the loss of her parents in such a horrific way, the games could be seen as an outworking of what was going on in her mind. Maybe bringing some form of closure, if not healing, to her mind."</p><p>The original Alice in Wonderland provides a roadmap to children hoping to detangle the bizarre world of grown-ups. Madness Returns has, in turn, become a cornerstone guide for women who've learned to become distrustful of the white rabbit that led them to it. Fans online <a href="https://chokit-pyrus.tumblr.com/post/189812838567/can-i-please-take-a-moment-to-rant-about-alice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gush</u></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1ckefpb/im_playing_alice_madness_returns_for_first_time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>about</u></a> the way Madness Returns handles trauma, which is, to this day, uncommonly nonjudgmental and empowering.While the villainous Bumby forces Madness Returns' Alice to suffer from gendered grief, she never allows it to infect all of who she is. She's more of a goth role model than a tragic hero, and in fans' appreciation of her, she's been able to join Alice in Wonderland as a fairytale classic. </p><p>Some fans have even grown up with Madness Returns the way other children, for more than a century, have had Alice in Wonderland read to them at bedtime. That was the case for twenty-two-year-old Johnnie, whose mom had been playing Alice games since before they were born. They first played it themselves when they were only five years old. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I'm biased as the art director, but in 2024, I think it's worth playing Madness Returns to experience a real visual feast</p></div><p>These days, Johnnie appreciates how "[Alice] isn't sexualized, demonized, or saved by a man," they say. "All of her healing is done on her own, and I've always loved and appreciated that. [...] <em>Alice</em> as a series, I believe, sparked a lot of discussion around trauma, psychosis, and mental health and provided that safe space for those who have suffered too without being painted as a villain."</p><p>Twenty-three-year-old Brynlee Daigle agrees. She's loved Madness Returns since begging her mom to buy it in 2012. Now, she discusses it with friends on Discord and does Alice roleplay on Tumblr. "One aspect of the game that still sticks with me is the important message about mental health, that no matter if you're disabled, or severely traumatized, you can overcome any obstacle in your way." </p><p>"It's why I have the [American McGee's Alice] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMm1M_JQUog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jabberwocky [boss] battle</u></a> tattooed on my thigh," she continues. "It's there to remind me I can always defeat my inner demons." </p><h2>A community lives on without its original creator</h2><p>Though he's helped Madness Returns sprout a loyal and hopeful community, McGee himself might prefer to let Alice's memory fade, like ink. In an email to IGN, a representative for McGee declined a request for comment, instead citing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFRZz8cAgfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recent YouTube video</u></a> as McGee's "final word on the matter" (after that, McGee acknowledged the "intensity of Alice<em> </em>fans" in relation to this article <a href="https://twitter.com/americanmcgee/status/1781074786472616365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on Twitter</u></a>). In the video, McGee describes being "emotionally, quite destroyed" after EA rejected his community-backed proposal for a third game.</p><p>Though McGee once welcomed fans' ardor while recruiting support for his Patreon, EA's rejection has understandably cut down his patience for it. He currently treats fans' eagerness like he would a slack-jawed Frankenstein – a creation that could never meet his wants and needs. </p><p>"Alice fans tend to have difficulty reading what I am saying when it comes to how much I DO NOT want to make games anymore," he wrote on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/americanmcgee/status/1783309103986852269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on April 24</u></a>. </p><p>Fans have learned to cope with his cold shoulder. Most of the meaning they derive from Madness Returns is personal anyway. </p><p>"Many of the active fans I've seen online are women," says Maria, "and American McGee's Alice goes through a lot as a young woman growing up in a world working against her." </p><p>"I think every woman can relate to some aspect of [Alice] in a way," she continues, "that feeling of something taken from them, that feeling of not seeming like you're in control [...] because you are a woman." So fans are grateful for what already exists. "If there's one thing I want people to take away from playing [Madness Returns]," says Jessilyn, "is that working through trauma — no matter how hard or stupid it is — can be worth it."</p><p>"If something is true, it’s true for all time," Brann says. "If the game resonates with people and helps them work through and leave behind some of their turmoil, understanding themselves more and what they’ve been through, that’s got to be a good thing."</p><p><em>Ashley Bardhan is a freelance writer at IGN</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In honor of the event, Humble is offering the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fsummer-games-done-quick-2024&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsummer-gdq-2024-humble-bundle-includes-an-homage-to-zelda-cd-i-a-great-3d-platformer-and-more%2F1100-6524602%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Summer Games Done Quick Bundle</a>, with seven of the very games you can watch speedrunners demolish, offering a chance for you to play them as you watch and see just how much you need to continue to hone your skills.</p><p dir="ltr">As is usually the case with Humble, the SGDQ Bundle comes with a tiered pricing system that lets you pick your price and the games you want. For $12, the lowest tier, you get three games: stealth immersive sim Dishonored, Contra-like side-scroller Blazing Chrome, and non-Euclidian first-person shooter Hyperbolica. Bump the price up to $15, and Humble adds The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore. At $20, you get the full seven-game bundle, adding Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 and Penny's Big Breakaway.</p><p dir="ltr">Humble Bundles support charities as well as game developers, and you can pay more than the asking price to increase your donation. The SGDQ Bundle supports Doctors Without Borders, just like SGDQ does.</p><p dir="ltr">All the games in the bundle are well-regarded, but there are a couple of recently released standouts you might not have heard of. Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore is a side-scrolling Metroidvania that harkens back to the CD-ROM era--specifically to Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, the 1989 CD-i game that featured bad animation and worse voice acting. Arzette is playing with that same aesthetic to great effect, making it fast, fun, and funny in equal measure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also Penny's Big Breakaway, a 3D platformer drawing a lot from the aesthetic, vibe, and gameplay of 3D Sonic games--in fact, it was developed by Evening Star, a studio formed from the fan developers responsible for Sonic Mania. An extremely colorful art style compliments its fast and reactive approach to platforming.</p><p dir="ltr">Also notable in the SGDQ bundle are a couple of excellent Bethesda titles. Morrowind, of course, is the well-loved RPG that preceded The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and the now truly ubiquitous The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but Morrowind has a special place in the hearts of many fans. Dishonored, developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda, is also worthy of your attention if you've never gotten around to playing it, whether you love slipping through various levels unseen or slicing through your foes with a mess of creative paranormal powers.</p><h2>Humble Summer Games Done Quick Bundle</h2><p><strong>Pay at least $12</strong></p><ul><li>Blazing Chrome</li><li>Dishonored</li><li>Hyperbolica</li></ul><p><strong>Pay at least $15</strong></p><ul><li>Arzette</li><li>Blazing Chrome</li><li>Dishonored</li><li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li><li>Hyperbolica</li></ul><p><strong>Pay at least $20</strong></p><ul><li>Arzette</li><li>Blazing Chrome</li><li>Dishonored</li><li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li><li>Hyperbolica</li><li>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2</li><li>Penny's Big Breakaway</li></ul><hr><p dir="ltr">If you're in the mood for more Bethesda games, you've got additional options thanks to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15540845%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fgames&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsummer-gdq-2024-humble-bundle-includes-an-homage-to-zelda-cd-i-a-great-3d-platformer-and-more%2F1100-6524602%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical</a>'s <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsummer-gdq-2024-humble-bundle-includes-an-homage-to-zelda-cd-i-a-great-3d-platformer-and-more%2F1100-6524602%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Bethesda Bundle</a>.

<p id="Hv77iu"><strong>Genre:</strong> Psychedelic action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 20m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Harmony Korine<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Jordi Mollà, Travis Scott, Joshua Tilley</p>
<p id="WqO7ba">What is there to say about <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, really? Filmed entirely in infrared photography, Harmony Korine’s latest experimental feature follows a melancholic assassin (Jordi Mollà) on a mission to murder a demonic, katana-wielding crime lord known as “The Beast” in nightmarish Floridian hellscape populated by eccentric gangsters and bikini-clad strippers. It’s a visually abrasive and unconventional film, but is it <em>actually</em> any good?</p>
<p id="jfbPox">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23916193/aggro-dr1ft-review-travis-scott-harmony-korine-incel-gamer-movie">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="udbdSc"><em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> is an obtuse, ridiculous, headache-inducing movie to watch. It’s nearly impossible to tell whether any moment of the movie is entirely a joke or entirely sincere — it’s called <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, for God’s sake. It’s a meaningless phrase, rendered in all capital letters with a 1 standing in for an I; for all we know, it might as well be Travis Scott’s Gamertag. But the movie is more than that too. It’s as clear a depiction of a certain kind of distinctly male-coded interior life as I’ve ever seen, and there is value to making that in such a weirdly unfiltered way. <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> isn’t an enjoyable or particularly well-made movie, but it is the movie I’ve thought about most this year. For better or worse, that’s worth something. </p></blockquote>

The MCU-ification of cinema means that franchise blockbusters often reveal characters, important MacGuffins, narrative loose ends, and potential sequel nods in bite-size teases that are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065485/mcu-post-credits-teases-sequels-rumors">less and less likely to lead anywhere</a>. But with <em>Furiosa</em>, Miller widens the scope of the Mad Max landscape exponentially, as characters old and new blast their way onto the screen, giving clearer insight into the setting of the Wasteland, its societal hierarchies, its gasoline-fueled wars, and its steampunk-hued reality.</p></blockquote>

<p id="5kPezr"><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 4m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Hayao Miyazaki<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Soma Santoki, Masaki Suda, Aimyon</p>
<p id="njTgWv">After more than a decade, Hayao Miyazaki has returned with a new fantasy follow-up to his 2013 historical drama <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/30/21275291/the-wind-rises-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-hbo-max"><em>The Wind Rises</em></a><em>. </em>Inspired by Miyazaki’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22732913/how-do-you-live-excerpt-hayao-miyazaki-favorite-novel">favorite childhood novel</a>, as well as his own experiences growing up in post-WWII Japan, <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> follows Mahito, a young boy who loses his mother in a tragic fire. After moving to the countryside with his newly remarried father, Mahito crosses paths with a mysterious anthropomorphic bird that entices him with the promise of being reunited with his mother.</p>
<p id="NEdXef">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="xfjuDz">On the surface, all of this is par for the course for a Miyazaki film, with trace elements from <em>Spirited Away,</em> <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>,<em> </em>or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/26/21270987/kikis-delivery-service-best-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki"><em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em></a><em>.</em> The confusion starts when viewers try to square that with the parakeets, causality-breaking out-of-time characters, and the heron turning out to be a small gnomelike man wearing a living bird like a suit. Could all those elements be purposeful trolling from a director known for his, to put it delicately, acerbic personality? Maybe, but there seems to be a statement behind the madness: It’s as if Miyazaki is declaring, “This is my life’s work. I don’t care if you’ve enjoyed it. Goodbye.”</p></blockquote>

<p id="kp0pkB"><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 42m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Ishana Night Shyamalan<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Dakota Fanning, Georgina Campbell, Olwen Fouéré</p>
<p id="cDU3aq">Dakota Fanning stars in <em>The Watchers</em>, the debut horror feature from Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23589900/m-night-shyamalan-movie-cameos-explained-haha">M. Night Shyamalan</a>. The film follows Mina, an American immigrant living in western Ireland who is tasked with delivering a parrot to a zoo in Belfast. After losing her way in a vast forest, Mina finds shelter in a strange bunker alongside three other strangers who are being held captive by strange malicious entities who observe them through a mirrored window. </p>
<p id="ZCehL3">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24173290/the-watchers-review-ishana-night-shyamalan-dakota-fanning">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="UPPZTb">Most of <em>The Watchers</em>’ appeal comes from all the mysteries in this setup: wondering what the Watchers are and what they want, what secrets the other three captives are hiding, who will inevitably crack first under the pressure the eerie situation puts the group under, and how Mina’s arrival will upset the status quo. The sharp, high-contrast cinematography (from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22724430/lamb-movie-sheep-birth-scenes"><em>Lamb</em></a>’s Eli Arenson) gives these opening chapters a winningly oppressive look, with the golden glow of the Coop extending out into the deep blues and blacks of the nighttime woods. The constant effect of the Coop’s mirrored wall gives the characters an eerie set of duplicates hovering nearby at all times, which Shyamalan and Arenson use to create a hyper-real but still fable-like atmosphere that’s often haunting and unsettling.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At this point, I’ve now played The First Descendant in three or four different beta iterations, and each time I’ve felt no more or less certain whether this would be something my friends and I would want to play, or just another sci-fi shooter in a sea of similar games vying for our attention. After more than 45 hours sunk into a pre-launch preview build over the past week, I’m only slightly closer to answering that question – but I’m certainly not having a bad time. I’ve got a whole lot left to play, including the all-important endgame, for instance, so as of now I’m still not sure if The First Descendant will be my next looter-shooter fixation, or yet another one that misses the mark.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>Nexon’s free-to-play third-person multiplayer game plays in the same space as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review"><u>Genshin Impact</u></a>, complete with cool-looking characters to unlock and countless currencies and materials to grind, all of which can be bypassed by those simply willing to cough up their hard-earned cash. And, like some of its polished contemporaries, there’s a pretty decent game here in spite of a UI that requires a PhD in RPG hogwash to decipher and an irritating monetization model that does crazy things like make you pay real money to increase your inventory capacity or get RNG consumable dye packets just to change the color of your gear. Running around with friends while shooting enemies and unleashing interesting supernatural abilities upon alien armies is an undeniably good time (as it is in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review">Destiny</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/20/warframe-review-3">Warframe</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outriders-review">Outriders</a>, to name a few) and the deep RPG mechanics and loot systems are a spreadsheet-loving nerd’s dream. It’s also a fairly pretty game that feels a lot more premium than one might expect from the free-to-play space, despite the occasional framerate dip or crash (at least in its pre-release state). That said, the free-to-play model is every bit as eyebrow raising as it might sound, the story and dialogue is laughably bad, and much of the campaign is packed with filler that can be a real snooze.</p><p>I’ve split my dozens of hours dashing around small hub areas completing repetitive chores in between much more substantial missions and boss battles against robotic kaiju called colossuses. Those self-contained missions and boss fights are exactly the kind of thing I hope for in an action-packed cooperative game: Some seriously awesome combat that rivals its peers, interesting enemies to take down, and a loot system that had me regularly trying out the latest shiny weapon I pulled from some shmuck’s corpse. If The First Descendant would just let me mainline that part, we’d be onto something and my mind would be made up. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The impressive self-contained missions are kept locked behind dull errands.</p></div><p>Unfortunately, so much of it is kept locked behind sections where you complete a series of really dull errands, like defending a piece of tech from waves of enemy assaults, gathering items from fallen baddies to deposit into a collection robot, or just killing stuff until a miniboss spawns for you to take out. Not even dope combat can stave off boredom when it has you hanging around for a few minutes while you wait for small groups of enemies to spawn until you’re told that you succeeded, then being directed to the next spot on the map to do it again. These sections account for a pretty big chunk of what you do during the main story, too, seemingly to pad out the adventure so you don’t burn through the more interesting activities too quickly. Worst of all, there are only a few flavors of these kinds of quests, so you’ll find yourself being asked to repeat them multiple times in between every boss battle or more meaty story mission.</p><p>While I’ve only played through half of the campaign, so far it’s really not looking great, fam. Absolutely brimming with nonsensical sci-fi babble like “dimensional walls,” “inverted data codes,” and “unleashing Arche,” it’s one of the sillier stories I’ve seen in a while. Most of the dialogue is absolutely atrocious: At one point I burst out laughing when a bad guy menacingly declared, “Qliphoth will engulf Ingris. The roars of the Vulgus will fill this land with fear!” In another section I shook my head as an antagonistic character named Jeremy (a grown man with the voice of a whiney, spoiled teenage brat), showed up to be the most annoying person in the world and was mean to me for no reason while I ran quests for him. It’s truly heinous stuff, but some of it is so bad it’s pretty amusing – I eventually found myself looking forward to cutscenes, eager for the next hit of sci-fi gibberish and butchered voice performances. (On top of the absurdity, the English voices rarely come close to matching the lips of the characters speaking. That’s fine if you enjoy watching anime dubs, but I find it pretty distracting.)</p><p>Thankfully, the most interesting characters are those you can unlock and play as, like the unflappable electric speedster Bunny (my personal favorite), or the sarcastic and smarmy grenade-chucking soldier Lepic. Some of the cast do still seem a bit shallow, largely because you get only a little backstory and character development for most of them, but hearing them cheer as you blast monsters to bits and seeing their charming animations – which clearly had much more effort put into them than those of the NPCs – is quite nice. Only one of these playable characters has an actual questline associated with them (with more planned for the future), but the bits of that story I played were some of the better content available in The First Descendant at launch, so here’s hoping they at least deliver on that front.</p><p>Actually learning to play as them is great too, although I still have plenty more characters to unlock before I’m able to take them all for a spin. One character might control the battlefield with explosive AoE attacks, while another covers enemies in devastating ice-based debuffs. Bunny does insane DPS by running around as much as possible to generate electrical energy, then unleashes it in powerful blasts. Since each of the characters has their own style of play, switching between them offers a markedly different experience, like how Ajax, a heavy tank with protective abilities is all about standing your ground instead. Most games with playable characters as its main chase live or die by how compelling those unlockable avatars are, and so far The First Descendent seems like it’s loaded with distinctive options that are absolutely worth going through the trouble to obtain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Similarly, the weapons, equipment, and upgrades you earn while shotgunning your way through levels are awesome. Loot drops constantly, most weapons feel distinct and satisfying to play with, and watching the numbers go up as you modify and upgrade every new toy in your arsenal makes The First Descendant hard to put down… until it forces you into about 15 separate menus to juggle dozens of materials and so many different systems that you might want to keep your inhaler at the ready. This kind of thing is pretty typical for looter-shooters, granted, but even by the already gag-inducing standards of the genre, this one’s especially obnoxious to learn – especially since the tutorial robot who shows you the ropes in the social area explains things to you in a series of texts that pass by quickly enough to challenge your speed-reading skills.</p><p>Even after spending dozens of hours with this pre-launch preview build, I’ve got plenty more to play and an endgame to dive into once it launches properly next week. Check back in the coming weeks for my final, scored review. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
