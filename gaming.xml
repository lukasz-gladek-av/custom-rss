		<p>Roguelikes have to do a lot to actually stand out these days, because not only is it a crowded field, but also one where the overall quality can be incredibly high. It’s not enough to be competent; the game has to be not only mechanically satisfying, but ideally mechanically different as well. Ovis Loop manages to do both of these things pretty darn well, even in Early Access.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ovis Loop | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1n91AzCgBn4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ovis Loop puts you in the shoes of a sheep, sort of. You might be all woolly, but you get to run around with a massive greatsword, and then absolutely smash the heck out of some wolves, some of which are robotic, and some of which are horribly mutated into things that can spit out fireballs, or just be massive. You’re a sheep hunting wolves, and that’s just a good concept to start with.</p>


<p>Without digging too deeply into the details of the story, being a roguelike means that it unfolds as you explore the levels and beat up baddies. Of course, so do your abilities. While the base level of fighting in the game is to just jump, hit, and dodge, the skills you have can completely change what you’re actually doing as you fight. There are plenty of cool builds to try in the game, even at this point. I really like mucking around with the electric attacks, as they not only deal damage, but also cause massive lightning strikes as the debuff up, but the drone builds are also good fun. There’s just something satisfying about constantly throwing out drones instead of fighting on your own, and that’s a blast.</p>


<p>Your skills go way deeper than this though. Each skill has passive augment slots as well as active ones. You can change the passives up so that the skill cools down faster, does more elemental damage, or gets more damage in exchange for less defence. The active slots let you put in extra skills, which you can activate sequentially as you go, and all of them get the passive buffs too. This lets you have far more skills than the four you eventually unlock, and also build up specific combos as you please.</p>
<p>You can also choose to make a build that hardly uses skills at all, and just focus on the core attacks and your weapon too. You do get new weapons to choose from as well, including the starting greatsword, but expanding into things like an electric rapier and even a gunblade. Each of these theoretically unlocks different playstyles, and it’s just a joy to muck around with them all.</p>

<p>Ovis Loop isn’t perfect, despite my glowing praise. The balance feels a little bit wonky for some of the boss and mini-boss fights, and there are some weird bugs too. Although it’s worth noting that a couple of those bugs actually got removed in the Early Access review window while I was playing, and that’s got to be a reassuring fact for the game’s continued development.</p>
<p>Ovis Loop is already one of the coolest action roguelikes I’ve played, and if it can keep improving and adding things while it’s in Early Access, it’s got potential to be one of my overall favorites. I’ve got high hopes for this my little sheep hero, and I reckon a lot of you will too.</p>

			<p>Today, Crosswind Crew has announced that its eponymous debut game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crosswind-is-an-upcoming-f2p-pirate-survival-mmo-in-development-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Crosswind</a>, will debut at some point next year <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041230/Crosswind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. The studio also revealed a shift from the previous plan to deliver a free-to-play survival MMO to a more traditional premium survival game. Following the recent Alpha test, the developers surveyed players' preferences and behaviors and reached this conclusion.</p>



<p>New content, features, and gameplay will be added based on player feedback, such as the new biome and crew improvements shown in the summer teaser below. Crosswind Crew is also exploring new options available thanks to the transition to a paid experience, like the potential for mods and dedicated servers.</p>

<iframe title="Crosswind: Summer Dev Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9WFRYYWFOM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Crosswind is a survival game set in an alternative Age of Piracy. Featuring the classic "build, craft, survive" formula, it offers challenging boss fights, sea battles, boarding actions, and seamless ship-to-land gameplay. Driven by real-world characters and supernatural powers, the story unfolds as an epic fight against an ancient evil.</p>



<p>Players assume the role of a freelance captain who has been betrayed and stranded after a job gone wrong. What starts as a grounded story of survival and revenge quickly puts them in a conflict between empires, pirate clans, and mysterious dark powers looming on the horizon.</p>



<p>Crosswind lets players seamlessly continue their adventure from sea to land and vice versa: bombard coastal forts from afar, then close in and engage the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Many different ships are available, from nimble cutters to frigates and even massive galleons.</p>



<p>Crosswind aims to be a refined and comprehensive survival experience at its core. Players will explore the game world's biomes to gather resources and then unleash their creativity through building and crafting. At first, they might build a shelter, which can eventually turn into a fully operational outpost. It is also possible to recruit and expand the crew to speed up harvesting and production.</p>



<p>In combat, a vast arsenal of melee weapons and firearms will be at the player's disposal. Movesets include parrying and dodging enemy attacks while using different strikes to the player's advantage, as well as managing food, potions, and oils to gain powerful buffs. Players will also find challenging bosses and defeating them will provide access to their juicy treasures. Of course, when in trouble, they might call on the aid of their friends via the co-op feature.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-flesh-eater-courts-battletome-preview-brings-ravenous</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-flesh-eater-courts-battletome-preview-brings-ravenous-regality.1270332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has dropped a preview for another <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> army. The upcoming <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome contains new mechanics and updated rules for the delusional undead army, and GW has provided a sneak peek.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/nudwrxbe/knightly-bannermen-join-a-riotous-bacchanal-in-the-flesh-eater-courts-armies-and-regiments-of-renown/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop provided a glimpse at the changes in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome. This is the second undead army to get a spotlight in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newest edition</a> of the fantasy miniatures war game recently. The other army was the ghostly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-previews-changes-in-new-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nighthaunt</a> army.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-flesh-eater-courts-promo-miniatures.jpg?itok=oVmKhiaR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-flesh-eater-courts-promo-miniatures.jpg?itok=SyNT5gjy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At their core, the Flesh-Eater Courts are still ravenous undead hordes under the strong delusion that they are royalty. That delusion can even be altered on the battlefield, adjusting the horde's behavior.</p>

<p>One of those changes are in the form of the Knights of New Summercourt delegation. It centers around Ushoran, Mortarch of Delusion. This delegation fights alongside Knights, Varghulf Courtiers, and Serfs. With "In Their Sire's Shadow," they can do a free Charge once per battle alongside Ushoran when certain conditions are met.</p>

<p>But Ushoran's behavior can change on a whim, which the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome embodies. Once per turn, Ushoran can use "A Duel, Good Sir!" to challenge an enemy general. If the general accepts, both they and Ushoran can only target each other until either one of them are defeated.</p>

<p>Since the Flesh-Eater Courts are undead, dying can be more of a setback than a danger. "Red Errantry Hosts" lets you set up a replacement unit of Knights that have been defeated, albeit with half the models (rounded up).</p>

<p>Additionally, all units can utilize certain passives. "Equinox Parade" gives units a Run bonus on round one. "Ritual Dance" gives a movement bonus in round 3. And "Eat Your Fill" lets units heal after combat on round four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

            <p>If you like your Bethesda <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with a bit more of another sort of Bethesda RPG, I've got good news. An <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> modder's decided to put another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a> feature into the 2006's hottest 'supposed to be a jungle, but Lord of the Rings is popular' game. This time, it's Adoring Fan skill bobbleheads, and they might help you come to find the annoying lad a bit more loveable.</p>
<p>Hey, if nothing else, you can stick them on the mantelpiece of that house you're using Obiliv in a thing called love's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">Fallout-inspired settlement building mod</a> to erect.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4997">Bobbleheads of Cyrodiil</a>'s the name of the latest entry in the burgeoning genre, and it's the work of modder TheJaceWindu. "Ever wanted your own collection of tiny versions of Cyrodiil’s most infamous fanboy? No? [Too] bad," they wrote, "Because now there are 15 of them scattered across Cyrodiil, each lovingly sculpted in the image of the one and only Adoring Fan!"</p>
<p>They're not lying about the lovingly sculpted bit either. Each Adoring Fan bobblehead can pass perfectly for a little plastic model of the Arena's backrub merchant, and as with Fallout's Vault Boys, he's posed/dressed to mirror each skill the trinkets improve. I think my favourite's the one triumphantly posed in Imperial legion armour, which I assume to be the heavy armour bobblehead. Or maybe it's the one that improves your ability to bellow at random criminal scum, then get them in a tight camera zoom headlock, who knows?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda / TheJaceWindu</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Each bobblehead grants a unique passive perk tied to a skill! Ranging from Heavy Armour to Speechcraft, Sneak to Alchemy," TheJaceWindu explains. "Find one, and you’ll gain a permanent boost. Find them all, and you’ll unlock the Collector’s Perk: a juicy bonus of +20 Luck and +100 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/feather">Feather</a>, because nothing says 'I’ve earned it' like hauling around a backpack full of tiny fans.</p><p>"The perks are permanent. Once you collect the little fan you get a passive ability perk that is unique to the associated skill! This means you don't have to keep them in your inventory! Unless you want to, as they weigh nothing! But you can use them to decorate your homes or spruce up your favorite local fighters guild."</p>
<p>They add that they've stuffed the fans in a bunch of nooks and crannies all over Cyrodiil, with some in building, others out in the wilderness, and a few sticking out more than an Elven bloke yelling 'By Azura'. In all seriousness, as much as this mod's not going to suit gritty Oblivion playthroughs (if such a thing is possible, I've not pulled one off yet), I'm definitely bookmarking it in case I need to spice up future wacky ones.</p>
<p>Also, my first thought when I saw this mod was that Adoring Fan bobbleheads are surely among the gift shop tat you can buy in real life, right? Having glanced at <a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/search?q=adoring+fan&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">Bethesda's official store</a>, while you can get Adoring Fan badges and plushies, it seems they've not thought to crack the bobblehead market with him yet. Maybe they're worried it might cause that Hollywood primadonna Vault Boy to waltz off to his agent and demand more money.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're up for a bit of bobblehead collecting in Oblivion Remastered, you'll first need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Jason Voorhees</a>, also known as the character who kills teens while wearing a hockey mask in various slasher movies, is back, and we can all say thanks to a beer company for his return. Really.</p> <p>Despite being one of the most iconic and famous slashers in horror movie history, it’s been nearly two decades since Jason Voorhees donned his hockey mask to slaughter people in an official live-action production. Sure, he’s popped up in some video games, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-smash-bros-wb-matrix-jason-all-characters-1851488213"><em>Multiversus</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat</em></a>, and he’s been in some fan films, too. But the last time the ’80s slasher star had killed some teens at Camp Crystal Lake was all the way back in 2009. However, Jason’s 16-year absence is over, and not how I expected.</p> <p>On August 13, <a href="https://youtu.be/O_dEbWGRXsg"><em>Sweet Revenge</em> was released on YouTube. The 15-minute short film</a> features a few couples traveling to a nice cabin by the lake who quickly experience all the tropes you’d expect from a <em>Friday The 13th</em> movie, including an encounter with a creepy guy, old stories of bad things happening, strange noises in the woods, and of course, someone getting into a car to escape but not being able to because they forgot the keys. The short takes a bit to get going, but I really enjoyed it. As a big fan of the<em> Friday the 13th </em>franchise,<em> Sweet Revenge</em> feels a lot like a classic <em>F13</em> slasher despite its short runtime. And I like the new look for Jason, even if some fans find him too skinny.</p> <p>And yes, <em>Sweet Revenge s</em>tarring Jason Voorhees was funded by beer manufacturer Angry Orchard. While you watch people get brutally murdered, count all the apples and Angry Orchard bottles in the shot. According to writer and director <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/features/friday-the-13th-movie-sweet-revenge-jason-killing-campers-1236487104/">Mike P. Nelson in an interview with <em>Variety</em></a>, Angry Orchard was a great partner to work with and didn’t push them to include obvious ads in the short. Instead, there are moments involving apples, including a pretty brutal scene involving an apple in the mouth. In fact, some of the kills in this are so gory that YouTube won’t even let me embed <em>Sweet Revenge</em> in this article. Instead, <a href="https://youtu.be/O_dEbWGRXsg">you’ll have to go watch it on YouTube</a>. Sorry about that.&nbsp; But here’s the trailer:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jason Universe: Sweet Revenge (2025) First-Look Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZLi7Q5dUoE?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>As for that ending, which I won’t spoil here, it does seem like there’s more story to be told, which Nelson would love to do if given the chance.</p> <p>“I have an idea of where I’d love for the story to go after this,” Nelson told <em>Variety</em>. “It’s not really [in] my hands, whether or not it’s where Horror Inc. and Jason Universe end up going with it. But if I was given the opportunity…Holy crap, dude. I would snatch it up in a heartbeat. ”</p> <p>This short, its classic slasher feel, and Jason’s new look have me excited for a future <em>Friday the 13th</em> movie. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jason-universe-horror-inc-announces-multi-platform-expansion-of-friday-the-13th-franchise?">We know there’s a full “Jason Universe” initiative</a> by the franchise’s owners, with plans to make lots of new <em>F13</em> stuff. Now, let’s just hope fans don’t have to wait another 16 years for any of it.</p>

              <p><span>After a </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ballsmusical/balls-the-monster-catchin-musical-comedy"><span>successful Kickstarter campaign</span></a><span>, a solidified venue, and a few rehearsals under its belt, </span><i><span>Balls: The Monster-Catchin’ Musical </span></i><span>ran into a problem back in March: its lead actor had to drop out of the production. The </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> parody show was three weeks away from opening night at Caveat, a comedy theater on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The Professor, a clear homage to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet-sada-turo-professors-1849001912"><span>Pokémon Professor</span></a><span> who greets players in most games and gives them their first monster, had to embody a nostalgic presence in theatergoers’ minds, and with only weeks to go before opening, co-creators Brandon Zelman and Harrison Bryan had a wild idea. What if they got Stuart Zagnit, the original voice actor of Professor Oak, the iconic scientist who opens the original Game Boy games and serves as Ash Ketchum’s mentor in the animated series?</span></p> <p><span>“Brandon and I sort of like, locked ourselves in a room and said like, ‘What do we do?’” Bryan tells </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “What’s the biggest Hail Mary we can throw right now? Getting the original voice of the actual professor that we grew up with seemed like the most insane possible route, but we had known that Stuart was a musical theater performer for much of his career, and we had connected previously a few years ago.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000617783" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617783"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617783">© Photo by Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s true. While most </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans will know him as Samuel Oak, the goofy but heartfelt professor who can’t remember his grandson’s name, Zagnit’s Broadway career goes back decades, with the veteran actor having played iconic roles like Seymour in </span><i><span>Little Shop of Horrors</span></i><span> and the Mayor of Whoville in the first run of </span><i><span>Suessical</span></i><span>. Would a prestigious actor who had long since hung up his lab coat be willing to don it once more to spoof his old character in an off-Broadway musical? Especially with such a short window between seeing the script and his first performance? Hell yeah, actually.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Zagnit tells me that his first impression of </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>was that its combination of slapstick, crude humor, and a surprisingly pithy commentary on the culture of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games jumped off the page upon his initial read-through. However, it was when he heard the show’s original music that he was especially taken aback by the group’s songwriting chops.</span></p> <p><span>“There’s development in there, there’s variety, and there’s jokes within the music,” Zagnit said. “It’s kind of a full meal of entertainment. You’ve got the musicality for people who like original musicals. It walks that line of being a little naughty. It’s not for kids, really. It’s for former kids who grew up in this world.”</span></p> <p><span>Along with getting a chance to throw on a lab coat again, Zagnit says that one of the most rewarding parts of </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>is getting to explore new sides of the archetype he didn’t in his stint as Professor Oak.</span></p>

 <p><span>“[The show] has made me think about the character in new ways because they’ve added dimensions to his backstory, which was something that even when I was doing the series, we never investigated or discussed,” Zagnit says. “We’d just go and read the words every week and whenever they called us. So it’s, it actually took me back into it and then [I could] sort of revisit it with a whole new lens.”</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BALLS: The Sizzler" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kI4UVxb4Z_A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Much of that new introspection has come from the satirical basis of </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>. While the entire production is legally distinct from </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> and stars 151 original “Collectabuddies,” the show still parodies a lot of the original games’ concepts, including some that were based solely within video game mechanics rather than meant to be interrogated as actual parts of the fiction or world-building. Zagnit stars as The Professor, who, alongside his “piece of shit” grandson (named by an audience member), created the capture devices to put monsters in, largely due to his own fear of these creatures, rather than a desire to befriend and study them. With the premise of capturing monsters in balls put under a microscope, </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>spends much of its run-time picking apart the logistics of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world for the gags. There’s an entire segment dedicated to unpacking the mental toll a monster might feel after being left in a PC box for too long. A player can only carry six critters on their belt at a time, and any excess captures end up in a storage system until they’re either added to the team or released back into the wild. But more often than not, Pokémon live the rest of their lives in these boxes, and in </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>, those little guys are depicted as having lost their minds.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There’s something very fun about when you investigate around the corners of things that were not created to be really investigated,” Zelman said. “It’s like if you really dig deeper into a fairy tale and you try to pick apart those pieces, or if you’re looking at an early Bible verse or something and you’re trying to piece it together. It’s like, well, maybe an allegory is meant to just be what it is. This is something that we’ve been commenting on. A franchise that’s been around for almost 30 years now and a story that has to be sustained over that amount of time across different kinds of platforms and mediums, obviously it’s grown so, so big, how could all of it hold without one part of it bursting?”</span></p> <p><span>Some of the topics </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>touches on, such as the ethics of keeping monsters in balls or what someone does in this culturally hegemonic world if they aren’t trying to be the very best like no one ever was, have been explored in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games themselves as the franchise has grown, but never with this sharp of an edge. Ultimately, however, the show’s use of over-the-top shock humor serves to harken back to the series’ original lessons.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We found that as we kept developing the piece and as we brought in actors and composers to ask us these deeper questions about what kind of story we’re telling, the whole notion of not holding ourselves to the label that others or society puts on us was why we fell in love with these games to begin with,” Bryan says.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000617782" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617782"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617782">Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>But how do you engage with these ideas when Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are notorious for squashing fan projects and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124"><span>even competitors</span></a><span> that get a little too close to Pikachu for their liking? Very carefully.</span></p>

 <p><span>A big part of that is the creation of 151 new monsters that aren’t direct retreads of the Pokémon people know and love. In fact, most of these critters are crude sketches that Zelman says are meant to be representative of the “juvenile and silly” time in our lives when we would nickname a Pokémon something like “fartmouth.” So you will likely not see anything resembling these guys in a Pokédex. Though there are some clear homages to characters like Snorlax’s road-blocking ass, the mischievous Squirtle Squad, and even some deep cuts like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemons-famous-missingno-glitch-explained-1653929141"><span>Missingno</span></a><span> glitch, Zelman and Bryan say it was important that the visuals of the show be “nostalgic or evocative,” but not using any trademarked imagery or language. As such, </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>falls under parody and satire protections, and the pair hopes that it can exist alongside other big parody musicals like </span><i><span>Puffs </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Stranger Sings</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“We have all those protections and freedom of speech as well, as long as we continue to comment on the material and not actually utilize any of it, I think we’re okay,” Bryan says.</span></p> <p><span>With all the legal hoops jumped through and probably the best man for the job in the leading role, </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>played a few shows at Caveat with Zagnit as its leading man. However, getting to the point where he was willing to engage with the role again after he stopped playing Professor Oak was a difficult process for him. He originated Oak in the English dub and went on to play him for over 400 episodes before he and most of the English cast were unceremoniously recast in 2006 when production changed hands from 4Kids to The Pokémon Company itself. While </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-james-carther-cathcart-dies-meowth-gary-oak-1851786041"><span>some actors stayed on the project</span></a><span>, several others, including Zagnit and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>original Ash Ketchum</span></a><span> voice actor Veronica Taylor, were replaced for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-and-pikachu-new-season-liko-roy-1849903499"><span>remainder of the series’ run</span></a><span>. Though he hasn’t officially played Oak in nearly 20 years, he says that in all the time he spent playing the guy, he has “bonded completely” with the character, and they are still “a part” of one another.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was like, really angry and bitter and sat around grousing all the time,” Zagnit says. “Little by little, I began to understand that my fellow original voice actors were starting to turn up at these anime conventions, and I said, ‘Oh, maybe there is a life after the series.’ The fans haven’t forgotten us, but the fans grew up with us. That really changed my whole feeling about it and really brought me back to it.”</span></p>   <p><span>Even though most members of the original cast have long hung up their Poké Ball belts, Zagnit and Taylor still frequent anime conventions and have fans who know them from their original roles. While Taylor isn’t in </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>’ main cast, she did perform in one of the New York performances as one of the audience volunteers, playing the “10-year-old kid” who takes part in the opening number. She has also signed merchandise that’s on sale at the show’s booth, and will host its newly announced New York Comic-Con panel in October. Bryan says that they hope the panel, which will function as a “bonus level” to the show with its own sketches and splash zone, and other events that the cast has attended alongside Zagnit, will help them recruit more former actors into its extended family, whether that be by being involved in the show or helping to spread the word.&nbsp;</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>The question is, will familiar voices be enough to bring non-musical fans into the fold? Even with runaway successes like the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>movie, musicals are still a hard sell to some of </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>’ intended audience. Zelman says that musicals have somehow become a “dirty word,” as evidenced by the 2024 </span><i><span>Mean Girls </span></i><span>film obfuscating that it’s even a musical in its promotion. To some extent, Zelman understands the hesitation some audiences might feel about musicals because they’ve been “burned” by bad ones.</span></p> <p><span>“I get pretty frustrated with theater when it feels like it’s just serving theater makers,” Zelman says. “It feels too circular, right? We shouldn’t just be making this for each other. We should be, like, offering something to other people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Several </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans who have little to no experience with musicals have shown up to see </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>and enjoyed themselves, so Bryan hopes that the shared love of the material being affectionately spoofed can help get people who have historically been musical-averse into seats at the Caveat and beyond.</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> being the number one IP on the planet [means it] has such a spectrum of fans, and many of them are super introverted and not very social and I think they would like this show a lot if they trusted the idea of, like, seeing a live performance event. And it’s just not in their vocabulary,” Bryan says. “I’m not concerned that the material won’t connect. I’m eager to find out how we can help bridge the gap between people who wouldn’t necessarily do something like this. How do we gain trust from the less social or the less extroverted of the fandom of the community?”</span></p>

 <p><span>For now, much like everything else about </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>, it’s a “word of mouth” game. The Comic-Con panel, however, is one of the biggest stages the show has ever had, and it’s in front of a lot of New York locals. But what about the rest of the world? If </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>is localized to New York City, is its audience not inherently pretty limited? Well, Bryan and Zelman have thought about that and hope to use their growing social media reach to emulate something like how StarKid Productions hosts </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmwM_AKeMCk&amp;list=PLC76BE906C9D83A3A"><span>entire video versions of its parody musicals online</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“We have filmed all of these performances and we’re hoping to—in pieces—start presenting the material and hopefully getting some virality in that way,” Bryan says.</span></p>

 <p><span>For now, </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>will return to the Caveat after a brief break, but Zelman and Bryan are “flirting” with the idea of a traveling show, and hopefully Professor Oak himself is on board. Zelman and Bryan have grand hopes that </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>can carve its own space in the pantheon of musical parodies, and they hope that Zagnit will stay on board as long as he’s willing and able. The character description for the Professor says he’s a “spry 100 years old,” so they have plenty of time. Zagnit says as long as he’s mobile and enthusiastic, the show “keeps [him] young.”</span></p> <p><span>“We are Stuart’s children and he’s our child,” Zelman says. “We’re all each other’s children. We love each other dearly. I would love for </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span> to remain part of his incredible legacy, and we’d love to have him as part of this project for as long as he is willing and able to do so. So, yes, please, forever.”</span></p> <p><span>To keep track of </span><i><span>Balls: The Monster-Catchin’ Musical</span></i><span>’s upcoming dates and developments, you can </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ballsmusical/?hl=en"><span>check out the show on Instagram</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-moving-forward-with-%E2%80%9Ctargeted-cost-initiatives%E2%80%9D-and-ai-use.1270311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embracer is, well, embracing more AI use moving forward as part of the company’s future. </p>



<p>In statements made during it’s latest earnings report, CEO Phil Rogers called AI an “increasingly supportive force”. He said that AI use, “smarter collaboration” and “increased streamlining” will “be key to unlocking value and expanding margins.”</p>



<p><strong>“Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential,”</strong> he said. <strong>“The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding streamlining, Embracer, as it moves forward to becoming Fellowship Entertainment, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-75-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that its focus will remain</a> on <strong>“continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives.”</strong></p>



<p>These initiatives will target underperforming businesses that will allow them to <strong>“free up capital to deploy with better returns.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These initiatives could potentially include divestments,”</strong> Rogers said without mentioning if it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-let-go-nearly-2000-employees-in-the-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">means more layoffs</a> could come.</p>



<p>Right now, Rogers said, the company is facing what he calls a <strong>“pivotal moment”</strong> where Embracer needs to “sharpen [its] focus”. He said that the company will “double down” on what he believes is its greatest strength: <strong>“empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IP.”</strong></p>



<p>Those IP include franchises like The Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;Tomb Raider,&nbsp;Kingdom Come Deliverance,&nbsp;Metro, and Dead Island, to name a few. Rogers says that the company is “laying the groundwork” for a better development environment for its titles that he believes is <strong>“one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry.”</strong></p>



<p>Embracer has nine AAA games in development and set for release without counting any projects financed by partners. A couple of those games, however, might slip into fiscal year 2028/29.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Embracer/Fellowship Entertainment, especially when it comes to AI use and these “targeted cost initiatives”? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>

A quarter of a century has passed, as Irving and the <a title="Games > Ete [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ete">Ete</a>rnal Order carefully rebuilt Verroa to protect it against a future war. Their efforts will be put to the test far too soon as a new threat looms on the horizon. The neighboring Holy Asverellian Empire needs new lands to grow, and the fractious, fragile Verroa seems ripe for the taking. All that stands in its way is the Order and twenty scrappy heroes-to-be.</p><p>Take command of the Eternal Delegation, led by Irving’s descendants. Gwyn and Riordian will have to navigate the treacherous politics of Verroa, and weave a web of alliances to turn the tide of the coming war.

This time around the game is a co-op adventure game where you play as two, single-stud bricks heading off on a journey about "friendship and play." Now, as revealed in a trailer released by publisher Annapurna Interactive, a release date has been set in stone.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to pick up Lego Voyagers in a month's time on September 15, when it will be launching on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and the original Nintendo Switch. The new trailer, which you can check out below, offers up a good look at what you can expect from the upcoming game.

You'll be able to play the game in both local and online co-op, and if you own a copy of the game, you'll be able to invite a friend to play the whole game for free alongside you with the Friend's Pass. If you're at Gamescom later this month, you'll also be able to try out a demo of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Voyagers is out September 15, on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

                <p>Metal Gear Solid V will be turning 10 in September, but it still stirs up conversation--especially about the fallout between Konami, Hideo Kojima, and longtime Snake voice actor David Hayter. When Hayter was replaced by actor Kiefer Sutherland for MGS5, fans were stunned, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-hayter-says-he-has-no-role-whatsoever-in-metal-gear-solid-5/1100-6420692/" data-ref-id="1100-6420692">Hayter himself took it hard</a>. Back in 2015, he said playing the game would feel like "60 hours of humiliation."</p><p>But it seems that time away from things has changed his mind. Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/he-once-said-playing-metal-gear-solid-5-would-be-60-hours-of-humiliation-but-snake-actor-david-hayter-finally-played-the-game-all-is-forgiven/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> ahead of the Metal Gear Solid Delta release, Hayter said he finally gave the game a shot. "I didn't want to play the game because I figured it would hurt my feelings," he said. "Then, you know, 10 years went by, and I was like, 'To hell with my feelings. What do I care?" As a veteran screenwriter, he added, "I get fired for a living...I'm not a child."</p>

<p>Once he played it, Hayter was surprised by how much he enjoyed it. "I was like, 'Stop being a baby and play the game.' So I played it. It's amazing." He admitted it gave him a new perspective on fans who once told him MGS5 was their favorite. "I'd be like, 'What the hell, dude? Thanks. You wanna give me a paper cut as well? Maybe pour some lemon juice on it?' And then I played it and I'm like, 'I think this is my favorite gameplay of the series.'"</p><p>As for Sutherland, Hayter holds no grudge. "I ran into Kiefer Sutherland at a bar in Dallas, and we had a bunch of drinks. He's a great guy. No ill will." With Konami now welcoming Hayter back as the voice of Snake in upcoming projects like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-kept-you-waiting-huh/1900-6418142/" data-ref-id="1900-6418142">Master Collection Vol. 1</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, it appears both the franchise--and Hayter--are looking forward, not back.</p>

            <p>Everyone loves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, the budget-priced, super moreish bullet-hell game from Poncle. The game has seen various updates and expansions since its initial release in December 2021, and now the game is shedding its digital clothes and heading into the real world thanks to a board game.</p>
<p>Details on Vampire Survivors: The Board Game are almost non-existent, but Poncle has stated that it'll be hitting Kickstarter this autumn (that's Fall for our North American readers). Poncle is working with board game publisher Grey Fox Games, and you can sign up on the <a href="https://promotion.greyfoxgames.com/">official site</a> to receive updates (plus get a free Deck Box with your Kickstarter pledge when it goes live).</p>

<p>Plus a neat charity collaboration</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rue_valley">Rue Valley</a>, a narrative RPG heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>, has been confirmed for the Switch in addition to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>No release date has been set at the time of writing, but we're keeping a close eye on this one. It looks pretty awesome; definitely a little more upbeat and comedic than what Disco Elysium offered, but still retaining some of the same DNA.</p>
<p>Publisher Owlcat Games has also announced a collaboration with Movember, a leading men's health charity, aiming "to showcase how the immersive power of gaming can be used to explore mental health in new and meaningful ways".</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key themes of the collaboration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Meeting Players Where They Are:</strong> Using gaming as a familiar non‑clinical space, <em>Rue Valley</em> provides a natural approach to promote mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>- <strong>Gaming as Connection and Healing:</strong> Through the dynamic narrative and compelling characters, players are encouraged to reflect and engage in meaningful conversations.</p>
<p>- <strong>Normalizing Therapy:</strong> <em>Rue Valley</em>’s thoughtful approach to storytelling helps players explore what therapy can feel like in a safe, immersive way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the game itself will see you craft your own personality traits as you look to break free from a time loop and discover the secrets of Rue Valley. It's got the same isometric presentation as Disco Elysium, and a lot of the narrative elements definitely remind us of our exploits as Lieutenant Harrier "Harry" Du Bois.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ex-Disco Elysium staff have since formed a new studio called Longdue, and are hard at work <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/ex-disco-elysium-devs-reveal-a-spiritual-successor-is-in-the-works">creating a spiritual successor to the critically-acclaimed CRPG</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lego-voyagers-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/annapurna-interactive-announces-lego-voyagers-release-date-arrives-on-pc-and-consoles-in-september.1270254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-publisher-annapurna-interactive-entire-team-has-reportedly-resigned/">Annapurna Interactive</a> has announced the release date for LEGO Voyagers, a co-op game developed by the studio behind <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1544360/LEGO_Builders_Journey/">LEGO Builder's Journey</a>, Light Brick. Imagine what It Takes Two might look like if it starred two tiny LEGO bricks instead, and you're on the path to picturing LEGO Voyagers. First revealed during this year's<a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/"> Summer Game Fest</a> showcase, it'll arrive on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC this coming September 15, 2025.</p>



<p>The news of the release date was revealed with a new trailer, showing off a bit more gameplay to add to what we saw back in June. LEGO Voyagers is a two-player co-op game, where a small orange and blue brick attach to and form a myriad of shapes with the LEGO environment around them to overcome platforming obstacles, solve puzzles, and embark on a picturesque adventure, brick by brick.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's an entirely non-verbal narrative, as the two colored bricks will just make expressive noises throughout the whole journey to communicate, and you'll have to solve all the game's challenges by figuring out what you can build to keep moving. </p>



<p>There doesn't seem to be any elaborate narrative embedded in LEGO Voyagers, with the journey being more about the themes it touches on. A press release for the game details that the adventure begins with the two bricks deciding to "<em>rescue an abandoned spaceship</em>," and along the way they discover "<em>the value of being connected</em>."</p>



<p>It all together seems like a charming game that will be up for Best Family Game at the end of the year for The Game Awards, and it might even have a few noteworthy puzzle and gameplay challenges for LEGO fans to dig into. We'll see what the whole adventure has in store on September 15, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Saber Interactive has announced&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>, a realistic management sim that tasks you with managing a busy port after a devastating hurricane has swept through it.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Docked&nbsp;</em>will have you operating heavy machinery, overseeing supply and logistics chains, and managing the overall operations of the port. It's very much one for the <i>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</i>crowd, although it's got the disaster twist of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/snowrunner" rel="nofollow">SnowRunner</a>&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<p>Unlike Astragon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon" rel="nofollow">recently-announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Docked&nbsp;</em>will see you managing the operations of the port itself, so you won't actually be sailing any ships in this one; rather, you'll be responsible for what happens to them when they come into port.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/docked-announced-ship.jpg?itok=SwaYy9F_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/docked-announced-ship.jpg?itok=OYMiZSdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You won't be sailing this thing, but you will get to decide what happens to it in your port.</figcaption></figure><p>While you may not be sailing the ships that come into Port Wake, you will be operating lots of heavy machinery, including "colossal ship-to-shore cranes" and "sturdy, heavy-duty tractors", among other things.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a Saber Interactive game, the simulation element will be important in&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>; you'll need to "tighten ropes, position materials, optimize weight distribution, [and] navigate delicate cargo with little margin for error".</p>

<p>As you revitalize your port, you'll need to upgrade and expand it "one crane at a time". Each job you take on will earn you cash, and you can reinvest that cash into Port Wake, buying new vehicles and upgrading your fuel and power supplies as you go.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>, which gives you a pretty good sense of what you can expect from the game, right here.</p>




<p><em>Docked&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does arrive, it'll be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you want to keep up with the game, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2487300/Docked/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s game time for streaming services: a growing number of streamers are betting on casual games as a way to keep viewers hooked when they’ve run out of things to watch.</p><p>Toronto-based Zone-ify added <a href="https://zone.tv/zone%c2%b7ify-becomes-first-avod-platform-to-launch-free-gaming-through-tv-remote-controls/">free casual games</a> to its ad-supported streaming service in June. Last month, close to 70 casual games <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/31/3125310/0/en/Future-Today-Levels-Up-Content-Strategy-with-Launch-of-Interactive-Game-Experiences.html">arrived on Happykids and Fawesome</a>, two ad-supported streaming services run by streaming startup Future Today. And later this year, Netflix is expected to expand its own gaming efforts with what company executives have called party games — casual titles that could turn movie night into game night.</p><p>It’s not the first time that companies have tried to blur the lines between gaming and leanback entertainment. But while prior efforts were largely focused on turning streaming devices into would-be game consoles, this new push focuses much more on casual gaming. Think <em>Connect 4</em>, not <em>Counterstrike</em>.</p><p>Casual games have been a huge hit on mobile, where breakout hits like <em>Candy Crush</em> and <em>Wordle, </em>the uber-popular word game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition"><em>the New York Times</em> acquired</a> in 2022, have turned hundreds of millions of people who would never describe themselves as gamers into habitual players. Can the same happen in the living room? And what does it take for streaming services to have their <em>Worlde</em> moment and launch a title that gets tens of millions of people to play every day?</p><p>For this week’s edition of <em>Lowpass</em>, I chatted with Zone-ify’s chief content officer John Orlando and Volley CEO Max Child to find out. I also spent a little too much time playing casual games on my TV …</p><div><p id="from-angry-birds-to-bandersnatch"><h2>From <em>Angry Birds</em> to <em>Bandersnatch</em></h2></p></div><p>When I first heard about streamers adding casual games, I thought: here we go again.</p><p>Over the years, there have been many attempts to turn streaming into more than just passive entertainment. Roku, for instance, struck a partnership <a href="https://angrybirds.fandom.com/wiki/Roku">in 2011</a> to bring <em>Angry Birds</em> to its platform. At the time, Roku even released a limited-edition <em>Angry Birds</em>-themed streaming device.</p><p>Amazon released its first Fire TV device with an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/television/amazon-fire-tv-is-amazon-s-streaming-box-1239265?src=rss&amp;attr=all">optional game controller</a> in 2014. And when Nvidia entered the streaming device market with the Nvidia Shield in 2015, it initially didn’t even include a remote control in the box, with the company betting that the device would appeal to gamers first and foremost.</p><p>None of those efforts succeeded, for obvious reasons: hardcore gamers want powerful hardware and AAA titles, something that streaming devices simply couldn’t offer. And people who buy a Roku do so primarily to watch TV, not to play mobile games in their living room.</p><p>Netflix’s first attempt to expand beyond leanback viewing with interactive titles like <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em> failed, as well, in part because the titles lacked the stickiness and replayability of video games. “As a novelty, it’s incredibly fun to do those interactive things,” Orlando tells me. “But it’s not something that you want to do all the time.”</p><p>“Gaming is different,” Orlando says. “You’re going to keep playing for hours, and you’ll want to come back.”</p><p>Chances are you’ve never heard of Orlando’s <a href="http://zoneify.tv/">Zone-ify</a> service, which looks a bit like Tubi did 10 years ago: a few high-profile titles and lots of older catalog content you’ll likely find elsewhere, as well.</p><p>At this point, the company’s game library matches that vibe, with a bunch of knock-off versions of popular games like <em>Connect 4</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em>, all of which can be played with a remote control. And yet, I quickly found myself sucked in, solving level after level in a game called <em>Crazy Lot</em>, which looks a lot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)"><em>Rush Hour</em></a>.</p><p>To add games to streaming, Zone-ify partnered with <a href="https://es3.ca/">ES3</a>, a company that has been building interactive advertising experiences for major media companies. However, this was the first time that a service used ES3’s tech for gaming inside a free streaming app. “I was shocked that there wasn’t another ad-supported video service that was doing it,” Orlando says.</p><div><p id="phones-become-dedicated-second-screens"><h2>Phones become dedicated second screens</h2></p></div><p>Zone-ify didn’t remain the only ad-supported service with casual games for very long. In late July, Future Today announced that it was adding puzzles, word games, and things like pool and air hockey to its Happykids and Fawesome apps on Roku devices. And some time later this year, Netflix is expected to launch a first crop of party games.</p><p>“We want to reimagine what social engaging experiences can unfold in the living room,” said Jeet Shroff, Netflix’s vice president of game technology, at a Netflix Game Developers Conference event <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/netflix-gaming-party-games-strategy">earlier this year</a>.</p><p>Netflix’s party games are an extension of the company’s massive push into gaming, which also includes dozens of mobile games and cloud gaming to bring AAA titles to the TV. Netflix did scale back some of its more ambitious indie gaming efforts and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">closed down</a> an in-house game studio last year. However, the company is still heavily invested in gaming as a whole, with its gaming head Alain Tascan telling reporters at the GDC event that Netflix was on its way to become the Netflix of gaming.</p><p>As part of those efforts, Netflix has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/8/23824509/netflix-game-controller-tv-gaming-ios-app">built its own mobile game controller app</a>. In the context of party games, that controller is poised to become a dedicated second screen, complete with prompts and clues that could make things like multiplayer quizzes more fun. “You have information that perhaps is only available to you,” Shroff said. “There’s all this amazing social gameplay that can unfold.”</p><p>Incorporating phones into TV-based game play works surprisingly well, according to Child, whose company <a href="https://www.volleygames.com/">Volley</a> has been building voice-centric multiplayer games for smart TVs. “We were worried about the friction of having people go get their phones,” Child says. But in a world where people cling to their mobile devices all day, that worry turned out to be unfounded. “We found that people are happy to use their phone,” he says.</p><p>Volley makes use of phones to extend voice input to multiple players (few people own a TV with built-in far field microphones, and sharing a single voice remote can be awkward during a fast-paced game). For some games, they also offer dedicated controls: the company’s <a href="https://www.volleygames.com/skills/jeopardy?screen=tv"><em>Jeopardy</em></a> adaptation turns your smart phone into a buzzer, making the game feel a lot more like the real thing. “It really replicates that actual experience of being on the game show,” Child says.</p><p>Volley’s experience with games like <em>Jeopardy</em> seems to validate some of Netflix’s ideas. “The live multiplayer family game night experience is really compelling,” Child says. “You have kids playing with their parents, playing with their grandparents.” And once they start, they keep playing. “Our average session is well over an hour,” he says.</p><p>However, Child also cautions that bringing games to the TV can’t be a one-and-done kind of affair. Even for casual games, players want regular updates — something that may require streamers to treat games much like the rest of their content. “If a streaming service had only one show you wanted to watch, once you finished that show, you wouldn’t come back,” he says.</p><p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/">Lowpass<em> by Janko Roettgers</em></a><em>, a column on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for </em>The Verge<em> subscribers once a week.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTM1Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Janko Roettgers</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/lowpass-newsletter/758917/streaming-gaming-netflix]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-rad-eus-trqstme-says-marvel-rivals-regular-patches-make-esports-insanely-difficult/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-rad-eu%E2%80%99s-trqstme-says-marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-regular-patches-make-esports-%E2%80%98insanely-difficult%E2%80%99.1270239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rad EU star TrqstMe believes it’s “insanely difficult” for Esports teams to compete in Marvel Rivals due to the regularity of patches, but hard work paid off after success in the Ignite Mid-Season Finals in Guangzhou.</p>



<p>The EMEA fought back against the odds in the Grand Final to overcome Envy, a team that had already defeated them twice at the event, to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure a 4-2 triumph</a>, a grand prize of $160k, and a place in history.</p>



<p>Rad EU’s victory was made even more impressive by the team’s uncertain future, with requests for the entire team to be signed by a new organisation <a href="https://x.com/fate_gb/status/1954738412893987073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared the day after their triumph</a>, giving the team even more challenges to overcome. The biggest of them all, according to TrqstMe, is Rivals’ regular patch schedule.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-is-unapproachable-for-new-players">Marvel Rivals is ‘Unapproachable’ For New Players</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Champions. Image via Marvel Rivals/Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking to Insider Gaming after the final, TrqstMe described dealing with the regular patches, which now see a new hero releasing every four weeks, as “insanely difficult” and “a full-time job.”</p>



<p>Not only does each major patch bring a new hero, who teams must quickly test out to see how they fit into the meta, but it also brings a range of buffs and nerfs to existing heroes. All this, along with the complexity of the banning system at high ranks, makes it difficult for new players to join the game.</p>



<p>“It’s unapproachable for a newcomer because a lot is going on, especially with the bans and stuff. There needs to be someone who explains it. In the future, more people will be there to analyse and explain it to the casual audience.”</p>



<p>Despite the complexities of the game, TrqstMe is adamant that Marvel Rivals is here to stay and declared that “everyone who hasn’t tried it needs to.”</p>



<p>For TrqstMe and his teammates, the future of the team may be somewhat up in the air ahead of the EMEA Ignite Stage 2 later this year, where the team will battle for a spot in the Grand Finals that offers a whopping $1m prize pool, but it’s clear he will be pivotal to any future success.</p>



<p>“All the effort I spent over the year paid off. I think I was one of the hardest-working players in the world. We did everything for the team, outside of the game and inside, I was leading the team a lot. I’m very happy it contributed to my success.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>publisher Playstack has announced&nbsp;<em>Raccoin</em>, a roguelike that blends strategic deckbuilding with the arcade thrills of coin-pusher machines, and it's getting a playtest very soon.</p>

<p>As revealed by Playstack and developer Doraccoon in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>is a ""nonstop dopamine rush" in which you must utilize special coins, combos, and synergies to get the results you want from a classic arcade coin-pusher.</p>

<p>If all of this is starting to sound familiar, that's probably because you're one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">millions of people</a> who has played&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>very much seems to be in the same vein; it looks to be attempting to do for coin-pushers what&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>did for poker.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raccoin-playstack-gadget.jpg?itok=AgD07SwI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raccoin-playstack-gadget.jpg?itok=FIgtO5x6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>wants to do for coin-pushers what&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>did for poker.</figcaption></figure><p>Some of the special coins you can look forward to include one that allows you to grow "a money tree" for your machine, as well as a "Nuclear Coin" that will provide a more propulsive push.</p>

<p>Doraccoon is promising "over 100 unique items", all of which have the potential to "dramatically shift the course of your run". Naturally, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>-style arcade roguelike, you'll be stacking multipliers and building crazy combos as well.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to different characters to play as, each of whom brings their own unique personality and themed coins. These include a "math-savvy raccoon manager" and a "quirky biologist". Is the former a manager of raccoons or a raccoon themselves (or both)? You'll have to play to find out!</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what <i>Raccoin&nbsp;</i>plays like, you can check out the announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Of course, a better way to join the&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>hype is to playtest the game yourself, and starting from August 18th, you'll get the chance to do just that. All you need to do is request access over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official Steam store page</a>.</p>

<p>Nearly two months after its release, crossplay in Rematch appears to finally be on the horizon. </p>



<p>In a post announced details for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-gets-second-major-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s second major patch</a>, developer Sloclap has given a new update regarding crossplay for players. </p>



<p><strong>“Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce Crossplay to the game (at last!),”</strong> they said. </p>



<p>In addition to crossplay coming to the game, Sloclap said that “some gameplay tweaks” may also be added in Patch 3, specifically calling out the Ippy Slide. Those details, however, are “still to be confirmed”.</p>



<p>Crossplay in Rematch was scheduled to be a major feature for the soccer game upon release. Unfortunately, shortly before its launch, Sloclap <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-will-not-have-crossplay-at-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that it wouldn’t</a> be available at that time, though getting it implemented was a “top priority”.</p>



<p>At the time, the developers said that they did their “utmost” to have it available at launch, but “unforeseen technical complexities” prevented it from happening. </p>



<p>Recently, the studio said that <strong>“core work”</strong> <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/mini-dev-update-1-august-12th-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was complete on the feature</a> with it being validated by Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. </p>



<p><strong>“This milestone represents the most time-consuming phase of the project, involving multiple rounds of collaboration and in-depth testing with each platform,”</strong> Sloclap said. <strong>“Our UI/UX and Online teams have been fully focused on bringing crossplay to life, which has meant fewer updates and improvements to existing features in recent weeks.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We’re now shifting our efforts toward final stabilization and bug fixing, with a special focus on polishing the Social features.”</strong></p>

A supply drop to an Alaskan town, auto-pilot on, guard down. You and Donovan were already planning post mission drinks when it happened.</p><p>The storm.</p><p>Half the plane disappeared in a flash. Donovan was gone, lost to the howling tempest. Waking from the crash, you find yourself alone, trapped in a frozen wilderness, your only companions a court-mandated therapy bot and temperatures that can cut a man to shreds. Hope for survival lies in finding your friend and maybe a way home.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You are Kai, a pilot without a plane, lost in the wilderness of the far north. You’ll need your wits about you to brave the elements, find your co-pilot and get the hell out of Dodge. Along the way, you might just discover what it was that cut your plane clean in two… and what it is making those noises after dark.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>Squid Games is taking over Fortnite, as Epic Games has announced that new creator-made games are available now to play. Like its Netflix source material, these are inspired by childhood games, but they're given a deadly twist as failure can result in elimination--at least it's better than what happens to the poor souls who lose a game in the popular TV series.</p><p>As you'd expect, there are also a few Fortnite elements present here, and some of the games revolve around lethal sumo rings, a deadly trap-filled gauntlet, and a recreation of the iconic Red Light, Green Light game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite x Squid Game - Official Creator Games Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the new modes teased was Squid Games: Island Escape. Now available, Island Escape revolves around players outrunning the Squid Games Guards and extracting themselves. Players assuming the role of Squid Games Contestants will compete in five minigames, and succeeding will unlock powerful loot to help them in their escape attempt. The catch here is that Guards will have several advantages as they chase down players, and the fewer survivors there are when they reach the boat, the bigger the payoff will be for all remaining players.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1944203356" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>The price of many products is increasing of late, due in part to tariffs and other economic conditions, and this has stretched to gaming as well. Against this backdrop, FuturLab has released a tongue-in-cheek trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2 that confirms the standalone sequel's price--$25 USD--which is the same as the first game.</p><p>"FuturLab acknowledges that in the current cost-of-living climate, players often have limited budgets for games and entertainment. For many, PowerWash Simulator is more than just a game, it's a wellbeing tool, a way to decompress and reclaim a moment of calm. The team is keen to keep that experience within reach," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A9wbwsmsA0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0A9wbwsmsA0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PowerWash Simulator 2 builds upon the foundation of the original game and adds more features like split-screen co-op, four-player online campaign support, better visuals, and perhaps most importantly, pettable cats.</p><p>"The choice to stick with the original price comes from a place of genuine appreciation. The team has been genuinely moved by the response to the original game and its DLC packs, and the hope is that continued support into the sequel will allow them to keep this accessible price point locked in at launch, with no plans to raise it," the studio said.</p><p>FuturLab added that it's able to keep the price the same due in part to the success of the first game. It was initially released in 2022 and became a big hit, as people embraced the satisfying zen nature of cleaning things off with a high-powered water hose.</p><p>FuturLab said that, as with the first game, it will steadily support PowerWash Simulator 2 with ongoing free updates after launch, including licensed content.</p><p>The game is in the works now for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but a release date hasn't been announced yet. The original game launched on Game Pass, but it's not confirmed if the sequel will. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist PowerWash Simulator 2 on Steam now.</a></p><p>On the subject of increased costs in gaming, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden recently told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that publishers should have raised prices gradually over the years to account for ballooning budgets. Nintendo's Mario Kart World was the first major $80 game when it launched earlier this year, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-sales-race-ahead-almost-tied-with-switch-2/1100-6533626/" data-ref-id="1100-6533626">it was a huge success for Nintendo</a>, though many people no doubt got it for a perceived discount with the Switch 2 hardware bundle that included a copy of the game.</p><p>Microsoft was set to charge $80 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6531213/" data-ref-id="1100-6531213">The Outer Worlds 2</a> this October but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">changed plans and is keeping the price at $70</a>. Many are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">expecting GTA 6 to come in at a price above $70</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/">the price of that game remains to be confirmed.</a></p><p>Others are not following Nintendo's path with $80 games, at least not yet, and that's because "everyone's afraid," according to Layden.</p><p>"No one wants to be the first one to raise the price, because you're afraid to lose traffic. So what you do is you just end up eating into your operating income, your profit margin," he said.</p>

<figure><a title="Tales of Xillia Jude Mathis" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecc3f5c82141f/tales-of-xillia-jude-mathis.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>After months of teasing for <strong>Tales</strong> fans, Bandai Namco may have slipped up and revealed its hand a little too early and shown us what the next <strong>Tales</strong> series remaster is.</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/rumour-tales-of-xillia-leaked-as-the-next-tales-remaster">Push Square</a>, it looks like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/tales_of_xillia">Tales of Xillia</a> will be the next title getting the remaster treatment. Originally released on the PS3 in 2011 and 2013, the game has been stuck on the older console since, so fans should be pretty happy about this</p>
<p>So, how did it slip through the cracks, though? Well, it appears Bandai Namco Europe uploaded a video premiere titled 'Tales of Series News' which was due to go live on 18th August 2025, next Monday.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ryghlp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Only a handful of people seem to have spotted the video before it was taken down — <a href="https://x.com/Lowedeltaa/status/1955925606274658555">Lowedeltaa on X</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/1mpy3ur/the_next_tales_of_event_and_the_next_remaster/">a few people</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/1mpzywl/tales_of_newsxillia_leak_youtube_screenshots/">Tales subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if you've been keeping an eye on the news, this likely isn't surprising, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/rumour-tales-of-xillia-remastered-switch-release-spotted-online">a rating for a Xillia remaster was spotted online last summer</a></p>
<p>But, given the title of the supposed video, there might be more than just a remaster announcement coming. Also, we don't know if the remaster <em>is</em> Xillia — we secretly hope that if it is, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/tales_of_xillia_2">Xillia 2</a> is also part of the package.</p>
<p>We suppose we'll find out on Monday, though Gamescom Opening Night Live is the next day, so we're a little surprised the reveal isn't coming then...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that later this year, it will wind down support for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>on PS4 and Xbox One, meaning that if you want to play the console versions of the game, you'll have to pick up a next-gen machine.</p>

<p>This news comes via an <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en/news/9005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official post</a> on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, in which Krafton confirms that support for the last-gen versions of its popular battle royale shooter will come to an end on November 13th.</p>

<p>Krafton describes this decision as "a necessary step towards aligning&nbsp;<em>PUBG Console&nbsp;</em>with current-gen consoles", and it should also help to "provide...players with a more stable gameplay environment on console", as well as ensuring "a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-explosion.jpg?itok=gi3c0IQe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-explosion.jpg?itok=eVJj5-lM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG</em>'s PS4 and Xbox One versions will soon lose support.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Krafton, once this transition is complete, console players will see "improved visuals and more stable frame rates", and not only that, but ongoing crash issues should be resolved "through memory-related optimizations".</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>is a live-service game, it probably won't shock you to learn that it won't be playable in single-player, either. Once support ends for the PS4 and Xbox One versions, that's it; they won't be playable or downloadable anymore.</p>

<p>If you're on PS5, you'll need to redownload&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s new PS5 version once the transition happens, but if you're on Xbox Series X|S and you already have the game installed, you'll automatically get the new version thanks to Smart Delivery.</p>

<p>Once the transition happens,&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>will support 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps on Xbox Series S, while Series X and PS5 Pro will enjoy dynamic 4K resolution at 60fps. The base PS5 version will also hit 60fps, but at just 1440p resolution.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-swamp.jpg?itok=F7QS0HIo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-swamp.jpg?itok=5Z46HUbz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The newer console versions of&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>should look and play nicer, at least.</figcaption></figure><p>This news follows the announcement that the PC version of&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system" rel="nofollow">is getting new anti-cheat systems</a>, but that probably won't affect console players, since crossplay between console and PC isn't supported.</p>

<p>In any case, you can download and play&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PUBG_BATTLEGROUNDS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5082-CUSA14081_00-PTSBUN0000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pubg-battlegrounds/c0mn5dn8kr3f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game will become unavailable on November 13th.</p>
