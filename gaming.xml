		<p>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine that’s sat in my backlog for years, and following the release and popularity of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a> last year, I thought it high time to delve into the first game and expand my very limited experience of the Warhammer universe. So, how does this 2011 third person hold up nowadays?</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40K Space Marine - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBB66g1PviE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is a prime example of the third person shooters that released during the PS3/Xbox 360 era. It has some big set pieces, lots of areas with obvious cover interconnected by primarily brown environments, and a ton of bloody violence. The game borrowed from its contemporaries, in essence being a Warhammer version of Gears of War. As Captain Titus, you are sent to the Forge world Graia as part of the Vanguard to push back an Ork invasion, and protect its assets. Captain Titus is the embodiment of an Ultramarine, running towards danger with guns blazing and no fear of any potential harm. Okay, it is more of heavy thumping jog due to wearing towering combat armour. Very nice and blue armour.</p>
<p>Space Marine’s story is one of factions vying for control over a powerful resource, each with their own agendas. One side wants to hold power, while another wants to tear everything down and bring about a new order to the galaxy. It is a tale we have seen hundreds of times, and Space Marine follows the well-trodden tropes without deviating all that much. Maybe doing so would have been considered heresy? What does help is Captain Titus, whose character is stoic throughout the story but isn’t afraid to think for himself to get the job done, even if it means interpreting the rules slightly differently to others. One of his battle brothers, Sidonus, understands this while his other, Leandros, still needs to learn that lesson.</p>


<p>The gameplay of Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine does still hold up. The shooting feels decent, even if feedback could have been a bit more impactful, while the melee combat is very satisfying, whether you’re using the chainsword, axe, or the big thunder hammer. What makes all of these satisfying are the enemy hordes you battle. Space Marine sends waves of Orks at you through much of the game, making the action frenetic as you deal with the different enemy types. Swing a sword to cut through them and using a laser rifle to one-shot ranged enemies. The boss fights could have been a bit more entertaining, though. The way the final enemy is set up through the story of Space Marine makes it seem like a big one-on-one fight with him will be the main event of a box office pay per view. Instead, the end boss disappoints by being a QTE event after facing off against waves of his various minions, from weakest to strongest.</p>
<p>What was surprising about Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is that the online multiplayer still works, at least on PC. Though there was a little bit of a wait to fill a lobby, there are people still playing the online of Space Marine, even with the glitzier sequel. More people were in the PvP playlists, with that having the standard modes such as deathmatches and zone captures. The real fun, for me anyway, was the PvE mode where you and up to three others face off against enemy waves, moving through different maps to get to a final objective. This mode also throws quick challenges at you, like killing 20 enemies in 20 seconds or getting a number of headshots. If you want to experience what online multiplayer was like in 2011, then jump on Space Marine as soon as you can.</p>

			<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick provided an interesting reply to an investor's question about Nintendo Switch 2 support during the publisher's Q4 FY 2025 earnings call yesterday. Zelnick outlined that Take-Two is planning record support for a Nintendo console launch (Borderlands 4, Civilization VII, WWE 2K 2025); at the same time, he clarified that the publisher isn't necessarily going to port all of its new games to the platform, highlighting potential opportunities for catalog (old) games.</p>
<p>Here's the quote, transcribed by <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-taketwos-q4-fy2025-revenue-beats-forecast-stock-dips-93CH-4049404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investing.com</a>:</p>
<p><em>You know, we’re launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that’s, I think, a bigger array of releases than we’ve ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform. You know, historically, being a third party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo’s been very forthcoming in addressing that, and we’re stepping up too because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis. We obviously wanna be where the consumers are. But, you know, we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities.</em></p>
<p>It's hard not to imagine he might have been referring to Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar's blockbuster has historically ditched Nintendo platforms, so it wouldn't be that surprising if the same happened with GTA VI. On the other hand, having the biggest game on what analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are describing as the console that will set new sales records</a> would be perfect from the publisher's standpoint.</p>
<p>Besides, the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving powerful enough to run complex games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Star Wars Outlaws, Hogwarts Legacy, Elden Ring, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a> (which is published by Take-Two). Of course, we don't know yet what kind of innovations GTA VI will introduce in terms of AI and physics. They could well be too much to deal with for the Nintendo Switch 2's 8-core ARM Cortex-A78C CPU.</p>
<p>In other news, the Take-Two CEO also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-to-2026-was-important-for-allowing-rockstar-to-seek-perfection-says-take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the GTA VI delay during the earnings call.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Offline Worldwide on iOS Thanks to Apple Blocking Release]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-offline-worldwide-on-ios-thanks-to-apple-blocking-release.1191144/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic says that Apple has blocked the release of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iOS in both the US and the European Union, meaning that nobody with an iPhone or an iPad in those territories can play the game on their devices right now.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923293522234356169" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Epic says it can't release&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iPhone or iPad since Apple has "blocked [its] submission". As such, the game "will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it".</p>

<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is unavailable on both the native iOS App Store in the US and the Apple-specific Epic Games Store in the European Union, so until this mess gets sorted out, it looks like iPhone users won't be dropping into the First Order Base to get murdered within five seconds anytime soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-ios-blocked-apple-epic-player.jpg?itok=1A8YRuN9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-ios-blocked-apple-epic-player.jpg?itok=bSM0EXUL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're out of luck if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iPhone or iPad right now.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic's Tim Sweeney originally announced that he would resubmit&nbsp;<em>Fortnite </em>to the US App Store for Apple's consideration <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1918694390677065882" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in May</a>, using the same Sweden-based account through which the developer submitted&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>to the EU in 2024.</p>

<p>Apple's most recent refusal to admit&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>to the store is the latest point in a very long legal battle, which began back in 2020 when Apple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">first removed</a>&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the App Store over Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">pointing players to its own payment system</a> via the game.</p>

<p>Recently, Apple was slapped with a&nbsp;€500 million fine by the European Commission, which also said that Apple must allow developers to point customers to third-party payment systems rather than using Apple's built-in system, for which the tech company gets a cut of payments.</p>

<p>However, it's worth noting that this decision doesn't necessarily mean Apple must admit&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>to its ecosystem; after all, since iOS is Apple's system, the Cupertino giant has the final say over what it allows onto the platform and what it doesn't allow.</p>




<p>There's no timeline as to when&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will return to the iOS App Store (if, indeed, it ever does), but it seems as though the Android release of the game is unaffected by this battle, so if you're a mobile user, that might be your best bet for now.</p>

<p>Otherwise,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now on...well, on pretty much everything.</p>

                <p>Prior to this month, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick assured investors that Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was on track for a 2025 debut, while also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">acknowledging the possibility of a delay</a>. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">the game was pushed back to a May 2026 release</a> earlier this month. Now, Zelnick has shared his reaction to GTA 6's delay after offering an explanation.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick noted that GTA 6 needed the extra time for the developers to polish the title and turn it into become the game that fans want it to be.</p><p>"As we get closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear," said Zelnick "In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach."</p><p>"While of course, delays pain me--how could they not?--the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection," added Zelnick.</p><p>According to <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two Interactive's investors info sheet</a>, GTA 6 only entered full development around 2020. The document also stated that, “affording Rockstar additional time for such a groundbreaking project is a worthy investment," before adding that GTA 6 is now "the most anticipated entertainment property of all time."</p><p>Considering that the newly released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-hit-almost-a-half-billion-views-right-away/1100-6531396/" data-ref-id="1100-6531396">GTA 6 trailer amassed a half-billion views</a> within the first few days, Take-Two may be right about the game's prerelease demand.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Stellar Blade - PC Features And Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>So what's the cause here? That's currently unclear, but this might be a case that's similar to Helldivers 2. Shortly after the game was released on PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">it became mandatory for players</a> on that platform to create and link a PlayStation Network account to keep playing the game. There was a huge backlash to this move--that was later scrapped--and Helldivers 2 was subsequently unavailable for purchase because of it in many countries at the time.</p><p>While Stellar Blade doesn't require a PSN account to be playable on PC, one of the new costumes being added to the game can only be unlocked when a Steam account is linked to Sony's service. It's also worth noting that PSN isn't available in the list of countries impacted.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496254" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496254"></a><figcaption>The countries where Stellar Blade won't be sold for PC on Steam (via SteamDB)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg"></figure><p>For everyone else looking to pick up the action game when it arrives next month, Stellar Blade will offer quite a few graphical enhancements. Support for upscaling tech like Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3 will be available, and there'll be lots of new content as well.</p><p>A total of 25 new Nano Suits are being added to the game, and if you feel like testing your skills, you can fight Xionn's guardian Mann in the Boss Challenge mode. PS5 owners can also get this content, as it'll be added to Stellar Blade for free in an upcoming update.</p>

            <p>
The slow swell of Nintendo Switch Online's N64 library continues with a brand-new addition for Expansion Pack subscribers: developer Rare's much-loved 1996 fighter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killer-instinct-gold">Killer Instinct Gold</a> is available now in the west, with Japan getting something else entirely.
</p>
<p>
Rare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killer-instinct">Killer Instinct</a> series - something of a response to the hugely popular (and considerably more violent) Mortal Kombat games - debuted in arcades back in 1994, with the series making its home console debut on Super Nintendo  later that year. A sequel, Killer Instinct 2, hit arcades in 1996, and it's this version that later made its way to the N64 under the name Killer Instinct Gold.
</p>
<p>
Killer Instinct Gold offered a bit of a glow-up compared to its console predecessor, replacing the previously 2D backdrops with new-fangled 3D. The pre-rendered characters, though, remained staunchly two dimensional across its 11-strong roster of new and returning fighters, which included the likes of Sabrewulf, Riptor, Galcius, and Spinal. Gold was warmly received at the time, but would mark the start of over a decade-and-a-half of dormancy for the series, which didn't return until 2013's Killer Instinct reboot on Xbox.

<p>
Anyone looking to relive the halcyon days of 1996 now have the option to do so on Switch, as long as they've got themselves a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. Things are a little different for members in Japan, however, where the service's latest N64 addition is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ridge-racer-64">Ridge Racer 64</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ridge-racer-64-is-finally-playable-again-after-its-n64-debut-25-years-ago">arrived in the west back in January this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Killer Instinct Gold and the rest of Nintendo's Switch Online classic games catalogue will also be available to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> owners with an Expansion Pack subscription <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">when the console arrives on 5th June</a>. In addition to the already available NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, N64, and Sega Mega Drive titles, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">Switch 2 also brings access to a range of GameCube classics</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, Soul Calibur 2, and F-Zero GX are all currently confirmed for launch day.

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 is in the works, alongside PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">GameReactor</a>, sources close to Rockstar Games revealed that the studio is working on a port of the excellent open-world game originally released in 2018 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One that could be released as early as this year. Besides working on this port, Rockstar Games is reportedly working on a Red Dead Redemption 2 update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S that will improve graphics and performance. This patch could be released with the Nintendo Switch 2 or later.</p>
<p>While Rockstar Games releasing a Red Dead Redemption 2 current generation upgrade via a free patch doesn't precisely align with how the studio has handled current generation upgrades, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Grand Theft Auto VI having been delayed to 2026</a>, both the developer and Take-Two are likely looking at ways to fill their release schedule for the rest of the year, and releasing new versions of their highly celebrated open-world game would be an excellent way of doing so. Still, without official confirmation, we must take everything above with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about one of the best open-world games ever released by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/classic-rare-fighter-killer-instinct-gold-joins-nintendo-switch-online.1191111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killer-instinct-gold-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>, a classic fighting game from the Nintendo 64 days, is now available via Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack service.</p>

<p>Rare's fighter is the latest N64 game to join the subscription service's lineup, following on from other classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ridge-racer-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow"><em>Ridge Racer 64</em></a>, spooky action-adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow Man</em></a>, and cult classic&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-april-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Iggy's Reckin' Balls</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Unlike some Switch Online N64 releases, it doesn't look like&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold&nbsp;</em>will be packing any extra online features; it'll just be you against the computer, or a friend that's daring enough to test their might against your unbeatable Sabrewulf.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killer-instinct-gold-nintendo-switch-online-glacius-combo.jpg?itok=p9hIQDCO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killer-instinct-gold-nintendo-switch-online-glacius-combo.jpg?itok=OahyuexO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Relive the glory days of N64 fighters with&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>&nbsp;on Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>Originally released in 1996,&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold&nbsp;</em>is a port of the previously arcade-only game&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct 2</em>. It features ten playable characters, three of whom (Kim Wu, Maya, and Tusk) are new additions to the roster.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several characters from the original&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>haven't made it into&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>'s roster, including Chief Thunder, Cinder, and Riptor. All of them would return for 2013's&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>reboot, however, as would every other character from the series up to that point.</p>

<p>Designed as a response to Midway's hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>,&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>features a focus on combo-based gameplay; the infamous "C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER" soundbite comes from the original 1994 release.</p>

<p><i>Killer Instinct Gold&nbsp;</i>largely carries across&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct 2</em>'s gameplay and characters from the original arcade release, but it omits voiceovers and full-motion video sequences thanks to the memory limitations of the N64's cartridges.</p>




<p>To date, 2013's&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>remains the last game in the series, and since developer and custodian Iron Galaxy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">suffered layoffs back in February</a>, I'm not sure another one is on the way anytime soon.</p>

<p>Still, you can content yourself with&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>, which is available now as part of a Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription. It'll also be playable on Nintendo Switch 2 when the console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launches on June 5th</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/667980/doom-the-dark-ages-review-xbox-ps5-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve spent any time on the internet, you may have seen the “what I expected vs. what I got” memes. If I could make one for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>, in my expected column I’d reference the earlier <em>Doom</em> games — <em>Eternal</em> and the 2016 soft reboot of the franchise. But for the “what I got” column, there’d be an unexpected mix. Those earlier <em>Doom</em> games would still be there, as in most respects <em>The Dark Ages</em> is very much like its predecessors. But I’d also throw in <em>Band of Brothers</em>, <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, <em>Pacific Rim</em>, <em>The Necronomicon</em>, and a collection of the best bodice-ripper romance books literature can provide. </p><p>For <em>The Dark Ages</em>, id Software takes the story way back to the early days, to a time before the demons invade Mars and Earth. The Doomguy, known as the Slayer, is a supersoldier enhanced by aliens who have styled themselves as humanity’s gods. When those gods and their human collaborators are besieged by the legions of Hell, the Slayer gets to doing what he does best: ripping and tearing until it is done.</p><p>The Slayer has an arsenal of weapons to aid him in his quest. The series’ time-honored favorites, like the super shotgun, make an appearance. But in this old-timey prequel of sorts, the Slayer has all new weapons to get medieval on demon asses. I’m actually really surprised at how much I enjoyed using every weapon in this game. Typically for games that give you a varied arsenal of guns, only one or two are worth using, as there’s only so many ways a thing you shoot people with is materially different from another thing you shoot people with. </p><p>But each gun in <em>The Dark Ages</em> was designed with a distinct purpose and enough utility to still get the job done outside that purpose. The accelerator breaks energy shields and with upgrades can paralyze enemies. The impaler works as a semiautomatic pistol to mow down swarms of fodder but can also transition into a sniper rifle that shoots bullets the length of railroad spikes. But though I love every gun equally, it’s the Slayer’s shield that makes combat so dang entertaining. </p><p>Using the Slayer’s shield is the most fun I’ve had playing a shooting-focused game because now, instead of shooting bullets, I<em> am</em> the bullet. Using the shield’s charge ability, I can shoot across the battlefield ramming into enemies and turning them into paste. When that ability’s on cooldown, I can also use the shield to parry attacks, reflecting them back where they came for massive damage. Parrying’s useful to break enemy armor and protect yourself and, unlike in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, it doesn’t take an advanced degree in theoretical physics to figure out the timing. </p><p>Between the shield, the Slayer’s melee attack, and all the guns, combat in <em>The Dark Ages</em> feels like entering mini flow states. Every action fits together like a ballet of carnage. Shoot the metal armor to weaken it, throw the shield to destroy it, and then, by the time it’s returned to my hand, the enemy has unleashed a blast I deflect back to kill it. And because combat is so much more involved than point and shoot, I can bear the fact that there’s not a lot of enemy variety or unique boss encounters. </p><p>Another conflict between the “what I expected” and the “what I got” columns is how strangely peaceful and Zen-like playing <em>The Dark Ages</em> is. The levels are large, filled with secrets and collectibles that I enjoy searching for. Completing a level 100 percent doesn’t feel like an exercise in tedium but rather a reward for perseverance and clever puzzle solving, especially for someone like me who is very much not a completionist. </p><p>In addition to the ripping and the tearing, there are other special sections of <em>The Dark Ages</em> in which the Slayer pilots either a big-ass Doomecha fighting enemies Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots style, or a big-ass dragon with flying sections. These moments were a miss for me. Despite the “rule of cool” novelty of the mecha and the dragon, without the variety of the Slayer’s weapons, combat in these sections is boring as — forgive me — hell. All you do in the mecha is walk and punch. All you do with the dragon is fly (poorly) and shoot a cannon (also poorly). They’re certainly cool to look at in cutscenes, but mechanically, I’d rather be back on the ground.</p><p>But my favorite part of this entire game is the story. I know that’s not something you’re supposed to say about <em>Doom</em>. It’s <strong><em>Doom</em></strong>: the story is superfluous to all the demon killing. But thinking about the narrative id laid out, I start giggling and kicking my feet like a blushing schoolgirl, because this Slayer is a lover!</p><p>Just like in the other games, this man cannot be bargained with and he has no moral ambiguity. If you are a demon, you die. If you enable demons, no matter how “good” or “noble” your reasoning is, you die. And he is just so stylish at killing things, inflaming my competency kink.</p><p>But more than that, despite the fact that in previous games the Slayer doesn’t speak outside of pained grunts and his face is covered for most of the game, the way this man emotes belies so much depth. There’s a moment in the middle of one of the dragon sections where, just before he hops back on his loyal steed, he takes a beat to place his hand tenderly on the creature’s neck. But my favorite Slayer moment comes early in the game. He’s being held in stasis by his alien masters as they don’t want to deploy him and thereby draw Hell’s attention. He’s forced to watch as his human allies are overrun, and he is so overcome with rage that he’s able to briefly break the chains that bind him. You could be forgiven for believing the Slayer is driven by the desire to vanquish Hell, but that’s only partly true. In <em>The Dark Ages</em>, he is just as much a lover as he is a fighter, and the hottest thing a man can do is rip and <em>care. </em></p><p><em>The Dark Ages</em> is so good because it brings out the kid in me. Describing it to other people makes me sound like a child trying to explain something that sounds nothing like what you’d expect from a <em>Doom </em>game as I ramble off events with no regard for shaping a coherent story. “And then, a big mancubus appeared, and I parried its blast with my shield and then a bolt of lightning came down from the sky and it killed a bunch of demons. And it was <em>awesome</em>.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 direct-feed footage is now available online, further highlighting how the system may be heavily underestimated.</p>
<p>The new footage, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den Faminico Gamer</a>, provides a new look at the new Switch 2 port of the game launching together with the system next month, highlighting how great the game looks and runs on the system, possibly even better than most expected, further suggesting that the system may be underestimated regarding what it can achieve with the help of tech like NVIDIA DLSS, which the game has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/">confirmed</a> of using.</p>
<p><iframe title="ニンテンドースイッチ2版『サイバーパンク2077』ゲームプレイ映像 ジョイコンを振って刀やマンティスブレードで敵をめった斬りにする「モーション操作」や、直感的にエイムできる「ジャイロ操作」にも対応" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VVHAa4dEbA?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From every showing, it's clear that CD Projekt Red has put some serious effort into the Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 port, ensuring it looks and runs well. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">Earlier this month</a>, studio SVP of Business Jan Rosner revealed that getting the game to run on the system didn't require a lot of effort, but getting it to run well was a challenge. Though some compromises had to be made, they don't impact the game's artistic vision, which definitely looks the case, judging from the new footage. The fact that the entire game is included in the retail edition's cartridge is another sign that CDPR put a lot of thought into the port, as they wanted to achieve a plug-and-play experience that is dear to Nintendo users without requiring any additional downloads.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console releases in North America, Europe and Japan. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.</p>

          <p>When my colleague Kyle Orland submitted <a href="https://kertisjones.itch.io/tetrisweeper"><em>Tetrisweeper</em></a>&nbsp;for a list of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/">Ars' favorite 2024 games not from 2024</a>, I told him, essentially: "Good for you, not for me." I'm a pedestrian <em>Tetris</em> player, at best, so the idea of managing a whole different game mechanic, while trying to clear lines and prevent stack-ups, sounded like taking a standardized test while baking a three-layer cake.</p>
<p>And yet, here I am, sneaking rounds of&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/drop-duchy-f46b7e">Epic</a>, for Windows/Linux via Proton) into lunch breaks, weekend mornings, and other bits of downtime. <em>Drop Duchy</em> is similarly not just a <em>Tetris</em>-esque block-dropper. It also has you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligning terrain types for resources</li>
<li>Placing both your troops and the enemy's</li>
<li>Choosing which cards to upgrade, sell, and bring into battle</li>
<li>Picking between terrain types to leave behind</li>
<li>Upgrading a tech tree with achievements</li>
<li>Picking the sequence of battles for maximum effectiveness</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Drop Duchy</em> is a quirky game, one that hasn't entirely fused together its various influences without some seams showing. But I keep returning to it, even as it beats me to a pulp on Normal mode, based on decisions I made five rounds ago. It feels like a medium-deep board game, played at triple speed, with someone across the table timing you on how fast you arrange your tiles.</p>
<h2>Your standard roguelite deck-builder, <em>Tetris</em> tactics, worker placement game</h2>

    <p><em>Drop Duchy</em> launch trailer.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Allow me to try to describe what is happening in <em>Drop Duchy,&nbsp;</em>ignoring entirely the idea that there is some kind of plot. You start off with three buildings and your enemy's buildings that you must place, mixed into a pile of terrain (plains and forest to start) in <em>Tetris-</em>like shapes. Filling a horizontal line gives you resources (wheat, wood, and stone) from that line but does not clear it.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>If you build up a big area of plains on your board, you can drop your "Farm" piece in the middle, and it converts those plains into richer plains. Put a "Woodcutter" into a bunch of forest, and it harvests that wood and turns it into plains. Set down a "Watchtower," and it recruits some archer units for every plains tile in its vicinity, and even more for richer fields. You could drop a Woodcutter next to a Farm and Watchtower, and it would turn the forests into plains, the Farm would turn the plains into fields, and the Watchtower would pick up more units for all those rich fields.</p>
<p>That kind of multi-effect combo, resulting from one piece you perfectly placed in the nick of time, is what keeps you coming back to <em>Drop Duchy</em>. The bitter losses come from the other side, like realizing you've leaned too heavily into heavy, halberd-wielding units when the enemy has lots of ranged units that are strong against them. Or that feeling, familiar to&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em> vets, that one hasty decision you made 10 rows back has doomed you to the awkward, slanted pile-up you find yourself in now. Except that lines don't clear in&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em>, and the game's boss battles specifically punish you for running out of good places to put things.</p>
<p>There's an upper strategic layer to all the which-square-where action. You choose branching paths on your way to each boss, picking different resources, battles, and trading posts. Every victory has you picking a card for your deck, whether military, production, or, later on, general "technology" gains. You upgrade cards using your gathered resources, try to balance or min-max cards toward certain armies or terrains, and try not to lose any one round by too many soldiers. You have a sort of "overall defense" life meter, and each loss chips away at it. Run out of money to refill it, and that's the game.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>Again: It is not a <em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>clone</h2>


<p><em>Drop Duchy</em> feels, moment to moment, triumphalist and unfair, but that is its intended rogue-ish nature. Where I see issues with the game beyond that is in the little stuff.</p>
<p>The game plays well on a Steam Deck or other handhelds, but if you have any issues with reading small text on a small screen, <em>Drop Duchy&nbsp;</em>is unforgiving. Many of the buildings look very similar, and the icons and text can be quite small. I feel the most for folks with extensive&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>experience and muscle memory.&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em> uses some non-standard pieces, like single, double, and three-square corners. And while line clearing is almost always rewarded, it can also work against you, like if an enemy's fort fits a slot, but also grants it lots of troops from the surrounding terrain.</p>
<p><em>Drop Duchy&nbsp;</em>can sometimes feel unbalanced, sometimes a bit unfair. Its bosses will typically require multiple runs before you figure out the right multi-round strategies. The game's many, many mechanics make this a title where I wouldn't blame someone for running the Tutorial round more than once.</p>
<p>But, like golf, home repair, or setting up a server, the few times you get a round, or just a line, perfectly right can erase all the hard lessons you had to endure before. I keep finding things in <em>Drop Duchy</em> that seem impossible to overcome, and then I come right back and try it a different way. I think this title will get a few balance fixes, but even before those, it's a good run.</p>

            <p>
Bungie has admitted that an external artist's work has been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent. 
</p>
<p>
The issue came to light yesterday following recent playable alpha tests of Marathon, from which an artist recognised their designs had been used.
</p>
<p>
"The Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017," artist <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Fern Hook wrote on social media</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language i have refined for the last decade, but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution."

<p>
Responding via its less-visible <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">Marathon Dev Team social media account</a>, Bungie wrote that it had "immediately investigated" Hook's claim and found that, yes, a former artist at the company had swiped the designs.
</p>
<p>
"This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred," Bungie wrote. "We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to 
[Hook]  to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.
</p>
<p>
"As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission," Bungie continued, stating - if it needed to be said - that the developer does not endorse plagiarism. 
</p>
<p>
"To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions," the publisher concluded.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Bungie has faced claims of using artists' work without permission - with multiple instances coming to light regarding designs for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.

"I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email," Hook concluded.

			<p>Hideo Kojima doesn't plan on stopping making video games even after he has passed away, as he will leave behind a USB stick with game ideas.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/">VGC</a>, the legendary game designer commented on his future as a creative, revealing that an unspecified illness he suffered during the pandemic, an eye operation and people around him passing away made him realize he was getting old, and wouldn't have all the time in the world to continue making games. This not only made him reevaluate his priorities, making him set aside the idea of directing a movie, but also convinced him to leave a USB stick with his ideas as some sort of will to Kojima Productions, which could continue making games even after he is gone, and not just stick to managing the IPs that have been created, including Physint, which is being made because Kojima-san realized a lot of people want him to make something like the Metal Gear series.</p>
<p>In the latest issue of Edge Magazine, Hideo Kojima also commented on his next game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which is set to become more popular than its predecessor, going by the positive reception it is receiving in test reviews. The legendary game designer, however, is not entirely happy with this, as he would have liked the game to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">more controversial</a>, not desiring to make games with mass market appeal.</p>
<p>Though it will likely be more popular than its predecessor, there's no doubt Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be full of those trademark Hideo Kojima moments that make his games so unique. Thankfully, it won't be long until we can experience them ourselves, as the game launches on June 26th on PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/labyrinth-of-the-demon-king">Labyrinth Of The Demon King</a> is the concentrated awfulness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-dark-descent">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> thrown into a toilet bowl with the stamina-based combat of From Software's old King's Field <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. Released this week, it is squalid, lumbering, vicious, desperate and untrustworthy. 
</p>
<p>
The setting is "mythical feudal Japan" - a time of devilry, manual savepoints, and dither filters. The story objective is to track down and slay the yokai boss who led your lord into an ambush. I do not greatly rate my chances. Currently, I am exploring a house full of bloated, whispering fungus and screechy little filthbastards with abbreviated limbs. The filthbastards all want to butcher me but they are no less keen to murder each other. As far as they're concerned, I am just another filthbastard among many.

<p>
My equipment consists of a bottle of sake, some dirty bandages that promise to infect my wounds, and a broken katana that looks like a stick of lichen. My goal right now is to free a self-described blacksmith from the pantry, in the hopes that they will repair my sword. The key is apparently in the possession of a "cat" on the second floor. I do not think the cat will be a nice cat. Usefully, it looks like I can hide in some of the cupboards hereabouts. 
</p>
<p>
There are also crates to smash, some of which harbour cockroaches that must be stamped on before they deduct an infuriating point or two of health. Kicking and stamping are, so far, my favourite activities in Labyrinth Of The Demon King. You can boot enemies to break their guards and avoid being countered, though unhelpfully, this also knocks them out of range of that broken katana. Ah, I really need that blacksmith. I guess there's nothing for it but to investigate the cat. I go looking for the stairs to the second floor and find my way to the basement entrance instead. Haha. I'm not going down there. Fuck no. Nope. No.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of PS1-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> games on the shop, but so far, Labyrinth Of The Demon King outshines them all, which is to say that there is nothing remotely shiny about it whatsoever. Playing the game is like putting your eye to a plughole. I can't quite dissect what it's doing, but I'm not sure I've played a more convincing encapsulation of the ambience of early Silent Hill. It's in the dithering, of course, but also, the cutscene length and choice of camera angle, the rattling, rolling soundscape, the profusion of locked doors, the presentation of floor maps, and the appallingly sluggish movement.
</p>
<p>
I likes it, in short. There is still a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804010/Labyrinth_Of_The_Demon_King/">Steam</a>, but be warned that save progress doesn't carry over to the full thing, and you will definitely not appreciate having to retrace your steps.

Not only did Kojima comment on time-related mechanics he has implemented in past games, but he also revealed concepts that he hasn’t used yet, including an idea he scrapped from the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ve thought about having characters’ hair grow in games,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRQeB2a-RSs&amp;t=2191s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kojima said in the most recent broadcast of his Japanese radio podcast KOJI10</a>. “Originally in Death Stranding 2, I was going to have Sam’s beard gradually grow out over time, and the player would have to shave it. If they didn’t, Sam would end up looking unkempt,” he explained. “However, as Norman Reedus is a big star, I didn’t want to make him look uncool!” Despite this, the director said it was still something he might add to another game one day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima also revealed three game concepts that have the passing of time in real life as a major mechanic. The first is a kind of game of life: “It starts out with the player being born, you’re a child and then gradually over time you become an adult. In the game, you fight various enemies. Like with the previous example (MGS3’s The End), if you keep playing the game, you will become a 70 or 80-year-old man. However, at this age you will be weaker, your eyesight will worsen. When you are a teenager you’ll be able to run faster but by the time you reach 60 you’ll slow down a bit,” Kojima explained, revealing that although your character will be in better physical condition when they are younger, they will have more knowledge and experience when they are older. This aging would affect your strategy as to how you deal with enemies. “But no-one would buy it!” Kojima added, however the other people on the podcast expressed enthusiasm about playing such a “Kojima-like game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another idea he mentioned is a game where you are creating something that takes time to mature, such as wine or cheese. This would require the player to continue gradually playing over a long period of time, and sounds like it would work as a background/idle game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, Kojima proposed a “forgetting game” that the player would have to “play through quickly.” In this concept, the main character gradually forgets important information and abilities if you take too long a break from the game. For example, if you don’t play every day, the main character will gradually forget things such as “how to fire their gun or what their job is.” This forgetfulness builds up until finally the player is unable to move. “Players would have to take a week off work or school to play it,” Kojima laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hugely busy time for Kojima and his studio, Kojima Productions (now we know why!). As well as Death Stranding 2, Kojima is working on a live-action <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/death-stranding">Death Stranding film</a> with A24, the studio behind Academy Award winning films such as Everything Everywhere All At Once. He's also working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">OD</a> for Xbox Game Studios, and video game and movie hybrid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a> for Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are no release dates for OD or Physint. Indeed, in January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-xbox-and-sony-games-affected-by-actors-strike">Kojima revealed the ongoing video game actors strike had affected production on both titles</a>, so it may be some time before we hear or see more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Apple case that required Apple to enable developers to offer their customers alternative ways to make purchases outside apps.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/tim-sweeney-1746092302375-1747385910840.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Epic's Tim Sweeney is determined to defeat Apple and Google, however long it takes. Photo by SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-epic-can-afford-to-keep-spending-billions-fighting-apple-and-google-for-the-future-of-fortnite-on-mobile-for-decades-to-come"><u>IGN reported on how Sweeney had spent billions of dollars fighting Apple and Google over the way the companies run their app stores</u></a>. Sweeney told IGN at the time that he considered it a long-term investment in Epic and Fortnite’s future, insisting Epic could afford to keep up the fight for decades to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweeney’s ongoing battle to get Fortnite back on iPhones and Android phones while avoiding paying store fees is well-documented. The gist is this: Epic doesn’t want to pay the now standard 30% store fees on revenue made on mobile games. Instead, it wants to run the likes of Fortnite through its own mobile store, the Epic Games Store, without Apple and Google getting in the way and gobbling up its profit. Back in 2020, this dispute ended up with Fortnite blocked from release on iOS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Sweeney’s tweet it was expected that Fortnite would return to iOS, but so far… nothing. And now, Epic has issued a statement to IGN providing an update:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on this statement, Fortnite is not only blocked from the U.S. App Store, but Fortnite on iOS is offline worldwide. That’s a terrible situation for Epic, which has already lost out on billions of dollars of revenue in the five years since Fortnite was booted off iPhones. Now, Tim Sweeney is tweeting at Apple boss Tim Cook to try to get him to change his mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi Tim. How about if you let our mutual customers access Fortnite? Just a thought.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi Tim. How about if you let our mutual customers access Fortnite? Just a thought.</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923133214748471391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">After the court ruling, Apple was referred to federal prosecutors for violating the U.S. court order. "Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated," U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said. "This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Judge referred Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, vice president of finance, to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation into their conduct in the case. Roman gave testimony about the steps Apple took to comply with her injunction that was "replete with misdirection and outright lies," the judge wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement issued at the time, Apple said: "we strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal." Last week, Apple asked the U.S. appeals court to pause the ruling in the Epic Games case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Antireal even<a href="https://x.com/solarphy/status/1923081236567728236" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> confirms</a> that Cross has followed their account "for a few years."</p><p>Bungie responded via its own <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marathon dev team </a>X account to say that it "immediately investigated" the concerns, and "confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game." It goes on to state that the issue was "unknown" to the existing art team, and it is reviewing how the oversight happened.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496213" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496213"></a><figcaption>Comparisons between Antireal's art and in-game screenshots from Marathon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>Bungie also says it reached out to Antireal to discuss the matter. "[We] are committed to do right by the artist," it confirms. "As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission." The developer also confirms that to prevent "similar issues" happening again, it will conduct a "thorough review" of game assets, with particular emphasis on the former artist responsible for the issue.</p><p>However, it's not the first time Bungie has been caught using assets without permission, as X user <a href="https://x.com/GaminCounselor/status/1923219998379544675" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GaminCounselor</a> points out. In 2021, the Witch Queen DLC trailer featured fan art of Xivu Arath without credit. In 2023, a Destiny 2 cutscene used near-identical fan art without permission. In 2024, the Ace of Spades NERF gun merchandise appeared to copy a fan-created design. In all cases Bungie reached out to the artists to apologize, credit, or compensate them--but four occurrences of art theft in as many years raises questions about Bungie's internal policies when it comes to these matters.</p><p>Bungie plans to host <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/marathonthegame" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Marathon stream</a> later today (May 16) at 1PM PT / 6PM ET. It's unlikely that it will address the asset theft during the stream, but given the interactive nature of Twitch, viewers may well have comment to pass. Marathon is set for release on September 23, and while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/" data-ref-id="1100-6530835">it won't be "full price,"</a> Bungie says it will be "a premium title."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> will release on PC on 11th June, but its availability on Steam has been blocked in over 120 countries, surprising even the game's developer.</p>
<p>Shift Up shared news of the release <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923048769245020481">on social media</a>, but a number of fans responded with Steam screenshots showing the game is unavailable in their region. Shift Up responded to confirm the PC version does not require a PSN account and appeared surprised in the replies at the games unavailability.</p>
<p>Checking <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1294088/info/">SteamDB</a>, it appears Stellar Blade has been restricted in over 120 countries. Most of these are where Sony's PSN is unavailable.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement, which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">company quickly u-turned its decision</a> following the backlash.</p>
<p>It would appear Stellar Blade is experiencing a similar issue, although Shift Up has stated a PSN account is not required. However, a free bonus costume will be offered when a PSN account is linked to Steam.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sony for clarification.</p>
<p>The Steam listing does state that Denuvo has been incorporated, much to the annoyance of some fans.</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-out-on-pc-next-month-according-to-leaked-trailer">Stellar Blade's PC release date leaked earlier in the week</a>, but has now been confirmed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/stellar-blade-launches-june-11-on-pc-specs-and-features-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>. What's more, Sony has confirmed its additional content will also be available on PS5 as a free update.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s already a bit of a winner, but Obsidian Entertainment has pledged to make its acclaimed RPG even better over the remainder of 2025. As per the studio's latest development roadmap, a new game plus, photo mode, and more are all on the horizon, and that's alongside the additions now available in its newly-released 1.4 update.
</p>
<p>
Avowed's 1.4 patch is available now for PC and Xbox Series X/S, introducing a range of tweaks and improvements. Top of the list is a new Arachnophobia safe mode, for players wanting to experience the game without the creeping threat of spindly legs and eight piercing eyes. This option can be switched on via the accessibility menu and replaces spider enemies with round, floating - and delightfully rainbow-hued - orbs.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
That's alongside a range of quality of life improvements including mouse and keyboard support for Xbox, additional gold and crafting materials, and unique gear improvements. Obsidian has also highlighted a number of changes introduced based on community feedback: critters can now be defeated, with a chance they'll drop loot; time can be advanced by waiting at the Party Camp; new optional settings enable players to view chests on the minimap or cancel Bow and Arquebus power attacks; Soul Pads now dispel illusions, and there are fog of war improvements too. Full <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-14-notes/">patch notes are available on Obsidian's forum</a>. 
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
So that's that for update 1.4, but Obisidian has also now confirmed <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/1-4-update">more's on the way as 2025 continues</a>. The studio has so far outlined two additional updates for the year, one coming this summer and another this "fall". Avowed's summer update will, for instance, include cooking and crafting improvements, new NPC abilities and behaviours, new active and passive abilities, new unique weapons and armour, plus custom map markers.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the nights start drawing in and the scent of autumn fills the air, Avowed players can look forward to some pretty significant new additions. A new game plus mode is top of the list, followed by a photo mode, and a new weapon type. Obsidian is also teasing new character presets, more Godlike feature presets, and the ability to change appearance in-world.
</p>
<p>
"We also want to acknowledge our players in Korea, Japan, and French-speaking regions," the studio adds in its latest blog post. "We know how important it is to experience a game in your preferred language, and we are actively working on localised versions for Korean and Japanese, along with ongoing improvements for French. We're committed to delivering these updates as soon as they are ready, and we deeply appreciate your patience and support as we make sure they meet the quality you deserve."
</p>

<p>
It's a good time for Avowed fans, then, as Obsidian continues to finesse its already excellent fantasy RPG. "Avowed has been more generous than I thought it would be - in length, in heart, in depth," Robert Purchase wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a> earlier this year, "and it never loses sight of being a game, of being an adventure, of taking you places you would never normally go, or of simply providing a few dozen hours of unabashed escapism. I think it's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."

		<p>With Bungie building up to the launch of their new extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, the studio has been accused of plagiarising art for their game, with examples found within videos and screenshots of the game’s alpha build. Bungie has responded to these accusations and put the blame on a former artist, pledging to perform a review of in-game assets and to implement stricter checks on contributions going forward.</p>
<p>Digital artist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antire.al/post/3lpa4gamtzs2l">Antireal took to social media</a> to highlight that their work was being lifted by Bungie yesterday, higlighting some key examples where glyphs and sections of posters created in 2017 were being used as decals and textures in Marathon.</p>

<p>In response, Bungie used their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonteam.bungie.net/post/3lpb36jqb5c22">@MarathonDevTeam accounts</a> (their account with 10,300 followers on Twitter, instead of 117,700 for @MarathonTheGame or 2.8 million for @Bungie) to issue the following statement:</p>
<p><em>“We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game</em>.</p>

<p><em>“This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to @4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist. As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</em></p>
<p><em>“To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.</em></p>
<p><em>“We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</em></p>
<p>We hope that financial renumeration and credit is on the table as a part of “doing right by them”.</p>
<p>While plagiarism is a massive no-no, taking inspiration and copying idea is pretty much inevitable. It is fair to say, of course, that art is constantly evolving and drawing upon previous work for inspiration. You could just as easily draw a line back to the Wipeout franchise for the style of their glyphs and general designs, while <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-art-style-mirrors-edge-ghost-in-the-shell/">Marathon Art Director Joseph Cross has publicly noted Mirror’s Edge, Ghost in the Shell and others as inspirations</a>.</p>
<p>All of this is deeply disappointing as Bungie has been caught doing similar things in the past. In 2021 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/pvu64p/bungie_accidentally_used_someones_fan_art_of_xivu/">Bungie used fan art in a Destiny 2 trailer</a>, and then for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/14evilb/bungie_stole_someones_art_for_the_new_cutscene/">another Destiny 2 cutscene in 2023</a>, and then ended up <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-to-compensate-artist-for-destiny-2-nerf-blaster-art/">compensating an artist after using their work for the physical Destiny 2 Nerf Blaster</a>.</p>

			<p>According to insider Dusk Golem, who is often well-informed about CAPCOM's roadmap, Resident Evil 9 should still be planned for a 2025 reveal and subsequent 2026 launch. Here's what the leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1922384237392523592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1922384237392523592%7Ctwgr%5E82e2561ec4f34e05178b2da1d63217fb52be56fe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Frumour-resident-evil-9-will-be-announced-this-year-1544383%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>
<p><em>It's almost 100% for sure being revealed this year and releasing next year. Doubt they'll delay more. The question comes if its being revealed this summer or at TGA for example this year, &amp; if its releasing this fiscal year (ending March 31st, 2026) or next fiscal year late 2026.</em></p>
<p>Dusk Golem previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-signapore-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Resident Evil 9 would be set on a Singapore-inspired island, more specifically in a rural town. The rural town setting was already explored in Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Village, although of course, those took place in Spain and Romania, respectively. The Southeast Asian setting alone should provide some freshness.</p>
<p>Last year, Dusk Golem also <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that both Resident Evil 9 and Monster Hunter Wilds would be open world games. The latter was released in late February and was indeed an open world, so the insider was probably right about the next Resident Evil, too.</p>
<p>More recently, Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> why the new game is taking a long time. CAPCOM is reportedly reinventing the series and trying new things, much like it did with Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil VII. Fans shouldn't expect it to play like Resident Evil Village. Whether that means a return to third-person view remains to be seen.</p>
<p>When it comes to the reveal, there are a number of options for the publisher, from the Summer Game Fest taking place next month to Gamescom in August and then finally Tokyo Game Show in September. Of course, it's also possible for CAPCOM to play coy until The Game Awards in December, but that would likely mean a release window in the latter half of 2026.</p>
