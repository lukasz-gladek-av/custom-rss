            <p>Last night, Microsoft unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">three new Xbox consoles</a> set to hit the market. However, despite previous rumours that such a platform was in development, there was no word on any handheld Xbox gaming device.</p>
<p>Following the show, Phil Spencer sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto">IGN</a>, where he was asked specifically about an Xbox handheld device, and the company's mantra of 'going where the players are'. And, despite no Xbox handheld device being officially confirmed (nor denied), Spencer agreed: "I think we should have a handheld".</p>

<p>Said Spencer: "The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome, and the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about. Today was about the games... but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can't wait to bring it to you."</p>
<p>When further asked, all very hypothetically, whether any future handheld Xbox console would be more akin to a Steam Deck that could be played offline, or a cloud-based piece of kit, Spencer said: "I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p>
<p>It feels like Spencer has all but confirmed a handheld Xbox gaming device is on the cards, and it will support offline play. The idea of an Xbox handheld is nothing new. Back in 2017, Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-xbox-handheld-was-designed-in-the-past-says-phi/1100-6449311/">Microsoft had "roughly designed an Xbox handheld"</a> in the past. Meanwhile, the Xbox exec has been spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1753539464071094493">interacting with social media posts about handheld devices</a> as recently as this year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during his conversation with IGN, Spencer addressed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-acknowledges-hard-decisions-to-close-studios-in-first-public-comment">closure of Tango Gameworks earlier this year</a>, and the decision to bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox and PC</a>.</p>

Xbox boss Phil Spencer has discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hi-fi-rush-on-ps5-and-the-xbox-multi-platform-story-so-far">the company's recent  steps into multiplatform publishing</a> - and confirmed there's more to come.
</p>
<p>
Speaking at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-briefly-explains-the-decision-to-bring-doom-the-dark-ages-to-playstation-5-ign-live-2024">IGN Live</a> just hours after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">Xbox confirmed another big title - Doom: The Dark Ages - would launch on PlayStation 5</a> as well as PC and Xbox Series X/S, Spencer was clear that Xbox's multiplatform plans were here to stay. 
</p>
<p>
"You're going to see more of our games on more platforms," Spencer said. "And we just see that as a benefit to the franchises we're building. And we see that from the players, that love to be able to play."

<p>
On Doom: The Dark Ages specifically, Spencer said the decision to launch id Software's shooter on PS5 came from id Software itself.
</p>
<p>
"Doom is definitely one of those franchises that has a history of so many platforms," Spencer continued. "It's a franchise that I think everyone deserves to play. 
</p>
<p>
"When I was in a meeting with Marty [Stratton, id Software studio director] a couple years ago, I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sell it on all platforms. Simple as that."
</p>
<p>Exactly which other Xbox games past and future might also launch on PlayStation - or Nintendo - platforms was not discussed, however.</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the same interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-acknowledges-hard-decisions-to-close-studios-in-first-public-comment">Spencer also finally addressed the recent studio closures within Microsoft</a>, which saw Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall studio Arkane Austin close their doors, among others.

            <p>
Xbox boss Phil Spencer has commented publicly for the first time on recent Microsoft studio closures, stating he has to "run a sustainable business inside the company and grow".
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Xbox made the shock decision to close a number of Bethesda studios</a>, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin.
</p>
<p>
Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">IGN</a>, Spencer has finally addressed the closures.

<p>
"The closure of any team is hard obviously on the individuals there, hard on the team," he said. "I haven't been talking publicly about this, because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals. It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them, and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we're doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR. It's about those teams.
</p>
<p>
"In the end, I've said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make.
</p>
<p>
"We will continue to go forward. We will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox and build the best business we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did."
</p>
<p>
Spencer's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-president-responds-to-studio-closures-as-commitment-to-make-sure-that-the-business-is-healthy-for-the-long-term">echo those of Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, who was interviewed shortly after the closures were announced.
</p>
<p>
"It's always extraordinarily hard when you have to make decisions like that," Bond said. "When we looked at those fundamental [industry] trends we feel a deep responsibility to ensure that the games we make, the devices we build, the services that we offer are there through moments. Even when the industry isn't growing, when you're through a time of transition.
</p>
<p>
"The news we announced earlier in the week is an outcome of that, in our commitment to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term."
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">studio closures were met with widespread criticism</a> from across the industry, especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-potential-new-dishonored-were-reportedly-being-pitched-by-now-closed-xbox-studios">both Tango and Arkane Austin were reportedly set to work on new games</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft laid off 1900 people across its video game teams</a>. This year alone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people have been laid off across the video game industry</a>, with Microsoft being the biggest contributor.

</p>
<p>The interview follows last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">Xbox Games Showcase - here's everything that was shown</a>.</p>

            <p>We continue to rummage through the debris caused by the horrendous pile-up of summer video game announcements. Among the wreckage, a release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>, the funny strategy game in which you play a ragtag crew of uniformed magic-zappers clearing enemies in confined spaces. It's not XCOM, but it is XCOM-ing soon. That's about as good a joke as I can muster on a Monday morning. Don't worry, there are funnier ones in the trailer below.</p>

<p>As the tray-tray reveals, the upcoming release date is August 22nd, and it was announced as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/X8trymrr_Fc?feature=shared&amp;t=9716">yesterday's PC Gaming Show</a>, the festival of frolics put together by cheery RPS fan zine PC Gamer. Unfortunately, they used the wrong version of the game's trailer and mistakenly announced the release date as two days earlier than it really is. Never mind, we know the real date now. </p>
<p>Mistakes happen. In fact, Tactical Breach Wizards is made by Suspicious Developments, aka Tom Francis, the creator of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gunpoint">Gunpoint</a>. "Mistakes happen" could be the generalised design philosophy of Tom's games. Or "systemic silliness" if you want to get all fancy schmancy. Wizards looks to be following that trend, with funny dialogue and colourful characters, at least judging by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tactical-breach-wizards-is-refreshingly-unlike-xcom-despite-wearing-the-same-tactical-underwear">what Nic has seen in the game's Next Fest demo</a>.</p>
<p>"You know you’re in for a cracking time when, alongside scores for speed and efficiency, the results screen bookending each room tallies up your total, and I quote, defenestrations," he wrote. "These compact room-levels are effectively just window delivery systems."</p>
<p>The next question is: if you throw an enemy back through the broken window, is that a "<em>re</em>fenestration"? I cannot be the first to have thought of this gag. I probably heard it somewhere years ago. Probably a Tom Francis game.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Tom Francis is a former PC Gamer journalist who has also written for RPS in the past.</em> </p>

        <p>Microsoft Gaming boss said "now is the time for us to focus" but adds "we're doing the right thing" for those affected</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Microsoft's Phil Spencer has addressed the backlash to Xbox's recent studio closures, emphasising that there were "hard decisions" that needed to be made "to run a sustainable business."</p>
<p>Phil Spencer was interviewed on stage during IGN Live in Los Angeles on Sunday, where he was asked about Xbox's decision last month to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">close four ZeniMax-owned studios</a>, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush creator Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>According to a write-up on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">IGN</a>, Spencer said: "The closure of any team is hard obviously on the individuals there, hard on the team. I haven't been talking publicly about this, because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals.</p>
<p>"It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them, and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we're doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR. It's about those teams.</p>
<p>"In the end, I've said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make.</p>
<p>"We will continue to go forward. We will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox and build the best business we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did."</p>
<p>Spencer's comments echo <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-president-our-commitment-is-to-make-sure-that-the-business-is-healthy-for-the-long-term">those of Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, who said in the days following the studio closures that the platform holder's committent is to "[making] sure that the business is healthy for the long term."</p>
<p>The remaining staff at ZeniMax's studios are <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-staff-now-included-in-microsoft-and-cwas-labour-neutrality-agreement">now covered by Microsoft's labour neutrality agreement with US union Communication Workers of America</a>, meaning the platform holder is legally bound to take a neutral approach to the unionisation of its staff.</p>
<p>The IGN account on X (formerly Twitter) also <a href="https://x.com/IGN/status/1799934935685554406">posted highlights</a> from Spencer's interview, including his response to rumours that Xbox is working on a Steam Deck-like handheld.</p>
<p>"I don't want to say anything, but the future for us in hardware is pretty awesome," he said. "Today was about the games, but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform."</p>
<p>When asked, if an Xbox handheld did exist, whether it would be playable without an internet connections, Spencer said: "I think the ability to play a game locally is very important."</p>

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will require your PC or console to be connected to the internet at all times to use texture streaming, including when you’re playing the game’s Campaign mode which doesn’t feature any multiplayer elements. </p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">This was confirmed on the official Activision website, with the section about the decision reading: “To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, <em>Black Ops 6</em> will use texture streaming across all game modes. This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign.”</p> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">This means that if your internet goes down, or you simply don’t have a connection at any time, you won’t be able to play <em>Black Ops 6</em>, even though the Campaign doesn’t feature multiplayer.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>You’ll not see any of <em>Black Ops 6</em>‘s game modes without an internet connection. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true">Texture streaming is a tool used in <em>Call of Duty</em> to provide extra detail and quality to the graphics of your game while attempting to keep the game’s file size as small as possible. Instead of bundling these graphics into the file to be installed on your computer, on-demand texture streaming downloads them via the internet while you’re playing. </p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">Activision developed it to “reduce the game’s overall package size by removing certain textures rarely used or encountered by players. If players encounter an Operator or Weapon that uses a high-resolution texture, it will be streamed to the PC [or console’s] cache as needed.”</p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">While this is massive for keeping our hard drives from filling up, it does mean that we’ll never be able to play the game without an internet connection. However, this trade-off is worth it for many players, and I’d be inclined to agree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-june-update-improves-melee-adds-bounty-hunting-features-and-paid-dlc-missions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Right in the middle of the Xbox Game Showcase 2024, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> not only the first trailer for the Shattered Space expansion but also the announcement that <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5fJOins2DKdriTNVBvBjdR/starfield-update-1-12-30-june-9-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Starfield update</a> had been released.</p>
<p>Following the showcase, Bethesda released a deep-dive video in which the game's developers unveiled the new features and content. One of the big changes is that melee weapons will finally have new tiers, providing increasing damage stats. Moreover, melee weapons will be available for improvement through the crafting system. Ammunition for ranged weapons can finally be crafted, too, after many requests from the community.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a bounty hunting scanner system has been added to the game, allowing players to scan non-player characters (NPCs) and check if they are wanted and, if so, for which felony. You will then have the chance to resolve the situation peacefully - or not. This ties into the new Tracking Alliance mission system, which features a free new mission where players are welcomed into this faction after a trial run of apprehending a thief of spaceships. Subsequent Tracking Alliance missions will be paid, though. The first one, called The Vulture, is already available for purchase for 1000 Premium Credits ($9.99). In this mission, players must track down a former sniper of the First Cavalry gone rogue. The good news is that owners of Starfield Premium Edition are given a complimentary 1000 Premium Credits, so they can pick up that mission right away if they wish.</p>

<p>The latter half of the deep dive video discusses Creations, the platform that debuted on Skyrim in late 2023. This features both Bethesda-made additional content and user-made content, both free and premium. Players can already find new quests, luxury homes, suits, modules, and even a ramen stand.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Starfield-Creations-Menu-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Several Verified Creators have already announced future plans to make new missions, additional companions, new weapons (possibly with multi-firing mode), and more. Of course, anyone can make Starfield content now with the Creation Kit available for download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam.</a></p>

            <p>"Deus Ex but tiny and hilarious" is how I pitch the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/streets-of-rogue">Streets of Rogue</a> to people in elevators. Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/streets-of-rogue-2">Streets of Rogue 2</a> is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.</p>

<p>Did you catch the guy doing a drive-by shooting from the back of a bear? This is the sort of delightful tomfoolery we can expect of developer Matt Dabrowski, who started making the roguelike sequel partly because adding more and more stuff to the previous game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-creator-wants-to-ramp-up-the-carnage-with-a-sequel">starting to break things</a>. Here the freedom to go wild is expanded. You'll be able to build stuff and farm a little cabbage patch, for example. Also, it looks like lots of silly, toy-like vehicles are planned.</p>
<p>"Cruise the highways in style with souped-out luxury cars or goof around in high-speed boat races," says this blood-caked press release. "Travel through a massive procedurally generated map, always changing with countless surprises..." It makes sense that the maps will be bigger than before. I imagine you'll need the space for all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-co-op-cocktails-for-total-carnage-in-streets-of-rogue">zombies you are going to unleash</a>. But the goal is still roughly the same as the first game - take down the corrupt President at the top of it all.</p>
<p>You see, in the first Streets of Rogue you could play as an experimental gorilla and beat a bunch of scientists to death to free your gorilla friends from their cage. You could be a dirty cop and arrest innocent civilians for kicks. You could be a vampire, a shapeshifter, an investment banker with a furious cocaine habit. But you were supposed to be climbing the floors of a towering megacity to face the mayor. I never did hit that endgame, because I was having too good a time elsewhere. Once in a while I'd get a couple of floors further but, inevitably, I'd end up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-hacking-games">hacking</a> ATMs and annoying the police or accidentally gassing all my friends in co-op. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-review">the best kind of bedlam</a>. </p>

		<p>Ancient Forge has unveiled its latest game, a hotel management simulator that allows players to construct and manage a hotel serving guests from across the galaxy. Hotel Galactic will encompass all aspects of hotel management, including construction, room upgrades, food cultivation, dealing with upset guests, and keeping the guests entertained.</p>
<p><iframe title="HOTEL GALACTIC - WORLD ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5PjZNMq6Do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p dir="ltr"><em>“Hotel Galactic&nbsp;is a massive step forward for all of us at Ancient Forge,”</em> said Maksymilian Strezelecki, Vice President and Technical Director.<em> “It’s an idea that had been percolating for a couple of years in pre-production, as we took our time to make sure the design and all its constituent parts meshed well to create this beautiful, nostalgic world. The technical demands were substantial, but the end result is a dynamic, immersive experience that I’m proud to share.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Hotel Galactic&nbsp;is the project that utilizes everything we’ve learned in the last ten years or so,”</em> said Dushan Chaciej, CEO and Creative Director at Ancient Forge. <em>“We aimed to create a wholesome and engaging experience for players that love to watch their simulated little dudes end up in all kinds of weird situations. Personally, I can’t wait to see what the world thinks of what we’ve been working on for the past three years.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">As the hotel proprietor, managing the entirety of Hotel Galactic single-handedly is not something you can, so assembling a team is essential. The staff will be responsible for catering to every guest’s needs and ensuring the hotel remains clean to maintain its reputation. While the staff take care of things, players will be able to explore an underground system, grow plants, and raise livestock.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hotel Galactic has been confirmed for PC, PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, and the Switch, but a release date is to be announced. Additionally, Ancient Forge will be running a Kickstarter from July 9th to July 30th, with each milestone allowing the development team to add new features. Those who back the Kickstarter will have the chance to win &nbsp;to win exclusive add-ons and assets, as well as take part in an alpha play test.</p>

Earlier this year he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073723/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-hardware-phil-spencer-handheld">said he was “a big fan of handhelds,”</a> after liking posts on X that mention the possibility of this new hardware. Now, in an interview with <em>IGN</em> Spencer says “I think we should have a handheld, too.”</p><p>It’s the biggest hint yet that Microsoft is working on an Xbox handheld, something that’s been long-rumored. “The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome. The work that the team is doing around different form factors and different ways to play, I’m incredibly excited about,” said Spencer. “Today was about the games... but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform.”</p><p>Pressed on whether an Xbox handheld would stream games or play them locally, Spencer dropped a further hint that Microsoft is looking at a true handheld gaming device rather than something like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a>. “I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck. I think being able to play games locally is really important,” said Spencer.</p><p>Earlier this year Spencer talked about wanting a compact Xbox mode on a handheld gaming PC. “I want to be able to boot into the Xbox app in a full screen, but in a compact mode,” said Spencer in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview"><em>Polygon&nbsp;</em>interview</a>. “Like I want it to feel like the dash of my Xbox when I turn on the television. [Except I want it] on those devices.”</p><p>I suspect what Microsoft is working on is an Xbox handheld that’s Windows-based, but that has the ability to run Xbox games and the full Xbox dashboard. On&nbsp;<em>The Vergecast </em>earlier this year, <a href="https://t.co/ItmeVS36Wa">I discussed</a>&nbsp;my ideal for an Xbox handheld. It would run Windows at its core but never expose this to you so it looks and feels like an Xbox console, but if you want to run Steam games or Xbox games, you can.</p><p>That would require Microsoft to pull off merging Xbox and Windows together in a way we haven’t seen before, but with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">the future of Xbox looking a lot like a PC</a> it feels more inevitable than ever.</p><div><div><h2>Notepad by Tom Warren<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>A weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft’s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.</p></div><p><a href="http://theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter">Subscribe</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24174977/xbox-phil-spencer-games-ps5-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox chief Phil Spencer has confirmed that more of Microsoft’s own games will be coming to other platforms, like the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. Microsoft revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">four Xbox-exclusive games</a> were launching on PS5 and some on Nintendo Switch, with fans left wondering if it would only be four titles or if there are more to come. Spencer took the opportunity to clear up that mystery in an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIIpMhthwnto">interview with <em>IGN</em></a><em> </em>yesterday.</p><p>“Our commitment to our Xbox customers is you’re going to get the opportunity to buy or subscribe to the game, and we’re going to support the game on other screens,” said Spencer. “You are going to see more of our games on more platforms, and we just see that as a benefit to the franchises that we’re building, and we see that from players, and the players love to be able to play.”</p><p>The confirmation of more games coming to rival platforms comes months after Spencer denied there was a change to Microsoft’s strategy of Xbox exclusives. “We made a decision that we’re going to take four games to the other consoles, just four games. Not a change to our fundamental exclusive strategy,” said Spencer <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKGlD9SO3rKU">in an Xbox podcast</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Microsoft unveiled a collection of new Xbox games during its big showcase event last night, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172041/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></a> the big new “world premiere” titles. One word Microsoft didn’t use all night was exclusive, though. It’s something I’ve noticed the company has been avoiding for months now. Microsoft-owned Arkane Lyon unveiled its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23992733/arkane-lyon-marvel-blade-game"><em>Blade </em>game</a> late last year at the Game Awards, and there was no mention of exclusivity for Xbox. </p><p>We also got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24040391/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-gameplay-trailer-xbox-bethesda">first look</a> at Bethesda’s new <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> game earlier this year, and while Xbox and PC were confirmed as launch platforms, there was no mention of exclusivity. I understand Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/4/24057433/microsoft-bethesda-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release">weighing up launching</a> <em>Indiana Jones</em> on PS5 several months after the planned launch for Xbox later this year.</p><p>All of these decisions are part of “Project Latitude” inside Microsoft, a secretive project that I recently detailed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">in my weekly Notepad newsletter</a>. Microsoft is considering a number of games for rival platforms, including the recently-released <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II game. </em>You can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">read more about Project Latitude here</a>.</p><p><em>IGN </em>didn’t press Spencer further on the Xbox multiplatform plans, and Microsoft largely avoided the elephant in the room during its showcase by never mentioning rival platforms. Instead, it focused on a barrage of game trailers that resulted in one of the best Xbox showcases I’ve seen in years.</p><div><div><h2>Notepad by Tom Warren<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>A weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft’s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.</p></div><p><a href="http://theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter">Subscribe</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Phantom Line was possibly one of the most impressive showcases featured in Summer Game Fest 2024's PC Gaming Show.</p>
<p>Labeled as 'paranormal SWAT', this is a cooperative tactical first-person shooter game in development at <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-cyberpunk-2077-and-bioshock-devs-form-antistatic-studios-alongside-debut-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANTISTATIC Studios</a>, a Polish team composed of former Cyberpunk 2077 and BioShock developers.</p>
<p>Set in a 'post-nuclear' version of Europe, it puts players in the role of an operator enrolled in an elite special operations unit that handles paranormal events. Employed by Mortfield Industries, the player character will be sent to the so-called Iron Corridor in Eastern Europe, where one of Mortfield's research facilities has suddenly gone dark.</p>
<p>One of the players' biggest assets is the H.U.S.K. program that allows them to transfer consciousness between artificial bodies. H.U.S.K.s can be used strategically to scout, distract, decoy, and more.</p>
<p>The world of Phantom Line is full of paranormal creatures and unexplained phenomena dubbed “anomalies.” These leak into the world through rifts in the space-time fabric.</p>
<p>Players will have their base of operations in the nuclear-powered Icebreaker ship. Here, they will get to customize their H.U.S.K. and cabin, showcase weapons and armor to friends, and, most importantly, modify their gear and body.</p>
<p>Phantom Line's gameplay also includes survival elements, such as hunting and cooking wild animals. Players must utilize any available resources, gear up, and adjust their tactics to the situation on the ground.</p>

<p>The developers have announced a Pre-Alpha playtest available now through June 18. Interested players need only join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/XfzzGrQeT2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Discord channel</a> to get a key and check out Phantom Line.

			<p>The Xbox Game Showcase 2024 didn't have many surprises (mostly due to prior leaks and rumors), but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was arguably the best.</p>
<p>This Unreal Engine 5-powered game looks fantastic from both a graphics and artistic point of view. It is set in a world inspired by Belle Époque France, taking place in Lumière, an obvious reference to Paris. However, this is very much a fantasy setting. Here, an entity called the Paintress wakes up once a year and paints a cursed number upon a monolith. Then, every one of that age simply vanishes into smoke.</p>
<p>The title is, therefore, a reference to an expedition organized by the 33-year-olds - the ones scheduled to disappear next. Players will step into the shoes of play of Gustave, a diligent engineer who hopes to change the future for his apprentices and all of the children of Lumière. He will be joined by various companions, as this is a roleplaying game at heart.</p>
<p>Maelle is Gustave's foster sister, an orphan who doesn't trust others easily and has never felt at truly home in Lumière. The expedition allows her to venture beyond the city. Lune, a scholar and mage, is looking to continue her parents' work and find a way to solve the mystery of the Paintress to free the people of Lumière. Finally, Sciel is a farmer-turned-teacher who has a rather fatalistic viewpoint on the expedition: they'll either make it or they won't.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDyqGZy78Ng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a turn-based JRPG. However, French developer Sandfall Interactive aims to introduce major innovations to the genre's typical combat, adding real-time elements such as dodge, parry, and counter in real time, chain combos by mastering attack rhythms and targeting enemy weak points using a free aim system.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is scheduled for a 2025 launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It'll be added to the Game Pass library on day one. The developers also shared minimum and recommended PC requirements:</p>

			<p>Obsidian Entertainment has briefly mentioned the Avowed release date, but the mention was quickly scrubbed from existence.</p>
<p>We finally received a new trailer for Obsidian's upcoming action RPG during yesterday's Xbox Showcase. Unfortunately, we still haven't gotten a release date for the title, which has many suggesting that a delay is likely. Interestingly enough, however, the <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official blog post</a> that accompanied that new trailer mentioned an actual release date for the title, but the mention has since been removed from existence. Luckily, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240609233558/https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cached sample</a> of the blog still mentions the planned release date - November 12, 2024. We've included a screenshot of the cached page below:</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/avowed-release-date.png"></a></figure>

<p>At the moment of writing, the blog post doesn't mention a release date at all. "The last few months at Obsidian Entertainment have been fast-paced and exciting", the edited blog now reads. "Since we saw you at the Xbox Developer Direct this past January, we’ve been busy with Avowed. Today, we’re thrilled to have revealed our first-ever story trailer at Xbox Games Showcase 2024, and to talk with you more about what we’ve shared."</p>
<p>Possibly, Avowed's Game Director mentioned an initially planned release date, but this date was changed around due to other Xbox titles releasing in the same time frame. Still, we're pretty sure that fans of Avowed will find this interesting.</p>
<p>Whether Avowed will indeed launch on November 12th remains to be seen, but at this point, we don't think that's likely.</p>
<p>Avowed was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc-by-obsidian-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially announced</a> for Xbox and PC back in July of 2020. Down below we've included some additional info on the game:</p>
<p><em>Welcome to the Living Lands, a mysterious island filled with adventure and danger.</em><br>
<em>Set in the fictional world of Eora that was first introduced to players in the Pillars of Eternity franchise, Avowed is a first-person fantasy action RPG from the award-winning team at Obsidian Entertainment.&nbsp;</em><em>You are the envoy of Aedyr, a distant land, sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague throughout the Living Lands - an island full of mysteries and secrets, danger and adventure, and choices and consequences, and untamed wilderness. You discover a personal connection to the Living Lands and an ancient secret that threatens to destroy everything. Can you save this unknown frontier and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them asunder?</em></p>

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Weird farming meets silly physics in <em>Southfield</em>! Combine chaotic crops with unpredictable effects, build your dream farmstead, and experiment with playful machinery. Wobble your way around an ever-changing island solo or with up to three friends and unearth its secrets.</p><p><strong>Welcome to Southfield</strong></p><p>Southfield is no ordinary island, and this is no ordinary farming game. Combine cartoony crops with chaotic effects, and customize your farm with fun toys and machines to automate your harvest. Whether you’re a solo explorer, or you’re looking for a new destination to play with friends—Southfield is the place to be!</p><p><strong>Combine Chaotic Crops</strong></p><p>Things grow differently in Southfield, so you’ll quickly learn to expect the unexpected. Your harvest could bounce, go boom, chime a tune, or change shape. We’re talking about crops that radiate, illuminate, even levitate, and that’s before you mix crops together to create something entirely new! Complete quests, experiment with crops, and check off combinations in your trusty Almanac.</p><p><strong>Be More Bud</strong></p><p>You’re a Bud. A big, bouncy Bud, freshly sprouted from the land itself. Nobody knows where these delightfully silly creatures came from, but now it’s your job to help these uncoordinated island dwellers navigate farm life. Flip, flop, and fling yourself into all kinds of physics-based fun. Play online with up to three other Buds, and give yourselves a unique look with customizable colors and quirky outfits.</p><p><strong>Experiment with Machines</strong></p><p>As your farm grows, so does your to-do list! Free up time for more tractor <a title="Genres > Racing [184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> and lily-pad jumping with fun farming automation. From trampolines to air cannons, there’s a myriad of toys and machines to help you get the most out of each harvest. Use these same tools to build obstacle courses or life-sized pinball machines for you and your friends.</p><p><strong>Build Your Own Way</strong></p><p>Go wild with creative sandbox tools to construct super unique builds in <em>Southfield</em>! Treat your Buds like royalty with their very own stone castle, or live a simpler life in little wooden lodgings. With plenty of materials and customisations to create your dream farmstead, the sky is (literally) the limit… Buds don’t belong in space.</p><p><strong>Beware the Ruffians</strong></p><p>Buds aren’t the only inhabitants of this strange and unpredictable island. As night settles, a shadow grows, a mysterious Monolith looms, and out come the Ruffians. Southfield’s spectral mischief makers are out to cause chaos for you and your crops, and it’s up to you to defend yourself and your farm. Contend with wild weather, protect your harvest, help the other island-dwellers, and restore balance to Southfield—even if your Bud loses balance along the way.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Southfield - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2NkfRH4AWa8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starfields-june-2024-update-introduces-the-creation-kit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Creation Kit mods incoming.</h2></div><section><p>After teasing that a brand-new update would arrive in Starfield later today, Bethesda Game Studios has officially released the June 2024 update for Starfield, which introduces the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/?linkId=100000266072161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creation Kit</a>, new Trackers Alliance missions, and more. </p><p>In a new blog post, Bethesda has detailed all the new features coming into Starfield update 1.12.30. Most notably, this month's update introduces Creations, an editing tool that allows players to create mods and share them with other players via Bethesda.net. Players can pay for these mods via Creation Credits. The Creation Kit has been featured in several Bethesda Game Studios-developed titles like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>More interestingly, Bethesda notes that those who purchased the Premium Edition of Starfield will find 1,000 Creation Credits available on their account after installing the latest update. While it seems odd to provide those select players with Creation Credits, given the tool was just released, <a href="https://youtu.be/7wvqF41_Bgw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with KindaFunny in April</a>, Todd Howard revealed that a Creation Kit for Starfield was given to some creators. </p><p>The announcement comes hours after Bethesda's parent company, Xbox, held a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">Summer Games showcase</a>. At the showcase, the developer also provided the first official trailer for its upcoming story expansion, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfields-shattered-space-dlc-first-official-trailer-gives-players-a-first-look-at-house-varuuns-homeworld-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Shattered Space</a>, which will be released sometime later this year.</p><p>You can check out the full patch notes below.  </p><h2><strong>Starfield Update 1.12.30 Update Notes</strong></h2><p><strong>Update Highlights</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Creations are here! Creations are now available in Starfield. What does that mean? You can now access and play new content in Starfield. Creations may include new missions, gear, skins, weapons, and more! You’ll also find Bethesda Game Studios Creations including one of the new Trackers Alliance missions, The Vulture. You can find Creations via the in-game menu. For those of you who own Starfield's Premium Edition, you will also find 1000 Creation Credits within this menu.</li><li>If creating your own content for Starfield is something that interests you, you may also now download the Creation Kit for Starfield on Steam. Note, this is a separate download from the game download and is only available on Steam.</li><li>Trackers Alliance Missions Available New missions have been added to Starfield as part of this update. Trackers Alliance establishes the first of several missions enabling you to live your best bounty-hunting life. The first mission, The Starjacker will have you in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in settlements throughout the Settled Systems. From there, let the hunts begin!</li><li>The second Trackers Alliance mission, The Vulture is available within the new Creations menu. And what bounty hunter is without their trusted methods to get the job done?</li><li>Bounty Scanning and Mission Boards! This update also introduces the bounty scanner system that enables you to seek and destroy (or peacefully resolve...?) those targets with bounties on their heads. If you still want more, you can also check out the Elite Trackers Alliance mission board.</li><li>Armed and Ever Ready! Those of you who appreciate being extra crafty may now find new melee weapon tiers and the ability to modify melee weapons when crafting. For those that prefer the firepower approach, ammo crafting has also been added with this update. You can research your preferred ammo at a Research Station and craft them at an Industrial Workbench!</li></ul><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>General: General performance and stability improvements</strong></li><li><strong>Gameplay</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gameplay Options: Addressed a sustenance issue that caused sneak attack damage to be too high.</li><li>Ship Decoration: Nova Galactic All-in-One 2x1 Habs will now declutter properly.</li><li>Ship Decoration: Items can no longer be placed on ladders.</li><li>Addressed an issue that could cause Guards to give up their chase too easily.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused visited space locations to appear undiscovered.</li><li>Addressed an issue that could occur when modifying the player’s ship at The Key.</li><li>Addressed a rare issue that could cause some objects to behave as if they were in zero-g.</li><li>Fixed a crowd character issue that could appear when loading a save.</li><li>Removed the "Fast Travel to Ship" button from screens where it could not be utilized.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could occur when opening photo mode at the start of a conversation.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could occur when trying to exit the pilot seat while landing.</li><li>Addressed an issue with incrementing the "Ships Modified" stat when entering ship builder.</li><li>Quest Trackers should highlight the correct NAT station when traveling to the Lodge in New Atlantis.</li><li>Cora Coe should now accept books even if the Main Quest is skipped after entering the Unity.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Graphics</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue which could cause a bright light when loading a save into New Atlantis.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause some objects to become hidden when they should be visible.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Outposts</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue where the Power Management Robot could unintentionally reduce power.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Quests</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Background Checks: Fixed an issue where the player could receive an unintentional trespassing message.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

IMAGE CAPTURED BY IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“The last few months at Obsidian Entertainment have been fast-paced and exciting,” the statement said. “Since we saw you at the Xbox Developer Direct this past January, we’ve been busy with Avowed getting it ready for release on November 12, 2024. Today, we’re thrilled to have revealed our first-ever story trailer at Xbox Games Showcase 2024, and to talk with you more about what we’ve shared.”</p><p>The current version of the page is almost exactly the same besides the removal of those November release plans. It’s strange to see the November date show up right after today’s Xbox Games Showcase, which wrapped up just hours ago. Avowed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidians-avowed-gets-new-story-trailer-still-no-release-date-xbox-games-showcase-2024">appeared during the event with a trailer</a> that showed a good chunk of the game, but it did so while only promising to launch sometime before the year was over. Its removal suggests Obsidian still wasn’t ready to reveal its plans to the rest of the world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Avowed Xbox Showcase 2024 Screnshots</h3></div></output><p>Xbox has yet to comment on if the date is accurate or why it appeared on the Obsidian website.

Fans have been burned before, expecting Xbox to finally turn a corner only to have the football pulled once again and realize the platform is still in another one of its inescapable “rebuilding” years. The proof is always in the games themselves, and how successful they are can only really be determined once they get into players’ hands. For now, though, the showcase delivered. </p><p>There was over sixty minutes of games big and small, offering everything from zombie survival to nostalgic teen hangout, punctuated by massive first-party franchises and third-party teases. If you own an Xbox Series X/S there will be plenty to play this year and next. Xbox game studios head Matt Booty’s perennial promise for a steady cadence of quarterly Xbox games worth showing up for might finally come true. The only thing missing from the event was any accountability for what, and who, Microsoft has sacrificed to get here. </p><p>It’s been just over a month since the company announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685">it’s shutting down three studios and reshuffling a fourth</a></span>. One of the casualties, Tango Gameworks, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-shut-down-xbox-studios-1851461379&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-shut-down-xbox-studios-1851461379">its 2023 hit <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span>, seemed to symbolize the best of Xbox in the Game Pass era: a hyper-stylized passion project from a newer team that wowed critics and won awards and wouldn’t have been possible without the “let a thousand flowers bloom” strategy behind the platform’s pivot to a Netflix-like subscription library. In a crushing reversal, however, the deep-pocketed tech giant cut the team, along with storied immersive sim makers Arkane Austin and others. According to internal comments from Booty and the head of parent company Zenimax, there just wasn’t enough bandwidth for one of the three most valuable companies in the world to manage so many studios.</p><p>The bad news and bullshit explanation might not have gone down like a lead balloon if Microsoft hadn’t announced mass layoffs just months earlier across several departments, including newly acquired Activision Blizzard. The cuts hit everyone from the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>team to <em>Call of Duty</em> makers Sledgehammer Games, and included the cancellation of <em>Odyssey</em>, a survival crafting fantasy game that might have become the first new franchise from Blizzard in nearly a decade. Microsoft spent $69 billion on the acquisition, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer toured the Activision Blizzard King offices shortly after the deal was finalized last fall, and then in early 2024 the mask came off. </p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer blamed the heel turn on a combination of investor pressure and the stagnation of the console gaming market in interviews with <em>Game File</em> and <em>Polygon</em>. In other words: capitalism. But  the complete closure of Tango Gameworks, originally founded by <em>Resident Evil </em>director Shinji Mikami to train a new generation of creatives, seemed especially capricious.  The Xbox team didn’t mention the developers it’s laid off and their contributions in its remarks to a live audience ahead of the showcase today, or during the pre-recorded event itself. (Even after learning its fate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/redfall-final-update-arkane-austin-1851509877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/redfall-final-update-arkane-austin-1851509877">Arkane Austin worked hard</a></span> to push out <em>Redfall</em>’s much-needed final update.)</p><p>Instead, Spencer opened the showcase by promoting <em>Black Ops 6</em> and the company’s desire to bring one of the most popular franchises to even more players through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one-1851503214&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one-1851503214">the power of a $17-a-month subscription</a></span>. It maybe wasn’t surprising given the billions Microsoft paid to acquire the series, but the choice to open the show this way underscored the new reality of an Xbox brand that now needs to make a return worthy of all of those investments. “I haven’t been talking publicly about this, because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spencer told <em>IGN</em> later in the day</a></span>, away from the hundreds of thousands of fans tunning into the showcase. </p><p>He continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It’s obviously a decision that’s very hard on them, and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we’re doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It’s not about my PR, it’s not about Xbox PR. It’s about those teams. In the end, I’ve said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make.</p></blockquote><p>The showcase, meanwhile, didn’t even clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-layoff-palworld-balatro-1851527203&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-layoff-palworld-balatro-1851527203">the bar set days prior by Geoff Keighley</a></span> at the Game Awards host’s own showcase.

But the future is built on the past, and every shiny new Xbox game now comes with the question of what will happen to the teams Microsoft has purchased or partnered with, once it no longer feels like they serve its bottom line. </p><p><em>Update 6/9/2024 9:10 p.m. ET: Added comments from Spencer’s post-show interview with </em>IGN<em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft held its annual Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday afternoon, and with it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-summer-games-showcase-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came a look at 30 games</a> and the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-three-new-series-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three new series consoles</a>. What wasn’t announced, however, was the highly rumored Xbox Handheld that the company is working on. In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Xbox head Phil Spencer talked about the lack of an announcement and where things stand.</p>



<p>“The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome,” Spencer told the outlet. “The work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I’m incredibly excited about.</p>



<p> “Today was about the games… but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can’t wait to bring it to you.”</p>



<p>Spencer was then asked if this new handheld would be a cloud-only system, or if it would all for local installations and gameplay. To that Spencer said that playing games locally on a handheld is “really important.”</p>



<p>There’s no timetable on when this rumored Xbox handheld console will happen. However, with Spencer not denying it’s existence, it seems to be only a matter of time before gamers get something more concrete on that front.</p>

"Today was about the games... but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can't wait to bring it to you."</p><p>When asked if a hypothetical Xbox handheld would be a dedicated gaming platform where you can play games locally (like a Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch), or a cloud-based handheld, Spencer responded: "I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Rumors about a possible Xbox handheld console have been swirling for months, with many expecting some kind of announcement at today's showcase. Those rumors were fueled by the trove of leaked Microsoft documents last fall, which revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-major-revelations-from-the-ftc-vs-xbox-court-document-leaks">plans for an Xbox handheld</a>. Spencer, however, would later come out to say those plans were outdated.</p><p>Xbox has hinted at new hardware in the near-ish future, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-next-gen-console-confirmed-business-update">announcing a multi-year roadmap</a> in February that includes a next-generation Xbox console. And, while neither Spencer nor any other Xbox leadership had confirmed the existence of it, Spencer did go so far as to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-official-xbox-handheld-rumors-swirl-phil-spencer-reveals-what-he-wants-from-it">say what he would want from a handheld Xbox</a> in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-official-xbox-handheld-rumors-swirl-phil-spencer-reveals-what-he-wants-from-it">Polygon</a> in March. </p><p>At the time, Spencer listed various features that would make a handheld console "feel like an Xbox," including having access to all your games with associated save files: "What should we build that will find new players?” he said at the time. “That will allow people to play at times when they couldn’t go play [in the past]?”</p><p>Elsewhere during our interview with Spencer, he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">addressed the recent closure of Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/10/streets-of-rogue-2-enters-steam-early-access-on-august-14th/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>During the PC Games Show, tinybuild revealed that Streets of Rogue 2 will be released into Steam Early Access on August 14th. This release has been somewhat delayed, as Streets of Rogue 2 was originally aiming for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/05/streets-of-rogue-2-will-be-entering-early-access-in-2023/">a 2023 early access release</a>. This early access release promises a lot of content, with much more to be added before Street of Rogue 2’s full release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Streets of Rogue 2 - Release Date Trailer (feat. Perturbator)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giKX3jFF47A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the initial early access phase of Streets of Rogue 2, players will be able to play as numerous characters who all have their own skillsets, including a tech-savvy hacker, an agile ninja, and culinary chef. Whichever character you choose, there are multiple ways to approach the procedurally generated open world of Streets of Rogue 2. You can go on a huge destructive spree to topple the President and take over the nation, or help people for rewards. You can build up a criminal empire or a business empire, and use those proceeds to gain power in the world too. There will be ample exploration opportunities by land and sea, using fast cars and fast boats. When it comes to fighting, your weapons arsenal could include flamethrowers and banana peels.</p>
<p>There is no need to play Streets of Rogue to understand the story of Streets of Rogue 2, but the games do take place in the same universe. The game will eventually feature four player co-op both locally and online, with there being scope to potentially increase the number of online players and increase the carnage, though this is likely to happen later on in early access, if not after the full launch of Streets of Rogue 2.</p>

One of those was not only the reveal of Doom: The Dark Ages, but the announcement that it would be coming to PlayStation 5 as well. </p><p>Asked about the decision by IGN's Ryan McCaffrey, Spencer attributed the decision, at least partially, to id Software Studio Director Marty Stratton.</p><p>"Doom is definitely one of those franchises that has a history of so many platforms," Spencer explained. "It’s a franchise that I think everyone deserves to play. When I was in a meeting with Marty a couple years ago, I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sell it on all platforms.

		<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/antistatic-studio-founded-by-ex-cyberpunk-2077-and-bioshock-devs/">Antistatic Studio was founded by ex Cyberpunk 2077 and BioShock devs</a>, and at the time it announced Project Hornet. Now, Antistatic Studio has confirmed the real name of Project Hornet is Phantom Line, and revealing new information about the game as well as giving the chance to register for its playtest.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Line - Reveal Trailer - Join the paranormal SWAT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vf0EsjF4uOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Phantom Line drops players into a version of Eastern Europe which has become embroiled in a global nuclear war. Amidst the chaos of nuclear war, Phantom Line hones in on a different threat, that of paranormal origins, that teams must confront. The game supports up to four players in an open-world setting, where they must navigate and survive dynamic events that will be full of dangers. Within Phantom Line’s lore, players’ consciousnesses are transferred into artificial bodies known as HUSKs, which are essentially avatars for scouting and combating paranormal threats. The game’s home base is set on an icebreaker ship, serving as a hub where players can upgrade and personalise their HUSKs, as well as manage their equipment, weapons, and armour. This ship also serves as the location for mission briefings,where players will learn more about the threats that plague the world.</p>
<p>Antistatic Studios has confirmed that there will be a playtest for Phantom Line, and if you want to join you will need to be part of the studio’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA">Discord channel</a>. The playtest is set to be taking place later in the summer, though an exact date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool-release-date-brings-devil-survivor-style-rpg-goodness-in-september.896346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ysbryd Games and developer Necrosoft have announced the&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>release date, so if you're hankering for some&nbsp;<em>Devil Survivor</em>-style tactical RPG action, you won't have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>As announced during today's PC Gaming Show presentation,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will launch across PC and consoles (although not Xbox One, it seems) on September 13th. It'll be playable on Steam Deck, too.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced">announced back in 2022</a>,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will bring&nbsp;tactical RPG action inspired by&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor</em>, old-school&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>games (think&nbsp;<em>Persona 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>rather than more recent entries), and Italian giallo-style horror movies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demonschool-release-date-boss.jpg?itok=Xhb1E0St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demonschool-release-date-boss.jpg?itok=iBWepkD7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will probably bring back warm, fuzzy memories if you're an old-school&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fan.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will revolve around Faye, the last in a line of demon-hunters, as she tries to navigate university life on "a mysterious island".</p>
<p>While doing so, she must also contend with "big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds", which sounds very much like the same kind of supernatural-mundane mix&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>is going for.</p>
<p><em>Demonschool</em>'s tactical battling will allow you not only to plan out moves in advance, but also to rewind actions during the planning stage of combat, giving you greater control over your strategy.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good idea of what to expect from both the game's art style and its tactical systems.</p>

<p>Faye will be assisted along the way by several companions, including kind pugilist Destin, "photography nerd" Namako, and "pragmatic media enthusiast" Knute.</p>
<p>In battle, you'll be able to buff your companions for extra damage and support, and you'll likely need to if you want to overcome some of&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s tougher challenges.</p>
<p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 13th. It's looking like a must-play if you're a fan of Atlus' old-school RPGs and&nbsp;<em>Devil Survivor&nbsp;</em>in particular.</p>
