            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gone Hunting is, as the name suggests, a game that revolves around the subtle art of hunting in the wild. Players need to use traps, rifles, and other such tools to hunt down a variety of different animals. An experienced hunter will tell you that the most underrated quality in a good hunter is patience, and this game requires players to have plenty of that. Hunting isn’t as easy as just picking up a gun and shooting at the first animal you see; it’s a far more methodical process that can go wrong if one bad step is made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players have to use items like tranquilizer guns, traps, and fishing rods to hunt down their prey. Fishing is another major gameplay element of Gone Hunting. What sets Gone Hunting apart from the competition is the fact that you don’t merely kill animals in this game, but rather, you capture animals using non-lethal weapons. These weapons can be upgraded using the in-game currency, and although you can get plenty of it by simply playing the game, one of the easiest ways to get some free money is using these Gone Hunting codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-gone-hunting-codes-october-2025">All New Gone Hunting Codes (October 2025)</h2>



<p>We currently only know of two active codes in Gone Hunting, which are listed below:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>RELEASE</strong>: 250 Coins (NEW)</li>



<li><strong>GONEHUNTING</strong>: 30 Mins of Luck Boost (NEW)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-gone-hunting-codes">Expired Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>There is currently only one expired code for Gone Hunting, but sometimes its worth trying expired codes as they could become active again.</p>



<p>The expired code is:</p>



<ul>
<li>BIGPLANS</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-gone-hunting-codes">How to Redeem Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>If you’re ready to hunt down some animals, using these Gone Hunting codes can be a good way to give yourself a head start. Redeeming codes in Gone Hunting is a simple and rather straightforward process. Players aren’t forced to follow any social media accounts or to join the Roblox game group. Instead, all players have to do is navigate through the menus of the game and simply input one of the active codes given above. For newer players who may be unfamiliar with the menus, here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming Gone Hunting codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Gone Hunting</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Shop’ icon at the top&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the provided text box</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to instantly receive your rewards</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-gone-hunting-codes">How to get more Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>Although there are only two active Gone Hunting codes right now, players can rest assured, as given the current popularity of the game, new codes are surely in the works. While following the game’s socials and Discord server is one way to get the codes, manually scrolling through all the posts to find the codes you’re looking for can be quite a hassle. Instead, players are urged to <strong>keep this page bookmarked</strong>, as we update it as soon as any new Gone Hunting codes drop.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is rumored to be the latest high-profile target of the hacker group Crimson Collective, according to a new online report.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/H4ckmanac">cyber intelligence firm Hackmanac</a>, the hacking group shared a screenshot showing folders of <em>"Nintendo topic files,"</em> claiming they are now in possession of the data. The Japanese company has yet to issue a statement or confirm any breach, making the group's claim impossible to verify at the time of writing (October 11 - 10:03 AM EDT)</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this cyberattack against Nintendo has yet to be officially confirmed, the Crimson Collective hacking group has already maliciously attacked other companies in the past few days, so an attack against Nintendo is not outside the realm of possibility. </p>



<p>Only this month, the Crimson Collective group attacked company Red Hat, breaching the software company's private GitHub repositories to steal 570GB of data. Red Hat itself confirmed the breach shortly after the attack, following claims from the hacking group that it had made extortion demands to the company. If the attack against Nintendo is real, there's a good chance the hacking group also made similar demands to the Japanese company.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks against video game companies are not a new occurrence, and many companies have had data stolen, ranging from information about yet-to-be-announced projects to personal information of employees. Insomniac Games, developer of Marvel's Spider-Man games and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">upcoming Marvel's Wolverine</a>, was the target of a massive cyberattack back in 2023, which resulted in confidential information making its way on the web.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ever dreamt about running your own store that sells premium makeup and skincare products? If yes, then this is going to be an unforgettable experience for you. The main point of Makeup Store Simulator is to make the most amount of money possible every day, all while keeping customers happy and the stock in check. Makeup Store Simulator throws you into the deep end in terms of the makeup business, in that you have to buy and sell high-end makeup products at a profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you try to sell at too low a price, you won’t make any money, whereas if you try to make a lot of money by boosting the prices, your customers will stop buying. As with most businesses, it’s a matter of acceptable margins, and Makeup Store Simulator will teach you how to walk that tightrope. One thing that all businesses need, however, is money, and you can earn some extra free cash by redeeming the following Makeup Store Simulator codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-makeup-store-simulator-codes-october-2025">All New Makeup Store Simulator Codes (October 2025)</h2>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Code</td><td data-align="center">Reward</td><td data-align="center">Expiry</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">FACEGLOW</td><td data-align="center">950 Cash</td><td data-align="center">Not specified&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 id="h-expired-makeup-store-simulator-codes">Expired Makeup Store Simulator Codes</h2>



<p>The following codes are currently expired for Makeup Store Simulator:</p>



<ul>
<li>LIPSTICK2025&nbsp;</li>



<li>MakeUp&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Although there are only two expired codes in the game currently, more will likely be added to this list as new Makeup Store Simulator codes drop. With just one active code in the game at this moment, the likelihood of new codes being released by the developers in the near future is quite high. Although there’s no defined date for when new codes might be released, considering how popular the game has become, the release of new Makeup Store Simulator codes is a likely eventuality at this point.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-makeup-store-simulator-codes-nbsp">How To Redeem Makeup Store Simulator Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Unlike in real life, free cash in this game is extremely easy to get, thanks to the Makeup Store Simulator codes. All players have to do is redeem active codes to get their rewards, but sometimes, that’s easier said than done. Some games force players to complete additional steps before they’re allowed to redeem codes, such as following the game’s socials or joining their Discord server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Makeup Store Simulator, however, hasn’t imposed any such criteria on its players. All you have to do to receive this free cash is navigate to the codes option in the game and input one of the active codes given above. Here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming your Makeup Store Simulator Codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Makeup Store Simulator</li>



<li>Hit the ‘Z’ button on your keyboard to bring up your mobile phone</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ button to open the text box</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Hit the ‘enter’ key on your keyboard to receive your rewards</li>
</ul>

		<p>Today, Bandai Namco released a new trailer for Dragon Ball FighterZ marking the game’s inclusion at EVO France 2025 this weekend, and within that trailer the publisher made a surprise annoucement. Goku from Dragon Ball Daima will be added to the Dragon Ball FighterZ roster, with the new character expected to be added in Spring 2026. In addition, a balance update was also announced. Check out the reveal trailer below.</p>

<p>The balance update for Dragon Ball FighterZ will be released on October 12th, with Z-Reflect being one of the key parts of the game being addressed. In addition, all characters on the roster have been updated so moves will be rebalanced across the board, though full patch notes will not be released until the balance update is released.</p>
<p>Released back in 2018, Dragon Ball FighterZ was a major hit for fighting game vets&nbsp;<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-system-works">Arc System Works</a>, followed by numerous updates and character additions. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">our glowing review</a>, Dave wrote, <em>“2018 is off to a strong start with Dragon Ball FighterZ an early contender for this year’s best fighting game. &nbsp;By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.”</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-17-inch-laptop-with-windows-11-pro-is-1560-off-now-going-for-pennies-right-after-prime-day-2000634417</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-17-inch-laptop-with-windows-11-pro-is-1-560-off-now-going-for-pennies-right-after-prime-day.1322602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people need a laptop that covers the basics reliably: smooth web browsing, comfortable document editing, video calls that don’t freeze and enough screen space to actually see what you’re working on. This HP laptop checks every box on that list and delivers a spacious 17.3-inch FHD display, an Intel i3-N305 8-core processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a generous 1TB SSD. Right now, t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4710/">his machine is down to $639 on Amazon, slashed from its typical $2,199 price</a>. This all-time low didn’t even show up during Prime Day last week.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4710/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel i3-N305 processor has a surprising amount of muscle to deliver for an i3 chip. With the ability to run 8 cores and 8 threads and turbo speeds that can hit as high as 3.8GHz, this processor can handle office workflows, multimedia, and multitasking situations that would slow older budget notebooks to a crawl. Those 8 cores enable you to have dozens of browser tabs and video conferencing programs running, edit docs, and stream music and still never have a slowdown. By delivering responsive speeds to heavy duty programs like photo editing or analyzing a spreadsheet, this notebook has the capacity to do much more than simple web browsing and email.</p>
<h2>A Display that makes Everything Easier to View</h2>
<p>That 17.3-inch diagonal display transforms your computer experience in ways you may not anticipate until you’ve experienced it. Additional screen real estate translates to less scrolling to documents, effortless use of windows side-by-side and real productivity boosts working in spreadsheets or graphics applications. FHD resolution of 1920×1080 maintains text sharp and images clear and IPS panel technologies deliver true colors over extremely wide viewing angles.</p>
<p>Anti-glare coating <strong>minimizes eye strain when you’ll be sitting for long periods</strong> which is essential when you’ll be looking at the display for hours on end. Narrow bezel design makes maximum use of the screen real estate without making the laptop too large and innovative lift-hinge design raises the keyboard when you open the lid to form a steeper and more upright typing angle that minimizes wrist strain.</p>



<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM has enough headroom to handle current computing needs: This memory capacity allows you to have several applications running smoothly, jump between applications quickly without loading times, and hold dozens of web pages without slow downs. The 1TB PCIe NVMe solid-state drive provides incredibly fast boot times, normally propelling you from power button to desktop in less than 10 seconds. File transfers occur virtually right away, and programs launch the moment their icons are clicked. Storage capacity also allows you to have your complete digital library stored right on the laptop without having to constantly manage it or rely on external storage units.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life can go as long as 8 hours</strong> due to the use of HP Fast Charge technology and it allows you to work throughout a day of meetings or travels and not have to search for outlets. HP True Vision HD camera provides clear video resolution even when you are in a low-light environment which eradicates the universal headache of having grainy, dark video calls while working in darkened rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro comes standard with the built-in Copilot AI assistant</strong>&nbsp;which can be accessed via a specialized keyboard key. This AI aide can provide answers to questions, summarize documents, create text, and automate many other tasks, all without having to leave your workstation. A full-size keyboard, complete with a numeric keypad that every person working with numbers or performing data entry will love, comes included as well.</p>
<p>With that $639 purchase price, you’re receiving a laptop that normally costs over three times as much.</p>

            <p>The one-year anniversary of Silent Hill's glorious return to form has come and gone with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and with it, hopes that the Born From a Wish DLC is on the way.</p>
<p>Born From a Wish is the brief but potent DLC story extension that was available only to Xbox players of the original 2001 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> game that focuses on Maria. Remake developer Bloober Team has yet to mention it, though, and while some fans had hoped we'd get news about the DLC on or near the anniversary or perhaps the upcoming release of the Return to Silent Hill movie, the voice actor behind Remake's Maria has confirmed she hasn't been contacted by Bloober to record extra content.</p>

<p>Salóme Gunnarsdóttir launched her streaming career earlier this week, popping up on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2587528784">Twitch</a> to mark the remake's first anniversary by playing it for the first time. Gazillions of Silent Hill fans descended into her chat, which predictably led to a question about the missing DLC.</p><p>After seeing several comments about it, Gunnarsdóttir said: "I'm just going to– I'm not going to announce any Born from a Wish thing. Um, I have been waiting for Konami to say something, I even asked Bloober if they were going to say something, but we've not recorded anything from Born from a Wish. I'm so sorry. Um, I don't know anything else, I just know I haven't recorded any material for it. So. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Is it possible that she recorded dialogue or mocap for the additional content while the game was in full production? Sure. Maybe. Could she be bound by an NDA and unable to confirm or deny anything? That's plausible, too. But the expression on her face and the multiple "sorrys" feel more like a gentle letdown than a teasing affirmation. Until Konami or Bloober confirm one way or the other, though, I suppose there'll always be the hope that more Silent Hill 2 Remake could eventually arrive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">I had a thrilling time with Silent Hill 2 Remake, awarding it 5/5, writing</a>: "Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands Silent Hill 2 in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves."</p>
<p>ICYMI, the remake of Silent Hill 2 is reportedly heading to the PS Plus catalogue later this month, available for Extra and Premium subscribers. While not formally confirmed, reliable insider billbil_kun of Dealabs reports Konami and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s remake will be added on 21st October. It was released last October as a PS5 console exclusive, also available on PC. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">trailer from last year added that it would be available on "other formats"</a> from 8th October 2025, exactly a year later.</p>

<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159479/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-atelier-games-on-nintendo-switch">Atelier</a> series, variety is the spice of life. One might think that more than 25 games deep into developer Gust’s long-running RPG series, the sheen of that trademark gameplay loop of collecting materials, learning recipes, and crafting items via alchemy would start to dull a little. Yet, with the introduction of each new entry and corresponding sub-series, Atelier constantly finds ways to reinvent itself and offer a unique spin on its tried-and-true gameplay systems. From the darker and more action-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_yumia_the_alchemist_of_memories_and_the_envisioned_land">Atelier Yumia</a> to the sprawling adventure saga of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/atelier-ryza-secret-trilogy-deluxe-pack">Atelier Ryza</a> trilogy, each title has its own distinct identity.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a>, the 27th mainline entry in the series, is such a complicated game to explain. So much of its identity is owed to what came before it. It’s simultaneously a standalone sequel to a free-to-play gacha game, a major crossover event that incorporates characters from past entries, <em>and</em> a self-proclaimed return to the series' turn-based roots. At the same time, it’s also very much its own thing, chronicling an original story with new leads and fresh gameplay concepts.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159480/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A lesser game might be crushed under the weight of all the things Atelier Resleriana is supposed to be, yet it manages to dovetail each responsibility into a cohesive whole. The result is one of the stronger Atelier releases in recent years and, thankfully, an enjoyable experience that remains largely unfettered by Switch 1’s ageing hardware.</p>
<p>Set after the events of 2023’s <strong>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy &amp; the Liberator of Polar Night</strong> (a mobile and PC-based gacha title that is no longer available to play outside of Japan), this moves the focus to two new playable protagonists: Rias and Slade. They hail from Hallfein, a once-bustling town that suffered a mysterious tragedy 12 years prior and has since fallen into disrepair. When the pair of adventurers meet and stumble across an abandoned atelier, they resolve to use the power of alchemy to restore their hometown to its former glory and uncover the mystery behind its downfall.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159488/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In keeping with its narrative focus, Atelier Resleriana’s gameplay is defined by three key areas: exploring the world and its dungeons while collecting alchemy ingredients and battling enemies; synthesising and strengthening new items via alchemy recipes at the atelier; and improving the quality of the town by selling items at Rias’ store or taking on additional quests and side activities. Each strand is well-defined with its own set of intricacies and systems to learn, and the way all three interweave makes engaging with each one key to progression.</p>
<p>The game’s refreshed alchemy system sees you combining ingredients to produce items and equipment for your party. Materials possess two distinct colour attributes that must be chained together to effectively pass on unique traits and effects. It may seem like a simple match-the-colour system on the surface, but there are a ton of wrinkles and additional mechanics that up the complexity of crafting considerably.</p>
<p>Having a nice amount of depth in the alchemy system is an Atelier hallmark, though this iteration’s tutorials don’t always do the best job of explaining all the need-to-know ins and outs. This opaqueness can be frustrating, especially as a few battles in the mid-to-late game ramp up the challenge to test your crafting mastery.</p>

<p>You collect materials by exploring locations and progressing through a slew of floor-based dungeons with procedurally generated interiors that change upon each visit. The act of collecting materials essentially boils down to hitting a button to instantly harvest useful stuff with ease. You can gather one handful of items after another within seconds, and having a constant influx of valuable ingredients added to your basket is pure dopamine.</p>
<p>For their part, battles have returned to a turn-based format from earlier Atelier titles. Here, you control the actions of up to three party members on your frontline. Most of the genre staples are present — each character has their own stats and skillsets (which can be expanded and improved via a skill tree or levelling up), and they can use their turn to perform an element-based attack or use an item. Enemies have elemental resistances and weaknesses that can be exploited to temporarily stun them. Party members who act in succession can also follow up each other’s actions with extra attacks.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159487/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The basics of combat may be straightforward, but Atelier Resleriana also includes several key mechanics that keep battles feeling dynamic and fresh. Arguably the biggest is the presence of a visible turn timeline à la <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, which you can use to plan out your strategy multiple moves in advance, and even manipulate to change turn timings and obtain certain bonus effects. Determining when to schedule an Interruption action for a free item use or deciding which target to steal an effect from on their next projected turn adds a whole additional layer to battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Multi-Action mechanic allows you to spend accumulated Technical Points to give an active combatant and two of your non-active party members a chance to perform an action in one fell swoop before swapping out the main fighter for someone on the back line. This twist allows you to perform some pretty devastating combos while keeping all of your party members relevant and involved.</p>
<p>There are more battle mechanics to play around with besides these, but the point is that Atelier Resleriana’s combat is a nice blend between classic turn-based RPG fare and fresher concepts that encourage further strategy and optimisation.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159481/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, there’s the town improvement system, which centres around management of Rias’ shop, Mistletoe Miscellaneous. Here, you can stock items you’ve synthesised, hire fairies as staff, and customise the interior to your liking. As the shop sells wares, you can both turn a profit and level up various parts of Hallfein.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to improve the town by taking on optional side quests and partaking in other activities around town. Certain shops, items, and visitor characters become available as Hallfein grows, but seeing the struggling locale’s condition visibly improve over the course of the game offers a rewarding sense of progression in itself.</p>
<p>On that note, I quite enjoyed the restrained and laid-back nature of the story. While it’s not without its high-stakes moments and occasional twists to keep things interesting, Rias and Slade’s journey feels refreshingly quaint with a greater emphasis on character dynamics. It helps that the main cast is made up of supremely likeable and charming people who come alive thanks to fluid animation work and fully-voiced cutscenes.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159482/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The people you meet are compassionate and willing to lend a helping hand far more often than not, and it’s easy to root for the team as they rally behind Hallfein’s restoration. It may not be everyone’s tonal cup of tea, but the whole thing just comes off as very pleasant and earnestly sweet without falling into saccharine territory.</p>
<p>You'll spend a whole lot of time with these characters, too, with an ample amount of cutscenes both throughout the main story and within optional character episodes and side quests. These story segments are generally enjoyable for the reasons described above, although there really are a ton of them, and they can be rather long-winded at times.</p>
<p>Cutscenes are also easy to trigger, even when you don’t intend to. Going to a certain area or speaking to a certain character can cause multiple cutscenes to stack, automatically playing out one after another and bringing progress to a screeching halt. Suffice to say, there are plenty of spans when all you can do is set down the controller and watch things play out.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159484/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that both the main story and side content feature a bunch of returning characters from Atelier history who make up most of the primary and supporting cast, including the bulk of your party members. Thankfully, the game doesn’t let this crossover element overpower the core narrative and effectively introduces everyone without much confusion. That said, you’ll definitely get much more out of all the little nods and references embedded in the story if you’re familiar with previous entries.</p>
<p>You'll also be relieved to hear that Atelier Resleriana appears on Switch without egregious performance concessions. The game ran at what appeared to be a rock-solid 30 frames per second throughout my playthrough, which feels fluid enough to fit its moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>
<p>Visuals have definitely taken the greatest hit, as it can get pretty blurry and jaggy in handheld mode. Thankfully, the stylised art direction shines through even in the messier moments. Atelier Resleriana on Switch may not be as sharp or as smooth as it is on other platforms, but it still plays just fine and stands as a more-than-viable version.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Between a restrained scope and structure that harkens back to the Atelier games of old, a bevvy of fresh gameplay twists to call its own, and a metric ton of fanservice for veterans, Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian feels like a triumphant celebration of the entire series’ legacy.</p>
<p>More importantly, it’s just a really great RPG experience. Appropriately, it mixes together a bunch of quality ingredients — a heartwarming narrative, strategic and dynamic turn-based combat, complex crafting systems — and synthesises them into a jolly little romp of an adventure. There’s certainly a bump in the road or two, but the ride is too enjoyable to linger on those for long.</p></section>

<p>A balance update arrives tomorrow</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At the end of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> finals at EVO France, Bandai Namco shared some exciting news. The highlight was the teaser announcement of a new warrior. It's Super Saiyan 4 Goku (Daima), and he's arriving at some point in <strong>Spring 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Along with this was the announcement of a balance adjustment update. This will be arriving tomorrow on <strong>12th October 2025</strong>. Bandai Namco highlighted how "successfully timing a Z-Reflect can turn the tide of battle". Along with this, every character is getting updated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Goku (SS4, DAIMA) from DRAGON BALL DAIMA is officially joining the #DRAGONBALLFighterZ roster! Plus, a balance update drops October 12, bringing strategic depth to Z Reflect! Full patch notes will be available on release day!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see in the trailer above, legends of the game's competitive scene will also be returning at the Dragon Ball FighterZ Masters Showdown at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026. This event will take place in Los Angeles, California at the Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall between 18th to 19th April 2026.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball FighterZ was released on the original Switch in 2018, and was followed by multiple game updates and DLC characters. Bandai Namco hasn't mentioned anything about a Switch 2 Edition or update, but if there are any announcements, we'll let you know. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions with rollback netcode were <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/02/dragon-ball-fighterzs-ps5-version-is-out-tomorrow-with-rollback-netcode">released last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is like playing an art-filled dream. It’s filled with unexpected events, disjointed acts, and hazy landscapes. Scenes end abruptly, and then you unexpectedly pick up the thread later on. You’ll meet talking angel statues and fish that want to escape their home and swim to the ocean. But it’s that same unstable, dreamlike quality that makes the game so memorable.</p><p>In <em>Dreams of Another</em>, from <em>PixelJunk</em> developer Q-Games, you play as a pajama-clad man who is aptly referred to only as the Man in Pajamas. He wields a gun given to him by a man called the Wandering Soldier. In the opening sequence, the soldier realizes he is unable to shoot a bullet from that gun. But in the Man in Pajamas’ hands, the gun doesn’t destroy things but instead “creates” them.</p><p>Q-Games says <em>Dreams of Another</em> is a “third-person exploration-action game,” but it’s easier to understand the game as a series of vignettes rather than by its genre. When you’re dropped into an environment in <em>Dreams from Another</em>, which usually happens suddenly and without any preamble, parts of the landscape are deconstructed into a bunch of tiny, colorful pieces. When you shoot the pieces with your gun, they’ll solidify into things like a bench, a tree, a building, a person, or a shipwreck. But even then, the objects in the world will still be made of the loosely connected pieces, giving them the impression that they could all scatter apart at a moment’s notice, and sometimes things do actually start to split up.</p><p>As you shoot the pieces of the world, things will solidify into objects that you can have conversations with, like the Wandering Soldier, or a clown who creates a giant ring statue out of the rings of divorced partners, or even seemingly inanimate objects like a bench pondering the nature of consciousness. Characters speak in a halting, unnatural way and say strange things: Once, after taking a photo of her husband, an old lady said that it would “make a nice funeral portrait for him.” And each “scene” typically lasts a few minutes before the entire environment comes apart, fades to white, and the game drops you someplace new — or brings you back to the main menu screen, which features the Man in Pajamas sleeping in his bed.</p><p>The strangeness of it all can make things difficult to follow. The game is often more concerned with exploring ideas about art, consciousness, and human nature rather than having every moment make sense or be “fun.” But it also has a welcome sense of unpredictability; at any moment during my six-hour-long playthrough, I had basically no idea what to expect. I found that, like in a real dream, even if it’s tough to keep everything straight, there are profound moments that stick with you long after it’s over.</p><p><sup>Dreams of Another<em> is available now on PS5 and PC.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/795553/dreams-of-another-review-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, when the Battlefield 6 servers went live, some users who purchased the game on PC via the EA app experienced a nasty entitlement issue that essentially locked them out of playing any of the game's modes. Most users received a message saying they were missing DLC content, and the bug quickly became a meme. A few hours later, everything was fixed, and the impacted players even received some bonuses for their troubles:</p>



<p><em>Today, we experienced an outage on the EA app that prevented some of our players who pre-ordered Battlefield 6 from accessing the game, and we know this can be frustrating so we wanted to offer an apology… with perks. The fix has been rolled out. But we aren't done.</em></p>



<p><em>Anyone on the EA app who was impacted will receive 12 Hardware and 12 Career 60-Minute Boosters, which should be arriving in impacted players' in-game inbox this weekend. In addition, we will also be granting impacted players full access to a seasonal Battle Pass. If impacted players purchased the Phantom Edition, we will be granting them access to Season 2's full Battle Pass.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Interestingly, while the bug was still active, Vince Zampella very candidly <a href="https://x.com/VinceZampella/status/1976738354164277604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told his X followers</a> that he was playing on Steam and recommended getting a refund on the EA app and purchasing the game again on Steam. </p>



<p><em>I have yelled about EA app people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation? </em></p>



<p><em>I am playing on Steam. Can you refund and buy on Steam?</em></p>



<p>It might be strange to see the head of the Battlefield franchise recommend something that effectively goes against the interests of his employer (EA gets full revenue through its own app, whereas it has to give Valve a cut of every purchase made through Steam, just like everyone else), but then again, EA CEO Andrew Wilson is more likely to commend Zampella on a job well done. </p>



<p>The former studio head of Infinity Ward and current studio head of Respawn Entertainment and Ripple Effect Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was appointed new head of the IP in December 2021</a>, just a couple of weeks after the disastrous launch of Battlefield 2042. Given <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how well Battlefield 6 has been reviewed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial concurrency data from Steam</a>, it seems like Zampella and the teams involved (Ripple Effect, DICE, Criterion, and Motive) successfully pulled off a strong comeback for the military shooter series.</p>



<p>That said, if you are playing on PC, there's a chance you might encounter some weird errors. <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We've compiled a troubleshooting guide here</a> to help with those. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has rocketed into Steam's chart of the biggest-ever games, becoming Steam's fourteenth most-popular game of all time by concurrent user numbers on the PC platform within 24 hours of its launch.</p>
<p>Eclipsing even its own free-to-play open beta and Call of Duty's peak numbers, Battlefield 6 is now EA's most successful shooter ever after clocking up 747,440 concurrent players in a single day. And that's only counting Steam players, of course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re on the fence about buying Battlefield 6 because you’ve been burned by EA before, or you simply think Battlefield 6 doesn’t look good, we’ve got 5 reasons to convince you why you should buy Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Let’s start by making things clear: We are not paid by EA to promote <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>The reason we’re bigging it up is because it’s one of the best Battlefield games in years. It fills a void in the FPS market that desperately needed a game like this. Battlefield 6 has learned from past mistakes, resulting in an excellent single-player and online shooter. </p>



<p>We’ve isolated 5 key talking points that could convince you to be a Battlefield believer (we’ll never say that again, promise).</p>



<h2 id="h-1-it-has-a-campaign">1. It Has A Campaign!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No burning bridges this time. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you’re someone who jumps straight into online multiplayer the second you get a new shooter, you can’t deny that having a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-campaign-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 single-player campaign</a> makes for a better overall package. It’s also better value for your money. Battlefield 2042 not having a campaign was borderline criminal, and EA didn’t learn from the negative reception Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 received for doing the same thing.</p>



<p>Yes, it’s not the best campaign in the world, nor is it that memorable. We think it doesn’t necessarily need to be. Having it there is better than not having it at all. It’s also a good little training tool to warm up your shooting skills; learning how weapons work in the game and getting a sense of recoil and movement against AI before you need to use these skills against real people.</p>



<p>It also offers many tough <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-trophy-list-all-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophies and achievements</a> to tick off as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-ea-is-listening-to-you">2. EA Is Listening To You</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leave all the feedback. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>“With over 30 Battlefield Labs sessions successfully completed alongside our community, and a total of 92,351,578 hours played during the Open Beta, Battlefield 6 is the most tested and iterated Battlefield game in history, and player agency remains at the heart of it,” said a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 community post</a>.</p>



<p>It’s no secret that EA has been on something of a vendetta against itself with Battlefield 6. The failure of Battlefield 2042 sent the game’s team back to the drawing board. Battlefield 6’s MO from the beginning has been clear: Listen to the community. If you don’t believe us, take it from Battlefield Studios:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We appreciate all of your suggestions, and want you to know we’re listening. With Season 1 and our roadmap ahead, we’re excited to continue to build a Battlefield that reflects what players want. We’ll continue reading and listening to community channels, and we cannot wait to share more with you, so keep the feedback coming.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The whole team knew that Battlefield 6 couldn’t fail, or it could be the end for the franchise. Time will tell if this remains the goal from day one until a potential next Battlefield release. In the meantime, you can play Battlefield 6 knowing that if you have feedback or criticism, it will be heard.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-more-content-than-any-other-battlefield">3. “More Content Than Any Other Battlefield”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Content upon content. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we head to the Battlefield Comms channel—a terrific communication line between players and the developer. A detailed post outlining the game’s current and upcoming content delivered a simple message: <strong>“Our Seasons will have more content than ever before in a Battlefield game.”</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is a live-service game at the end of the day. This means the usual dripfeed of new content, but we’ve already seen with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Roadmap</a> how seriously EA is taking this. If you commit to the purchase, you know you’re getting a plethora of new maps, weapons, game modes, and everything that <em>you </em>want for the next few years.</p>



<p>We’ll probably get beloved maps and fan-favorite playlists.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-4-free-to-play-battle-royale-mode">4. Free-To-Play Battle Royale Mode</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire away. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>This won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but a free-to-play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode</a> arrives shortly after the game’s full release. It freshens up the concept slightly with the new insta-death circle, and will also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-and-multiplayer-has-the-same-destruction-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature the multiplayer’s destruction</a>—meaning if someone is camping in a house, try to bring it down on them to win the game!</p>



<p>Even though the Battle Royale concept is a bit stale and played out at this point, adding a BR mode to Battlefield 6 once again helps the game’s overall package and value.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-it-s-fun">5. It’s Fun</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beautiful. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The reality is that few AAA games offer the level of destruction and versatility that Battlefield does. Even a ‘bad’ Battlefield game is still pretty good—2042 being the outlier—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-destruction-improved-after-dropping-ps4-and-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s decision to skip the PS4 and Xbox One</a> has allowed Battlefield Studios to improve the franchise’s destruction.</p>



<p>Our time in the Open Beta was delightful, and this really is Battlefield back to its brilliant best. From long, back-and-forth Conquest matches to the pitfalls and pressure of defending an objective in Rush, there really is nothing like Battlefield and its signature ‘moments’. </p>



<hr>



<p>As always, this is the part where you get to say your piece. Either leave a comment or head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> and share your thoughts on Battlefield 6 with us. Did you buy Battlefield 6? If so, what do you think? Or tell us why you won’t be buying it, and why our reasons aren’t convincing enough.</p>

<p>Brainrot Evolution is a grindcore experience that calls forth dynamic progression through Rebirths. The madcap world is divided into distinct maps and surreal Brainrots, each with varying power levels. Smacking every NPC and object you see is the way to go in this Brainrot game.

These codes can be redeemed for free EXP Potions, numerous Crates, and much more. Avoid paying tax in the form of grinding montages by using the codes featured below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-%E2%80%93-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors.1322536/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like many other modern PC releases, Battlefield 6 launched with some issues that prevent players from playing the highly anticipated new entry in EA's FPS series. Thankfully, most of these issues are minor and can be easily fixed.</p>



<p><em>Note: Due to the nature of PC gaming, with different system configurations and driver versions, and with various versions of the game (Steam, EA App, Epic Games Store) these fixes are not guaranteed to work for all players. They are, however, the most common solutions available for the up-to-date version of the game as of October 11, 2025.</em></p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-quick-fix-checklist" data-level="3">Quick Fix Checklist</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-game-not-released-error-steam" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 "Game Not Released" Error (Steam)</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-won-t-launch" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 Won't Launch</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-directx-error-dxgi-error-device-removed" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 DirectX Error "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED"</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-purchase-to-play-or-content-not-installed-error-ea-app" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 "Purchase to Play" or "Content Not Installed" Error (EA App)</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-queue-and-server-errors" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 Queue and Server Errors</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-long-or-infinite-loading-screen" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 Long or Infinite Loading Screen</a></li></ul></div>



<h3 id="h-quick-fix-checklist">Quick Fix Checklist</h3>



<p>Before attempting any in-depth fixes, try these simple, common fixes.</p>



<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Restart the Steam/EA App/Epic Games Store app and Battlefield 6:</strong> Close the game and your platform's launcher, then restart them. This forces an automatic recheck of licenses and updates that may fix minor issues.</li>



<li><strong>Verify/Repair Game Files:</strong> Try the <em>"Verify Integrity Of Game Files" option in Steam or the </em>repair function in the EA App. This fixes corrupted files that may prevent the game from working.</li>



<li><strong>Clear EA App Cache (EA App Users):</strong> Clearing the EA App cache is a common solution for any license verification issue.<br></li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-game-not-released-error-steam">Battlefield 6 "Game Not Released" Error (Steam)</h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 "Game Not Released" error is a Steam issue that prevents some users from downloading or updating the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fix</strong>: The development team has shared an <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1976862813437280350">official workaround</a>, requiring the user to open the game's Properties on Steam and uncheck the Battlefield Multiplayer HD Marker and Battlefield Multiplayer Marker DLC. Alternative fixes include restarting the Steam client or rebooting your system. An official fix has yet to be implemented.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-won-t-launch">Battlefield 6 Won't Launch</h2>



<p>For some users, Battlefield 6 will crash right after the splash screen, and will not launch.</p>



<p><strong>Fix: </strong>Enable Secure Boot in your BIOS/UEFI settings. To do so, you have to make sure your system's BIOS Mode is UEFI and your Windows drive's partition is GPT and:</p>



<ol>
<li>Restart your system and enter the BIOS setting menu by holding the appropriate key for your motherboard (usually the Delete key, F11 or F12)</li>



<li>Access the Advanced Mode in the menu</li>



<li>Access the Boot or Secure Boot option</li>



<li>Enable Secure Boot if disabled.</li>



<li>Save changes and reboot your system</li>
</ol>



<figure><figcaption><em>Before you can fight other soldiers, technical issues may be your Battlefield 6 fiercest enemies.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-directx-error-dxgi-error-device-removed"><strong>Battlefield 6 DirectX Error "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED"</strong></h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 DirectX DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED error is caused by your GPU not correctly recognized by the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Make sure you have the latest drivers from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html">AMD</a> or <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/software/drivers.html">Intel</a> for your graphics card. Updated drivers can also address performance or stability issues. Also, make sure all GPU and CPU overclocks are disabled. Reinstalling the game may also fix this issue. If these fixes don't work, you will have to wait for a patch to address this issue.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-purchase-to-play-or-content-not-installed-error-ea-app">Battlefield 6 "Purchase to Play" or "Content Not Installed" Error (EA App)</h2>



<p>The "Purchase to Play" or "Content Not Installed" error is an EA App issue that prevents the game from starting due to a license verification issue. As the EA App cannot verify if you have purchased the game, it will launch, but you cannot play it.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Clear the EA APP Cache or restart the game. If this doesn't work, you should try reinstalling the game. Joining an active game, whether a friend's or one found via the Community Server Browser, was also confirmed to be a working workaround for some users.</p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE: An <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1976679780264153186">official fix</a> is in the works.</strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-queue-and-server-errors">Battlefield 6 Queue and Server Errors</h2>



<p>Several users are stuck in long queues for online multiplayer or are encountering "Server Disconnected" or "An Unidentified Error occurred" errors.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> For long queues, you only have to wait for your turn. Don't quit, or you will start waiting again from the back of the queue! There are no fixes for the other issues, as they are server-side issues that require developer intervention.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-long-or-infinite-loading-screen">Battlefield 6 Long or Infinite Loading Screen</h2>



<p>Sometimes, Battlefield 6 is stuck in a long, potentially infinite, loading screen.</p>



<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Restarting the game is the only known fix for this issue. If you cannot close the game by closing its window, do so with Task Manager (CTRL+Shift+Esc) after pressing Alt+Tab to get out of the game.</p>



<p>If any of the fixes above have solved your issues, and you can finally enjoy Battlefield 6, congratulations!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-grogu-set-with-hover-pram-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-a-new-record-low.1322533/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one Lego license that consistently flies off the shelves, it’s Star Wars. These sets rarely see significant discounts, which makes today’s deal even more remarkable. The Lego <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4704/">Star Wars Grogu with hover pram building set has dropped to $69 on Amazon, down from its usual $99 price tag</a>. This is the first time this incredibly popular set (boasting an<strong> impressive 4.9 out of 5 stars</strong>) has hit such a record low price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4704/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This <strong>1,048-piece building set</strong> brings everybody’s beloved Force-sensitive foundling to life in breathtaking detail. Over <strong>7.5 inches tall when standing in his hover pram</strong>, it’s not just another fast-assembly figure. Thoughtful engineering allows you to interact with the model long after you’ve finished building it and it captures Grogu’s undeniable charm. With a <strong>dial-controlled arm mechanism</strong>, you have complete control over Grogu’s gestures to recreate those iconic moments when he reaches out to touch whatever comes his attention or attempts to use his powers. His <strong>head smoothly turns to freeze various expressions</strong>, and his characteristic oversized ears can be set to demonstrate curiosity, sleepiness, or wakefulness.</p>
<h2>Why This Set Provides the Magic of The Mandalorian</h2>
<p>The <strong>hover pram itself is a 7-inch long and 6-inch wide base</strong> that doubles as a display piece. It’s the flexibility of having a choice in how you display this build that makes it so interesting. You can display Grogu safely nestled inside his safety pod just as Din Djarin carries him when out adventuring or standing him upright outside for a more dynamic display.</p>



<p>Lego didn’t hold back on the accessories that transformed Grogu into a cultural icon. Three key items that epitomize his personality are included in the set: <strong>a brick-built Sorgan frog</strong> (don’t you recall his snacking ways from Season 1?), <strong>the shifter knob from the Razor Crest</strong> that became a meme immediately, and <strong>a cookie</strong> that he can hold in his miniature hands.</p>



<p>The advanced level of this 1,048-piece set makes it <strong>ideal for builders aged 10 and up</strong> but adult collectors will relish the building process as much. The piece count assures hours of uninterrupted building time which makes it an ideal weekend project or a relaxing evening activity. While other, simpler sets may have you racing to get to the final stages, you’ll have time to smell the Lego, as it were, as you assemble the mechanical components that give Grogu’s movement life.</p>
<p>With the $30 savings, it comes to a price that is difficult to pass up, particularly since those Star Wars sets tend to hold their value or gain it over time.</p>

		<p>Are you picking Battlefield 6 or Little Nightmares 3 this weekend? Obviously other games are available, but these two games are certainly catering to two of the main October gaming traditions – namely big budget FPS launches and horror games – so which are you going to choose?</p>

But before we dive into what we're playing over the next couple of days, let's just look back at some of the recent news highlights.</p>
<p>The big talking point this week was undoubtedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-updates-animated-short-film-close-to-you-with-some-familiar-faces">the debut video(s) from Nintendo Pictures</a>. While there was a lot of mystery surrounding the first release, most had assumed that it would be <strong>Pikmin</strong>-related, and this was indeed confirmed just one day later. It's a lovely release, so do check it out if you haven't already.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-three-more-titles">three SNES games have been added to Nintendo Switch Online</a> – perhaps not the most exciting line-up imaginable, but welcome nonetheless. Alarmo (remember that?) also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-alarmo-is-getting-a-kirby-themed-update">received a new Kirby-themed update</a>, which means we're <em>still</em> waiting for those sweet <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> themes – come on, Nintendo.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Since last weekend was pretty much dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, I'd like to spend a bit of time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> and actually get a decent start on it. On the other hand, I've recently jumped into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt</a>, and my goodness, it's absolutely <em>marvellous</em>. Gorgeous visuals and lots of numbers that keep going up, up, up. It's addictive stuff.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m still banging my head against repeatedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> runs and, once again, it’s refusing to let me go. I don’t think I’m quite as <em>into</em> this one as I was its predecessor, but it’s still a jolly good time and a firm reminder that I am very bad at just about every boss fight going.</p>
<p>If I can put it down, I’d really like to get back to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, which I haven’t touched in about a week but has really gotten under my skin. I’ll wrap it up on PS5 soon enough, I’m sure, but it has to be coming to Switch 2 soon, right?</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I've got a bunch of things to review over the weekend so most of my gaming time will be spent doing that. However, I will also be putting a little time aside especially for Hades II and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> action.</p>
<p>I genuinely can't believe these latest Galaxy 1+2 ports have been out this long and I haven't even started them yet. I'm losing my touch.</p>
<p>I never had a touch.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This week, it's nothing but Hades 2. I was a very good girl and waited until it was out of early access, a feat of willpower for which I deserve the highest praise, and I'm glad I did — although I always feel like I can sort of see the stitches in a formerly-early-access game. I can see the places where they've added more content, like building on an extension after realising that they forgot to put in bathrooms; I can feel the tension between whatever the early combat systems were, and how they ended up changing to be different from the first game, and more like what the early access players wanted. There's a lot of speedrunning and min-maxing stuff, for example. I don't hate it!</p>
<p>But I am less invested in the storyline this time, which is a shame, because Hades was so pivotal to me as a player, designer, and writer. It's like they lost their sense of humour. Supergiant has always had a really masterful way of weaving together cosmic tragedy and silliness (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bastion">Bastion</a> was great at it), but Hades 2 is far more serious. I have strong thoughts on Comedy As Serious Art, and I love when games get it right, so I'm a little disappointed, especially because I love seeing the Gods take things less seriously than mortals would. There are still moments of levity, but they're largely at the side of the Main Story. Still, I'm relatively early in the game — maybe a little under midway through the story? — so perhaps it lightens up a bit!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm reliving my Final Fantasy Tactics obsession through Zach all over again, who's playing on Tactician difficulty. So of course we're getting our backsides handed to us every so often. We're approaching <em>that</em> Chapter 3 fight, so let's see if we get another rude reawakening...</p>
<p>That's pretty much it for me right now — things are busy busy in our household right now! Enjoy your weekends, folks!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Greetings programs! I have arrived at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> point where I am told if I proceed forward, I will miss out on all unresolved side quest content. So instead of properly finishing the game, I will probably be running around the galaxy for odds and ends. Wow, it’s Lando Calrissian! While not properly a new game despite its recent début on the eShop, Söldner-x: Himmellstürmer is giving that euro-shmup bliss I often crave and it was the only game in the series I had never played before with the added bonus of a banger soundtrack by Rafael Dyll. Also making my way to the final missions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gearbits">Gearbits</a> and I've made my way to Cronos in Hades II. Hopefully a defeat of the Titan is on the cards for this weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 31 of 50 games played. Wow, these week’s lot is impressive! Divers is super retro-hardcode hard, Rail Heist is amazing, Vainger gravity switch tricks makes it rather unique, Rock On! Island is super addictive and Pingolf could be a stand alone release! Still more games to come next week.</p>
<p>Game of the week is that Wii forgotten gem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/tron_evolution_battle_grids">TRON Evolution: Battle Grids</a>. In this scribe's humble opinion still the best TRON video game ever made and clearly one destined to be forgotten by time and industry advancements. But despite all the light-cycling and disc throwing shenanigans, I need to ensure part of this weekend is spent cleaning up my new upcoming music album and ensure a smooth release in a few short days time. End of line.</p>
<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>There’s a very quirky, recently released title by Panic called Blippo+, which is basically a TV simulator where you pick up the broadcasts of a distant alien planet where '80s New Wave culture is the norm! The fun thing about it is that you can use a single Joy-Con vertically to as a remote, and it gives me vivid flashbacks of surfing channels on a CRT and stumbling across late-night public access shows as a kid. There’s not much “game” to it, but it’s utterly unique.</p>
<p>I absolutely love Donkey Kong Bonanza<em>,</em> but I’ve been chipping away at it far too slowly and will be firing it up this weekend. Likewise, there are so many P-Switches in Mario Kart World that I’ve yet to discover and complete, and I owe it to myself to improve my paltry Knockout Tour score a little bit, so there’ll definitely be some competitive karting happening.</p>
<p>I’m really curious as to the roadmap for future updates for <em>World</em> and still find it odd that DK and Pauline have only an outfit each. I’m crossing my fingers for a <em>Bonanza</em> tie-in of some kind.</p>

			<p>Battlefield 6 may have <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched ray tracing effects in an effort to deliver optimal performance</a> (which the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-performance-benchmarks-wreck-havoc-break-stuff-with-solid-performance-on-all-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely achieved</a>, as the game runs as smoothly as butter). However, the game, powered by the latest version of the Frostbite engine, is still quite the visual treat.</p>



<p>YouTuber ElAnalistaDeBits has decided to compare the game's maps to their real-life counterparts. In the video embedded below, we can see how the Gibraltar and New York City maps (Iberian Offensive, Empire State, and Manhattan Bridge) stand up to the real locations. Overall, the developers have done an admirable job, to be sure, though of course, there are a few creative liberties here and there. After all, the purpose was not to make the Battlefield 6 maps 1:1 replicas; instead, they sought to replicate the location's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Mere hours after the Battlefield 6 launch, the new installment in the popular military first-person shooter series <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">has already thrashed any previous Steam concurrency records in the franchise</a> with 747K concurrent players. To be fair, though, successful entries such as Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield 1 only landed on Steam in June 2020, many years after their actual debuts. That's because Electronic Arts tried to use the games to push its own launcher, Origin, making them exclusive to the platform. The company <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-is-back-on-steam-with-ea-games-and-ea-access-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only decided to switch strategy in late 2019</a>, returning its games to Valve's platform. Battlefield 2042 launched on November 19, 2021 on both Origin and Steam, but that game had its own issues and only reached a peak of 107K concurrent players.</p>



<p>If you're still on the fence about buying Battlefield 6, perhaps <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review written by David Carcasole</a> can help you decide:</p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play. The single-player campaign fails to impress, but the multiplayer experience more than makes up for it.</em></p>

<p>It's also got an fps boost on Switch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>When the 3D hand-drawn platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside</a> made its debut on Nintendo platforms in June, we noted how there were some performance issues across both the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>It seems the developers have now acknowledged these issues in the latest game update by addressing the frame rate on both hybrid systems. On the Switch 2, you can now look forward to 60fps, and on the original device, you can generally expect "higher fps" than before.</p>
<p>This "huge" new patch also reportedly improves some other aspects of the game. This includes a "smoother camera" and "better combat". Here's the full rundown:</p>

<p>Here's what we had to say about the frame rate of this title on the Switch and Switch 2 in our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Switch 1, the framerate struggles at times, mostly when the game transitions into new areas on-the-fly. Moving seamlessly across the world comes at a cost, it seems. It's a shame, and although they've not spoiled my enjoyment much, they are there and it'd be really nice to have a patch to sort this (and to add the old gyro).</p>
<p>For Switch 2 players, the performance issues present on Switch 1 do carry over to the newer console, and swapping between the two (bad puns flying out of me today), there's very little difference other than perhaps a slight improvement in loading times.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Saturday, and while I’ve not been around for a while, I hope that your streaks are all going strong, pushing into the weekend. I unfortunately lost mine, but it’s time to kick that back into gear with more NYT Connections hints and solutions for Saturday, October 11.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-11">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 11)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #852:</p>



<ul>
<li>ALLEY</li>



<li>SPORT</li>



<li>TACKLE</li>



<li>LANE</li>



<li>TOM</li>



<li>COURT</li>



<li>KIT</li>



<li>BOB</li>



<li>DON</li>



<li>BILL</li>



<li>WEAR</li>



<li>GEAR</li>



<li>PAT</li>



<li>WAY</li>



<li>PUT ON</li>



<li>STUFF</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Whether you’re camping or competing, this collection has you covered.</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Ready for the runway or the rugby pitch? These words help you get suited up.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – You’ll find these at the end of addresses — just don’t take a wrong turn</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – These names double as everyday nouns — from currency to movement.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 11.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 was released yesterday, and some PC-based players have been experiencing issues tied to the EA App, a digital storefront and launcher that supports the game. It has been actively blocking users from booting the game and presenting an error message, which is something that has actively ’embarrassed’ EA leadership.</p>



<p>In a series of social media posts, Respawn Entertainment CEO and co-founder Vince Zampella actively criticized the EA App, suggesting that users consider refunding the game and purchasing it through Steam instead, which offers a more stable experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-vince-zampella-bags-on-the-app-his-owner-created">Vince Zampella Bags on the App His Owner Created</h2>



<p>Respawn Entertainment is one of the many subsidiaries under the Electronic Arts banner, but that hasn’t stopped CEO Vince Zampella from taking to social media to lead a crusade against the EA App.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/VinceZampella/status/1976718941063151656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a post</a> responding to a communication about the rampant EA App issues, Zampella wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have yelled about ea app people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments beneath that post, Zampella admitted he’s playing the game on Steam, and he actively advised others to do the same. When one user explained they had similar issues, Zampella asked if they could refund the game on the EA App and buy it on Steam instead.</p>



<p>He also confirmed that other platforms, like Xbox, aren’t having these issues whatsoever.</p>



<p>When one user demanded that Zampella ‘yell at Andrew Wilson’ (EA’s CEO), Zampella said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not his fault, he’s just as upset as me</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that <strong>as of a few hours ago</strong> (at the time of publishing), the EA App was no longer exhibiting these issues and things had returned to normal for users across the platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July, a PEGI rating surfaced for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Nintendo Switch 2. This was just days after Ubisoft stated the game, which is one of the best-received Assassin’s Creed games in <strong>years</strong>, would be headed to ‘other machines’.</p>



<p>Now, a listing on a French storefront has revealed a placeholder cover and a product description for the game. It could be the site getting ahead of the game, or it could be a slip that was posted early in error. The listing was spotted by eagle-eyed fans, but if it’s a real listing, it comes as no surprise.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2">When is Assassin’s Creed Shadows Coming to Switch 2?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, there’s no release date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Switch 2, but it’s widely believed that it will land in the coming months. It’s looking as though it’ll follow a similar path to Star Wars: Outlaws, which landed on Switch 2 on September 4.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PEGI rating</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 back in July, which is usually applied within a few months of launch and no earlier. Now, a French outlet <a href="https://www.auchan.fr/assassin-s-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2/pr-C1851867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">named Auchan</a> has shown a listing for the game.</p>



<p>On the French storefront, it’s written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience Assassin’s Creed Shadows in a whole new way with Nintendo Switch 2!<br></p>



<p>MASTER THE SERIES’ MOST DEPTH-BASED STEALTH MECHANISMS AND ENJOY VISCERAL COMBAT.<br>Play as Naoe, a cunning shinobi, and use light, sound, and shadows to avoid detection. Infiltrate enemy strongholds with a variety of free-running options, including the new grappling hook, distract guards with shurikens or smoke bombs, and assassinate targets with your Hidden Blade. As the samurai Yasuke, perform silent takedowns with a bow or unleash devastating combos with a katana or naginata.<br></p>



<p>Switch between these two heroes to adapt your strategy and experience feudal Japan through two radically different approaches: stealth or power, shadow or steel.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released in March 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, we praised the game’s visuals, world, and cinematic campaign, all of which were on point for this stellar release.</p>

<p>Return to the garden later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PopCap's highly addictive tower defence series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/plants_vs_zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a> is making a return on the Switch and Switch 2 later this month.</p>
<p>Before you return to the garden in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted</a>, there's a new gameplay trailer you might want to check out. It showcases the Switch 2 GameShare feature, which allows two players to enjoy Local Co-Op or PvP together.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the fine print of the trailer, the Switch 2 system must initiate the GameShare session. And users who receive software via GameShare can only play this software during the session it was shared.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b4736719262f"><a title="Plants vs Zombies Replanted" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b4736719262f/plants-vs-zombies-replanted.large.png"></a></figure>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the 'Replanted' version of the original Plants vs. Zombies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cult classic, Plants vs. Zombies, returns in glorious HD! After years in Crazy Dave’s attic, the original battle between Plants and Zombies is back—bigger, brighter and crazier than ever before. Revisit the epic backyard standoffs you remember, but this time with new levels, fresh twists, and 15 years of never-before-seen franchise history at your fingertips. Relive the glory days of Peashooters, Sunflowers, and brain-hungry chaos. Rejoin the ultimate garden defense and experience the backyard brawl that started a phenomenon—now back for a new era!"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-buds-3-pro-are-going-for-pennies-the-new-airpods-pro-can%E2%80%99t-compete-at-full-price.1322428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and finally added AI features that Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have had for nearly a year now. Samsung got ahead with AI features in its Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which launched way back and still remain at the top of their game. From a value perspective, they’re even more compelling now with this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">post-Prime Day deal on Amazon that drops them to a record low of $172, down from their usual $249 price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>AI integration goes beyond marketing buzzwords</strong> and actually improves your listening experience in practical ways. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro use machine learning to analyze your ear canal shape and ambient noise conditions, then automatically adjust sound output to optimize audio quality for your specific situation. This means the earbuds adapt when you move from a quiet office to a loud street, or when you switch from music to podcasts, adjusting EQ and volume levels on the fly. The real-time translation feature lets you have conversations across language barriers with audio playing directly in your ears as someone speaks in another language. This AI capability <strong>transforms these earbuds into a communication tool rather than just an audio device</strong>.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation That Really Works</h2>
<p>The<strong> active noise canceling system incorporates multiple microphones</strong> that cancel out external noise over the full frequency spectrum. Rumble from motors or HVAC is cancelled out very effectively, while mid-level noise such as voice conversations and typing on the keyboard drop into the background. The adaptive ANC modulates the level depending on where you are so you’re not draining the battery with full cancellation when you’re already sitting in silence. Ambient sound mode does the opposite, streaming external sounds in over the microphones so you hear announcements, traffic, or brisk conversations without removing the earbuds.</p>



<p>Samsung reworked the fit around the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro based on complaints from previous iterations. The new blade design with tilted nozzles fit deeper into the ear canal with more even pressure distribution. It makes a difference during exercises, commutes or marathon listening sessions where ill-fitting earbuds will fall out or make uncomfortable pressure points. The <strong>IP57 rating also means dust and water resistance</strong>&nbsp;so you won’t harm them by sweating during exercise or getting caught in the rain. The protective coverage even extends to immersion under up to one meter’s depth of water for 30 minutes, although you won’t be swimming with them.</p>



<p><strong>Sound quality is improved by dual-driver construction</strong> that decouples the low frequency from the mid and high frequency response. The low end is covered by a specialized woofer and the high end and midrange by a specialized tweeter. The decoupling makes for clearer sound with better detail compared to single-driver earbuds that are not capable of accurately playing the full frequency response.</p>
<p>Battery life is around six hours with ANC enabled and around eight hours with ANC disabled. The <strong>charging case adds around 20 hours or so</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll have enough time before you’ll want to recharge. Fast charging will give you around an hour’s play from five minutes’ charging if time is extremely limited. The Amazon Exclusive version comes with a two-year warranty rather than the one-year coverage you get otherwise, so you have even greater assurance for your pound.</p>
<p>The all-time low price makes the earbuds an extremely smart purchase this time.</p>
