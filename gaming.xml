			<p>A few (fewer than ten, at this time) former ZeniMax Online developers who worked <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the cancelled game Project Blackbird</a> and The Elder Scrolls Online have just announced <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sackbird Studios</a>. This new Baltimore-based indie developer was inspired by the cancellation of Project Blackbird to build a studio that avoids the pitfalls experienced across the industry.</p>



<p>Lee Ridout, Chief Executive Officer at Sackbird Studios, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people. When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.</em></p>



<p>David Worley, Chief Operating Officer at Sackbird Studios, added:</p>



<p><em>After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets. We’re fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games.</em></p>



<p>Sackbird Studios has already started working on an original project for PC and consoles, though, of course, this is way too early to discuss it. The only hint was shared on LinkedIn, where the studio suggested that its mandate is to 'create unforgettable multiplayer experiences that surprise and thrill players'.</p>



<p>Still, we'll monitor the studio's progress over the years. Stay tuned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is PowerWash Simulator 2 Splitscreen? Local Multiplayer Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original PowerWash Simulator game was highly enjoyed by many, but will PowerWash Simulator 2 add splitscreen functionality?</p>



<p>There are many reasons to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look forward to the sequel</a> if you loved the first game, but it’s always nice to see how games like this improve over what came before.</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether PowerWash Simulator 2 has splitscreen or not, and a general look at how multiplayer works.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-splitscreen">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have Splitscreen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A friend could help you get this clean faster. Image by Futurlab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, PowerWash Simulator 2 has splitscreen functionality. You and one other person can play the game from the same screen as you work together to clean up various levels.</strong></p>



<p>This is actually a pretty big development, considering that the original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator game</a> did not have any local multiplayer, only online.</p>



<p>Often these days, video games are going out of their way to remove local multiplayer opportunities. In some cases, this comes down to the performance taking a noticeable dip when the game tries to run two instances at the same time. Hopefully, the splitscreen in PowerWash Simulator 2 isn’t anything that will cause massive frame drops or other issues.</p>



<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 adding dedicated local multiplayer support may actually be one of the reasons that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game isn’t on older hardware</a>. There’s a possibility that the development team was so focused on making sure the splitscreen experience was as smooth as possible that they wanted to make sure only the current generation consoles could run it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-powerwash-simulator-2">How Many People Can Play PowerWash Simulator 2?</h2>



<p><strong>While two people can play PowerWash Simulator 2 in splitscreen, the career mode has been expanded to four players at a time, with free play holding up to six players at once.</strong></p>



<p>These are some pretty notable increases over the original game. The first game only allowed two people to play the career mode together, and in that, only the host was able to save their progress and got a much better reward payout than the joined friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, this time around, all players who join career mode will share all of the progress updates as the host, which allows them to bring their upgrades and unlocked levels into their own save.</p>



<p>Futurlab has definitely taken a big interest in making sure that multiplayer in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> has been improved over the original game. Changes like these are much more friendly to players who want to enjoy the game with others and make it so no one is being left behind just for the “crime” of helping their friend.</p>



<hr>



<p>How many people are you going to play PowerWash Simulator 2 with? Do you plan on doing the career mode with a dedicated splitscreen partner? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Mario &amp; Wario, Bubsy and Fatal Fury Special!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's latest batch of Switch Online SNES games has dropped, and for October three games have been added.</p>
<p>Following his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Purrfect Collection</a> release in September, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bubsy_in_claws_encounters_of_the_furred_kind">Bubsy</a> is now back with Accolade's original 1993 Super Nintendo side-scroller. Along with this, we've got the release of the 1994/95 SNK fighting game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/fatal_fury_special">Fatal Fury Special</a>. It follows on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_2">Fatal Fury 2</a> on the service in January.</p>
<p>And last but not least is Game Freak's <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_and_wario">Mario &amp; Wario</a></strong>. This puzzle-platform title by the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a></strong> developer made its debut on the Super Famicom in 1993, and this marks the first time it's been made available outside of Japan. One catch is, you'll need to use your Joy-Con 2 to play this game (or a USB mouse on the Switch).</p>
<p>Here's the official Nintendo description for each game, along with some screenshots:</p>
<h3><strong>Mario &amp; Wario</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Action puzzles abound in this title released only in Japan for the Super Famicom™ system in 1993. Wario has dropped a bucket on poor Mario's head, and now he can't see! So it's up to you to lead Mario safely to Luigi. Use the forest fairy's magic wand to create platforms, change the direction Mario walks, and defeat enemies. You can clear a total of 100 screens full of unique challenges using simple controls—just move the mouse to move the fairy and click the left button once to perform actions.</p>

<h3><strong>BUBSY™ in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bubsy the bobcat is on the prowl to recover his stolen yarn! Play as the furr-ocious feline himself in this action title released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System™ in 1993. Bubsy's grand adventure begins when his precious yarn is stolen by a race of yarn-obsessed aliens, the Woolies. Gallivant across 16 total stages, each containing an average of 300 screens, packed with wacky enemies and kooky mechanics. Dash through every nook and cranny of these vast stages as you search for yarn balls scattered throughout and make for the goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>FATAL FURY SPECIAL</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Pit 15 different fighters against each other! This fighting game, released for the Super NES™ console in 1995, includes the original eight characters from FATAL FURY 2, as well as three new characters (Billy Kane, Axel Hawk, and Laurence Blood) and a new boss (Wolfgang Krauser). Additionally, three characters from the original FATAL FURY (Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, and Geese Howard) have returned to the fight. By building on the appeal from the previous game with its two-line battles, special moves, and powerful finishers, on top of further improving the series's formula, this game is truly worthy of the title "SPECIAL." And if you can meet certain special conditions, Ryo Sakazaki from the ART OF FIGHTING series will make a special guest appearance, which is noteworthy in itself!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same three titles have also been released on the Super Famicom - Nintendo Classics service in Japan this month. Mouse support for the SNES digital collection arrived alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> release in July. Nintendo has added this control option for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-four-more-titles">other games on the service</a> as well.</p>

<p>It's already outpacing Switch and PS4</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella, Nintendo's new hybrid device sold 2.4 million units over its first three months on the market (from June to August), placing the system five percent ahead of the PlayStation 4's previous "record-setting pace", which shifted 2.2 million units within the same time frame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With 2.4M units sold LTD over its first 3 months market, Nintendo Switch 2 is now 5% ahead of the previous record setting pace of PlayStation 4, which sold 2.2M units during the 3 months ending January 2014."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4nyqhgv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Piscatella further notes how these sales were able to offset "double-digit percentage declines" across the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Switch. It doesn't stop there, either – with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-sales-in-the-us-are-outpacing-the-original-console-by-75percent">Switch 2's unit sales trending</a> ahead of "time-aligned sales" of Nintendo's original hybrid unit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 unit sales are trending 77% ahead the time-aligned sales of the original Nintendo Switch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo's financial results in August previously confirmed Switch 2 hardware sales had exceeded <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">"6 million units globally"</a> in the seven weeks after launch. It also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">shared a regional breakdown</a> of Switch 2 hardware sales for this period.</p>
<p>As for the best-selling games in the US in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> made the top 10, coming in at seventh place (down from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/donkey-kong-bananza-is-selling-like-bananas-on-switch-2-us">third spot in the previous month</a>). Although this placement does not factor in the game's digital sales.</p>

The 27-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor that a couple of <em>Verge </em>staffers have tested is <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-27-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw2725q/apd/210-brfr/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored">$699.99</a> right now, which is $200 off its original $899.99 price.

My colleague Nathan Edwards digs it, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/784323/upgrading-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor">posting recently</a> about how making the jump to a high-refresh-rate 240Hz OLED can truly spoil you. I can attest to this; it was a little heartbreaking to go back to my 1080p IPS panels after returning the AW2725Q to Alienware.</p><p>This Alienware monitor made waves in early 2025 by proving that companies could deliver a 4K OLED for under $1,000. It wasn’t all that long ago that 1440p was the standard at that price. Whether you actually have a PC that can play games in 4K at respectable frame rates or not, it’s good to have a monitor that’s ready to play high-resolution content for when you upgrade your PC. Also, you can connect a console like a PS5, Xbox Series X, or a Nintendo Switch 2 to play titles at up to 4K at 120Hz, and they’ll look great on the AW2725Q’s 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/796918/amazon-october-prime-day-alienware-aw2725q-oled-gaming-monitor-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Discord Denies Recent Claims About 1.5TB Of Data Being Stolen]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Discord has denied that the party responsible for the recent security breach against the company has the data it claims to have. </p>



<p>On Wednesday, the group claiming responsibility for the hack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/discord-hackers-claim-to-have-1-5tb-of-age-verification-photos/">said that it had gained access</a> to over 1.5TB of data, including over 2 million age-verification photos. In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, Discord said that not only is the number not true, but it’s not even close. </p>



<p>Discord spokesperson Nu Wexler&nbsp;tells Insider Gaming that it has identified around 70,000 users “that may have had government ID photos exposed.” The public claims by the group, they say, are all being done as a means to extort the company.</p>



<p>The full statement from Discord is as follows:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Following&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">last week’s announcement</a>&nbsp;about a security incident involving a third-party customer service provider, we want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online.&nbsp;First, as stated in our blog post, this was&nbsp;not&nbsp;a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review&nbsp;<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041820932-Help-I-m-old-enough-to-use-Discord-in-my-country-but-I-got-locked-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">age-related appeals</a>. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All affected users globally have been contacted and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities, and external security experts. We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The incident that involved lost data took place in late September and was addressed on October 3 by the company. At the time, the company said that information such as Discord usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and “limited” billing information was compromised. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2017's indie 3D platformer&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/yooka-laylee-review-flying-lizard-monster" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Laylee</a>&nbsp;</em>from Playtonic Games, a studio founded by former Rare staffers, was aiming to catch "lightning in a bottle" with the release, which was positioned to be <em>Banjo-Kazooie's</em> spiritual successor. While the game received mixed responses following its release and a spin-off game, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yooka-laylee-and-impossible-lair-out-this-october" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>,</em> launched some time later, there were calls for another adventure with Yooka and Laylee, and after eight years, Playtonic returns with <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yooka-replaylee-release-date" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Replaylee</a>.</em></p>

<p>Quite simply, it's "better late than never," as nearly a decade later, with <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> becoming a cult favorite among platformer enthusiasts and eventually the broad gaming community, the time felt perfect for these tandem adventurers to reemerge once again.</p>

<p>This time around, Playtonic paid attention to the players and the community with a thoughtful remaster of the 2017 release to include new content and optimizations for modern consoles, resulting in the epic grand return of Yooka and Laylee.</p>

Quick, help them! (Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> Review: The Epic Grand Return</h2>

<p>Much like the original 2017 indie platformer release,&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee</em>, the game's remaster sees our heroes briefly recounting their past adventures aboard "The Batship Crazy" in epic fairytale style&nbsp;before their fleet got beached due to an incoming storm. Nevertheless, this mishap didn't deter the duo, as after landing safely and repairing their ship, they traversed their new location and encountered a caged magical book, the One Book.</p>

<p>While their deeds were truly appreciated, this event annoyed&nbsp;the nefarious&nbsp;CEO Capital B (who looks like Gru from&nbsp;<em>Despicable Me</em>) and his underappreciated yet equally villainous cohort, Dr. Quack, back at the Hivory Towers. Distraught at the disappearance of the One Book, Dr. Quack switched to Plan B to recapture the book; however, while vacuuming all the books, several pages or Pagies of the One Book gets ripped from its spine, thus getting scattered across the world levels. It's up to Yooka and Laylee to collect the Pagies to reassemble the One Book before Capital B and Dr. Quack.</p>

<p>And this is where the journey for the adventurous duo begins, as they must collect the Pagies across world levels or Grand Tomes while acquiring their first in-game currency of gold coins called Q.U.I.D.S,&nbsp;Quills, and puzzle pieces along their journey. But they won't be alone, as a few familiar faces will aid them with unique upgrades called Tonics, some snazzy customization pieces, clues, and a spade-donning knight who seemingly found themselves lost but comes to Yooka and Laylee to call for help in taking down&nbsp;Capital B and&nbsp;Dr. Quack for good this time around.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review:&nbsp;An Absolute Page Turner</h2>

<p>Playtonic Games has listened to player feedback and delivered what could possibly be the best <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> game we needed by overhauling everything that first appeared in the original release, including the world design, gameplay mechanics, puzzles, challenges, audio, and visuals.</p>

<p>While these mass changes from top to bottom make <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> vastly different from the&nbsp;2017 release, much of the story, hilarious jokes, and puns are still the same, retaining that nostalgic feeling we first experienced in <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-642.jpg?itok=AmOtCOf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-642.jpg?itok=0dDjjcc_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players get to revist key Grand Tome locations, including Moodymaze Marsh, all revamped and reimagined for Yooka-Replaylee. (Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of the game's story, after Yooka and Laylee free the One Book before the book got vacuumed, Yooka and Laylee must explore several Grand Tomes by jumping into large storybooks and exploring these areas to find Pagies, Quills, puzzle pieces, and&nbsp;Q.U.I.D.S before moving to the next world level. As previously mentioned, the story and narrative beats are still the heartbeat of <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, by introducing slight changes to the story's presentation and pacing, leaving room for the developers to showcase their comedic writing.</p>

<p>In the words of the salesman Trowsers, "thank goodnessss," because while the devs can truly let their writing take centerstage, the execution in how the narrative beats, jokes, and puns were delivered was outstanding, as one can feel the writing team has more confidence and pride in their work. This also gives Yooka and Laylee, as well as the supporting characters, so much more personality and wit, while much of the fluff and annoying dialogue has been scrubbed away, allowing one to truly appreciate the remaster's story and the cast of characters.</p>

<p>In terms of gameplay, <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> is still very much a 3D platformer collect-a-thon game, which players will spend much of their time collecting Pagies to unlock doors within the Hivory Towers and locate other Grand Tomes. Quills and Q.U.I.D.S serve as the in-game currencies for Yooka and Laylee to spend on various items and upgrades. Players assume control of this tandem as they explore multiple world levels, utilizing various abilities already accessible at the start of the game, with tighter gameplay controls that make traversal and platforming smoother and more rewarding.</p>

<p>There were times when the controls failed us, mostly when platforming, but this was largely attributed to the camera angles guiding us off the platform or not being able to use specific abilities like the Sonar Shot and Sonar 'Splosion to hit invisible targets effectively. What was a blessing was the ability to use rolling to knock down enemies, move up slippery surfaces, destroy crates, or evade danger swiftly, which players can now roll infinitely and mind their business without consuming energy.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review:&nbsp;Sssay It Ain't Ssso</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-643.jpg?itok=SR_MkYk9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-643.jpg?itok=ywUD-nDd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Having a map really comes in handy as it helps players track all challenges, fast travel, and Pagie locations.&nbsp;(Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>As each world level has been massively revamped to accompany the overhaul of gameplay mechanics, the world levels are now significantly larger for players to explore, featuring overworlds, cavern systems, and underworld areas, as well as a World Map to refer to and check which areas haven't been explored or Pagies haven't been collected.</p>

<p>Traversal feels more fun and exciting with the fast-travel system, as players can locate and activate bookmarks called Mark to warp to specific areas to revisit challenges or farm more Q.U.I.D.S., so players' time isn't wasted by dashing from one corner of the map to the next.</p>

<p>Gameplay progression has also been reworked for <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> as players are now geared to collecting a specific number of Pagies needed to unlock new areas within the Hivory Towers to access Grand Tomes. While the previous level progression system, which was controversial at the time, has been done away with in <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, the removal of this system does lead to unusual difficulty spikes in the remaster, which caught us off guard at times.</p>

<p>Given the brilliance with which Playtonic has remastered&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee</em> for modern hardware, there are a few minor bugs that we're sure Yooka will gobble up in no time. Sure, some of the challenges in&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>&nbsp;have upped the difficulty, which will require players to "lock in" (certainly one did even after multiple failed attempts), players may encounter a few visual and latency issues on PC for the time being, but it's not too bothersome.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-641.jpg?itok=5mNU8PVi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-641.jpg?itok=WnydVLQ_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> does have its shortcomings; however, the new changes and improvements certainly makes it stand out from its original release. (Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, fans of this iconic duo will certainly not be disappointed with this outstanding and "definitive remastered and enhanced version" of <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>. Boasting a revamp of the classic 3D platformer, which sees multiple Grand Tomes and their worlds reimagined with new challenges, more Pagies to collect, familiar faces to aid Yooka and Laylee and assist in navigating the terrains, and so much additional content to keep players coming back to test their platforming skills.</p>

<p>Likewise, some of Yooka and Laylee's moveset and team combos have been reworked and are much easier to acquire by visiting the various vendors found within these worlds, and they can bag themselves some new threads to don and show off their fashionista sides. And let's not forget that the devs retained the game's sense of humor, as the jokes and puns have been one-upped, which had left one giggling long after they were mentioned.</p>

<p>Mind you, the game does have a few optimization errors, such as cutscenes and entering new Grand Tomes having slight latency bugs momentarily, but they didn't affect the overall gameplay experience. Additionally, the issues with the level progression system have left the game riddled with random difficulty spikes that will cause some frustration when exploring each world level, while leaving these levels with no structured design, but it didn't deter us from having an incredible, nostalgic trip down memory lane.</p>

You could not pay me to go to the moon, I think. I'm glad Mr. Armstrong and Buzz Lightyear had a good time up there, but that place is scary! It's just a massive, dark rock! But in the case of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-moon">Dark Moon</a>, an upcoming survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game that just got a release date, that darkness is your friend, because if you want to survive on the moon, you've got to protect yourself from that hot, hot orb in the sky called the sun.
</p>
<p>
In Dark Moon, your goal is simple: stay the hell out of the sun's path. This is a world where the sun's rays will burn you to a crisp, so you need to constantly be moving to make sure you're on the dark side of the moon (the scariest side and potential all-time best cover art for an album ever). So the story goes, you are a member of the Engineering Council, tasked with managing the construction of a mining system on the moon that gets all donked up after a solar storm hits the Earth, destroying all electronics, and leaving you without any form of communication.

<p>
To get around the moon, you have a big ole spider-like vehicle called the Mechaplex, which serves as your main base of operations. Each playthrough is supposedly non-linear; as you make your way across the moon, you might come across survivors that want to join you (who may not have your best interests at heart), or you might need to gather up minerals to better survive.
</p><p>
You can build upon the Mechaplex too, netting your crew better abilities, or making easier and faster ways to get around. Occasionally you may have to make difficult choices related to said crew, the members of which may react positively or negatively depending on who you let onto the Mechaplex, and who you leave behind. Slightly nightmarish scenario to be honest! Better that it's a video game and not my lived experience.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and that release date! It's coming October 29th, so it's only a few weeks away now. Seems seasonally appropriate, even if I don't know I can handle it due to existential dread reasons. Might be worth adding to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1105330/Dark_Moon/">wishlist on Steam</a> if it tickles your fancy, though.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skate%E2%80%99s-charging-35-for-a-dead-space-skin-that-looks-like-a-bad-cosplay-made-outta-junk-from-home-depot.1320304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Skateboarding games are a hell of a good time and EA’s recent <i>skate</i>, the free-to-play title aiming to reboot EA’s once-cherished series, is trying to lure folks back into the thrills of digital ollies and kickflips. And because it’s a free-to-play game from a AAA publisher in 2025, it’s got microtransactions and seasons and all that stuff. While we mostly tolerate this silliness in games nowadays, some stuff is just too expensive and too ugly to pass without comment.</p> <p>Instead of throwing money at the screen for a skin of space zombie-stomper Isaac Clarke from <i>Dead Space</i>, fans of <i>skate</i> have taken to the internet to throw shade at the developers for selling such an ugly version of Clarke for $35 bucks (h/t <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-fans-slam-35-isaac-clarke-costume-in-eas-new-skate/1100-6535310/">comrade Pitts at <i>GameSpot</i></a>). That’s like, a whole meal at Taco Bell these days (with maybe a drink if you’re lucky). It’s also the price of many full, complete games you can play from start to finish. That’s probably what’s left folks so sore: <i>skate</i>. Is the type of game you could once plunk down a moderate sum for and be done with it, but is now yet another nagging wallet leech trying to bank on your nostalgia.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can buy 3 Dead Sapce games with that money  (and probably 3 Skate games)</p> <p>— Diogo Rodrigues (@Rodrigues_520) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rodrigues_520/status/1975629911059800416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The situation reminds us just how far we’ve come from an era of gaming that felt more respectful of our time and money. One fan over on r/SkateEA points out that 2010’s <i>Skate 3</i> had an Isaac Clarke skin–but it was free and seemed more faithful to the character’s appearance in the original game.</p>

    <p>It’s a real shame as <i>skate</i> looks like a good time otherwise, full of all of the crazy stuff we’ll never be able to do in real life on a skateboard.</p>   <p>And as another fan on Reddit opines, the game’s battle pass (skate pass?) just contains “ugly accessories and clothing along with phoned in feeling graphics for decks” instead of stuff from actual skate brands. And if ever there was an industry that was ripe for having its aesthetics&nbsp; cut up and sold in little bits, it’s the skateboard industry. With its various legendary designs, from the <a href="https://www.birdhouseskateboards.com/">epic birds of Birdhouse Skateboards</a> to the gorgeous artwork found on your average <a href="https://www.elementbrand.lu/skateboards/">Element board</a> (which used to my brand of choice back in the day), there’s a ton of cool designs that could be packaged into the game as a fitting tribute to the industry. I’d still be annoyed if those cost $35 a piece, but at least they’d feel a little more relevant.</p>  <p>C’mon, EA.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Doja Cat is coming to <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536">Fortnite’s 2025 Halloween event</a> and the battle royale tried to get players hyped by letting R&amp;B’s “Queen of Memes” take over the <em>Fortnite</em> X account on Wednesday. It didn’t take long for that piece of online performance art to blow up after the account tweeted what seemed like an obvious allusion to sex toys and Doja Cat denied being behind it. “Shit cringe as fuck now I’m embarrassed,” she wrote back.</p> <p>The<em> Fortnite</em> X account had Doja Cat’s in-game face as its avatar when it posted “mother of rose toys,” which many fans immediately took to mean sex toys. “Oh damn the sex update is real!!” one joked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1o1jdub/mother_of_rose_toys/">on the subreddit</a>. But Doja Cat immediately distanced herself from the whole thing and the post was taken down. People didn’t believe her at first. “I told them not to man that’s not even me,” she wrote. “I said this yesterday and then said ‘don’t post that’ :/.”</p> <p> <figure id="attachment_2000633342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633342"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633342">X</figcaption></figure> </p> <p>The internet-savvy artist has a history of trolling and back-handed marketing endorsements, as <a href="http://he internet-savvy artist known for trolling"><em>Polygon</em> points out</a>. So many are left wondering whether this was an actual brand activation gone bad or part of some elaborate 4D poster chess to get people talking and arguing about what is, at the end of the day, a microtransaction-filled in-game event aimed at getting players to empty their virtual wallets on overpriced skins. Is the modern media landscape so cynical as to desperately gin up a non-troversy just to pad the quarterly sales figures?</p> <p>Some folks are genuinely surprised that a game largely aimed at children would go anywhere near sexual entendres, even if the whole thing really is just a social media fake-out on page seven of the <em>Fortnite</em> Halloween 2025 marketing deck. With the culture already primed to lash out at any online gaming-adjacent micro-scandal, it does seem a bit far-fetched that Epic Games would willingly ignite a whole discourse cycle around “<em>Fortnite</em> sex toys.”</p> <p>After all, it only just got done making sure there weren’t any accidental Nazi allusions in its latest <a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-s2-fortnite-dance-nazi-swastika-refund-2000630714"><em>Peacemaker</em> emote</a> following some late season-2 twists. It’s due back tomorrow with a “modified” animation that will apparently remove any possibility of it accidentally conjuring a swastika. Then again, Epic didn’t seem too worried about Darth Vader, voiced by AI James Earl Jones, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-star-wars-ai-darth-vader-james-earl-jones-1851781018">saying racist stuff and cursing at players,</a> so who can say?</p>

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Americans are spending more on game consoles in 2025, compared to August of last year, and that’s mostly thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 and tariffs. Hardware sales topped $312 million in the US in August, up 32 percent from $236 million in August of 2024, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op74cc4s26">according to Circana</a>. That’s a huge increase, especially considering that sales of the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and original Switch all fell by double-digit percentage points year over year.</p><p>A big driver is the Switch 2, which has sold over 2.4 million units in the US during its first three months, making it the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest selling console</a> of all time. It’s outpacing the PlayStation 4 (the previous record holder) by a full five percent after the three month mark. And compared to the original Switch, the Switch 2 is absolutely crushing — outpacing its predecessor by 77 percent at this stage of its lifecycle.</p><p>Consumer spending on game consoles in the US is up to $2.9 billion for the year, 20 percent higher than last year. But while the number of consoles sold is up 6.5 percent year-over-year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">prices are up 12.3 percent</a>, accounting for most of the increase in spending. A 512GB Xbox Series S started the year at $299.99, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">is now $399.99</a>. The all-digital Series X started at $449.99, and is now all the way up to $599.99. Similarly all PlayStation 5 models have seen a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">$50 price bump</a>.</p><p>Despite the soaring prices, consumers haven’t been scared off yet. But, while $799.99 for a tricked out 2TB Xbox Series X in Galaxy Black is hard to swallow, we haven’t quite reached <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/7/17830868/neo-geo-mini-review-arcade-imperfect">Neo Geo prices</a> yet. That handheld debuted at $649.99 in 1990 — or about $1,500 in today’s money.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms">Tim Sweeney</a>, CEO of Epic Games, thinks that automated chatbots can be used to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-boss-makes-a-bold-claim-about-ai-in-video-games/1100-6532073/">enrich games with auto-generated dialogue</a>. But what he and his company don’t like, however, is the end user using bots to bring false life to lifeless server rooms so that user-created maps can earn money even if nobody’s actually playing them.</p> <p>Two Michigan-based <i>Fortnite</i> creators, Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser, are at the center of a lawsuit filed by Epic Games that alleges they created 20,000 bots to falsely inflate the popularity of their maps (h/t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/epic-games-fortnite-creative-bot-lawsuit-uefn-idris-nahdi-ayob-nasser/">comrade Hernandez at <i>Polygon</i></a>). And they weren’t just doing it because they were lonely and wanted thousands of bot friends. Generating engagement on <i>Fortnite </i>maps is akin to printing money, as <i>Fortnite</i>’s “Island Creator” program sees folks earn real cash for making genuinely cool stuff that appeals to genuine people. Create a cool island that attracts loads of players, and Epic will make it worth your while.</p>

 <p>But alas, we live in a society with “rules.” And one of <i>Fortnite</i>’s creator program rules is that engagement is measured by real people playing the game. This is in addition to some pretty <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-uefn-call-of-duty-dmca-creator-copyright-1850299456">strict rules about intellectual property</a>.</p> <p>Epic Games alleges that the defendants were intentionally trying to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DAltzrgrMn8">circumvent</a> the program’s terms of service, having bots flood their islands “using a cloud gaming service that allows users to play video games, like <i>Fortnite</i>, remotely.”</p>

 <p>If true, it’s a computer abuse scheme that went on to earn the defendants tens of thousands of dollars. But Epic eventually caught on, cut them off and ordered the duo to stop playing the game and “destroy all copies of <i>Fortnite</i>” they currently had. The two apparently didn’t listen and continued playing <i>Fortnite</i>, and so now Epic is escalating things, alleging that:</p>

 <p>Defendants’ conduct undermines Epic’s relationship with developers,…depriving legitimate developers of the full share of funds they otherwise would have received and eroding the trust Epic has built with them.</p> <p>Epic Games is seeking financial recuperation, but also wants to ban not only these players but also their entire bloodlines from ever playing <i>Fortnite</i> again. No, I’m not being snarky and for once in my life it seems that I don’t need to be: The lawsuit literally wants to ban Nahdi and Ayob Nasser and their “heirs [and] successors” from playing <i>Fortnite</i>.</p> <p>Rational behavior from rational people.</p>

              <p>Unlike Microsoft, it’s hard to see Nintendo ever bringing its games to PlayStation 5. Someone’s taking advantage of that fact with a store listing for a seemingly fake game that looks an awful lot like <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>. It’s called<em> Anime Village Online</em>, and that’s probably the most distinct thing about it.</p> <p>A <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10017289">recently discovered store listing</a> for the game shows what looks like a human Villager from <em>Animal Crossing</em> jumping into the air beneath a blue sky. The description for <em>Anime Village Online</em> reads like a summary of everything the Nintendo franchise is best known for. “Design and expand your own charming house, craft furniture, grow crops, catch fish, and decorate your surroundings to match your personal style,” it reads. “Wander through beautiful forests, rivers, beaches, and hidden paths. Discover resources, meet NPC villagers, and unlock new items and areas as you play.”</p>

   <p><em>Anime Village Online</em> will allegedly feature cross-platform multiplayer and arrive sometime in 2027. Who’s making it? The developer is listed as Wisnu Sudirman. According to a LinkedIn page bearing the same name, that person is a recent graduate who lives in Indonesia. <em>Anime Village Online</em> isn’t their only hustle either. They’re also apparently making a game called <em>Rooted: Survival</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Desastre_Show/status/1782483445085520227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1782483445085520227%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">with store page art</a> that makes it look like an AI-generated rip-off of <em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633325"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633325">Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>“<em>Rooted: Survival</em> is a brutal, atmospheric survival experience set in a world consumed by the aftermath of bacteriological warfare. A century after civilization collapsed, nature has reclaimed the earth—but it didn’t come alone,” reads the description. But my favorite part is the disclaimer: “All referenced game titles, brands, characters, and visual elements are the property of their respective owners. Any similarities are intended purely as homage or satire for entertainment purposes. No copyright infringement is intended.”</p> <p>Is this an elaborate troll? Someone making a point about the lack of moderation on the PlayStation Store? After all, this is far from the only <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">AI-looking slop</a> adorning listings seemingly meant to trick casual players just searching for whatever’s popular. Usually, those entries target popular indie games from Steam that lack the resources to police their IP rights on other platforms, not one of the most notoriously litigious companies in gaming and the owner of the platform itself. We’ll see if it actually ends up mattering.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft reportedly canceled an entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise last year after determining that its proposed setting--the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era of the 1860s and 1870s--was too controversial for its audience, according to the newsletter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=175622801&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=1t4m1&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File.</a></p><p>The game, which was canceled early in development, would have put players in control of a Black protagonist who escaped enslavement and started a new life away from the South. He is later recruited by the Assassins, returns to the South, and confronts prominent racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>Three sources told Game File that the game was cancelled due to online backlash after the reveal of Yasuke, a historically-inspired Black samurai, as a protagonist in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the uneasy political climate in the United States. Developers working on the project were upset, believing that the company was giving in to perceived controversy.</p><p>Ubisoft has developed and published Assassin's Creed games set in North America before. Assassin's Creed 3 takes place during the American Revolution, set in 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier. It follows two protagonists, including one half-Indigenous Assassin seeking to avenge the death of his mother.</p>

            <p>
Everybody makes mistakes! That's life, really, a constant series of tiny mistakes that are sometimes good ones, sometimes bad ones, occasionally purposeful, often not. Here's one that was very much not purposeful: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-park-classic-edition">Pico Park: Classic Edition</a>, a delightful co-op puzzle platformery game you've almost definitely seen a bunch of Twitch streamers play during COVID lockdown, is now permanently free.
</p>
<p>
For some context, Pico Park: Classic Edition released almost 10 whole years ago in 2016, and despite the fact that up to 10 people can play together, it was an offline only game. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/461040/view/511841259183144976">August</a>, developer Tecopark said that they were thinking of updating the game soon to add in online support, an update that did in fact arrive in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/461040/view/563634739104186763?l=english">September</a>, and one that they thought they "might charge a small fee for." Come September, the update is released, and online play is added, with plans to keep it free for about a week.
</p>
<p>
Except, Steam apparently doesn't allow you to switch between a game being paid-for and free an infinite number of times, resulting in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/">this message</a> from Tecopark: "I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support. but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! :) If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (Pico Park, Pico Park 2) too."
</p>
<p>
Welp! Truly seems like there's not much to be done there, but the matter of fact approach to the news that the game is permanently free does tickle me. What else can you do in a situation like that? I doubt that Pico Park: Classic Edition was making all that much for Tecopark in any case, particularly with Pico Park (2021) being as popular as it is.
</p><p>If you're wondering, "why didn't they just discount it to 100% off?" the answer is you can't! The maximum discount you can set on Steam is 90% off. Don't ask me why, it's just one of those weird Steam things that robs mostly inconsequential control from developers that release games on the platform.
</p>
<p>
In any case, unless you're someone who likes to keep their Steam library as lean as possible (you're not better than the rest of us), it's a fun little game to add to your library free of charge.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Baby Steps</i> is the latest hilariously difficult game from Bennett Foddy of <i>QWOP </i>and <i>Getting Over It</i>, here working in collaboration with Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch. And it’s not just in your efforts to put one foot in front of the other and make progress that the game finds ludicrous ways to punish you. Players have discovered that, should you dare to skip the cutscenes throughout your ordeal, you’ll be treated to an unskippable 28-minute cutscene. Congratulations to Foddy &amp; co. for innovating bold new ways for video games to fuck with you.</p> <p>The game loves to do that. Not only does it take the concept of a “walking simulator” to the extreme, making the act of placing one foot in front of the other wonderfully tricky and maddening, but it plays games with its cutscenes, too. Again, literally. Cutscenes taunt you with a mini-game that you must complete if you want to skip ‘em.</p>

 <p>And if you’re really so tempted to give the game the proverbial middle finger and skip all of the cutscenes by passing these mini-games, at the end of the game you’ll be confronted with an unskippable 28-minute cutscene featuring two characters talking about how much of a bummer it is that so much work went into these cutscenes and yet, there you are, just skipping them. Wow. I hope you feel bad about yourself.</p>

 <p>If you’re not up for making your own way, step by hilariously agonizing step, through <i>Baby Steps</i>, skipping the cutscenes all the while, you can watch the whole thing here:</p>   <p>Anyway, the anthropomorphic donkey is enough to sell me on this game. Just what I need, more 2025 gems to fill up my already dense-ass backlog.</p>

                <p>Literal walking simulator Baby Steps is already a punishing affair, but the game has one last trick up its sleeve that might make certain players fume with rage.</p><p>If you skip enough cutscenes in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/well-this-esrb-description-sure-is-a-wild-ride/1100-6534659/" data-ref-id="1100-6534659">wacky and raunchy Baby Steps</a>, you'll be treated (or penalized, depending how you look at it) with a meandering 28-minute long cutscene full of meta jokes and haphazard conversation topics, which user Cuttyflame shared on YouTube (per <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/skipping-all-baby-steps-cutscenes-unlocks-a-secret-28-minute-punishment-cutscene/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p>Baby Steps, which was made by Ape Out developers Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and QWOP creator Bennett Foddy, actively discourages players you skipping story cutscenes, requiring you to complete minigames that increase in complexity each subsequent time you try to skip a scene.</p><p>Skipping around 30 cutscenes results in this shaggy dog story of a cutscene playing at the end of the story, according to Cuttyflame.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQahQACsvPU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mQahQACsvPU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The secret ending cutscene has protagonist Nate, voiced by Cuzzillo, reaching the cabin of donkey-human hybrid Moose, voiced by Foddy. Nate makes some fourth wall-breaking comments about the player skipping cutscenes, beginning a long-winded conversation with a spread of topics.</p><p>From their interest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-new-ip-intergalactic-has-the-deepest-gameplay-the-studio-has-ever-done/1100-6531793/" data-ref-id="1100-6531793">Naughty Dog's next game</a> to their favorite fictional clowns, Cuzzillo and Foddy go on and on, adding in additional jabs toward cutscene skippers and joking that they'll likely skip this scene as well.</p><p>The role of non-interactive cinematics in what is otherwise a very interactive medium of entertainment has always been a subject of debate, but this extended scene almost feels like Cuzzillo and Foddy putting a spotlight on their voicework and shaming players for missing out on it, though all in good fun.</p><p>Baby Steps is currently available only on PlayStation 5 and PC, along with being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baby-steps-is-steam-deck-verified-meaning-you-can-just-throw-the-whole-system-when-frustrated/1100-6534828/" data-ref-id="1100-6534828">verified for Steam Deck</a>.

                <p>Company of Heroes developer Relic Entertainment is keen to make and release games faster, CEO Justin Dowdeswell said in a new interview, but the company isn't banking on AI to get there.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-relic-entertainment-wants-to-make-games-more-quickly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Dowdeswell said one of the company's Achilles heels is that it has taken too long to release new games. "There's long stretches of time between game releases, and you lose touch with the players, people lose touch with what you're up to--and they generally cost a lot more, the longer they take," he said.</p><p>Part of what Relic will look to do in the future is "get to market more frequently," and that doesn't mean the company wants to lower the quality bar and simply ship things faster for the sake of it.</p><p>How can Relic achieve this? Already, the studio has improved how fast it can prototype new ideas, Dowdeswell said, noting that staffers can now get a prototype up and running in four weeks. The executive added that improving project management and specifically controlling scope is another way.</p><p>Could AI help Relic make games even faster, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">some developers are attempting</a>? Dowdeswell said businesses around the world today are "trying to figure out" how AI can help them, and right now, AI tools and systems are helpful for Relic in "workflows around the office."</p><p>"Even just reviewing something or summarizing something. I get more done. And I think that there's something in that concept of getting more done, that's part of where the power is," he said.</p><p>As for actual game development, Dowdeswell said humans will continue to be essential to the process. "We still need people making decisions, we still need people coming up with ideas, we still need people creating an architecture," he said. "And for me at least, it's not about replacing people, it's just [about taking] some of the slightly more annoying things off the list and getting them done more quickly. There's power in that."</p><p>Dowdeswell said AI may be able to be implemented in game development to help people with "augmenting skills" they already have.</p><p>Relic "can't ignore" AI, Dowdeswell said, but he's not ready to go all-in yet, either. "So I think understanding how it serves us and where it serves us is the starting point. And then as we gain experience with it, understanding where we want it to stop, I think that's important," he said.</p><p>Another area of concern around AI for Relic is regarding public perception. Right now, Dowdeswell said, "I don't think we have an answer for that," but it's something the studio is "in the middle of figuring out collectively."</p><p>People have concerns about AI for a variety of reasons, including the possibility of job losses, copyright and plagiarism issues, and a number of other elements. Thanks in part to AI, Nvidia's market cap has exceeded $4 trillion and the company is now the world's most valuable by a significant margin. Some have expressed fears of an AI bubble that could pop and lead to a number of negative consequences.</p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a></p>

He warned readers against falling into these cycles, providing a framework for both industry patterns and what he calls "fad audits." This sort of transparency is unusual for an executive, something Mahoney himself alluded to in the post itself, referencing an exchange with a Bloomberg reporter in 2015, in which he was advised </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to speak freely about his opinion on virtual reality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is easy to look back and ridicule everyone involved," Mahoney, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nexon-ceo-owen-mahoney-to-retire-after-a-decade-at-the-helm">who left Nexon in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, wrote. "But the phenomenon of game industry hype cycles is actually serious business. The fallout from these mass delusions has been tens of billions of capital destroyed and thousands — possibly tens of thousands — of careers upended. The degree of destruction leaves an important lesson: a vital skill is to identify and understand hype cycles, and to filter and orient yourself when they inevitably arise."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And, Mahoney said, mocking the people who drove these fads is "valuable," taking the rare step of validating the external criticism that these sorts of decisions often get.&nbsp; "Mocking fashion trends and the people who participate in them after the fact is fun, but it’s also valuable," he wrote. "These weren’t harmless fads. The malinvestments destroyed billions of dollars of capital that belonged to pension funds, retirement accounts, and ordinary savers. For those making capital investments, ignoring user experience questions isn’t just naïve, it’s a breach of fiduciary duty."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/calling-partners-for-gdc-2026-deadline-extended-to-friday-10-10-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Calling partners for GDC 2026!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-a-19th-century-post-american-civil-war-era-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-game-last-year.1320223/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Stephen Totilo at Game File (paywalled)</a>, Ubisoft cancelled an Assassin's Creed game in 2024 that would have been set in the 19th century, specifically in a post-American Civil War era setting. Players would have taken on the role of a Black man who had been enslaved in the American South before the war, now living in the western regions of the country, looking to start a new life.</p>



<p>That is, until you would have been recruited by the Order of Assassins and sent back to the American South to face a growing Templar threat, which would have, according to Totilo's report, seen your character "<em>confront the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan</em>."</p>



<p>Totilo's report comes from a mix of five current and former Ubisoft employees who all spoke under anonymity, who claim that the game was cancelled for two main reasons.</p>



<p>The first was Ubisoft deciding it didn't want to go through the same online turmoil it went through <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">over the inclusion of Yasuke</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows. The second reason was that Ubisoft management ultimately seemed to believe that releasing an Assassin's Creed game with this setting would have been like stepping on the third rail in the United States with regards to the game's political setting.</p>



<p>"<em>Too political in a country too unstable, to make it short</em>," a source reportedly told Game File. Another source added, "<em>I was terribly disappointed by not surprised by leadership. They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political 'status quo' and take no stand, no risk, even creative</em>."</p>



<p>This wouldn't have been the first time Ubisoft has broached atrocities like slavery in its historical settings. Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry was a spin-off to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, where you play as Adéwalé, a Black man from Trinidad who was a slave before his time on Edward Kenway's ship in the Black Flag campaign. Beyond your regular Assassin's Creed stealth and action gameplay, a core element of the story was freeing other Black people who had been enslaved by the Templars.</p>



<p>In fact, you could argue that making the kind of game described by the report here would be the next logical step if you wanted to continue exploring the idea of a character fighting back against those who enslaved him and those like him.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that for all the 'backlash' Ubisoft received online for having Yasuke as one of two protagonists, Assassin's Creed Shadows had a stellar launch <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-shadows/">from a critical</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/"> commercial perspective</a>, and even now <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">is still one of the best-selling games of 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Ubisoft would have been able to execute on this story is another matter, but the fact that Ubisoft management allegedly deemed a story that would have, among other things, pointed out the very obvious fact that slavery is an awful, terrible, and disgusting stain on human history, "<em>too political</em>," is telling in its own way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There are a lot of</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-jump-button-battlefield-6-disc-2000632532"><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> games</span></a><span> I haven’t played, but when I hear that Ubisoft’s historical fiction franchise is exploring an interesting moment in human history, my ears perk up. </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil"><i><span>Game File</span></i></a><span> has a new report about one game that didn’t make it out of Ubisoft, and everything from its fascinating concept to the maddening reasons it was canceled makes it sound like it absolutely should have been made.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The game would have reportedly been set during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, and put players in the shoes of a formerly enslaved Black man. This man would be recruited by the titular Creed and would return to the South to fight for justice for his people. The game would have even portrayed the founding of the white supremacist organization the Ku Klux Klan. </span><i><span>Game File</span></i><span>‘s sources say canceling this game in July 2024 was Ubisoft “bowing to controversy” after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rant-yasuke-viral-cowboy-1851771346"><span>racist backlash</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754"><span>Yasuke</span></a><span>, the Black samurai in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/its-the-perfect-time-to-play-assassins-creed-shadows-2000624758"><i><span>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</span></i></a><span>, and concern that portraying a Black man’s life in the Reconstruction era would be “too political in a country too unstable.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The game was in the concept phase and had been approved by Ubisoft leadership, and though it was still years away, it was canceled because the company was already dealing with hostility over Yasuke’s inclusion in </span><i><span>Shadows </span></i><span>and, seeing the current political climate in the United States, was wary of releasing a game that may have been seen as divisive. Other sources also note that Ubisoft’s financial struggles after the pirate game </span><i><span>Skull &amp; Bones</span></i><span> underperformed and the free-to-play shooter </span><i><span>The Division Heartland </span></i><span>was canceled had made the company “risk-averse.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was terribly disappointed but not surprised by leadership,” a source told </span><i><span>Game File</span></i><span>. “They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political ‘status quo’ and take no stand, no risk, even creative.”</span></p> <p><i><span>Game File</span></i><span> goes on to emphasize that the broader U.S. political climate played more of a role in the cancellation of the Reconstruction-era </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> than the Yasuke outrage campaign, and that the cancellation happened shortly after the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump on July 13. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <p><span>So, that sucks. </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> has not always shied away from exploring difficult eras of human history, and has even knowingly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/henry-kissinger-assassins-creed-templar-brotherhood-1851061127"><span>woven its own mythology into real-world conflicts</span></a><span>. It’s even told stories involving Black slaves before in </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed III: Liberation</span></i><span>. It sounds like the team at Ubisoft was passionate about what they were working on, but while they were hoping to put something into the world that could maybe make an impact, someone up top got scared. What a shame.</span></p>

<p>A new report has outlined details about a now-cancelled Assassin’s Creed game that was in development and was set to take place after the Civil War.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/leaderboard?r=2ysgx9&amp;referrer_token=2ysgx9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>‘s Stephen Totilo, a post-Civil War Assassin’s Creed was in development at one point, but was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed series has been going strong for almost two decades. With countless entries spanning multiple eras, the historical action games have been a staple for Ubisoft fans. The latest entry, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, finally releases after a lot of delays and some controversy regarding one of its characters, Yasuke. While it has subsided, it may have led to a new entry being scrapped altogether, according to Totilo.</p>



<p>They revealed that, at one point, a title set post-Civil War was in development. The game would have a former slave protagonist who returns to the South to confront the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. Development was progressing well, and the team seemed pleased with the project. Unfortunately, sources informed Game File that it ceased development due to several reasons. Key among them was the backlash of Shadows’ Yasuke and the political climate of the United States at the time.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-details-and-corroboration">More Details and Corroboration</h2>



<p>For those familiar with Insider Gaming’s coverage, you’ll be aware that we have extensively covered the Assassin’s Creed franchise and its future releases. Although not mentioned by Totilo, I can confirm that this project was known as Project Scarlet.</p>



<p>As Totilo mentioned, the game was cancelled following backlash over Shadows’ Yasuke. Still, before then, it was slated to be the next mainline RPG for the franchise, releasing in fiscal year 2028 (around October 2027).</p>

<p>The game was in development at Ubisoft Quebec, and from the information I was able to gather, it was led by Game Director Scott Philips, who had previously worked on Assassin’s Creed Syndicate and Odyssey. While the game was in a concept phase, everyone working on the project was seemingly thrilled.</p>
