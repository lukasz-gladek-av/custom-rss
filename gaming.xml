		<p>Ahead of its launch on August 7th, 11 bit Studios has announced some DLC for its creature saving exploration game Creatures of Ava. This DLC has been made with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation charity, and it will contain cosmetic backpack trinkets for the price of $2.99. All of the net proceeds from the DLC will be donated to the charity. The DLC will also be part of the Creatures of Ava Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>

To help save these creatures, Vic learns musical melodies from the inhabitants of the planet, called the Naam, to tame the animals.</p>
<p>Creatures of Ava has been co-written by Rhianna Pratchett, and explores the themes of preservation, empathy, and making sacrifices. Creatures of Ava will be available from August 7th on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>Larian Studios made it clear a few months back that their next game wouldn't be set in the Forgotten Realms, but the developer had started working on Baldur's Gate 4 before scrapping the project for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC Gamer</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke revealed that the studio was originally open to the idea of more Baldur's Gate, as they were in a vulnerable state following the release of the third entry in the series. <em>"So if something is super successful, obviously everyone's [asking] you, 'When are you going to make the next one?"</em>, Vincke said. <em>"And when you, as a developer, come out of this little miserable cave that you've been sitting in for many, many hours as you're finishing your thing, you're vulnerable."</em></p>
<p>In the beginning, Larian didn't go on working on Baldur's Gate 4 but rather on an expansion of the third entry in the series because it was considered to be the easiest route to take, as they had the engine and everything else already for the creation of more content. Progress was quick due to the production machine still being warm, but eventually, the project was retooled as a new game, as Vincke and his team didn't feel like working on this expansion for three years was worth it. The same, however, happened when the project became Baldur's Gate 4, and when the idea of scrapping the project was brought to the developers, the consensus was to move on. Sadly, it sounds like we are really missing out, as Baldur's Gate 4 was in a partially playable state, and players would have really loved it, according to Vincke.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about one of the best role-playing games ever released by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">review.</a></p>

		<p>Obsidian Entertainment’s action RPG Avowed will no longer be released in 2024, Microsoft has confirmed. Instead, the game has been pushed back to February 18th, 2025. The short reason given for the new release date is primarily due to the number of big games coming out in the second half of 2024. Instead, Microsoft has seemingly targeted a date which will be relatively quiet, allowing Avowed to get more attention.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYvTNAaXMUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Avowed takes us back to the Living Lands, a mysterious islands in the fantasy world of Eora, which it shares with Obsidian’s previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">Pillars of Eternity</a> games. However, where those games were both top-down CRPGs and part of the genre’s revival over the past decade, Avowed will shift back to one of Obsidian’s areas of expertise: first person action RPG adventuring. Avowed is not a fully open world game, but has several large open areas that you can explore. In that regard it might be comparable to one of Obsidian’s other acclaimed hits,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a>. In the game, you’ll encounter NPCs who can join your party and accompany you on your quest, with the option to have two companions at your side. As an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, players are tasked with investigating a spiritual plague that endangers the world. Throughout the player journey, there will be opportunities to wield the power to either save or doom the world, utilising a combination of magical abilities, melee combat, and firearms.</p>
<p>When Avowed releases, it will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It seems out of nowhere THQ Nordic and Gunfire Games have confirmed that a Darksiders game is in development, but outside of a teaser we do not know whether this is Darksiders 4, another spin off, a prequel, or a remake. You can see the teaser below, which gives very little away but it is sure to excite Darksiders fans.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHuefHUAX3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The only clue given is the tagline, which is “Be Prepared to Ride Again.” That could point to either a sequel to the original Darksiders, carrying on from the final scene which saw the other Horsemen coming to join War. It also could allude to a remake of the first game, which did already get a remastered version when it was re-released as Darksiders Warmastered Edition back in 2016. It could be another game entirely, starring one of the other Horsemen. Darksiders II had Death as the main character, Darksiders III had Fury, and Darksiders Genesis saw War and Strife as the playable characters. Ideally, this will be Darksiders 4 which will see the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse working together.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/03/darksiders-genesis-review/">Darksiders Genesis Review&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>Darksiders Genesis was the last Darksiders game to release, launching in 2019. In our review, Dom said, <em>“Despite the fundamental changes to the series’ viewpoint, Darksiders Genesis feels like a true Darksiders game, and banishes any memory of the lacklustre third entry.”</em></p>

<p>That third lacklustre entry, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/26/darksiders-iii-review/">Darksiders III</a>, got a 7/10 in our review. Thomas said,<em> “Darksiders III, while more limited in scope than its predecessor, provides a tighter, more deliberate experience that elaborates on the lore we’ve seen so far. The smaller world of Darksiders 3 may disappoint some fans of the previous game, but this feels like a reboot of the series. Poor PC performance, a lack of side-objectives and some unimaginative world-design point to a game with ambitions bigger than its budget, but Darksiders III is a fun and challenging experience that kept me engaged across the length of its story.”</em></p>

			<p>A couple of days ago, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-might-be-getting-delayed-to-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> hearing that Avowed would suffer a small delay to give it more breathing room from an otherwise busy Fall game release schedule. A few hours ago, Xbox <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1819495487155982486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the news, revealing that the game is now set to launch on February 18, 2025. New gameplay for Avowed will be shown in a live stream scheduled for August 23.</p>
<p>They also reminded players there are lots of games made by Microsoft-owned studios on the way. World of Warcraft: The War Within, the tenth expansion for Blizzard's premiere MMO, launches on August 26 (and you can read all about getting ready for it here). Age of Mythology: Retold, the remastered version of the classic RTS game, is due September 4. The turn-based grand strategy game Ara: History Untold from Oxide Games (Ashes of the Singularity) is out on September 24.</p>
<p>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, the first expansion for the popular hack-and-slash action RPG, launches October 8. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is out on October 25. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, an updated version of the already amazing flight simulation game, will be released on November 19.</p>
<p>Three more Xbox first-party games are due in 2024 without a fixed launch date: Stoic's side-scrolling multiplayer action-adventure game Towerborne, the Shattered Space Starfield expansion, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Moreover, Microsoft has a three-month exclusivity deal with GSC Game World for STALKER 2, which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delayed-november-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> from early September to November 20.</p>
<p>As for Avowed, Obsidian Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed</a> very confident about hitting the 2024 launch, so it must have been a Microsoft directive. The studio's website even briefly listed a November 12 release date before getting amended.&nbsp;The developers certainly won't be able to add new content to the RPG, which will be on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-confirmed-by-obsidian-to-be-very-short-for-an-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short </a>side of the spectrum for the genre, in just three months.</p>
<p>However, that's plenty of time to fix bugs and improve performance, which could help deliver the most polished Obsidian game to date. RPG fans still have Dragon Age: The Veilguard to look forward to this Fall, with BioWare <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-reveal-its-release-date-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> to announce the date later this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has just been confirmed that Avowed <strong>is </strong>being delayed into 2025 and that the Obsidian title will now be released on February 18. This news comes following rumours that surfaced in recent days talking about the game’s untimely delay. In a post on social media, the Xbox team confirmed that Avowed has been delayed to avoid clashing with ‘so many games’ coming out later this year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-three-more-months">Three More Months</h2>



<p>Avowed was due to drop in November, but with an immense gaming schedule being built up for H2 2024, there’s <strong>a lot </strong>of competition on the horizon. Therefore, like many others before them, Obsidian and the Xbox team have made the strategic decision to release Avowed when the gaming schedule is a little less cluttered.</p>



<p>This means that Avowed will no longer need to compete with the likes of Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones, Starfield’s Shattered Space DLC, the new World of Warcraft expansion, or any number of the games yet to be released this year.</p>



<p>That’s what was alluded to by Xbox in a post on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So many games coming! As such, we’re moving Avowed to Feb 18, 2025 to give players’ backlogs some breathing room.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The three-month delay isn’t so much to tussle with – and from what we’ve seen, Avowed is more or less ready to go. It could be that this delay is a veiled attempt to get more breathing space and development time in, but that’s not exactly a bad thing.</p>

<p>With esports becoming increasingly popular each day, specific countries seem to have different games reign in popularity. So, what are the top esports games in the USA? With North America having some of the best teams in competitive gaming, there are surely quite a few games that hit a massive popularity mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-esports-games-in-the-usa">Top Esports Games In The USA</h2>



<p>Esports continues to stride towards new heights. The industry consistently sees new monthly tournaments, with the Olympics even adding gaming to its repertoire.</p>



<p>Which esports games would be considered the most popular in the USA?</p>



<figure></figure>







<h4 id="h-biggest-esports-in-the-usa">Biggest Esports In The USA:</h4>



<ul>
<li>1. Fortnite </li>



<li>2. Dota 2</li>



<li>3. Counter-Strike</li>



<li>4. Rocket League</li>



<li>5. Apex Legends</li>
</ul>



<p>While the five games listed above are quite popular in the US, Fortnite sits in first place with over $48 million in prize money awarded to American competitors.</p>



<p>Dota 2, the second-biggest esports game in the USA, has awarded $18 million in prize money to American players, which is well below Fortnite.</p>







<h3 id="h-top-esports-tournaments-in-the-usa">Top Esports Tournaments In The USA</h3>



<p>With the USA giving out some serious prize money across different esports titles, a few tournaments have remained the best when it comes to popularity and prize pools.</p>



<h4 id="h-biggest-esports-tournaments-in-the-usa">Biggest Esports Tournaments In The USA:</h4>



<ul>
<li>1. Fortnite World Cup</li>



<li>2. Dota 2: The International 2015</li>



<li>3. Call of Duty League Championship 2020</li>



<li>4. Call of Duty League Championship 2022</li>



<li>5. Dota 2: The International 2016</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>While the majority of these tournaments have nowhere the size of prize pools that they used to, we still see quite a bit of esports action from each of these games in the USA.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Is Fallout London Worth Your Time?</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The game itself starts like most Fallout games: You make a character and eventually leave an underground base. Once you reach the surface, you take a train that shows you what's left of London.</p><p dir="ltr">As the name suggests, the mod takes place in London, the first time players have been outside the United States. Even though it's a fan-made mod, it has the look and feel that most players have come to expect from the series. What's nice about the mod is that it even has futuristic double-decker buses, red phone booths, and even real-world historical landmarks.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio made some changes to make Fallout London stand out from the original. For example, Bottle Caps are not the primary currency used. Instead, the game uses Tube Tickets. Fallout London's early-game is more linear, but the city is dense overall. It sacrifices extensive open areas and replaces them with smaller landscapes that can often feel like mazes, and finding locations requires some legwork that may turn away some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the video to hear our thoughts on the popular mod<span> and decide if you want to give it a go yourself. Of course, if London isn't calling you, we have a long list of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fallout-4-mods/2900-5217/"> best Fallout mods</a> to</span> consider.</p>

                <p>Fanatical's build-your-own-bundles often bring some great games and hidden gems to light, and this month's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fplatinum-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-up-to-18-games-for-less-than-3-each-with-fanaticals-august-platinum-bundle%2F1100-6525513%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Platinum Collection</a> is the perfect example. The lineup includes four games that have never been in a Fanatical bundle before, and seven games that have never been in bundles before <em>period</em>. Like other Build Your Own deals from Fanatical, the Platinum Collection lets you select from a pool of PC games to create your own bundle, and the savings get better as you add more games. The bundle starts at three games for $3.33 each ($10 total). Add five games and you'll pay $3 each, and if you select seven or more games for your Platinum collection, you pay just $2.86 each. If you grab all 18 titles, you'll only pay $51.41 for the lot.</p><p>There are a few standouts among Fanatical's picks for this bundle, with the most notable being <strong>DMC: Devil May Cry</strong>. The retelling of the original Devil May Cry updates the PlayStation 2 original with a contemporary setting and cleaned-up combat, while still retaining what's great about the franchise: ridiculous, over-the-top demon-slaying action.</p><p>You can also snag <strong>Trover Saves the Universe</strong>, a goofy title from Squanch Games with humor akin to the likes of Rick and Morty so. And speaking of games inspired by TV, there's the <strong>Cobra Kai Collection</strong>, which packs two side-scrolling brawlers that draw from the Netflix series that updates the Karate Kid franchise (and is excellent, by the way).</p><p>A secret diamond in the rough, though, might be <strong>Remember Me</strong>. The 2013 action game was developed by Life is Strange studio Dontnod Entertainment. While some of its ideas are a bit half-baked--it relies a lot on combat that's very similar to the Batman Arkham games, with environmental traversal that's very similar to Uncharted--it's set in a beautiful and fascinating sci-fi dystopia and has some very cool mechanics that relate to scrubbing through other people's memories. It's underrated if for no other reason than its glitchy and synthy orchestral soundtrack.</p><p>Those are just a few of the 18 games on offer in the August 2024 edition of Fanatical's Build Your Own Platinum Collection bundle. There's there's also 2D brawler <strong>River City Girls Zero</strong>, open space exploration sim <strong>Everspace Ultimate Edition</strong>, dungeon-crawling action RPG <strong>Sands of Aura</strong>, plenty more.

            <p>
Salt and Sanctuary, from Ska Studios, is a bit bloody good, serving up an enormously enjoyable, Dark Souls-inspired slice of 2D action-adventure. It's also now eight years old - but that hasn't stopped it from getting a surprise update this week, adding a tough new Randomiser mode.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary, which initially released for PlayStation 4 and PC back in 2016, is a fairly explicit attempt to translate From Software's now oft-replicated dark fantasy RPG formula, complete with considered combat and corpse runs, into two dimensions. It begins on the shores of a vast and broodily enigmatic kingdom, which players - in the role of the Saltborn - must explore and overcome, tackling enemies and imposing bosses along the way.
</p>
<p>
It's good stuff, and not exactly a walk in the park, but it just got a whole lot tougher thanks to its new Randomiser mode. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/283640/view/4344369662294623052?l=english">detailed over on Steam</a>, Salt and Sanctuary players looking to give themselves a real challenge can now select from three randomiser options: Item Randomiser, Monster Randomiser, and Scaling Monster Randomiser.

<p>
The first randomises all non-essential items around the world, while Monster Randomiser mixes up enemies and bosses without giving them stat changes. As for the Scaling Monster Randomiser, it also switches up enemy and boss positions, but this time <em>does</em> give them adjusted stats. Currently, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/saltandsanctuary/">Salt and Sanctuary subreddit</a> (which remains surprisingly active for a ten-year-old game) is having a grand old time documenting Randomiser mode's cruelty.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary's latest update - which is out now for PC players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/283640/Salt_and_Sanctuary/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/salt-and-sanctuary">Epic Games Store</a> - also includes miscellaneous bug fixes, a Turkish localisation, plus support for 4K/UHD, with new higher resolution options now available.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary received a sequel, Salt and Sacrifice, in 2022, but some changes to the formula - discrete zones linked by a hub replacing the first game's interconnected map, for instance, and new Monster Hunter style boss encounters - didn't seem to resonate quite so much with fans of the original. Still, the first game remains a treat ("shockingly good" is what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/salt-and-sanctuary-review">Eurogamer said</a> about it), so an excuse to return thanks to its latest update is a welcome one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parsons-cars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Right now, my social media feeds are full of people mourning layoffs, both on the journalism side, with the sudden closure of <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer</a> today, and on the developer side, with Wednesday's <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs at Bungie</a>. But, uh, at least some CEOs are doing okay? On this week's episode of Aftermath Hours, we're real pissed about that. </p><p>Luke, Chris, and I start by discussing the Bungie layoffs, which saw 220 people lose their jobs and other people and teams shuffled around into parent company Sony. According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=147249643&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=18lby&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, Bungie had "repeatedly missed financial targets promised to Sony and had been losing money since the release of February 2023’s <em>Destiny 2</em> expansion <em>Lightfall</em>."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Schreier reported </a>today, many of those affected by the layoffs put the blame on CEO Pete Parsons, "saying he had failed to take accountability for his own bad bets and that he’d been overly optimistic in his communication with the staff." But one thing Parsons didn't fail to do is <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend over 2 million dollars on classic cars</a>, apparently winning over a dozen cars on an auction site. We all know CEOs are ghouls, but now one example of their ghoulishness is on display for all to see. </p><p>Next, we talk about how, instead of getting a new <em>Sonic &amp; Mario</em> Olympics game, we got <a href="https://aftermath.site/olympics-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a crummy mobile game</a> with an NFT attached. This leads us to reflect on the Olympics games of our youths, and also how bad the battery life on the Game Gear was. </p><p>Then, we move away from bad news to rave about games we're enjoying: Luke, with excellent city-builder <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/cataclismo-impressions-rts-city-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cataclismo</a></em>, and me, with excellent comedy platformer <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thank Goodness You’re Here</a></em>. </p><p>Last, we answer some reader questions, discussing what game genre we’d like to resurrect, how both we and our pets would do in the Olympics, fake cubes, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Q1hoEhfk4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible new AI device we can’t believe is real</a>, and what the <em>Rashomon</em> of games would be.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank">Spotify</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy some fancy cars, and then sit outside shitty CEOs' houses revving the engines really loud.</p><p>Here's an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It was like two million on classic cars and motorbikes since [Sony] bought the studio in 2022. And that exists everywhere, you know what I mean: talk about wealth, I mean Gabe [Newell of Valve]. But Gabe's not doing that stuff, or he's better at hiding it.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I wrote a blog just before I left Kotaku about <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-gabe-newell-submarine-submersible-valve-science-1850563956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabe's submarine</a>. He spent god knows how much money on his very functional billionaire submarine which is excellent and does genuine scientific work. But that ain't cheap! Pete Parsons does not have Gabe money, Gabe's on a different level.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That's James Cameron money, that's that good money. That's "you own a marketplace" money. </p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>The money's going straight to you; it's not getting diluted among shareholders. </p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> [Parsons buying cars] just seems tacky. Also just generally, where does the money go and who does it go to?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> In this case, like I said, all these people spend their money on weird things--they're rich! [Parsons] was a rare example where we got to see it, like we got to actually see what this dude spends his money on. It was like, "aw, man." I like cars! I would probably have multiple cars if I was that rich.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> That's a fun question. What's the weirdo thing I would spend my money on if I was a billionaire executive?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> How about I'm gonna come up with a really left field suggestion: I'd keep my staff employed. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If there was something wrong with an old game, or you wanted to make a different version of it, and you wanted people to help you fix that, you typically did that on RomHacking.net. After this week, you'll have to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, the site has been home to some remarkable remakes, translations, fix-ups, and experiments. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/so-long-slowdown-new-hack-runs-snes-star-fox-at-up-to-60-fps/"><em>Star Fox&nbsp;</em>running at 60 fps</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/a-christmas-gift-from-game-boy-rom-hackers-super-mario-land-2-in-color/"><em>Super Mario Land 2</em> in color</a>, a fix for <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s bad smoke, even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/we-traced-namcos-new-pac-man-demake-to-its-source-a-2008-fan-romhack/">a&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man</em> "demake" that Namco spiffed up and resold</a>—and that's not even counting the stuff that was pulled down by corporate cease-and-desist actions. It's a remarkable collection, one that encompasses both very obscure and mainstream games and well worth preserving.</p>
<p>Preserved it will be, but it seems that the RomHacking site will not go on further. The site's founder <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=39405">posted a sign-off statement to the site Thursday night</a>, one that in turn praised the community, decried certain members of it, and looked forward to what will happen with "the next generation."</p>
<p>To condense the statement by founder Nightcrawler: the site had come a long way, he missed the early small-group days, there are more options now, and then, last year, he attempted to hand control over to a small internal group. That is when, Nightcrawler writes, he "discovered a most dishonest and hate filled group," one that targeted him for cutting out of the site and harassment.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The site's database, minus accounts and profiles, has been <a href="https://archive.org/details/romhacking.net-20240801">handed off to the Internet Archive</a>. RomHacking will have news posts and forums, but everything else is read-only, and the official Twitter and Discord "affiliations" are ended.</p>
<p>"I thank all of the many staff and community members whom kept the wheels turning and the lights on over the years. I am proud of our many accomplishments here together. I will carry forward remembering the good times, laughing about the bad times, and knowing she was right for the time, but time has a way of moving on," Nightcrawler wrote.</p>
<h2>Not the whole story</h2>
<p>Gideon Zhi, proprietor of Time Capsule Games and member of RomHacking for more than 20 years, took issue with Nightcrawler's monologued coda. <a href="https://x.com/GideonZhi/status/1819215914988196204">In a thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Zhi acknowledged the site's technical debt, monetary cost, and the burnout in being its administrator. "But he existed as a single point of failure for the site and exerted iron-fisted control over community-created content, and categorically refused basically all offers of help over the last decade," Zhi wrote.</p>
<p>Zhi details a near abandonment of the site last year, followed by attempts by interested members, gathered on the site's Discord chat server, to transition the site's back-end to modern storage and file serving, such as Amazon Web Services S3, and last-minute refusal by Nightcrawler to enact the changes. He also denied that the volunteers on the attempted transition threatened or doxxed Nightcrawler.</p>
<p>An administrator on the now "unofficial" Discord for the site confirmed a "rocky" relationship between the founder and the would-be administrators, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/founder-takes-down-the-nexus-mods-of-romhacking-after-20-years-because-lines-were-crossed-by-a-most-dishonest-and-hate-filled-group-but-others-tell-a-different-story/">reported by PC Gamer</a>. The Discord admin also denied threats or harassment toward Nightcrawler.</p>
<p>While ROM hacking, translation, demakes, and other game-altering work will certainly continue elsewhere, the gaming world has lost a kind of central depot for the most notable fixes, one with a community full of very experienced hackers.</p>

Last October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-touts-bigger-vision-for-destiny-2s-final-shape-but-doesnt-confirm-delay/1100-6518871/" data-ref-id="1100-6518871">the developer laid off roughly 100 people</a>, equating to approximately 8% of it's workforce. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">the studio let go another 220</a>--a shockingly high 17% of its workforce--while also relocating 12% of its remaining staff to its parent company, Sony.</p><p>Bungie executive Pete Parsons cited "rising costs of development," "industry shifts," and "enduring economic conditions" as the reason for the mass layoffs, which impacted "most" of Bungie's executive and senior leader positions. Considering this loss of leadership, it comes as no surprise then that the studio is entering what the executive refers to as a time of "tremendous change." And as for the mass transfer of former Bungie employees to Sony, Parsons' explained the move aims to "deepen" Bungie's integration with the company--a statement that has raised more than a few eyebrows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpP6wO98eqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UpP6wO98eqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Though it's easy to see these layoffs as merely the latest in a series' of widespread job losses in the industry, it also showcases the trend of large corporations acquiring well-known developers and how it ultimately leads to significant changes in staffing, priorities, and, potentially, identity. This week on Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss the impact of these layoffs and what it means for the future of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-as-employees-fear-more-layoffs-report/1100-6521967/" data-ref-id="1100-6521967">Marathon</a>, and Bungie as a whole.</p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-darksiders-game-in-development/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Gunfire Games have announced that they are officially working on a new Darksiders game. The last Darksiders game was released in 2019 and received generally positive reviews. This coincides with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LOzXTJXIUY">THQ Nordic Showcase</a> that happened today, which provided updates to some of their other games, such as a Gothic Remake and Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHuefHUAX3g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Darksiders YouTube channel</a> released a 51-second trailer that shows off a little bit of what players can expect to see in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Below, the trailer text said, "Be prepared to ride again..." The video begins with a view of the roundtable, lit up by nearby beacons in a cave filled with smoldering lava. Flames begin to rise, and then three statues with faces carved burst into flames. This is the charred council. In the audio, you can hear the word "horsemen" in a gravely voice.</p>
<p>The trailer doesn't reveal any details whatsoever,&nbsp; and players are left to speculate in the YouTube comments as to what any of the details mean. There is a large amount of speculation that this game could be <a href="https://wccftech.com/darksiders-art-darksiders-4/">Darksiders 4</a>, which would be the final game to complete the stories of each horseman. So far, two of the three horsemen have had their stories told in the series.</p>
<p>In Darksiders III, you play as Fury, the third horseman; in Darksiders Genesis, you play as Strife, the fourth horseman. Many players are guessing that you'll be able to swap between all four horsemen in the upcoming Darksiders game or that it'll be exclusively about Strife.</p>
<p>It's unknown whether this will be a brand-new game in the franchise or a remaster or remake of one of the previous games. There is a lot of potential for the story to go and for the mechanics to be seen throughout the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Although the trailer for the upcoming Darksiders game doesn't give away much, fans are suggesting that it could be a continuation of War's story as he is no longer chained up near the Charred Council.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's all speculation, and all fans can do is wait for some information from THQ Nordic and Gunfire Games about how the development for the new Darksiders game is coming along.</p>
<p>When Gunfire Games was not openly developing Darksiders, it worked on games such as Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant II. However, it remains unknown for how long the Darksiders project has been in development.</p>

The superpowered characters have the ability to come together to save their loved ones’ lives or to struggle with each other to watch things fall apart.<br></p><p>These themes also reflect the current sociopolitical climate here in the US, where messages of unity permeate the 2024 election landscape following the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement four years ago and the continued threats to human rights. <em>Supacell</em> can be intense to watch, but it’s important for us to do so.</p><p>Following a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/supacell-episode-5-review-recap-netflix-superhero-1851610702&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/supacell-episode-5-review-recap-netflix-superhero-1851610702">disjointed episode 5</a></span>, creator Rapman manages to bring the narrative together successfully in an explosive finale that earns a demand for more seasons.</p><h2 id="h94245"><a id=""></a>The Supacell activates</h2><p>In this episode, we finally see our heroes start to use their powers in a unified and combined fashion to confront the mysterious, electricity-wielding, hooded enforcers trying to hinder and kidnap them. However, they have to help each other get out of their own way.<br></p><p>Tazer (Josh Tedeku), for example, remains hotheaded and angry over his mother’s death. When Michael (Tosin Cole) stops the enemies in time, Tazer rushes to action without consulting the team. To hinder him, Michael moves him to another time and place, but that sets the enemies free where they were, leaving the remaining members of the Supacell to deal with them. In this scene, we see how a lack of unity is a big detriment to the remaining members of the team, as Rodney and Sabrina are left to a two-on-four fight and Andre is nowhere to be found.<br></p><p>When the enemies set Rodney (Calvin Demba) on fire, Sabrina’s (Nadine Mills) rage activates, and she uses her powers to push all four of them away.<br></p><p>Sabrina’s heroic moment doesn’t end there, as Rodney is badly burned. She assesses him, stating that he needs to go to the hospital, but thenRodney heals before their eyes, revealing that his superpowers also provide some sort of regenerative ability. As the de facto leader of the group, Michael taps into his leadership capabilities, protecting the three other heroes as they rest after the fight. But it’s evident how much this adds to his stress, how always looking out for everyone else in his life adds even more stakes to his every day. This is the Michael I wanted to see more of in the last episode, not someone who has to struggle with telling the truth, but someone whose living truth is to protect others. It’s refreshing to see OG Michael back, and finally telling the truth to Dionne (Adelayo Adedayo). To be a hero, Michael needs to be motivated by more than fear, and he finally embraces that.</p><h2 id="h94246"><a id=""></a>Surveillance culture critiqued</h2><p>While the symbolism of a shadow organization run by white men keeping Black people with superpowers imprisoned and under observation is obvious, there’s another insidious theme tothe organization’s actions: the use of surveillance. They’re able to track and confront the Supacell due to their ability to tap into publicly placed surveillance cameras.<br></p><p>The idea that the organization—representative of both misguided governments and big tech in the real world—could be watching becomes increasingly unsettling as we see how it uses the information they collect. In the public consciousness, we’re becoming increasingly aware of this issue as governmental administrations potentially change, as data helps foreign governments <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/articles/data-misuse-and-disinformation-technology-and-the-2022-elections/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/data-misuse-and-disinformation-technology-and-the-2022-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sway elections on social media</a></span>, and as tech companies sell our data to the highest bidder. The Supacell is largely unaware that they’re even being watched, even though they know some nefarious group is targeting them.<br></p><p>Not all surveillance and tech in <em>Supacell</em> is bad, though. We also learn that Jasmine’s father used a tracker on her bag, not out of malice, but out of overprotectiveness, which is how he was able to determine that she was taken to a facility called “The Estate” or Ashington Estate. Dionne reveals that she used to serve clients there, but that it’s being knocked down and that there aren’t people there currently. Jasmine’s father plays a recording of his last call with Jasmine, where she says they are hurting her by making her use her powers all the time, and that she wants to come home.</p><p>As the (white) man in charge at The Estate walks by several Black superpowered prisoners, he deliberately ignores their pleas. The guards mistreat Jasmine as they drag her into a larger holding cell with an injured Black man who has a deep laceration on his back. She uses her powers to heal him, and then we see that the injured man is Andre (Eric Kofi Abrefa), who has also been given an injection to mute his powers.<br></p><p>At the facility, Andre learns that the “supercell” is a mutation of the sickle cell, which is why these superpowers, like the disease, are prevalent in Black people. And naturally, the organization wants to control it and offers Andre the one thing he needs: a stable job with steady income. The director explains that being near other superpowered individuals can activate a person’s power (cells).</p><p>Two main power players in this episode use threats to exert power. The first is the director at The Estate, who implies his son AJ will remain safe and provided for if Andre complies. The second is Krazy (Ghetts), who threatens to hurt Tazer’s grandmother if he doesn’t show up to meet him – meanwhile, Sabrina is ready to confront Krazy over Sharleen’s disappearance.</p><figure id="" data-id="da4bd4a9308fa4d371199e6cbf47dbcf" data-recommend-id="image://da4bd4a9308fa4d371199e6cbf47dbcf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A superhero wields her power." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A superhero wields her power." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da4bd4a9308fa4d371199e6cbf47dbcf" data-recommend-id="image://da4bd4a9308fa4d371199e6cbf47dbcf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A superhero wields her power." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h94247"><a id=""></a>A win for women</h2><p> I’ve been critical of how the show handles women characters, but Sabrina’s character arc is satisfying. By day, she’s a nurse,a nurturer and healer, but as a superpowered person, she does a lot of damage with force, when induced by rage.</p><p>I appreciate how this comes together in the last episode of the season, and feel that this represents the role society expects women to have and the anger we’re supposed to suppress because we’re expected to be nurturing all the time, despite all the stresses in our lives. It took a while to get here, but I’m glad Rapman got it right for this character.<br></p><p>The death of another woman character serves mainly to motivate one of the men, however, and although it didn’t happen at the beginning of the season, it’s still frustrating to see that be her primary plot function.<br></p><p>Without providing overt spoilers, the final battle is epic. Michael discovers that sometimes no action will create the outcome you want. This reinforces the “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” nature of living in a society built to empower your failure instead of your success. Michael follows the rules. He’s exceptional. He tries to change everything bad and take care of his fiance, his sick mom, and his newfound Supacell family. But ultimately, there are too many systems and points of power working against him. It’s a hard lesson, but a realistic one that many superhero shows try to circumvent in favor of wrapping everything up in a hopeful bow instead of recognizing the reality of the world in which superheroes have to function.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h94248"><a id=""></a>The future of <em>Supacell</em></h2><p><em>Supacell </em>fans can have hope: Netflix has neither canceled or renewed <em>Supacell</em>. While the show functions satisfactorily as a standalone season, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/14/some-promising-news-about-supacell-season-2-on-netflix/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/14/some-promising-news-about-supacell-season-2-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapman revealed to<em> Radio Times</em></a></span> that he has plans for three full seasons of the show – and the season ends with a clear direction for the new season. The innovative and expressive concept provides a lens for depth and exploration that other superhero series are missing.<br></p><p>While some episodes of the first season were much stronger than others, <em>Supacell </em>is a refreshing take on superheroes, exploring Black identity in a way not served by mainstream superhero franchises. The show is also centered around London, and while I love American superhero movies and TV shows, watching a well-soundtracked show from another culture broke up the monotony of superhero shows for me.<br></p><p><em>Supacell</em> is about complex characters whose stories could fill more seasons and voices that deserve more time and space on Netflix. Since we don’t have Michael to help us with that in real life, it’s up to fans to watch the show and advocate for further seasons.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I've never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I'd be good at it, because 'look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they've taught you the basics'. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

Ah, you can almost smell the burning rubber. Real cars involve rubber, correct? The trailer is a mixture of live-action shenanigans and in-game footage of horseless carriages despoiling each other. At a THQ Nordic preview event earlier in the week, I also got to see a bit of the game's car customisation - a "big new feature", which lets you paint individual car pieces and adorn them with decals, impact damage and rust. Goodness knows I'd hate to get wrecked while piloting a shabby motor. As for modes, expect a single player career, multiplayer, tournaments, regular challenges via game update, and modding support.
</p>
<p>
The game runs on a new version of developer Bugbear's ROMU engine, which appears capable of more elaborate vehicular deformation effects - doors and exhaust pipes flapping loose, tyres unhooking and bounding away like rats fleeing a sinking ship that is actually a truck with a ludicrously elevated ride. It's all enjoyably madcap, but I don't get the sense the racing experience will differ excessively from the 2018 game, which John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-is-a-splendid-antidote-to-po-faced-racing-sims">thought was Top Work</a>. </p>
<p>"There's so much fun in this, and it manages to make failure an entertaining element of racing, which is a trick all too rarely pulled off," he wrote. "Wreckfest is a splendid antidote to the po-faced severity of the current crop of Need For Speeds, Crews, and so on. It holds its own in that competition, while delivering something far more specifically its own." I'd argue that Wreckfest 2 has less competition - both the Need For Speed series and The Crew are on the backburner, giving this juiced-up road-rager a clear run at our affections.

This has helped him rack up over 300 million subscribers on YouTube, sell a ton of candy bars and merch, and led to him reportedly getting paid $100 million to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-reality-game-show-prize-1851344900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-reality-game-show-prize-1851344900">host and develop a reality game show for Amazon</a></span>. But his nice guy empire seems to be facing some pushback.</p><p>On July 24, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RosannaPansino/status/1815965420408692786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RosannaPansino/status/1815965420408692786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2017 clip of a then 18 to 19-year-old MrBeast resurfaced online</a></span>. In the clip, posted by YouTube influencer Rosanna Pansino, MrBeast jokes about buying black people and “n-words” for $300. Later in the video clip, MrBeast says a homophobic slur and jokingly asks his chat to stop posting the “n-word.” At one point someone suggests they are selling black people for $69, to which MrBeast replies with a smile and laugh, “That’s a steep price.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1816145206099808688&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1816145206099808688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a separate clip reportedly from 2017</a></span>, MrBeast and others are talking on a podcast and joking about having sex with 14-year-old rapper Bhad Barbie.</p><p> “When Jimmy was a teenager he acted like many kids and used inappropriate language while trying to be funny,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apnews.com/article/mrbeast-jimmy-donaldson-allegations-philanthropy-feastibles-742306d7c77e2eca8d895bf439790c69&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apnews.com/article/mrbeast-jimmy-donaldson-allegations-philanthropy-feastibles-742306d7c77e2eca8d895bf439790c69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a MrBeast spokesperson told <em>The Associated Press</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p>“Over the years he has repeatedly apologized and has learned that increasing influence comes with increased responsibility to be more aware and more sensitive to the power of language. After making some bad jokes and other mistakes when he was younger, as an adult he has focused on engaging with the MrBeast community to work together on making a positive impact around the world.” </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>contacted MrBeast for comment but didn’t hear back before publication. </p><h2 id="h19665"><a id=""></a>There’s even more MrBeast controversy</h2><p>It’s not just old clips of MrBeast that are hounding the internet star. A video created by someone who claims to have worked for MrBeast in the past suggests that some of the competitions he puts on are staged and feature actors or friends winning prizes. </p><p>And in late July, MrBeast cut ties with Ava Kris Tyson following allegations that his one-time co-host  groomed a minor years ago. MrBeast later said in a statement that what Tyson did was “unacceptable.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ava-kris-tyson-mr-beast-grooming-allegations-1851606782&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ava-kris-tyson-mr-beast-grooming-allegations-1851606782">The creator has since hired a third-party investigator</a></span> in the hopes that they’ll “ensure” he has clarity on all the facts.</p><p>But wait, that’s not all that’s chipping away at MrBeast’s good guy empire. There have been multiple reports and rumors that his Amazon reality show, which has a $5 million prize, is a dangerous trainwreck. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/style/mrbeast-beast-games-competition-show.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/style/mrbeast-beast-games-competition-show.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new report from the <em>New York Times</em></a></span> claims that people aren’t being properly fed, have been injured repeatedly, and aren’t receiving proper or adequate medical care. </p><p>Some women claim they were denied clean underwear when they started menstruating and others reported they weren’t given access to their medications when needed. </p><p>A rep for MrBeast told the paper that the shoot has been “complicated by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/southwest-airlines-windows-3-1-blue-screen-crowdstrike-1851603013&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/southwest-airlines-windows-3-1-blue-screen-crowdstrike-1851603013">CrowdStrike incident</a></span>, extreme weather, and other unexpected logistical and communications issues.” The spokesperson claimed that MrBeast had started a formal review and had “taken steps to ensure that we learn from this experience.” </p><p>For the famous content creator, it seems his days of being known as the good guy online might be coming to an end as he tries to grow his empire more and more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
