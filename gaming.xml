		<p>Even in the ranks of nasty little goblins in fiction, Styx is a particularly mean little fellow, but then what would you expect from the grim fantasy world that he was born into? With elves, humans and dwarves all various shades of mean, conniving, and genocidal, it’s not like Styx is morally inferior to those he’s going up against. But now, in Styx: Blades of Greed, he’s not doing it alone.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;| Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZleFS3upA1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Styx has often been able to rely on the help of others in his first two solo adventures, often in an ‘enemy of my enemy’ kind of way, but as Styx looks to escape from the lockdown in place on the human fortress of The Wall, he starts to put together a crew of rapscallions to join him, with a mix of new and returning faces. And what’s the latest object of Styx’s obsession? Well, it’s the power of the Quartz.</p>


<p>Our hands-on picked up right at the beginning of the game, with Styx needing to plot an escape, with a little advice from Helledryn to do so. The Wall is an imposing fortress, built up and up the side of a, well, a giant wall or cliff face, in a fashion that makes Helm’s Deep and Minas Tirith look vertically challenged. Structures sprout out and hang over the rocky abyss below with one of the main ways to get around being to catch a quick zeppelin. But who would ferry a sneaky little goblin around town? Well, maybe you can spring the ship of a drunkard dwarvish captain whose ship has been impounded by the Inquisition?</p>


<p>Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good plan, and lets you get a real feel for the early stages of this game’s stealth action, which is still as broad and flexible as before. Guards tend to go on nicely predictable patrol paths and react in a suitably game-like fashion to make this an enjoyable playground to sneak through, and should react in fairly expected ways to what you try to do. The direct approach is always possible, having Styx slink between cover, get the drop on enemies (often literally from above) and stashing bodies away in boxes as you go. Should you get spotted, you don’t stand much of a chance in one-on-one combat, so it’s best to stay in the shadows, use crawlspaces and more, as well as some extended techniques like poisoning drinking water by just gobbing in it, placing traps, triggering environmental hazards with a goblin clone, possessing guards, and more. If you’re spotted, they put up their hackles for a while, potentially making use of poison gas to try and flush you out of tunnels if they think you just ducked into one, and generally keeping you on your toes.</p>
<p>But Styx: Blades of Greed wouldn’t stop with just retreading the past. In trying to spring the zeppelin from being impounded, Styx needs to break through a Quartz lock, and as he gets some help to do so, he’s drawn to the immense power that this can provide. Also, it starts talking to him with the promise of even more power if he can find more Quartz. What could possibly go wrong here?</p>

<p>As Styx tracks down more shards of Quartz and absorbs their power, he’ll be able to unlock new time-twisting abilities and more that it enables, this coming as a separate skill tree to go alongside the standard Amber skills and crafting recipes he’s learnt. You won’t need the Quartz for some of his other new abilities, though, with a glider that lets you sail through the sky, a grappling hook and claws to climb up taller walls.</p>
<p>This all ties in with a much greater sense of verticality and discoverability through the game’s three environments. The Wall is the home of the humans, while Turquoise Dawn is the more verdant home of the Orcs, and the game will also return to Akenash, the now ruined site of the first title. Each of these regions are going to evolve and open up to you more and more as you unlock those core new movement abilities, so where the first two Styx titles were of a linear structure, Blades of Greed will be more of an evolving open world, replete with key fast travel hot air balloon wharfs.</p>

<p>It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158758/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2022’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, you ran a little shop of horrors, dealing plants with an occult edge to the inhabitants of a mysterious dark town. Now, Bad Viking and Iceberg Interactive’s follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, takes us back to Undermere. Again, something strange is afoot. Again, you hear residents’ problems and offer up solutions from your range. Again, there’s a cat you can pat (!) who gets startled by the shop bell.</p>
<p>But this time, instead of being plant-based, the solutions are antique-based. If you enjoyed the first instalment for its puzzles and sinister aura, be sure to reach for this treasure, because it’s just as fun. (Either way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/strange-horticulture">the first game is worth playing</a>.)</p>
<p>In Strange Antiquities, you’re the apprentice of a thaumaturge (a sort of magic miracle-worker) who has left you to run his shop while he investigates peculiar goings-on. He gives you a map of Undermere and a book called 'Strange Artefacts: A guide to occult objects', the latter your bible for working out which among the oddities at your disposal will aid various customers’ misfortunes. And there are shelves on shelves of these otherworldly items: a stag carved of wood, a pendant with a moving eye, a disfigured hand. You know, your usual macabre bric-a-brac.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158763/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much of the play is listening to customers’ requests for mystical antiques. They might be caring for an ailing loved one, or setting out on a journey, or seeking a gift. They might have a particular object in mind, or they’ll just describe the situation and you need to suggest something. You deduce the required trinket by matching the description in your book with the shop’s wares. Clues can be a bit obscure but there are clever hints to help. And when you match each antique successfully, you get more clues, more puzzles. I was so consumed with this gameplay loop that I missed my (IRL) bedtime in my first play session.</p>
<p>Present the wrong antique, however, and you’ll increase a type of anti-health bar. When the meter fills up, you’ll feel ‘a deep fear has taken root’. This takes you to a dice roll minigame where you need to match symbols on dice to those on a board to diminish the fear. It’s quite fun in itself and its spiritual symbols of cats, snakes, suns, moons, etc., feel right at home with the unearthly undercurrent.</p>
<p>But the plot thickens: a customer comes in with a problem and your solution can be one of two items – here the game warns you that your choice will determine the fate of the story. These ethical quandaries arise a few times throughout, and while I won’t spoil anything, I will say I delighted in seeing the consequences of my chosen antiquity.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158764/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Around this time the game also opens up new areas and new ways of thinking: you need to procure new items for the store. Dialogue, letters, cards, and other paraphernalia pile on your desk, each hinting at a locale on your map where you can unearth these antiques. This ‘exploration’ doesn’t involve much visual change of scene (the store remains static), but the story unfolds through thrilling Arthur Conan Doyle-style prose.</p>
<p>In that way, the worldbuilding often functions like a visual novel: your imagination is left to fill in the blanks. These moments were when I noticed how masterful the storytelling is, always building intrigue and pulling you through, even when not much is happening on screen. It's impressive that such a rich world fits into such a tiny space.</p>
<p>As you progress, the puzzle ‘pieces’ become more scattered. I found myself cross-referencing various books and tools, and jumping in and out of item inspection. I used my own notes and screenshots to document clues, but it would’ve been nice if findings were logged somewhere in-game.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158762/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, I was never stuck. Whenever I’d feel lost on one puzzle, I’d put it aside and work on another. Lo and behold, the puzzles interlinked and I was able to solve both. This means things flow quite smoothly – making the game all the more addictive.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, Strange Antiquities is PC-first. Its point-and-click function longs for a mouse like Tess Sherwood longs for a Horned Shackle, because moving the cursor with the joystick is a bit of a drag. Bad Viking has added options for cursor speed to address this, though I still found the joystick a little laggy. You’d think, then, the game would be an ideal candidate for Switch 2’s mouse feature, but at this stage it’s not supported. So: good ol’ handheld is your friend here – an appropriately cosy way to play.</p>
<p>Along with cursor speed, there’s a good range of settings, such as arachnophobia mode and easy-to-read fonts (unfortunately font size is static, but your magnifying glass can embiggen it). Early Strange Horticulture fans will be excited to enable autolabelling – a blessing for those who find typing on the Switch cursed.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158766/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every artefact, map, and character has been designed with intricate attention to detail – no easy feat when there are so many. The style is dark enough to maintain its arcane leanings, yet cartoonish enough that you know it won't haunt you at night. It strikes the balance of cosy-spooky (or, as my partner says, ‘kooky’). Likewise, the slow tempo and minor-key piano music is a little eerie without being disturbing in a true horror sense; no jumpscares here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In Strange Antiquities, Bad Viking expands the rich world of Strange Horticulture – this time in an antique shop specialising in the occult. The puzzles are cryptic but rarely skull-cracking, forming an addictive gameplay loop: who knew hunting down magic antiques to solve customers’ conundrums could be so satisfying?</p>
<p>The whole thing is cloaked in a gripping mystery narrative, which you can influence with the right (or wrong) occult oddity. And with the possibility of multiple endings, replay value is high – at least for those of you who want to see just how much strangeness is in store.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-not-for-the-faint-of-heart.1298121/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the years and with plenty of solid work, developer Cyanide established the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/">Styx </a>series as one of the most important stealth series still running today, combining a dark fantasy medieval world with a personable main character and some advanced gameplay mechanics to provide experiences like few others. The hardcore approach of the franchise will be turned up to eleven by Styx: Blades of Greed, which is setting out to become the biggest and most complex entry in the series to date.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month, I had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed in one of the longest session I had booked for this year's show, and, after a brief presentation, it was clear why I was given one hour and half to try out the game. Not counting the sheer size of the open map, which was really massive, featuring a focus on verticality that only opens a lot of possibilities, but also made it feel even bigger, Styx: Blades of Greed is a game that doesn't pull any punches. Though there was a bit of clunkiness to the experience, with some rather complex controls that required a little time to get used to, and enemies sometimes failing to spot Styx even though he was in plain view ahead of them, the experience was as hardcore as it could have been.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed is as hardcore as a stealth game can get.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not counting the above issues, which will likely get ironed out by the time the game comes out, enemies are highly attentive to their surroundings, forcing the player to take advantage of every hiding point or shadow in the environment, and are relentless in their pursuit of Styx if he is discovered, giving up the search only when the goblin is properly concealed, and out of the way. As Styx is not very good at direct combat, a stealthy approach is always the winning one in Styx: Blades of Greed, forcing players to think hard and proceed even more carefully, and to make them take full advantage of the environment by snuffing out candles to create shadows, where he is more difficult to spot, by making noise to distract enemies, or by simply choosing a safer route with fewer enemies. Thanks to a waypoint system, the general area where the main objective is located is easily highlighted, making it easier for players to focus on sneaking around without having to worry about getting lost.</p>



<p>Besides Styx's excellent agility, which allows him to climb pretty much anywhere to take advantage of the aforementioned improved verticality of the maps, the goblin also has many different abilities that can be learned via skill trees. These abilities were extremely varied in the Gamescom demo, ranging from creating clones to fight and distract enemies, setting down a coccoon to be used as a respawn and teleportation point, mind control, and more. These abilities further highlighted how this sandbox approach to level design is a great direction to take the series to, as the massive freedom left to players makes it very involving and engaging. With other tools added to the mix, like a grappling hook and a glider, it will really be interesting to see how stealth game experts will put everything at Styx's disposal to use.</p>



<p>Though a little complex at times, the Styx: Blades of Greed Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the third entry in the series will elevate the franchise to new heights. With the abilities and tools on show being so diverse and versatile, I'm really interested to see what else the game will offer when it launches this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-is-us-director-calls-silksong%E2%80%99s-two-week-heads-up-%E2%80%9Ca-little-callous%E2%80%9D.1298118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Excitement and hype have been building around Hollow Knight Silksong's release <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">for years</a>, so it was no surprise when its launch, which occurred 11 days ago at the time of this writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">was a big deal</a>. Several <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">indie games delayed their launches to get out of Silksong's way</a> to try to avoid every ounce of attention being swallowed by Silksong, but others, like Hell is Us, stuck it out, proudly launching alongside Silksong on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Now that both games are out, and developer Rogue Factor survived the first week and a half of launching alongside Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel, Hell is Us director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête had a few thoughts on how Team Cherry handled launching the most wishlisted game on Steam.</p>



<p>"<em>I mean, they're allowed to do what they did,</em>" began Jacques-Belletête when answering what it was like finding out they'd be releasing the same day as Silksong on an episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y">Friends Per Second</a> podcast per <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/">TWIV</a>. "<em>There's no laws or rules against that. And I don't want to get into, 'Oh they caused this to us or somebody else.' I don't really care about that, and I don't want to get into that type of debate. But I do, it's hard for me not to say, like, when you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like wow. You know what I mean? As the GTA VI of indie, right? And I know now this term gets thrown around left and right, but people in the industry, that's how we were</em> <em>calling such a game. To shadow drop something like this is a little callous.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="'Hell is Us' Game Director on what worked (and didn't) | Friends Per Second Ep #78" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/opeNl55y-0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jacques-Belletête also confirmed that there were conversations between Rogue Factor and its publisher, Nacon, regarding whether Hell is Us should be delayed, and that while it wasn't the deciding factor, at least one point of friction against that decision would be having to refund pre-orders, and hope those players purchase them again for the new date.</p>



<p>"<em>The real pain in the ass is that you have to refund your pre-orders when you do that, right? That's the real, 'How you gonna do this?' now you need to rebuild them. We didn't say 'Oh my god, we have to do it but we can't because of that.' We were like, 'No, I think we can get through the storm.'"</em></p>



<p>Obviously, Hell is Us kept its date, which Jacques-Belletête says he was "<em>happy</em>" about, and noted that Rogue Factor is still a larger studio than several of the other indies that delayed their games, which went into the team believing they could weather the storm of Silksong.</p>



<p>But while he doesn't have any hard numbers, it's his belief that Silksong did impact the launch sales of Hell is Us. "<em>I don't have any specific numbers, at least not at this time. But for sure it did</em>." He continued to say that it's not just about Hollow Knight, but about how it's practically impossible to find a release window where you aren't going up against a big upcoming title.</p>



<p>"<em>That's the thing nowadays, getting a window where you're pretty much alone</em> <em>is almost impossible. 15 years ago, the mid-end of the summer was always a dead period. But there's no such thing anymore. It's just constant madness</em>."</p>



<p>When we start looking at sales reports for September, it'll be interesting to see where Hell is Us lands on the charts, especially if it lands within a few places of Silksong. As Jacques-Belletête pointed out, there are no laws against what Team Cherry did, and it's difficult for everyone in the industry, no matter who you are, to draw the ever-shrinking attention spans of modern players away from the hundreds of other options they have to any one game. But it seems odd to even suggest that Team Cherry, or any other studio in its place, owes other studios the courtesy of a long lead time. </p>



<p>Team Cherry launched Hollow Knight Silksong in the way that it did with the intention of getting as many eyes as possible on it for September 4. Rogue Factor did the same with its own strategy. Is that callousness, or competitiveness?</p>



<p>For more on Hell is Us,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/"> you can check out my review</a>, in which I noted that despite a few flaws, Rogue Factor is largely able to succeed at what it is trying to do with Hell is Us, and that it is overall "<em>one of the 2025's best games</em>."</p>

            <p>By the great transport gods, trolleymageddon is upon us! It's the end of the line as we know it, and I feel fine. All of that is to say that two wacky trolley-related games are releasing within days of each other, no doubt driving fans of the budding genre off the rails or road.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">The Trolley Solution</a>, a game about a famous philosophical quandary and also at least one tale of a girl falling deeply in love with a tram, pulled up at this stop on September 12. Boarding costs £5.20/$6.49/€6.33 right now, or £5.40 if you want the deluxe edition the comes with a mysterious and possibly satirical DLC dubbed '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3550600/The_Trolley_olution/">the V.I.P. lever</a>'. If you hurry, you can probably still catch it! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731330/TROLEU/">Troleu</a>, a game that tasks you with checking tickets and occasionally kicking the bottoms of troublemakers as a trolleybus conductor, is due to pull up on the opposite side of the stop later today, September 15th. Make sure you've got your ticket ready!</p>
<p>If you opt to get on The Trolley Solution's tram, which is named Trolley-San, you're in for a series of amusing scenarios/puzzles based around Phillipa Foot's famous trolley problem. You know, the one with the unstoppable train speeding towards a point at which some tracks separate, with some unfortunate folks strapped to the rails of both forks, and a lever presenting the chance to save one group at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>As I discovered when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trolley-solution-is-a-moral-quandary-that-suddenly-turns-into-a-tragically-touching-tale-of-tram-love">gave its demo a go back in June</a>, The Trolley Solution takes that scenario in a whole bunch of wacky directions, including one which politely requests permission to tweet something highly controversial about footwear from your Twitter account. That's probably less of a threat if you're solely on BlueSky or have smartly given up the socials. Also, this happens:</p>
<blockquote>Tameko falls, to a degree of your choosing, in love with a tram. He goes by Trolley-San and keep pulling up and saying "Ding Ding" in what I can only assume by Tameko's reactions to be an incredibly suave and seductive fashion. This and all the rest of the game - and I can't emphasise this enough - are a right hoot, a great laugh, and a throaty chuckle.</blockquote>
<p>Given the updated Steam page images feature the likes of a person pushing a tram up an incline like Sisyphus, I can only assume the full version's even wackier.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/troleu">Troleu</a>, meanwhile, is a bus conductor sim with attitude. Lest you accuse me of falsifying its trolleyness, the Steam description insists on a couple of occasions that this is a "trolleybus". I've no idea what the difference between the two is, but our Nic liked the demo when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/troleus-demo-is-for-anyone-whos-ever-wanted-to-physically-kick-someone-out-of-a-moving-bus">gave it a go back in June</a>. That said, while he enjoyed lobbing folks with fake passes out of the doors "at which point they fly off down the street like a crisp packet in a gale", he was neutral about the child kicking you can do if you wish. Here's his conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>To keep you on your toes, there's both a passenger annoyance meter and your own boss, the ticket inspector, to contend with, who makes sure you haven't been letting on fare dodgers. I am as yet not fully convinced there is more than 15 minutes of fun here but it is a very good 15 minutes.</blockquote>
<p>Right, now pick your transport and get on. Or, divide yourself in two somehow and board both. Or board neither and stay home to play something else. The choice, as when dealing with tram quandaries and ornery passengers, is yours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can make streaming all your favorite movies and shows a seamless experience with the help of a Fire TV. Specifically, the Fire TV Cube which is the most feature-packed streaming device in Amazon’s lineup. Right now, Amazon, has it marked down by a solid 29%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Normally, you’d find the Fire TV Cube going for $140, but after the discount, it comes down to just $100</a>. That’ll save you a whole $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Streaming Experience</h2>
<p>Okay, I know what your thinking. Why the cube? What’s better about the cube than the stick? Well, the Fire TV Cube has a built-in mic and speaker. It’s sort of a Fire TV Stick and an Echo Dot all in one. With the Fire TV Cube, you can use Alexa hands-free. The Fire TV Stick’s Alexa support is baked into the remote. You need to hold down a button and speak in for it to register what you’re asking. But what if you’re all cozied up under a blanket and the remote is all the way <em>over there</em>? Now you see the value.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Cube also uses an octa-core processor which can provide about twice the power of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max—the premium option for Fire TV Sticks. It leads to better performance from your apps like speedier start-up times and faster streaming. And with Wi-Fi 6E support, the upper limit of streaming speeds is pretty dang good.</p>



<p>With any Fire TV, you get to download a wide range of streaming apps so you can keep up with all your favorite content. Get Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max (I think that’s what it’s called again last I checked), and Prime Video, of course. Enjoy watching your movies and shows with impressive picture and sound quality thanks to support for cinematic 4K, Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio.</p>
<p>You can connect all your entertainment sources through your Fire TV Cube, allowing you to switch between them. Just use Alexa to ask to pull up your Xbox when you’re ready to try again against Sister Splinter in&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.&nbsp;</em>Then when you give up after 20 more tries, you can ask to switch back over to your cable box in time to catch a rerun of the latest episode of<em> Bob’s Burgers</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Drop the Stick and go for the Cube. Right now, you can save a good $40 on Amazon’s Fire TV Cube. You’ll only be paying an even $100 for a limited time.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official PC Features Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Buhl went on to say any game is free to "be whatever they want to be," saying Fortnite is a "pretty good" game with its "goofy" skins.</p><p>"So, I think where we end up is we're pretty happy with where we are. We are a gritty, grounded, realistic shooter. That's what we intend to be, and that's what the game is going to look like for a while," Buhl said.</p><p>Buhl ending that comment with "for a while" is causing some Battlefield fans to panic and theorize that Battlefield 6 will launch without weird skins and then add them later. Evidence of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-skin-has-some-players-wanting-to-send-ea-a-message/1100-6534728/" data-ref-id="1100-6534728">non-traditional cosmetics have already leaked, after all</a>, prompting some people to wonder about what comes next.</p><p>Nickerson, for their part, said Battlefield Studios examines the competition and understands the competitive landscape that Battlefield 6 will join this October. However, Nickerson said, "We're really focused on what works for Battlefield at the end of the day. We're not chasing trends. We're not chasing other products."</p><p>Nickerson said people can look at the Road to Battlefield 6 event in Battlefield 2042 to get a "taste" of the kinds of cosmetics that will come to Battlefield 6 down the road.</p><p>"Generally, I think, from a design perspective, we're doing us. We're staying in our lane, doing us at the end of the day," Nickerson said.</p><p>Before this, Battlefield Studios specifically mentioned how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-have-grounded-skins-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj/1100-6533627/" data-ref-id="1100-6533627">Battlefield 6 aims to have "grounded" skins and purposefully avoid Nicki Minaj</a>. Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> hasn't exactly been off to a flying start. While it's already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-blasts-off-on-steam-with-record-breaking-results/1100-6534670/">developed a healthy playerbase</a>, Steam reviews have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/">not been so hot</a>, primarily due to the game's performance issues. But it's not just PC players that are having trouble, as many players on console have been clamouring for a field-of-view slider option. And based on a recent tweet, it looks like such an option might be on the way.</p><p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966626024235434322" rel="nofollow ">shared a poll over the weekend</a> on his personal X account asking console players about including a FOV setting. He noted that there are "some dreams" he has "where an FOV setting might affect fairness," but also said he couldn't talk about that. It seems like that didn't matter to most folks though, as the top rated result in the poll was "FOV slider or GTFO!" Following that, a post from the official Borderlands X account was shared essentially confirming that the devs will be looking into adding that in as an option.</p>

		<p>Following its early access release for PC and Xbox last year, Maximum Entertainment has confirmed that the city builder with superpowers Overthrown will launch on October 16th for PS5, and exit out of early access on PC and Xbox Series X|S the same day. Overthrown lets up to six players work together to build a world, and whoever wears the crown wields the powers of super strength and super speed to find resources and place buildings.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overthrown - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/28mx1hgDWP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When Overthrown begins you are put in a world where there is no city, just wildlife and bandits stalking the wilderness. Armed with your crown, you are tasked with building a town and attracting people to come live in your town, making it grow from a small village to a bustling town. Of course, that kind of growth has it danger and can attract attacks from the wild. You can wishlist <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012237">Overthrown</a> on the PS Store, or get it in early access for £20.99 on Steam and Xbox Series XS now.</p>

<p>In our Overthrown Early Access review, I said, <em>“Overthrown certainly has potential but after just a few hours I felt like I had seen all I could see in the Early Access stage, at least until the next batch of new content is added in January. It doesn’t take long to unlock all the research available and once you have the town starting to thrive you’re waiting for raids to hit or explore a big but rather sparse world. Regular content updates will be needed to keep people invested in their worlds, otherwise the inhabitants will face more than a harsh winter.”</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-chapter-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-chapter-5-not-coming-in-2026s-first-half-chapter-6-officially-confirmed.1298079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox has revealed that the game's fifth chapter isn't going to be ready until at least the second half of next year, but there's some good news as well: a sixth chapter has officially been confirmed.</p>

<p>As part of the game's <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/autumn25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fall newsletter</a>, Fox says that he "[doesn't] think that the game will be released in the first half of 2026", presumably referring to&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s fifth chapter rather than to the game as a whole.</p>

<p>He says that as of September 8th this year, Chapter 5's early areas are complete but in need of polish for some optional areas, while the last 40% of the chapter is in a "rough first pass" state, with the final 10% currently being prototyped.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-sans.jpg?itok=s5szU5gM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-sans.jpg?itok=r3oxRAbs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>Chapter 5 won't be along until the second half of next year at the earliest.</figcaption></figure><p>The newsletter also contains the first official confirmation of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>Chapter 6; Fox says that "one programmer is already working on the regular enemy bullet patterns of Chapter 6", with regular enemies in Chapter 5 being "mostly done".</p>

<p>It was already fairly obvious that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>would have at least two more chapters following Chapter 5. The game's chapter selection screen shows space for seven chapters, but this is the first time Fox has overtly referred to a sixth chapter for&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, he doesn't provide any kind of timeline for Chapter 6's release; since Chapter 5 doesn't have a release date yet, it would perhaps be strange if Fox knew when its followup would arrive.</p>

<p>In the case of Chapter 5, Fox says he and his team will release it "when it's done", and that he'll continue to update expectant fans on the progress of the chapter as it's made. Hopefully, it won't be too long until the next update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=HD6mVzkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=V19o4CWl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A sixth chapter of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>is officially in development.</figcaption></figure><p>Fox has traditionally been pretty transparent about&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s development. Back in October last year, he promised that the game's third and fourth chapters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025" rel="nofollow">would definitely release this year</a>, which was subsequently confirmed during a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct show.</p>

<p>He's also pledged in the past that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development" rel="nofollow">development would be "smoother"</a> following relatively lengthy waits for the game's first few chapters, so hopefully, Chapters 5 and 6 will arrive in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s first four chapters on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deltarune/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.

I'm not sure the just-released Troublemaker 2: Beyond Dream is one of those "good games" you're all so bloody obsessed with. My working summary, based on 30 minutes with the demo, is that it's an unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">Like A Dragon/Yakuza game</a> developed with a fraction of the budget, and set in "fictionalised" Indonesia. That's to say, it's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> comedy beat 'em up with a bunch of other genres haphazardly stirred in. 
</p>
<p>
I compared it to Rockstar's work and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saints-row">Saints Row</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-dying-light-a-martian-themepark-sim-a-glossy-rpg-remake-and-some-cuddly-lego-co-op">this week's Maw</a>, which was Mostly Wrong. This is a predominantly on-foot experience, for one thing, and you can't grievously assault people at random. There are designated gangs of hoodlums you're permitted to punch out, and as far as I can tell, you have to wait for them to Make Trouble first. It seems very polite and passive for a brawler. Also, you get to transform briefly into a dying cow.

<p>
I'm writing up the demo partly because "Troublemaker" is a brilliant name for an urban sandbox brawl-me-do. Such boisterous Beano energy. Petition to call the next Call Of Duty "Bang Street Kids" and the next Doom "Marine the Minx". The previous Troublemaker from 2023 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1498740/Troublemaker/">which was pretty well reviewed</a>) took place in a high school - and what is a city, I guess, but a larger school with fancier social dynamics and also, roaming delinquent students called "cars" that waste you instantly on contact. I'm interested to see how far they can extend this "troublemaking" concept. Could we perchance Make Trouble in outer space?</p><p>I'm also writing this up because while I'm not very sold on the button-mashy core combat system, I'm quite struck by the setting. The demo map is a believable jumble of spaces, their disorder amplified by film grain and pop-up. There are neon sculpture trails, pavements lined with scooters, courtyards roamed by lonely broom pushers, half-constructed concert stages, and noisy backstreets where random guys stand on crates twerking. That last one could be a bug.</p>

<p>It feels like a celebration of somebody's neighbourhood. Sadly, you can't enter all the shops and coo over local brands of fast food - often, you're treated to an anime illustration of a shopkeeper. I sound like a massive stinking tourist, I know. I've only ever been to Indonesia in videogames, the last one being the very different <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/afterlove-ep-review">Afterlove EP</a>.
</p><p>
One early hurdle to overcome is the humour. I'm not sure if it's innately awful or poorly localised in English. Possibly, it's both. Example: dropping straight into one of the demo's free roam modes, I approach a man fishing from a bridge. We've barely exchanged hellos when his wife runs up and castigates him for fishing all day. She makes unflattering reference to his "pole" and bullies him back to work with the threat of withholding "our nightly spicy time". I am left alone on the bridge with nothing but questions. And a pole. I try my hand at some fishing myself, but lose interest when I fail the QTE.
</p>
<p>
The jokes do improve in the course of my demo, however uneven the English translation. Subsequently, I meet the aforementioned dying cow, slumped on a corner with a gaggle of onlookers. I moo at the cow sympathetically. The cow tells me that I'm rubbish at speaking cow. This cow, it turns out, has been "gifted by God with critical thinking", and yet now its sorry fate is to be butchered and cooked into rendang. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / indie.io</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I ask whether the cow has any final wishes, and it asks me to pass laws punishing corrupt government officials who steal money intended for 5G towers, or something to that effect. I sense that there may be a joke I'm missing here about Indonesian politics (for context: the game's start-up disclaimer puts the word "fiction" in air quotes). I am unable to pass any laws in the demo, so the cow settles for asking me to help it go on a rampage. There follows a minigame in which <em>I</em> am the cow, barging through cars that conveniently burst like soapbubbles.
</p><p>
Aside from brute catharsis, the tragic bovine encounter also furnishes me with some important background knowledge. Shortly afterwards, another sidequest sees me answering trivia questions posed by a couple of blokes doing a vox pop livestream of some kind. What's rendang made of, they ask? Aha! I know this! That cow was complaining about it earlier!</p>
<p>I somehow score full marks on the quiz, or at least, that's what the NPCs tell me. I celebrate by getting into some lumbering and disconnected brawls with mysteriously hostile dudes in vests, involving light and heavy attacks and parries when I can be bothered. Then I decide that it's time to report back with my findings. It's a deflating end to a demo in which I got to rampage through not-Jakarta as a cow.
</p>
<p>
Troublemaker 2 won't be toppling the likes of Yakuza Zero anytime soon, but it has a similar sense of abandon and generosity. Going by the demo, at least, it's a joyfully ungainly Xmas panto of a game, all glitter and gags and wonky stage punches. Creators Gamecom Team started out as a high school project in 2014, and have also made a bunch of Troublemaker games for mobile. I think I've Made enough Trouble for the foreseeable, but I'm rooting for them. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479770/Troublemaker_2_Beyond_Dream/">Read more on Steam</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>With action-RPGs, it's not uncommon for players to discover character builds that do a little <em>too much </em>damage than initially intended. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-patch-will-fix-one-of-the-most-broken-builds-in-the-game/1100-6531392/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 players leveraged the power of the Stendhal build</a> to wipe the floor with enemies until developer Sandfall Interactive toned down the damage, and Bungie has nerfed numerous Guardian builds over the years, much to the annoyance of the game's fanbase. Borderlands has often been an exception to that school of thought, as players have discovered killer combos between weapons, gear, and skills that have helped them overcome tough fights.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-xbox-series-s-technical-limitations-made-battlefield-6-a-better-more-stable-game.1298040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-series-s/">Xbox Series S </a>version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> was challenging due to the console's technical limitations, but optimizing the game for the system ultimately made the game better and more stable.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">Kotaku</a>, Technical Director Christian Buhl commented on the challenges of developing the sixth entry in the series launching next month on the Microsoft system, saying that the biggest challenge was dealing with the console's limited memory, which was less than that of the studio's mid-spec PCs, and that caused crashing issues in a lot of the levels. Due to these issues, the team focused on optimizing memory usage in Battlefield 6, and these improvements were also applied to the other versions of the game, resulting in a better and more stable game. The specific optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version also didn't take a very long time, as the memory issues were reportedly fixed in one month or two, according to Buhl.</p>



<p>Although the Battlefield 6 developer managed to find an opportunity in the development challenges the Xbox Series S poses with its technical limitations compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S, many more developers have found these challenges to be a serious issue not easily solved. One of these developers is Saber Interactive, which hasn't managed to make the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-cant-run-turok-origins-60-fps/">Turok: Origins</a> run at 60 FPS on the system. Memory limitations were one of the reasons why <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-split-screen-xbox-series-s-challenge/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> took a long time to release on Xbox systems. For the latter to launch on Xbox systems, Microsoft had to amend its parity clause and let Larian launch their games without split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S, which was later added to this version of the game with a patch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Performance Is "Pretty Damn Optimal", Says Randy Pitchford]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-performance-is-pretty-damn-optimal-says-randy-pitchford.1298037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has been paying attention to comments about&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance since it launched this past Friday, and he's got a characteristically brusque suggestion for you if you're dissatisfied.</p>

<p>As part of a very lengthy <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">string of posts</a> on social media platform X over the weekend (which also included multiple threads and responses to other users), Pitchford told one user who suggested&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>should "look good without relying on AI upscal[ing]" to "code [their] own engine".</p>

<p>Pitchford suggested the user "show [Gearbox] how it's done", sarcastically suggesting that those currently working on the game's technical side are "clearly dumb and don't know what they're doing", and that "the world's greatest" technical staff "don't seem to know what [the user seems] to know".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-comments-character.jpg?itok=b_ycA7dQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-comments-character.jpg?itok=GqinSjS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you unsatisfied with&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance? Randy Pitchford reckons you should "code your own engine".</figcaption></figure><p>For context,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report" rel="nofollow">launched on Friday</a>, has attracted a Mixed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">user review score</a> on Steam, with the majority of negative reviews pointing to sub-optimal performance as their reason for scoring the game negatively.</p>

<p>Some users are suggesting that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>runs poorly on hardware that's pretty new in PC terms, although others say that features like DLSS and frame generation alleviate the problem significantly.</p>

<p>Pitchford himself <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424849653236055" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recommends</a> that players use DLSS, since&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was "built to take advantage of it", dismissing criticisms of input latency and describing&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance on PC as "pretty damn optimal". He suggests PC gamers should "tune to [their] preferences using the tools available".</p>

<p>Despite these comments, it is worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>did receive <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an update</a> over the weekend, and that said update was intended to address "stability for a wide range of PCs", so it does look like Gearbox and publisher 2K intend to address these performance issues.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game to come under fire for lackluster PC performance in recent years.</p>

<p>Others include the likes of Capcom's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-statement" rel="nofollow">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, as well as indie titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, although none of these games are built on Unreal Engine 5, which some&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players are blaming for the game's issues.</p>

<p>In any case, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and make sure to check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/randy-pitchford-how-20-years-of-borderlands-led-to-borderlands-4" rel="nofollow">our interview with Randy Pitchford</a> to find out how the game came together.</p>

But Nintendo is said to have once planned a more concrete backstory that linked Rosalina and the Mushroom Kingdom, with her being related to Princess Peach in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Years later, eagle-eyed fans spotted a mysterious tease within 2023's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, in a scene which sees Peach discuss her origins, and reveal how she first arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You don't seem like you're from here," Mario says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't know where I'm from," Peach replies. "My earliest memory is arriving," she continues, as a flashback shows her, aged as a toddler, turning up in the Mushroom Kingdom via a warp pipe. Dressed in a skirt decorated with stars and moons, she is quickly found by a group of Toads. "I was so lucky they found me. They took me in, raised me like one of their own, and when I was ready they made me their princess."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/peach1-1757935750838.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Peach arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom, wearing a skirt featuring stars and moons.

Mario suggests, though Peach seems to disagree. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a huge universe out there, with a lot of galaxies," she hints, as the camera pulls back to focus on the night sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a moment some fans believe is a nod towards Peach's own galactic origins — and with it, the link between her and Rosalina that Nintendo ultimately shied away from confirming long ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario games are not known for their story, and Super Mario Galaxy's director Yoshiaki Koizumi has admitted he wrote Galaxy's storybook in secret each evening, after other developers had left the office. Ultimately, he surprised even Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto with the idea, and an adapted version of his plans was ultimately included. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/peach2-1757935750839.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"There's a huge universe out there, with a lot of galaxies."

Last week's Nintendo Direct also provided some clues. Koizumi and Miyamoto both appeared, with the former announcing a physical version of Galaxy's storybook as a tie-in product, and that additional storybook pages would be included for the first time in the Switch 2 re-releases of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Super Mario Galaxy Movie headed into space next year, fans may finally get some answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nitendo-switch-2-held-back-cpu/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Games powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are likely held back by the system's CPU, and some engine updates, taking the system's specifications into account, will be required to implement some of the engine's trademark features on the console.</p>



<p>In a new analysis shared on YouTube, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tPvLuU_JxQ">Digital Foundry</a> take a look at the Unreal Engine 5-powered games now available on Nintendo Switch 2, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Fortnite, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a>, highlighting how all three games do not sport the engine's headline features like Lumen and Nanite. The fact that they are missing in Fortnite, in particular,  is rather telling, as it heavily suggests how the engine doesn't yet have a good preset to make an already released game run with these features at acceptable performance on Nintendo's new system. Having a high lower-level barrier to running high-level features like Lumen, Naninte and Virtual Shadow Maps, Cronos: The New Dawn and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/">Borderlands 4</a>, which will only launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next month, struggle to run smoohtly on a CPU like the Ryzen 5 3600, leading to a variety of issues, including traversal stuttering, which would be a lot worse on a slower CPU like the Switch 2's.</p>



<p>How the Nintendo Switch 2 CPU holds back Unreal Engine 5 games is made clearer by how Fortnite runs on the system. As highlighted in the Digital Foundry analysis, there are some sort of "transition zones" used to load new elements into the game, which show some frametime issues that would be significantly worse if the most demanding UE5 features were in. As such, at the current stage, there's likely no way to scale down these features to a level the Nintendo Switch 2 could handle them, having been developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S specs in mind, especially their CPUs, which are much faster than the Switch 2's. Like in the other consoles' case, it will take some dedicated work and some updates to create a good profile to run games with Lumen and Nanite on Nintendo Switch 2 at acceptable performance.</p>

<p>Although it was suggested before release that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/">Nintendo Switch 2 CPU shouldn't have been a problem for games</a>, it looks like it is the most challenging aspect of the system, and not only in Unreal Engine 5 games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">The state of the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Gamescom demo</a> also suggested how the system's CPU is impacting performance significantly, requiring more optimization work to make games run at acceptable, playable framerates.</p>

              <p>The Find My app makes keeping track of all your able stuff real simple. I’ve relied on it the time I left my iPhone behind at a restaurant, when I left a MacBook under the table at a coffee shop, and even when my Apple Watch fell into a river That one I never found, but hey, at least I knew it was in the river (I should really be taking better care of my things). The Find My app’s usefulness is undeniable, even if you’re just using it to track friends when at an event together or when traveling to a new city. Gee wiz, wouldn’t it be great if you could use that awesome feature on more than just an iPhone and other Apple stuff?</p>
<p>AirTags, people. That’s what you need. Amazon’s got a pretty stellar deal happening right now on a four-pack right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Normally going for $99, or about $25 each, the online retail giant has them for just $75</a>. The 24% discount shave’s $24 off the price, making them each average out to a a bit under $19.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep Track of Everything</h2>
<p>These quarter-sized discs can be attached or placed inside of any amount of your belongings to make tracking them just as easy as it is for your iPhone. You can place on on a keychain so you don’t ever misplace your keys again. Stick one inside your wallet to that stops going missing around the house. Through one in a case with your Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck. The big brain move is for when you travel. Place one in each of your checked bags. I’ve had my luggage go missing before and just having one of these could have save days of headaches.</p>



<p>Setting up the Apple AirTags couldn’t be any easier. With just one tap, they will be paired with your iPhone or iPad. Once connected, they will each populate in the Find My app next to any Apple devices you may have. You can then give them individual names so you know what exactly you’re tracking. Name the one you put in your purse, “Purse.” Name the one on your keys, “Keys.” Name the—oh, you get.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Let’s say you know your keys or wallet or whatever the AirTag is in is somewhere in the house. You’re just not sure where exactly.</a> In the Find My app, you can initiate the AirTag to play a sound. They each have a built-in speaker so you can easily locate your belongings among your clutter or through various rooms of your home.</p>

            <p>
Hell is Us creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête called the surprise release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> "a little callous", believing it had an impact on his game's sales.
</p>
<p>
Rogue Factor's adventure game was already locked in for its release ahead of Team Cherry's announcement, but the two games eventually released on the same day.
</p>
<p>
"When you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like – wow," said Jacques-Belletête on <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/">Skill Up's Friends Per Second podcast</a>. "As the '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> of indie'... to shadow drop something like this is a little callous."

<p>
After Team Cherry's announcement, the Hell is Us development team discussed with publisher Nacon whether to change the date. "It was a real thing," said Jacques-Belletête.
</p>
<p>
However, the "real pain in the ass", Jacques-Belletête explained, is that changing release date means refunding pre-orders. And while that wasn't a deciding factor, the team believed they could weather the storm.
</p>
<p>
Still, Jacques-Belletête admitted Silksong's release did impact the launch of Hell is Us. "I don't have any specific numbers,"he said, "at least not at this time. But for sure it did."
</p>
<p>
Above all, Jacques-Belletête highlighted the difficulties of finding an appropriate release window in the current climate.
</p>
<p>
"That's the thing nowadays, honestly – getting a window where you're pretty much alone is almost impossible," he said. "15 years ago, the mid-end of the summer was always a dead period. But there's no such thing anymore. It's just constant madness."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">Plenty of games did change their release date in the wake of Silksong's launch</a>, including Demonschool and Baby Steps.
</p>
<p>
"Hell is Us is an absorbing, nightmarish meditation on the horror of war, but divisive design choices prove tedious," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hell-is-us-review">Hell is Us review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It feels like ages since I’ve played a proper Japanese dungeon-crawler. Back in the 3DS and PS Vita era, we were spoiled for choice – a new&nbsp;<em>Etrian Odyssey&nbsp;</em>entry was always around the corner, the&nbsp;<em>Persona Q&nbsp;</em>spinoffs were coming out at a steady clip, and there was a horde of dungeon crawlers to choose from on the iconic PlayStation handheld. As the visual and content expectations for modern games has grown, it’s kind of outpaced the lo-fi and scrappy nature of a traditional first-person dungeon crawler. The only reason I’m diving into a new one now, that title being&nbsp;<em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster,&nbsp;</em>is because it’s an updated release and first-time localisation of a game that came out over 15 years ago. Diving into it now is a delightful blast from the past that I had no idea I was in such dire need of.</p>
<p>youtube.com/watch?v=kzICEVJisBU&amp;themeRefresh=1</p>
<p><em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> is a dungeon-crawler RPG that’s set against a school-setting backdrop. When you boot the game up, you’re given three different schools to choose from for your playthrough. While the flavour text makes it seem like this is just an aesthetic choice, the ramifications here are surprisingly huge. Your starting school not only dictates your character uniforms, but it also entirely changes the region you start in, the teachers you train with, the roles your characters can take on, and the quests you’re doing. </p>


<p>These changes in quests and locations also inherently lead to major differences in difficulty across the 3 schools. It’s a surprisingly inventive approach to “difficulty settings” that feels akin to the way an MMO will give you different starting regions based on your chosen race – and it’s something I’m surprised more games haven’t done.</p>
<p>Once you’re enrolled in school, the loop of the game is deceptively simple. You’ve got some barebones narrative reasons for going out into an escalating series of dungeons. As you explore, you’ll level up your characters, get money and materials to acquire new gear, run into incredibly difficult monsters, and acquire more levels and more gear until those monsters are milquetoast. Much like the&nbsp;<em>Disgaea&nbsp;</em>series, this game is built around giving you a sandbox to grind in, a massive amount of gear and unlockables to grind for, and leaving you to your own devices. As a result, it’s an incredibly love-it-or-hate-it kind of game.</p>


<p>Some quality-of-life features you might expect from a JRPG, for example, are entirely absent here – but they’re kind of absent on purpose. Battles can be repetitive and lengthy, yet there’s no way to speed them up or automatically squash lower-level foes. For a masochistic dungeon-crawler fan, that’s music to your ears. But if you’re someone who ends up bouncing off that kind of purposefully repetitive dungeoneering, there isn’t much else on offer in <em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> to occupy your time or make those encounters any less taxing. </p>
<p>One refreshing feature is the ability to swap your character classes at any time. This doesn’t lead to any sort of exciting dual-class or skill-inheritance systems, though – you can no longer use abilities from your previous class once you swap to a new one. Still, it’s nice to be able to make the mistake of leveling a class that isn’t working out for you and have an instant way to remedy that without feeling like that character is useless now.</p>

<p>Additionally, there’s a fun relationship-chart system in <em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> that I appreciated a lot. As you build your adventuring party, you’re also tasked with setting up a connective web of relationships between all of them and deciding which characters like each other or dislike each other. These connections can lead to buffs or debuffs in battle, and often times one character liking a different one can lead to another person in the party having negative feelings for someone as a result. </p>
<p>It’s all framed like one of those relationship charts out of a bonus manga chapter, and I love how it helps add an extra layer of self-driven roleplay to the experience. One of my favorite parts of an open-ended dungeon crawler like this is getting to craft my own stories and personalities for each character, and the game giving me a tool to cook up inter-party relationships on top of that is so fun.</p>

<p>Ultimately,&nbsp;<em>Class of Heroes 3&nbsp;</em>is an incredibly simple but dauntingly dense dungeon-crawler. There’s a massive amount of classes, enemies, gear, and skills to grind for and acquire. The grind to get all of those is going to be absolutely repetitive and mechanical, but that’s the kind of thing that makes a game like this so satisfying to dump time into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="undertale 10th anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab24f5e410d85/undertale-10th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to believe that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> is 10 years old, innit. A game that released just a year after the birth of my eldest son, and two before my youngest arrived on the scene. What is time? It's all going so quickly.</p>
<p>I bring my kids up here, not to be one of those tiresome people, but because Toby Fox's masterpiece (and you better believe that's exactly what it is) is a game that has the honour of being the first I was introduced to and drawn into entirely by the efforts of my terrible offspring.</p>
<p>Rather than the usual occurrence in our house, where I scream excitedly at them both that they simply must play the latest Very Shiny Thing™, as well as all of the classics — what kind of an education misses out on the classics? — that sit at the top of their respective genres. You know, a bit of the old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario</a> to cover platforming, a shot on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_ridge_racer">Ridge Racer</a> for everything they'll ever need from a driving game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a> just for the hilarious graphics patter...all that sort of stuff that dads like me need to help us through our days.</p>

<p>I've always stuck to the safe bets, trying to gently introduce my sons to things they'll get a handle on quickly and then actually enjoy so they're not put off the hobby, but this has proven to be an idiotic approach. Yes, as it turns out, funnelling your kids through stuff that's deemed cool by you, or "appropriate" for kids by the industry, is perhaps preventing them from chancing upon something that genuinely, in real time, could have a positive effect on their lives.</p>
<p>What on earth am I talking about? Well, Undertale, if you haven't played it, is the sort of game that doesn't perhaps grab your attention straight away, hence why I had totally missed it back at release. I will also admit that I still wasn't really bothered, even when I caught a glimpse of some seriously good-looking review scores. It just didn't seem like my sort of thing. What an absolute balloon animal I have been in my previous life.</p>
<p>Because now, 10 years down the line, I can't really remember a time when my eldest hasn't been either talking about Undertale, making little Undertale projects on his PC, or quoting the game in every situation he can get away with. Even more pleasingly for me, he's taken up piano and keyboard (and has been eyeing up my incredibly dusty guitar), all thanks to his love affair with this game's masterful soundtrack. Did you know Undertale has one of the greatest soundtracks in video games? No? Well, my friend, now you do. Indeed, I reckon we're looking at a top-five spot without any issues. Fight me.</p>

<p>Toby Fox's chiptune masterpiece takes in a crazy amount of influences and spins them into gamified bangers. There's acid house here, jazz, choral, hardcore breakbeat...and I know, I know, with so many influences surely the end result is some fine-but-watered-down tributes. Wrong! These songs, songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ9XtKJHvjQ">Heartache</a> (the first where I was like "Okay, this actually slaps"), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKAiUtWZ4xY">Bonetrousle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEbHopRL0OA">Stronger Monsters</a> (incredibly hardcore stuff) and on and on.</p>
<p>You gotta go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BR7-AzE2dQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_l6pEkEJgy577R-aDlJ3Gkp5rmlgIOu8bc">check this album out</a> if you haven't already heard it. It's important. That is a fact. It has significant cultural importance, I feel, and part of this, besides the obvious popularity of the game, is how I have watched this music positively affect and inform my children.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna talk about the story of Undertale here, it's a game I've played a bunch of times now, but always in fragments; repeated, never in order, broken up with kids' arguments or other things to do in the house. It's also something you should just go away and play and experience on your own for maximum effect without having any information relayed or spoiled. But as much as it's fully suitable, in my opinion, for kids, it also doesn't shy away from some weird, weird s***.</p>

<p>Neither does it step back from dark themes and real-life stuff. Death and all that crap. Eating too much and feeling sick afterwards. Y'know, the big things. There are lessons, lessons that stay with you — and I've watched them stay with my eldest as he'll still reference the game or a character (Sans is a constant in our house) in discussions — about violence and where it leads to, about greed, about making the right choice at the right time, about having to live with the consequences of the things you've done.</p>
<p>I mean, <em>steady on</em>, that's a bit much for the kiddies, no? Maybe take a break and play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/race_with_ryan">Race With Ryan?</a> Let's never do that.</p>
<p>As much as things can get a bit edgy at times, it's these aspects of Undertale, and especially if you are playing it with younger gamers present, that makes almost every screen a delight, because you've now got the onscreen puzzles (top tier across the board) sat alongside the real world mental puzzle of explaining things delicately to your children as they crop up. I mean, a father threatens his own son at one point in this game. How do you think that went? It's fun to learn together!</p>
<p>It's not hard to see how it's got such a cult following, considering all of this, and how it gives younger gamers so much to chew on and come back to time and again.</p>

<p>Finally, and another delightful thing, especially for a parent, is watching how much both of my kids have got into all sorts of actual messy art-attacking (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsHuNuoAfV0">hi, Neil!</a>) off the back of the unique pixel style that Toby Fox used for Undertale. These characters and situations are easy to recreate, to add to your backpack (and draw all over your mum's office).</p>
<p>It all opens doors to creativity and, alongside the music aspects, and the little life lessons we've discussed as they've played and replayed the game over the years (you better believe these guys are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> fans now, btw), Undertale has gone from something that would very definitely have passed me by, into something that has become an important, relatively speaking, part of my relationship with my kids.</p>
<p>So that's nice. Happy birthday, Undertale. I still have to use a guide to play you when my kids aren't around, and I'm not even ashamed to admit it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox is probably happy overall about the Borderlands 4 launch, which quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke series records</a> for concurrent players active on the Steam platform and did it again this weekend, topping 304K players sixteen hours ago. However, it also has to deal with performance complaints for the PC version, which have been voiced loudly in over 16 thousand and a half Steam reviews, which are currently 'Mixed' (67% rating).</p>



<p>Gearbox Software co-founder and president Randy Pitchford tried to address the performance <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a lengthy X thread</a>, alleging that there are some '4K stubborn' PC players who either don't have the hardware to run the game at Ultra HD resolution and should switch to 1440P, or perhaps do not want to use upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS even if they have access to them.</p>



<p><em>I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4K with ultra max settings and using 2-3 year old hardware. You do you, but Borderlands 4 and UE5 are doing a lot, and for me, that trade-off for frames isn’t worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade-off - the game looks amazing at 1440p. If you’re not 4K stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you’ve got a beast of a video card, you’re probably fine at 4K. But if you’re in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade.</em></p>



<p><em>If you have a DLSS option, use it! Especially if you’re trying to run at resolutions higher than 1080p. This is a campaign game - you’re not competing in high-stakes esports here. The input latency is so insanely negligible that less than .01% of the population could reliably detect it without tools in a blind test. Take the W on frame rate and use this incredible tech with DLSS on.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, many comments that can be read not only on Steam but also on Reddit, X, and other social channels are from users who insist on using native rendering only. As seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's benchmarks</a>, even the most powerful graphics card available on the market, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090, stops at around 48 frames per second with maxed settings and 4K native resolution. But games are not designed anymore to be running at native resolution, and to be honest, they haven't been for a long time on either PC or consoles. Besides, with the latest NVIDIA DLSS transformer model and AMD FSR 4 (which can be enabled at a driver level by 9000 series users), the visual quality is excellent and the performance gains are massive.</p>



<p>The Gearbox executive eventually <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered</a> one such comment that invited the studio to make their game 'look good without AI upscale'. As usual, Pitchford did not mince words:</p>



<p><em>Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please. We will be your customer when you pull it off. The people doing it now are clearly dumb and don’t know what they’re doing and all the support and recommendations and code and architecture from the world’s greatest hardware companies and tech companies working with the world’s greatest real time graphics engine coders don’t know what you seem to know.</em></p>



<p>While there is an argument to be made that Borderlands 4 perhaps doesn't look as good as it should for how taxing it is on hardware, and Gearbox absolutely has work to do to improve performance through patches, deliberately choosing to keep AI upscaling disabled when both current hardware and software are designed with that in mind feels like living in the past.</p>



<p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the studio <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> there is no spyware in the game. The first PC mods have already been uploaded to Nexus, and we've listed a few useful ones <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-borderlands-4-mods-remove-outlines-bloom-fog-tweak-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>
