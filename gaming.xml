The leaked materials, which have details for a dual-fan ASRock Arc B570 Challenger OC GPU, suggest that the new chip may feature 18 Xe2 cores and 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 160-bit memory bus.</p><p>The leak also indicates that Intel’s Arc B570 chip could come with the 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 2.6GHz GPU clock, along with support for HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1. </p><p>The rumored specs for the Arc B570’s slightly more powerful counterpart — the Arc B580 — have been floating around as well. An early Amazon listing <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-b570-specs-leaked-18-xe2-cores-10gb-memory-and-pcie-4-0x8">spotted by <em>VideoCardz</em></a> suggests that the Arc B580 could arrive with 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 192-bit memory bus, a 2.8GHz GPU clock, and an 8-pin PCIe power connector.</p><p>Judging by these specs, it seems Intel’s Battlemage chips are designed to compete with more affordable graphics cards, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">like the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 7600</a>. Though we still don’t know how much Intel’s new chips will cost, a product listing shared by <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861788237456711881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861788237456711881%7Ctwgr%5E0f3b2be26b93fa4b7b0634731f5fc84a40464720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F24309086%2Fintel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">@Momomo_us</a> shows Intel’s “Limited Edition” B580 card priced at $250 — less than the $399 RTX 4060Ti and $269 Radeon RX 7600.</p><p>The reveal of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs is just days away, as the company confirmed that it will make an Arc-related announcement on December 3rd at 9AM ET from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intelgaming">its YouTube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since he hasn’t been in a giant franchise…yet, his box office numbers aren’t as big as some of his contemporaries. However, he’s made up for it with nine acting Oscar nominations and two wins. His new film “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/in-gladiator-ii-denzel-washington-is-a-villain-unlike-1851704950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/in-gladiator-ii-denzel-washington-is-a-villain-unlike-1851704950">Gladiator II</a></span>” is already creating buzz for a tenth nomination and has become one of his most successful films with its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/black-hollywood-excellence-two-black-led-films-wicke-1851707332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/black-hollywood-excellence-two-black-led-films-wicke-1851707332">huge opening weekend</a></span>.</p><p>With the legend poised to take over the Broadway stage in “Othello,” then bring the project on screen, possibly appear in “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/five-characters-we-want-to-see-denzel-washington-portra-1851696651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/five-characters-we-want-to-see-denzel-washington-portra-1851696651">Black Panther 3</a></span>,” once again work with Spike Lee, collaborate with Steve McQueen and make two more “Equalizer” films, we need to take a few moments and celebrate all things Denzel Washington with his highest grossing movies worldwide, per <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1778156289/?ref_=bo_hm_rd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1778156289/?ref_=bo_hm_rd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a></span>. </p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Friday, November 29.</em></p></div></div><div><p>The amazing thing about “American Gangster” is that it has so many quotable moments and everyone has their favorite. It’s why we keep coming back to it over and over.</p></div><div><p>In just its first week of worldwide release, the follow up to the Oscar winning epic is already one of the acting icon’s most successful films. If it continues on its current path, it won’t take long for it to jump into the No. 1 spot. We know he’s supposed to be the villain, but how can we ever truly root against our king.</p></div><div><p>Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds isn’t a team we were expecting, but somehow their two different styles work in this fun, good vs. evil action film.</p></div><div><p>What makes Washington so fantastic in “Philadelphia” is how you can still discover something new in his performance all these years later. He and Tom Hanks are perfection here.</p></div><div><p>If you like government conspiracy thrillers and major movie stars, this ‘90s hit is probably one of your favorites. If we’re being honest, we weren’t expecting it to be this high.</p></div><div><p>In his first outing as “The Equalizer,” Denzel entered the action hero conversation with a brutal, violent trip to a big box hardware store. We’ll never look at Home Depot or Lowe’s the same way again.</p></div><div><p>This was meant to feel like a final chapter, but we’ll watch Washington “equalize” problems forever if he keeps making these awesome movies.</p></div><div><p>Just in case you’re wondering, that’s a franchise total of $573,798,455. Half a billion dollars for an action franchise led by a Black actor is a major deal.</p></div><div><p>Every time Spike Lee and Washington team up, it’s magic. The way “Inside Man” unravels its complicated web is beautiful and even more fun on subsequent viewings. And of course, in a ridiculously star-studded cast, Denzel is a spectacular anchor.</p></div><div><p>Spoiler alert for a movie from 2006: the time travel plot is a lot. Don’t think too hard about it or you’ll get a headache.</p></div><div><p>Not only were we not expecting this runaway train epic to crack the top 10, it’s also surprising to see how evenly split the box office is between domestic and international numbers. It brought in $81.5 million domestic and $86.2 million globally.</p></div><div><p>Despite a cast that includes Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke, we’re giving all the credit for this western’s success to Washington. </p></div><div><p>Washington delivers another classic performance in “Flight,” but we’re still not happy about his character’s fate.</p></div><div><p>Washington and Gene Hackman go toe to toe in this thriller that somehow feels relevant again.</p></div><div><p>Word on the street is we’re getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/01/the-book-of-eli-prequel-series-john-boyega-shopping-network-1235799330/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/the-book-of-eli-prequel-series-john-boyega-shopping-network-1235799330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Book of Eli” prequel series</a></span> starring John Boyega. He’s an amazing actor who can definitely bring the emotional weight required for the role. But that doesn’t mean we don’t want a Washington cameo if possible.</p></div><div><p>As quadriplegic forensics investigator Lincoln Rhyme, Washington brilliantly conveys his character’s emotional upheaval without venturing into pity or mockery.</p></div><div><p>We’re not claiming this is one of his instant classics, but clearly some people enjoyed it. Even amongst John Travolta’s overacting, Washington is rock solid.</p></div><div><p>If you don’t like “Remember the Titans” we have serious questions about all your life choices.</p></div><div><p>Even when you’re a legend, they won’t all be winners. We’re totally blaming Mark Wahlberg for the lower box office total.</p></div><div><p>If this were a list of Washington’s best action movies, “Man on Fire” would definitely be in the top five. It’s his unmatched ability to draw you in and make you truly feel every single one of Creasy’s emotions that makes him so great.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-recommend-id="image://4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="697" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Film Real/YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-recommend-id="image://4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="697" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Following the Sept. 11 attacks, this 1998 film about similar attacks in NYC leading to martial law sort of faded away, as it was a little too real in how it portrayed the United States’ response to the situation.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There is no avoiding the (mechanical) elephant in the room so let’s get it out of the way: Boy oh boy does this game look and play like Sony’s Horizon franchise. A female protagonist with a bow and a big stick for finishers? Check. Set in the far future over multiple biomes including lush rainforests and deserts? Check. Giant mechanical beasts with weak points that glow, that look and even move the same as those in Horizon? Check. Even the music is similar.</p>
<p>There are natives, dressed exactly the same as those in Horizon, the protagonist has a glider exactly the same as Horizon, there’s red grass for stealth, the trailer has characters entering a cave and finding cave paintings a scene lifted from the original HZD Trailer. But hey, completing ripping off one franchise isn’t enough so why not take the Ghost from Destiny and add them in as well, including the exact same scanning animation. </p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While Horizon can’t lay claim to inventing mechanical beasties, Zoids were doing that back in the 80s, the art style is so similar you could honestly think some of of this trailer was from a Horizon game. </p>
<p>However, Light of Motiram is an open world survival game rather than an action adventure so there is base building, crafting and all that sort of thing. So that’s different and absolutely, totally not the sort of thing that would be in Sony’s upcoming Horizon online multiplayer title. </p>

<p>Light of Motiram will be free to play and is coming to PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam </a>and the Epic Games Store, assuming Sony’s lawyers don’t get to it first. </p>

            <p>A teaser for an unreleased Lego James Bond game has leaked online.</p>
<p>Whilst there's very little information accompanying the leak - apparently, it just popped up on Iinterni Gamer's Discord server at 2 am one day - it appears that at one stage, TT Games was considering a blocktastic bonanza based on Bond.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the trailer is still live, and several mirrors have been uploaded - you can check it out below:</p>

</span></p><p>"This trailer got leaked surprisingly on my Discord server, and it's an official trailer cause literally everything that appears looks exactly as the previous trailer but with final designs. Possibly its [sic] on reddit but [I don't know] really," wrote the uploader in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkSR8L8Gjwc">YouTube description</a>.</p><p>Rather than being based on one particular Bond or movie, the teaser features a number of iconic portrayals and films, including Live and Let Die and A View to a Kill. For the full-minute-long run-time, a disclaimer states: "Confidential (TT Games Studio) - Not for distribution. R&amp;D content only - not representative of any final products".</p>

</span></p><p>"This wasn't actually for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a> year 3 [as described in the reddit thread], it was produced as a pitch for The Lego Group to convince them to give the okay for a full game, it was made during the last year Dimensions was being worked on when TT knew Dimensions wouldn't get a third year of content," they said.</p>
<p>"Once again, TLG decided Bond wasn't suitable, and vetoed the project. I think this has been found in the data of a Dimensions build, which is where the confusion is coming from."</p>
<p>"This was around 2016, and LEGO specifically were not happy with the violence and sexual innuendo," they added in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1h0jkr3/comment/lz97qu1/">follow-up comment</a>.</p>
<p>"Characters called Pussy Galore and Plenty O'Tool wouldn't really work in a family-friendly Lego game. Although I'm sure TT could make it work. TLG these days seems more willing to try different things in games, so it could potentially be revisited, the biggest barrier for TT would be WB forcing them to stick to owned IP."</p><p>If you want to expand your IRL Lego collection, you're in luck - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/physical-lego-horizon-adventures-set-sees-aloy-taking-on-a-bricky-shell-walker-and-sawtooth">Lego has just unveiled a new Horizon set</a>.

Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

		<p>NBA 2K23 is no longer available to purchase from digital storefronts, as 2K delisted it overnight. This was expected as 2K had confirmed this would be happening in September, and follows the general pattern of NBA 2K game servers being shut down a couple of years after release. NBA 2K23 was released on September 9th, 2022.</p>
<p><iframe title="NBA 2K23 | MyCAREER Trailer | 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khEO9BDIlio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you attempt to search for NBA 2K23 on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, Steam, and the Nintendo eShop you will hit different results. For example, on the Xbox Store, PlayStation Store, and Steam store there will be no listing for the NBA 2K23. While on the Nintendo eShop the game page is still up, but with only the option to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/NBA-2K23-2266457.html">wishlist NBA 2K23</a>. The physical editions of NBA 2K23 can still be purchased from various retailers.</p>
<p>On December 31st, the servers for NBA 2K23 will be shutdown. 2K states exactly what this means. <em>“After this date, you will no longer be able to play multiplayer games or access any online game modes. MyCAREER and MyTEAM will no longer be available, and it will no longer be possible to earn Virtual Currency (VC). While you will still be able to enjoy Play Now, MyNBA, The W, and MyWNBA, any features that require a connection to 2K servers will be unavailable. This includes multiplayer, Online Leagues, and community sharing.”</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cod-movement-mechanics-dev-reveals/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98a-massive-problem%E2%80%99-cod-dev-reveals-why-movement-mechanics-were-slowed-after-mw19.1048926/</guid>

<p>On social media, a Treyarch developer has written a transparent post explaining why Call of Duty’s movement seemed to slow down after 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. He also explained why certain mechanics aren’t all that effective in Black Ops 6, despite them having been a staple in the Call of Duty space for many years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faster-is-not-always-healthier">‘Faster is Not Always Healthier’</h2>



<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/MaTtKs/status/1862340934832132335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>, Treyarch’s Matt Scronce confirmed – in a way – that movement mechanics were slowed dramatically after MW19 because ‘faster is not always healthier’. He explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once prone and crouch speeds become too fast, you end up with mismatch between 1st and 3rd person POV leading to “snaking” which has been a massive problem in the past.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Modern Warfare’s movement mechanics were fast-paced and intense, with slide cancelling, snaking, and jump shots making up the meta that eventually worked into Warzone when it was released in March 2020. These elements remained, but players were forced to contend with slower, heavier games that felt nerfed in terms of movement.</p>



<p>Scronce’s comments were posted in response to a video comparing Black Ops 6 and MW19, showing how much slower the game has become over the years, particularly movement mechanics like jumping.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve never personally been a fan of spamming jump during combat, so when we intentionally designed omnimovement mechanics, we adjusted sway/bob when jumping by default to ensure that wasn’t the most effective tactic during engagements. </p>



<p>If you want to spam jump while shooting, we have Perks and Attachments to increase effectiveness just like we do for slide and dive.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’ve been relying on jump shots for all these years and wondered why you’re having no luck hitting your shots now when doing so, that’s your explanation in black and white.</p>



<p>Scronce signed off with a reassurance that Treyarch is always evaluating feedback and making improvements based on the community’s sentiment.</p>

<p>Delta Force is preparing to go head-to-head with the likes of Arena Breakout: Infinite and Escape from Tarkov in the extraction shooter world. Recently, it was revealed that the developers are willing to work with a relatively controversial mechanic to compete with the games that spearhead the genre.</p>



<p>When Delta Force’s extraction mode hits an end-of-season ‘wipe’, players will be able to decide if they want to opt in or not. That means that with each new season, players can carry their progress over rather than wiping and starting from the beginning.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-a-decision">Make a Decision</h2>



<p>For the extraction shooter community, a regular wipe makes sense. It ensures that things remain balanced, allowing players to all sit at the same level once every so often. In Escape from Tarkov, wipes typically occur once every six months, and when each wipe arrives, so too does a major game update that changes the playing field.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Escape from Tarkov’s developer, Battlestate Games, released a PvE mode in the game that allows users to play indefinitely without undergoing a wipe, and that was a hit with many players – particularly those who don’t have the time to grind once every six months.</p>



<p>Delta Force is following in those footsteps – in a way.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed that when a wipe arrives at the end of each three-month season in Delta Force, players are given the choice to either wipe and start fresh or retain what they’ve earned and unlocked and keep playing as normal.</p>



<p>There’s a twist, though. If you choose to wipe, you’ll unlock exclusive rewards and abilities, one of which is the opportunity to spawn as a boss character and take enemies down using powerful weapons. </p>



<p>It’s entirely up to you.</p>



<p>Will you be wiping in Delta Force, or would you prefer to stick with the same gear forever? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you thought Fortnite didn’t have much left in the tank, you’d be sorely mistaken. Recently, the game reached new heights during the Juice WLRD finale event, racking up a whopping <strong>14.3 million </strong>concurrent players, a new all-time high for the game. </p>



<p>This new record effectively decimated the number secured by the arrival of Fortnite OG last year. When the game’s original map was reintroduced, just north of 11 million concurrent players found their way into the game, but that record has been left standing in the dust.</p>



<hr>







<p>Fortnite’s live events are nothing short of monumental, and they never fail to attract millions of users. </p>



<p>In the past, we’ve seen the likes of Travis Scott, DJ Marshmello, J Balvin, and Ariana Grande appear in Fortnite to perform live shows before millions of fans. Typically, these shows have been accompanied by in-game events, limited-time bundles, and skins.</p>



<p>The most recent event brought about an end to Chapter 5, and it saw the late Juice WLRD perform tracks while accompanied by jaw-dropping visuals.</p>



<p>This is a new bar for Fortnite, and it will likely go untouched for some time. </p>



<p>Fortnite’s newest season starts today. The launch trailer for the new season dropped a couple of days ago and it showcased some upcoming content, including a Godzilla-themed event, of all characters. </p>



<p>It has been a glowing year or two for Fortnite. From the arrival of the new UEFN to the success of Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing, Fortnite is in top form and continuing to impress gamers after almost ten years on the market.</p>

The trailer, which is reminiscent of an anime opening sequence, showcases many of the hero characters coming to the game, and there are a few easter eggs and references sprinkled in for good measure.</p>



<p>It’s an energetic trailer that has fans stoked for what’s to come. Check it out below.</p>

<p>I love the trailer for Marvel Rivals – particularly the sequence that unfolds midway through showcasing a gaggle of characters replicating the iconic group shot seen in 2012’s The Avengers.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer to add a little more fuel to your hype train:</p>

<p>On YouTube, a trailer for a cancelled LEGO James Bond project that would have been developed by TT Games has emerged. It’s only 50 seconds long, but it showcases a game that was reportedly scrapped several years ago, about the time when LEGO Dimensions was discontinued.</p>



<p>It has been claimed online that the game was being pieced together during ‘the last year LEGO Dimensions was being worked on’ in 2016, but it was ultimately decided that James Bond wasn’t a suitable franchise to focus on due to the ‘violence and sexual innuendo’ that the series is famed for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brick-by-brick">Brick by Brick</h2>



<p>LEGO has dabbled with many game-based franchises over the years, ranging from Star Wars to Indiana Jones, but it never delivered a James Bond project. Given the expansiveness of the JB universe, it seems as though a LEGO series would write itself – and with the release of this leaked trailer, we now know how close we came to that being realised.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer that was released on YouTube (live at the time of publishing):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Leaked Unreleased LEGO James Bond Game Trailer - FINAL VERSION (READ DESCRIPTION)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkSR8L8Gjwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases iconic scenes from various James Bond projects, and for something that was scrapped quite early on, it looks relatively polished. It seems as though it was set to be a fully voiced game, which was starting to be the standard for LEGO games around the time that LEGO JB was reportedly being developed.</p>



<p>Sadly, LEGO James Bond was lost to the abyss of time and won’t ever see the light of day.</p>

<p>Ella Purnell, one of the faces of the Fallout TV show that debuted on Prime this year, is soaking up source material in anticipation of the show’s second season. Purnell, who plays Lucy MacLean, fronted the Emmy Award-winning show when the first season was released in April, working alongside Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten to bring the post-apocalyptic universe to life.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, Purnell revealed that she’s been instructed to play Fallout: New Vegas to ‘prep for a certain job I may or may not be on soon’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-the-wasteland">Back to the Wasteland</h2>



<p>Fallout premiered in April 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, emerging as one of Prime’s biggest launches ever. It proved to be a boon for the entire franchise, as player counts soared across everything from Fallout 4 to the online title, Fallout 76. It was a resurgence of sorts for the series, and for a while, Fallout mania was running wild.</p>



<p>On Bluesky, Ella Purnell posted that she’s playing Fallout: New Vegas – on Xbox – in preparation for filming the show’s second season, which was due to start in November but may have been delayed, if Purnell’s post is anything to go by.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Purnell responded to some fan requests to head north through Quarry Junction after starting the game, realising several hours later how much of a mistake that was. New Vegas veterans will understand why that’s such a problem.</p>



<p>This morning, Purnell posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously time isn’t on my side to absorb all the source material in time. I will still absorb the game until I’m called to the wasteland.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout: New Vegas is considered the best game in the series by many, and we <strong>know </strong>that it’s the setting for the second season per the closing moments of the show’s first season.</p>

While it’s easy to focus on the new bestiaries, rods, fish, and mutations added to the overall experience, fans should note that the update comes bundled in with the gargantuan Megalodon Hunt. It’s an event that adds giant prehistoric creatures to fish for, making this an especially enticing addition to one of Roblox’s most popular games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/30/fisch-ancient-isles-the-megalodon-hunt-1732988478803.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fisch The Ancient Isles update gives Roblox fishing game its biggest content drop yet.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ancient Isles have just been discovered—lush jungles, glowing ruins, mystery filled caves, and ancient fish whisper of secrets long forgotten,” a description from Fisching says. “What mysteries could these legendary lands unveil? Treasure, danger, and prehistoric wonders await those daring enough to explore!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fisch players can look forward to two Bestiaries – the Ancient Isles and Ancient Archives – as well as a whopping 12 new rods and 39 new fish. Today's update also comes with Rod Crafting and eight new mutations. There’s a lot to explore in the Ancient Isles, and thanks to an increased level cap of 750, you don’t have to worry about maxing out your level too early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to what Fisching calls “a ton” of quality-of-life and bug fixes, Fisch fans can now find a rotating fan art board in Moosewood that will feature more player creations as future updates roll out. There are also a few new titles, new ziplines to use around the map, and optimization settings to take advantage of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fisch has lured in thousands of Roblox fans since it released earlier this year, but today’s update has helped it reach new heights. The Ancient Isles and Megalodon Hunt event have both propelled the fishing experience into the public eye more than ever before, as players will now find it placed firmly <a href="https://www.roblox.com/charts#/?device=all&amp;country=all" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">atop the Roblox top trending charts</a>.

This is something I've never expected. In a million years.

                <p>Fortnite is gearing up for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-start-date-battle-pass-skins-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-5955/" data-ref-id="2900-5955">Chapter 6 Season 1</a>, closing the book on Remix Chapter 2 with its massive Remix Finale event, the latest in a years-long run of in-game concerts that Epic has put on for players. Shortly after the event, the official Fortnite account on Twitter/X revealed that the Remix Finale event was, in fact, the biggest in-game concert the game has ever hosted.</p><p>With more than 14 million players, this latest event has usurped Travis Scott's "Astronomical" in-game concert from 2020 as the biggest Fortnite in-game music event ever. Scott's interactive concert saw a high of 12.3 million players. In the summer of 2021, Ariana Grande starred in the Rift Tour, a concert of a similar scale, though player counts were never revealed for it, thereby inferring the total was less than Scott's showcase.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1862950664281919658" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">You.

In the case of Scott's show, this led to nearly 28 million unique players experiencing the concert before its run of shows came to a close. Today's event, however, will be shown just once more at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET today, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-servers-are-down-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up-for-chapter-6-season-1/1100-6527547/" data-ref-id="1100-6527547">Fortnite is down</a> ahead of Chapter 6 Season 1. The new chapter is expected to begin tomorrow, December 1.</p><p>The show featured a four-pack of artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and Juice WRLD, with the lattermost appearing<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-epic-is-bringing-the-late-juice-wrld-to-fortnite/1100-6527957/" data-ref-id="1100-6527957"> posthumously and with the blessing of the late artist's mother and record label</a>. Many other concerts have been in the game since Grande's, including shows starring The Kid Laroi, Metallica, and many more, but there is often a noticeable difference in scale among these various shows. The Remix Finale event was much more in the style of the Astronomical and Rift Tour shows, making it the first to feel that way in three years.</p><p>The event also came close to being Fortnite's biggest live event ever, though that distinction still belongs to the Marvel crossover event from December 2020, during which time <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1333954587879821314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game saw a peak count of 15.3 million players</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has finally done it. Tonight's Remix Finale event has at last beaten the game's long-standing concurrent player record for a live concert, set back in 2020 when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-eye-popping-live-concert-hits-all-time-player-record">12.3 million players tuned in for the first broadcast of its lockdown-era Travis Scott concert</a>.
</p>
<p>
14.3 million people were in-game tonight for Fortnite's Remix Finale event, according to the game's public player stats, while millions more were watching online via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube. 
</p>
<p>
That's higher than the 9.8 million watching in-game earlier this month when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-than-10m-fortnite-players-watch-snoop-dogg-ice-spice-headline-concert-streamed-live-from-times-square">Fortnite Remix mini-season kicked off with a livestreamed concert in Times Square</a> featuring Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice. It's more than double the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-live-event-sees-56m-players-defeat-doctor-doom-in-hour-long-battle">5.6 million players who logged in for October's hour-long Doctor Doom boss battle</a>. And perhaps most impressively, it's also higher than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">last December's much-hyped The Big Bang event</a>, which was attended by 10 million players at the end of the game's hugely popular OG season.
</p>
<p>The only event to ever get higher within Fortnite was its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">Marvel season finale featuring Galactus</a>, again back during the lockdown era of 2020, when 15.3 million people were in-game.</p>

<p>It's been a while since Fortnite itself has commented on its own player stats. Tonight, Epic Games <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1862950664281919658">noted</a> the Remix Finale's huge attendance and it confirmed it was a record for any Fortnite concert event. Excluding concerts - which draw huge engagement but are brief affairs - Epic Games last noted a player milestone at the launch of last year's OG season. Then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">an astonishing 44 million players logged in over 24 hours, for Fortnite's biggest day ever</a>. (Could this record be broken next week, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG returns as a permanent mode</a>?)</p><p>
Fortnite's Remix Finale kicked off on top of Snoop Dogg's restyled Agency headquarters, site of the fan-favourite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-device-live-event-analysed-as-epic-sets-up-fortnites-longterm-future">Chapter 2 live event The Device</a>. Here, players saw the first of several nods back to previous Fortnite live events, as pylons rose from the waters surrounding the building - now decked out in loudspeakers - and the 'Device' itself appeared - now a giant microphone for a skyscraper-sized Snoop Dogg to pick up and rap with. Snoop's section of the event continued with the rapper free-styling alongside a cel-shaded version of himself, around the Agency and then also in a space-set section where players skipped along a planet's rings.
</p>
<p>
As Snoop blasted off atop the Battle Bus, Eminem dropped in for sequence initially inspired by his appearance in last year's The Big Bang event. This was followed by a brilliant anime-inspired section where Snoop fought Fortnite's fan-favourite bear robot (or Mecha Team Leader, to give its full name) from the game's memorable 2019 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-fortnites-mecha-vs-monster-battle-played-out">mecha versus monster battle</a>.

</figure>
<p>Next up came Ice Spice, initially via a more intimate sequence that saw players follow the rapper across city rooftops. A second track saw her turn kaiju-sized, before players were sent off to the concert's final section featuring the late singer and self-proclaimed Fortnite fan Juice WRLD, who died in 2019. </p><p>How Fortnite handled Juice WRLD's involvement here was interesting. Never before has the game highlighted a celebrity who has passed away, but this section felt an engaging and respectful tribute. Players saw a giant version of the singer surrounded by stars and Fortnite's rift butterflies, rapping on the horizon. One section, featuring the newly-released track Empty Out Your Pockets, saw players transform into and move around the sequence as one of said butterflies (with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/moments-of-2018-when-fortnite-stopped-everything-for-a-butterfly">nod back to the game's 2018 butterfly event</a>, too). And there was more Juice WRLD to come - at the very end of the concert, there was the option to watch the debut of the official music video for the track. It's a stylish animation set within Fortnite's world, featuring many of its characters, and fitted tonight's proceedings perfectly.</p>

<p>As the music came to a close, fans of Fortnite's storyline were treated to something more - a look towards the game's future, with some key characters again along for the ride. </p>
<p>The event's end saw long-time Fortnite hero Jones and Chapter 5's new main character Hope zooming off into a rift, quickly followed by the Battle Bus and what looks to be a shard of the Zero Point. Huh! As players followed, they were taken to... the game's new Japan-inspired battle royale Island, which will launch properly tomorrow morning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-launch-trailer-goes-live-early-reveals-roaming-godzilla-and-giant-turtle">Yesterday's trailer leak</a> - presumably meant to go live after the event tonight - picks up immediately after, showing the Zero Point shard impacting the Island and sparking demons to come through a portal. Oops. But that's tomorrow's problem.</p>
<p>Back to tonight, and Epic Games has an encore showing of the Remix Finale event scheduled for 1am UK time (8pm Eastern, 3pm Pacific), should you wish to join in yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24308372/fortnite-remix-finale-concert-juice-wrld-chapter-6-how-to-watch">most recent virtual concert</a> was supersized in multiple ways. Unlike previous events, which focused on specific artists like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>, this one featured a cast of four different artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD. And it turned each one of the large lineup into a kaiju-sized performer, while also integrating deep cuts of <em>Fortnite</em> lore and providing a tease of what’s next for the game.</p><p>Things started out at Snoop Dogg’s compound, which has been at the center of the battle royale map since the beginning of November. From there, a gigantic version of the rapper performed, before whisking players away into space for another song. In fact, the event constantly moved around: up next was Eminem who fought against a giant robot following a dramatic storm, followed by Ice Spice towering over a cityscape like Godzilla. It ended back on the battle royale island with a pair of Juice WRLD songs.</p><p>The humongous versions of the stars were reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">the Travis Scott show from 2020</a>, and — much like the Grande concert — the event also weaved in bits of <em>Fortnite</em>’s strange history. Eminem’s sequence was similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot">the game’s mecha-monster battle from back in 2019</a>, while during Juice WRLD’s songs players were turned into the glowing butterflies that first appeared in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"><em>Fortnite</em>’s ambitious black hole event from the same year</a>. At the end players were given a glimpse of what appears to be the new version of the battle royale island that will be playable when the game’s next chapter kicks off on December 1st.</p><p>After things wrapped up, the game was used to premiere Juice WRLD’s new animated music video for “Empty Out Your Pockets,” which takes place inside of <em>Fortnite</em>:</p><div><p>This all comes after an interesting, music-filled month for the battle royale game. At the beginning of November Epic kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">a remixed version of <em>Fortnite</em>: Chapter 2</a>, which was a month-long and focused on a different musical artist each week. It was preceded by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">a real life concert in Times Square from Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice</a>. The mini season also introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301624/can-i-kick-it-yes-i-can-on-thursday">a new cosmetic item in the form of kicks</a>, and saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301710/fortnites-subscription-is-about-to-become-a-better-deal">Epic revamp its battle pass structure</a>.</p></div><p>The concert not only closed out Chapter 2: Remix, it also set up the game’s next mainline season. It’s called “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one">Hunters</a>,” and it kicks off on December 1st with new additions like Godzilla and Baymax, along with a completely new battle royale island. Here’s the first trailer:</p><div><p>While the Chapter 2 event is over, <em>Fortnite</em> isn’t done with the nostalgia. Epic is bringing back <em>Fortnite </em>OG — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season">a throwback to the game’s original map</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">as a permanent fixture on December 6th.</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
