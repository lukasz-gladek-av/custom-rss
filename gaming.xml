		<p>Permafrost will be coming to Steam Early Access in 2026, SpaceRocket Games has announced today, but a playtest will be taking place ahead of the early access release. You can register for the Permafrost playtest now via the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254990/Permafrost/">Steam page</a>. Along with the early access announcement, a new trailer for Permafrost has been released showing various elements of gameplay including base building, hunting, and co-operative play.</p>

<p>In a blog post, the development team said, <em>“First of all, thank you for your support and patience throughout the last year. Your dedication to providing critical feedback, suggestions, bug reports and technical troubleshooting during our demo was a literal game changer. With your help, we have been able to lock in the vision for our Early Access release – we have been in the icy trenches since – focusing on improving the core elements of the game, including stability, performance, and key gameplay foundations. So, this brings us to the release date. Permafrost will release into Early Access in 2026. We want to bring the best possible Early Access release build to you – one that’s not rushed, but rather polished and with a solid foundation, built with your feedback, reports, and requests. In other words, it’s for the best. We know it sucks to wait, but hang in there and let the devs cook, it will be worth it.”</em></p>
<p>Permafrost takes place in a world where the moon shattered and Earth plunged into a never-ending ice age. Among this icy world, players will need to find scarce resources, hunt for food, and work with each other to survive the wintry landscape. The game supports four player co-op but there may be clashes with groups that are not your own. The cold will be an ever present danger to all players, so building shelters will be necessary to survive. The development team will be releasing a deep dive on Permafrost next week to delve more into the game’s systems.</p>

<p>As revealed in today's trailer drop, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>10th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The story DLC sees you and Team MZ investigating mysterious distortions that have been cropping up across Lumiose City, connected to the strange land of 'Hyperspace Lumiose'.</p>
<p>Here's the official summary from the new trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just when Team MZ’s efforts seem to have restored peace to Lumiose City, something strange begins to happen—mysterious distortions start forming all around town. You’ll also meet a mysterious young girl named Ansha, who is accompanied by the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We can expect new Mega Evolutions (Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y take pride of place on the key art), plenty of Hoopa content, and more than a little eerily-silent dialogue from you and your MZ pals. Hey, at least the dimension-hopping looks interesting enough.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some of those new Mega forms for Baxcalibur, Chimecho, Diancie and Meganium:</p>

<p>As a reminder, the DLC will set you back <strong>£24.99 / $29.99</strong>, and it is now available to buy on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html#DLC">Switch eShop</a>.</p>

<p>Well here's a dish that we weren't expecting! Team17 and Ghost Town Games have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overcooked-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Overcooked 2! - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is being served up today!</p>
<p>As initially revealed back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, this is the same old co-op cooking chaos that we all know and love, garnished with some new features to make the most of the beefed-up system.</p>
<p>We've got 4k 60fps gameplay in docked mode, we've got camera integration so everyone's screaming faces can appear on screen, we've got GameShare for playing with pals on one copy of the game, heck, there's even a new chef: The Pristine Platinum Platypus.</p>
<p>A pretty balanced meal, no? Well, it won't arrive for free. Those with the Switch 1 version of the game will be able to upgrade for <strong>£7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99</strong>, or you can pick up the full Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> on the eShop. There is a 20% discount running on the storefront for one week only, so you can sneak in and grab an early bird offer if you want to plate up soon.</p>

<p>And for all those wondering, yes, there is cross-progression for this release, so all of your precious DLC and save data can be transferred over to the new edition without any troubles — nobody wants to see those three-star runs go to waste.</p>
<p>A spot of Overcooked can be a dangerous game over the holiday season, but with the right chefs in the kitchen, we're ready to head back in for another good old giggle.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-last-caretaker-out-now-early-access-on-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/craft-and-build-your-way-to-saving-the-world-in-the-last-caretaker-out-now-in-early-access-on-pc.1345570/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Former <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Trials developers</a> in Finland came together to form a new studio called Channel37 back in 2021. Four years later, as of today, that studio has released its debut project, The Last Caretaker, in early access on PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>It's a survival building and crafting game where you step into the circuitry of a care-taking robot who wakes up to a world that is, quite literally, underwater. You go about waking up the ship you're on, and once your ship's engine is back up and running, the journey towards saving humanity begins, as you explore the vast ocean and hunt for the resources you need to improve your ship, and complete your ultimate goal: saving humanity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last Caretaker - Early Access Launch trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZgDWk0xFNU?start=84&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Along with this early access launch, Channel37 revealed its roadmap for the game, which seems to hint towards the studio looking to get the 1.0 version of The Last Caretaker out sometime next year. Its first major update is coming before the end of this year, which will add new modules, night vision, a new node questline, warehouses, caves, and a basketball game. </p>



<p>Then in 2026, Channel37 has four major updates planned, one to start the year, two in the spring, and one in the summer. Assuming none of those updates get delayed, we could be looking at a release date for the 1.0 version of the game, aligning with its early access release date today.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Last Caretaker roadmap. Image credit: Channel37</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>We're delighted to share our vision with players, and are committed to the long-term future for The Last Caretaker</em>," said co-founder of Channel37, Antti Ilvesuo. "<em>We wanted to make a world that feels like it could exist; it's survival that makes sense. Sharing this roadmap now shows our intention, and we'll deliver all of this and more as we head toward full launch in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>Whether you grab The Last Caretaker on Steam or the Epic Games Store, make sure you have the latest graphics drivers, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/">NVIDIA confirmed it will support DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation and Super Resolution</a>. You can also play it through <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-add-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-anno-117-pax-romana-in-november-2025/">NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>, if you prefer.</p>

			<p>On the first GeForce NOW media blast of the month, NVIDIA has outlined the planned roadmap of PC games that will be added to the cloud gaming service throughout November 2025.</p>



<p>Chief among them is, without a doubt, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The game developed by Treyarch Software will be available from day one via GeForce NOW. Granted, its PC specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-trailer-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are definitely not too demanding</a>, and playing a competitive first-person shooter isn't something I would advise even with the latest upgrades brought by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new RTX 5080-class servers</a>, but having the option is always nice.</p>



<p>Other highlights include Anno 117: Pax Romana, Assetto Corsa Rally, Where Winds Meet, and Project Motor Racing. Here's the full list of PC games due to be added throughout November:</p>



<ul>
<li>INAZUMA ELEVEN: Victory Road (New release on Steam, Nov. 10)</li>



<li>Surviving Mars: Relaunched (New release on Steam, Nov. 10)</li>

<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assetto Corsa Rally</a> (New release on Steam, Nov. 13)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where Winds Meet</a> (New release on Epic Games Store, Nov. 14)</li>



<li>SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide (New release on Steam, Nov. 18)</li>



<li>Long Drive North (New release on Steam, Nov. 18)</li>



<li>Demonschool (New release on Steam, Nov. 19)</li>



<li>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, Nov. 20)</li>



<li>Project Motor Racing (New release on Steam, Nov. 25)</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (New release on Steam, Battle.net, and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, Nov. 25)</li>



<li>Brotato (Steam)</li>



<li>GODBREAKERS (Steam)</li>



<li>Megabonk (Steam)</li>



<li>R.E.P.O. (Steam)</li>
</ul>



<p>This week, GeForce NOW users can look forward to the following additions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Europa Universalis V (New release on Steam, GeForce RTX 5080-ready, Nov. 4)</li>



<li>7 Days Blood Moons (New release on Steam, Nov 4)</li>



<li>Whiskerwood (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, Nov. 6)</li>



<li>The Last Caretaker (New release on Steam, Nov. 6)</li>



<li>Voidtrain (New release on Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, Nov. 7)</li>



<li>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage (Steam)</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA confirmed that the Montréal and Amsterdam server regions will go live with brand-new GeForce RTX 5080-class servers this week. The Phoenix server is slated to be the next in line for the upgrade.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s</a>&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>DLC was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708">contentious announcement</a> when Game Freak and Nintendo confirmed its existence before the RPG launched last month, but whether you’re thrilled about paying an extra $30 on top of the base game or not, the expansion is coming and it’s actually launching pretty soon. Game Freak announced today that <em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on December 10, and it released a ton of new footage alongside it showing some returning characters, new Mega Evolutions, and what looks like a pretty sizable post-game story.</p>  <p>As we knew from the original announcement,&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>will include Hoopa, the dimension-jumping legendary Pokémon, opening rifts to what looks like a different version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431">Lumiose City</a> that includes new wild Pokémon. We see a few monsters not native to the Kalos city, including Chimecho, Baxcalibur, and Corviknight in the trailer, the latter two of which are getting new Mega Evolutions as part of the expansion. The DLC also includes some new and returning characters, including <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>gym leader Korrina, who is referenced in the main game but never shown.</p>

 <p>Apparently Pokémon will be able to exceed level 100 in this alternate dimension, so if you’re going to play the expansion, make sure you’ve got a maxed out team ready to take on whatever challenges await. That said, it does look like one of the new characters, Ansha, will be able to help upgrade your team, so you won’t be completely washed if you’re using some weaker ‘mons.</p>  <p>While the full expansion is a month away, if you log in to&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>now, you can take part in a new, free side quest that will add the legendary Pokémon Diancie to your party, and comes with its Mega Evolution stone. You’ll just need to use the online Mystery Gift function to claim the stone, then complete the quest alongside Emma, Lumiose’s Naruto-running detective.</p>

<p>Square Enix is fully aboard the generative AI train. As part of its latest earnings report on November 6, the company says that it wants AI to handle at least 70% of its QA and debugging on projects by the end of 2027.</p>



<p>They said that a joint research project with the Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo that is <strong>“aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies.”</strong> Square Enix even held a company-wide idea contest with a theme of AI that has seen <strong>“several selected ideas developed into projects and currently being promoted internally.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as how the research is being done, Square <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that it’s a team</a> of more than 10 people. This team includes researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory as well is engineers from Square Enix. The overall goal, the company says, is to give them a “competitive advantage” in game development.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Square Enix for comment on if this plan would ultimately lead to layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokemon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose. This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokemon and other Pokemon not usually found in Lumiose, some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.</p><p>Hoopa’s powers are awakened when it receives one of Ansha’s donuts, transforming the distortions into portals to hyperspace. Ansha uses Berries to create various kinds of donuts that grant different effects in hyperspace, such as powering up your Pokemon. She can also use more potent Hyperspace Berries, which are useful for taking on the high-level Pokemon in Hyperspace Lumiose.</p><p>Trainers will be joined by new allies such as Korrina, a successor to a line of Mega Evolution gurus determined to encounter every Mega-Evolved Pokemon. Together with Team MZ, players will explore Hyperspace Lumiose, uncover its secrets, and tackle the strange events befalling Lumiose City.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Another year, another batch of 'World of Warcraft could be coming to console' speculation. The instigator this time: the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion Midnight, which seems to be providing Blizzard with a time-and-place to snip away game add-ons and simplify the combat experience. Speculation says this is being done to prepare the game for a long-awaited console release.</p>
<p>Weight has been added to this argument by a couple of things. One, that Blizzard is owned by Microsoft, which of course makes Xbox and is now actively engaged in spreading its games to as many other platforms as it can, including PlayStation 5. And two, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-comes-after-the-xbox-series-consoles-well-its-pretty-much-just-a-pc-even-the-microsoft-ceo-has-said-so">Microsoft came out recently and suggested the next Xbox will work a lot like a PC</a>. Given that, WoW on console seems to make sense.</p>
<p>But Blizzard has poured cold water on the speculation. WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4">the Unshackled Fury podcast</a> that, "There's no reason for us to hide anything about this. If we were actively working towards bringing WoW to consoles, or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying, 'We're actively working towards it; we know we have a lot of work to do but it's a place where we want to land.'</p>
<p>"Our focus remains right now on the PC-based experience," Hazzikostas said.</p>
<p>It's a strong reply but WoW on console remains a perennial debate surrounding the 20-year-old game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-world-of-warcraft-on-console-finally-be-happening">I recall asking WoW executive producer Holly Langdale</a> a year ago whether a console release could finally be happening, following the Microsoft acquisition, and her answer was intriguingly cagey.</p><p>"I will say nothing's impossible," Langdale told me at the time, smiling. "I can't say anything more than that." Then, she laughed and started to say something but stopped herself and instead said: "No, that's all I'll say." Then she laughed again.</p>
<p>Consoles are in a completely different place to where they were in 2004/5 when World of Warcraft launched. Not only are they technically more capable but their internet infrastructure and network services have improved dramatically. Plus, Blizzard already runs services like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> across multiple platforms. However, in terms of size, World of Warcraft is many orders of magnitude bigger.</p>
<p>But putting MMOs on consoles is not impossible. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> managed it, to great success, and The Elder Scrolls Online has long been playable there too. What will it take, I wonder, for Blizzard and Microsoft to make the move? Or rather: what's the hold-up?</p>
<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight, the second expansion in the Worldsoul Saga trilogy, is due sometime next year. More excitingly, player housing is being added to the game after all these years, in December, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">an ambitious system Blizzard is describing as "a sociological experiment"</a>.</p>

<p>As today is launch day, we now know who to thank for such musical bangers, and it's none other than the music group Monaca — the sound team behind the <strong>NieR</strong> series.</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment popped up on the <a href="https://monaca.jp/en/works/13333">Monaca website</a> today, crediting Keiichi Okabe, Kuniyuki Takahashi, Oliver Good, Keita Inoue, Taichi Joraku for the composition, and Ryuichi Takada for the arrangement.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2srloij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>The production studio was founded by Okabe back in 2004, and has since provided tunes for games and anime alike, even picking up the coveted 'Best Score/Music' award at the Game Awards 2017 for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a>.</p>
<p>The team has long served on the NieR series, though you'll also find their works in PS5 titles like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/foamstars">Foamstars</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>, and they even assisted on a handful of songs in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> soundtrack.</p>
<p>This is the first time they've had a Nintendo joint to themselves, mind you, and we are big fans of it. We described the score as "excellent" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">our review</a>, and have been leaping back to the music player on more than one occasion to listen to select tracks in isolation.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-cracks-steams-all-time-top-10-worst-games-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-cracks-steam%E2%80%99s-all-time-top-10-worst-games-list.1345510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam’s user review system can sometimes be overloaded with user bombing and other unfair measures and tactics. However, the writing has been on the wall for Football Manager 26 since its early access beta, and Steam’s all-time worst games list has sadly welcomed it with open arms.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-open-beta-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Open Beta</a> was supposed to signal the welcome return of FM. Anticipation quickly turned to agony after it was found that the game was a bug-ridden mess with an unintuitive UI. Problems quickly piled on problems, and the comeback turned into a nightmare. The full release arrived, and as expected, players weren’t happy with the final product.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It wasn’t worth the wait. Credit to Sports Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Developer Sports Interactive said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-years-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Was Helped By Last Year’s Cancellation</a>. FM 25 was infamously delayed and canceled, putting a huge gap in the calendars of Football Manager fans.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launched to better-than-expected critical reviews. The FM community wasn’t as kind, and the game’s Steam store page was quickly filled with bad reviews, giving the game a ‘<strong>Mostly Negative</strong>‘ review reception.</p>



<p>This isn’t the end of the world, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 REDSEC launched to Mostly Negative reviews</a>. Yet, it’s still being enjoyed by countless users. For Football Manager 26, it went from bad to worse to <em>abysmal </em>very quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FootballGamingZone</a> (through Steam250) found that <strong>Football Manager has moved to number seven on the all-time worst games list</strong> already. It’s better than Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight and FlatOut 3: Chaos &amp; Destruction at least, but it’s a sight for sore FM fans’ eyes.</p>



<p>Strangely, there was no major day-one patch for FM 26 either. Even though it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-riddled-with-performance-issues-on-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">riddled with performance issues on console</a>, it seems like fixes will be a slow rollout. This will surely risk the ire and patience of those who’ve committed to the game early doors.</p>



<p>This is no doubt a huge disappointment for you who’ve had to wait two years for Football Manager 26. Have you bought FM 26 in any way? More importantly, have you played it? Let us know what you think of it, what needs fixing, and if Sports Interactive has any hope of salvaging this mess through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> community has asked for bigger Conquest maps for months, so someone made their own – and they're actually pretty popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have spent the time since launch asking EA and Battlefield Studios for everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-to-revert-aim-assist-settings-as-pc-players-edit-files-to-turn-off-crossplay">aim assist tweaks</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">realistic skins</a>, but few conversations have stolen the spotlight quite like the discussion around map sizes. While some players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">went to great lengths to determine if Battlefield 6 maps are as small as they look</a> and others <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps">took to review-bombing</a>, the more creative individuals are using Battlefield Portal and REDSEC to make larger maps of their own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to work from Reddit users kurtinthegrind and andy_6170 (a.k.a. ViperAndyStudios), the Battlefield 6 community now has Club House, a large-scale Conquest play area that pulls elements from REDSEC’s Southern California-set Fort Lyndon map for an (unofficial) version of the kind of wide-open spaces they’ve been asking for. There are also Tech Center and Operation Tech Center map options, with the former set up as a large-scale, infantry-focused Conquest map, while the latter offers linear gameplay centered around one main building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The credit to the original version of Tech Center and the Conquest Script belongs to Andy,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/two_new_br_maps_with_three_conquest_gamemodes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kurtinthegrind says</a>, “though I've made a few modifications to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Club House and the smaller version of Tech Center are my creations, and honestly, I'm not too proud of them. But until Ripple Effect/Battlefield Studios provides improved Portal support and releases ALL parts of Battle Royale map, these will have to suffice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both bot and bot-less versions of the Club House and Tech Center maps are currently available for players to create servers, but it’s Club House that’s attracting the most attention online. In the middle of a Wednesday, the map, also known as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oovku6/golf_course_is_the_best_bf6_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golf Course</a>, boasts a few hundred active players across different server browsers in Battlefield 6, with some 64-player servers populated almost entirely with real people.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/img-4639-1762378638374.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Portal Club House Conquest Map Page. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We played a few matches on Club House and noticed that, even with around 30 players on each team, combat encounters feel spread out, with infantry required to sprint long distances to reach each Conquest objective without redeploying. Everything from small vehicles like golf carts to attack helicopters and tanks can help with travel, too, with above-average ticket sizes and a relatively large play area resulting in more room for vehicle warfare and lengthy matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is brilliant," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/comment/nmv6sa1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular comment</a> says. "Fingers crossed they actually put these on the official map rotation. For now, I’ll just mess around with my squad."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s certainly a change of pace when compared to other, standard Conquest maps, and it’s an experience those playing on Club House seem to enjoy. Our short time with real-world players saw the in-game chat filled with comments praising the map for its long, clear sightlines and vehicular combat potential.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fingers crossed they actually put these on the official map rotation. For now, I’ll just mess around with my squad.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Portal game modes – Club House Conquest included – have dedicated fans, even if a modified XP rate means significantly slower progression for all. One Battlefield 6 player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ooadm9/for_the_first_time_i_felt_like_i_could_breathe_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to Reddit</u></a> after trying the mode for themselves, saying, “for the first time, I felt like I could breathe in this game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are too many small, cramped, and poorly designed maps in this game, and I never had much opportunity to play normally without constantly confronting opponents in narrow alleys or buildings,” the popular post says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there should be maps like in BF3/4, small, medium, but also large - I know I haven't discovered anything new, everyone has been saying this since the game's release, but we need to keep talking about it until we finally get some comment on the matter.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some have already begun calling for these fan-made maps to join official Battlefield 6 playlists, others argue the emergeance of Club House and other similarly large Conquest maps only serve as proof that Portal is working just as the developers intended. For now, it's unclear if Portal experiences like this could get a bigger spotlight from BF Studios.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although BF Studios has yet to confirm just how big future Battlefield 6 maps will be, we do know that much, much more is on the way. The first post-launch map, Blackwell Fields, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-map-blackwell-fields-in-the-firing-line-as-players-report-being-killed-from-as-far-away-as-enemy-hq-spawn-points">met with criticism from fans</a>, but another new map called Eastwood is just weeks away. Both locations are included as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch">Season 1</a>, with more content set to follow in the months ahead as future seasons roll out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Battlefield 6 and REDSEC, you can read IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review">REDSEC review in progress</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has discussed last year's intense backlash to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and said the unexpected conversation shift "from gameplay to ideology" led directly to its high-profile delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a recent event at Paris Games Week, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameFile</a>, Guillemot screened a short internal video Ubisoft had created to narrate its response to the backlash surrounding Shadows' Black samurai co-protagonist Yasuke — <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-shadows/208502/news/assassins-creed-shadows-dev-addresses-musks-tweet-on-yasuke" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which even saw Tesla and X boss Elon Musk getting involved</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot has now stated that the level of vitriol required Ubisoft to rethink its plans for Shadows — back then, set for launch in November 2024. Ultimately, the company elected to delay the game until March 2025, a decision explained last year as necessary to "polish" the game further. But, behind the scenes, Guillemot says the firm understood it needed to bolster fan sentiment to ensure the game launched to a more positive response.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With more time to improve the game, Ubisoft gave itself the opportunity to share more with fans pre-launch, Guillemot said, something the company hoped would both impress long-term Assassin's Creed aficionados, and move the conversation around Shadows on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we saw is that, by allowing our fans to see in the game — everything they were going to be able to rediscover — of what they love about Assassin's Creed, [that] ultimately helped to combat this aggression, which is linked to the fact that video games have a very strong impact on the people who play them," Guillemot said. "They’re kind of caught between 'I want to play, and what interests me is self-expression within a game' and 'there is a cultural message that comes with the video game.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So our goal is really to be able to ensure that our fans discover and defend what they expect from our games," Guillemot continued. "It very quickly eliminated the fights, which were just fake fights."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an internal video, also shown last week, Ubisoft described its response as a successful turnaround of public opinion on a game featuring a pre-launch crisis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What happens when a legendary franchise reveals one of its most anticipated experiences," the video begins, "only to become the game everyone loves to hate? When conversation shifts from gameplay to ideology? When everything you say only adds fuel to the fire?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In September 2024, we had our backs against the wall, and that's when it clicked," the video continues. "To get out of the corner, we had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies. So we stopped trying to win the argument, and leaned on what had carried us for 18 years: The Assassin's Creed brand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We started by doing the last thing anyone would have advised. We delayed the game. The extra time allowed the devs to polish, optimize, and reach the high standards fans expect from an Assassin's Creed game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It also gave us time to rebuild the Assassin’s Creed brand pact, putting the markers of the franchise back at the center. More hood, more stealth, more leap of faith, more lore. So we could show that the spirit of Assassin’s Creed lives on in Shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Instead of fearing leaks, we showed the game," Ubisoft concluded. "Fans came back, conversations started shifting, and everyone who built, played, and loved this game could be proud again."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The framing of the delay as a positive response to the game's backlash is an interesting one, though one which feels limited considering what we already know from other reports detailing events at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> reported that the game's delay had been widely expected within the company "and desperately needed" to address feedback from playtests and mock reviews (a standard industry practice where external consultants size-up projects before copies are given to press).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking in December last year</a>, former Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté suggested similar, saying that the game's delay was necessary to change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality" (just months after the company's fellow blockbuster Star Wars Outlaws underperformed).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, perhaps most notably, there's no mention here by Guillemot of the fact that Ubisoft's plans to delay Shadows came alongside a decision to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-set-during-post-civil-war-period-canceled-last-year-due-to-increasing-concerns-over-us-political-climate-report">reportedly cancel a separate Assassin's Creed game set in post-Civil War America</a> — a project that would have featured a former slave as its main character. While still in pre-production, the game's fate was apparently sealed after Ubisoft judged the idea too risky to continue amid the current U.S. political landscape — and, to a lesser extent, after having seen the Yasuke backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows has gone on to sell "in line with expectations," Ubisoft said in July, with 5 million copies sold so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud has called on his fans to vote for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> as Game of the Year 2025 over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, calling multiplayer gamers “the minority.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Canadian Michael ‘Shroud’ Grzesiek, who specializes in competitive multiplayer first-person shooters, is a former professional Counter-Strike player who has built an enormous online audience. With 6.8 million subscribers on YouTube and 11.3 million followers on Twitch, his call to action has significant weight behind it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud has thrown himself into Embark Studios’ Arc Raiders ever since its explosive launch, and in a recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2610645158" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch stream</a> mobilized his community to vote for the game when it comes to The Game Awards 2025.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/gettyimages-1054359868-1762430155403.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shroud wants Arc Raiders to win Game of the Year 2025. Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We gotta make sure that this game wins game of the year, by the way,” he said. “Do not let that Expedition game win game of the year. Do not let it. Absolutely do not. We all have to band together to make this game win. Us multiplayer gamers are the minority, okay. We are the minority being multiplayer gamers, but I believe we can win. I believe. You just need to tell everybody. I’ve never voted for anything ever, but I think I’m going to vote this year for this game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the end of 2025 in sight, Sandfall's single-player role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has emerged as a frontrunner for Game of the Year, but Arc Raiders is being touted by some as a strong contender. Other candidates include Hades 2, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Blue Prince, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, among others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does Shroud’s comment about multiplayer gamers being in the “minority” ring true? Research from last year indicated that most gamers prefer single-player games, but there's a significant difference in preference depending on the age bracket. <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/most-gamers-prefer-single-player-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midia Research</a> found that under 25s preferred multiplayer to single-player, with younger generations emphasising social play. But as you get older and it becomes harder to arrange time to play with friends, this preference shifts towards single-player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Younger players prefer PVP, which captures a large swathe of consumer attention and engagement and is enjoyed by all generations,” Midia Research’s Rhys Elliott said in the report. “Convincing players — and their friends — to leave for new titles is a huge barrier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Live-service games are the homes of many highly engaged players. Getting them (and their friends) to relocate permanently to another live-service game is a big ask.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When people talk about the most popular video games in the world, multiplayer games tend to dominate. Roblox games that blow up, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden">Grow a Garden</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/steal-a-brainrot">Steal a Brainrot</a>, typically have a strong community element to them despite not being traditional competitive multiplayer. Fortnite is a multiplayer game through and through. Minecraft can be played either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dominant games on Steam, meanwhile, are competitive multiplayer: Counter-Strike, Dota 2, PUBG, Battlefield 6, and Apex Legends are, at the time of this article's publication, the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. And let’s not forget the likes of World of Warcraft and League of Legends, both of which are multiplayer games. There are huge single-player games, of course, but when it comes to sheer popularity, or monthly active users, free-to-play multiplayer games dominate the industry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, Shroud went on to claim that voting in The Game Awards doesn’t matter. “All the f***ing awards are rigged anyway, who cares?” he said in the same stream. “When have you ever seen an award that’s actually legit?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards uses a combination of votes from the games media and influencers and public fan voting. The voting jury has in the past had more of an influence on the outcome. Keighley has said he’s considered going all in on public voting for The Game Awards, but expressed concerns about “social engineering.” It’s worth noting that The Game Awards has a purely fan-voted category called Players’ Voice. The Game Awards 2025 nominees are expected mid-November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Rockstar Games has pushed back against the claims that a group of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">recently laid-off developers were removed for trying to unionize</a>. Instead, these people were leaking company secrets, Rockstar said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Rockstar told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> that the staffers were "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public form." This violated Rockstar's policies, the company said. "This was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities."</p><p>Between 30 and 40 people were fired from Rockstar's offices in Canada and the UK related to what the developer labeled "gross misconduct." A spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the affected staffers were involved in unionizing efforts and said Rockstar is guilty of "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union-busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p>The union said the affected staffers sent messages within a "private trade union chat group" on Discord. The union acknowledged that outsiders were in the chat, too, but they were labor organizers.</p><p>IWGB president Alex Marshall said Rockstar's management are "showing they don't care about delays to GTA 6, and that they're prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game."</p><p>In 2022, Rockstar suffered a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-leak-was-really-frustrating-and-upsetting-take-two-says/1100-6511236/" data-ref-id="1100-6511236">massive leak that revealed the first footage and details about GTA 6</a>. When Rockstar ordered staff back to the office in 2024, the company cited security concerns as one of the reasons for calling staff back. The union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">opposed this directive at the time.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is Rockstar's next big release, and it's set to launch in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Rockstar's owner, Take-Two, will release its next earnings report today, November 6, at which time the company is expected to communicate more about GTA 6, or at least re-confirm the release date.</p><p>In addition to GTA 6, it's rumored that Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">developing PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 versions of Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.

            <p>Marks and Spencer has released its new Christmas-flavoured food ad for the year, with Dawn French taking a starring role as one of many stuck in a traffic jam on their way home for some festive fun.</p>
<p>Ok, that's very nice and all Victoria, but what has this to do with Pokémon? Eurogamer is a site about video games, after all (I mean, the clue's in the name). Well, it is because I was watching the M&amp;S trailer this morning with my coffee, and when I popped on the subtitles, I got a rather amusing surprise.</p>

<p>At one point during the trailer, Dawn holds a plate of food above the masses gathered in the back of M&amp;S's very plush food lorry, but she is a little unsure what she actually has in her hands. A fairy companion then whispers in her ear, before Dawn proclaims this is, in fact, a plate of pork and mushroom pâté by Tom Kerridge. How jolly!</p>

<p>Except, the subtitles on YouTube can't quite hear her properly, and instead proclaim the Vicar of Dibley actor is presenting a plate of Pokémon food pâté. I checked on another site with a video embedded, and again the subtitles got a little confused, this time instead suggesting Dawn was holding up a delicious Pokémon Shoe. Mmm… yummy…</p>
<p>Anyway, this all amused me, so I wanted to spread some silly kind of Christmas joy your way on this rather overcast Thursday afternoon, and decided to share it with you.</p>

<p>As for Pokémon when they are not being plated up in the back of a lorry by hungry and stressed travelers, the latest video game release made its debut just a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>"Lumiose City could do with work, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is a much more tightly focused - and delightfully goofy - return to better form," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer's three star Pokémon Legends: Z-A review</a>. "At least by modern Pokémon's standards."</p>

We would've loved to bag ourselves the solo Samus figure too, but unfortunately we're not made of money – amiibo cost a lot these days, in case you didn't notice!</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the firing of 30 employees last week and accusations that this was an attempt to stymie efforts by employees to unionise, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rockstar">Rockstar</a> has issued a statement that says the employees were fired for sharing company information in a public forum.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, a Rockstar spokesperson said, “Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies. This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>


<p>All of the affected employees – with 30 to 40 people fired from across the company’s studios in the UK and Canada – were part of a private trade union chat on Discord. There were outsiders within this chat, but they were there from the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) as labor organisers.</p>
<p>Following the dismissals last week, the <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/">IWGB branded it</a> as&nbsp;“a brazen act of illegal union busting”, with IWGB president Alex Marshall calling it “a calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions.”</p>
<p>Marshall has responded to Rockstar’s new allegations to say the company is&nbsp;“afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritising union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.”</p>

<p data-component="paragraph">Rockstar has always been a very secretive studio, something that goes hand-in-hand with the popularity of their games to make leaks of their work huge news stories. For GTA 6, the game has had two very high-profile leaking moments, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/19/rockstar-games-releases-statement-on-gta-6-leak/">a 2022 hack</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/02/gta-6-leak-rockstar-employee/">the friend of an employee’s son leaking more screens and details in 2023</a>. That latter moment was quickly followed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/rockstar-plans-full-return-to-office-for-gta-6-developers-citing-security-and-productivity/">Rockstar calling employees to return to offices for work</a>, having necessarily loosened this requirement and allowed work from home since 2020 – we all know why that was…</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto 6 is expected to release on 26th May 2026, as Rockstar eventually decided that they needed more time, despite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs constantly stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>. But that’s been good news for 2025’s slate of releases, so where games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> had been fairly tentative about launching this year, they could launch with more confidence. That game’s knocked it out of the park, as well, no doubt helped just a little by not having to compete with GTA 6 for the average gamer’s wallet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the most controversial entries in the series to date, and the massive backlash the game received not only threw Ubisoft off, but also had an impact on the game's development.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, during a meeting of video game industry insiders held last week at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft addressed the controversy surrounding the latest entry in the series, starting with a video that recapped how the game evolved into one that everyone loved to hate. At the end, the video revealed Ubisoft's approach to the controversy: it stopped focusing on the haters. This caused the game to be delayed for additional polish, as the publisher focused on appealing to the series fan that would, in turn, defend the game in the culture war that stemmed from its controversial choices.</p>



<p><em>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,"</em> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added after the short video ended. <em>"And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</em></p>



<p>If Ubisoft indeed managed to convincingly demonstrate that Assassin's Creed Shadows is more a game than a message, it's not yet clear at this moment, as no official sales data for the game has been provided by the publisher. It definitely seems to have done well at least in Europe, as it was reported back in August that the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">latest entry in the series was the best-selling new game of 2025 in Europe</a>, beating competition like Monster Hunter Wilds and Mario Kart World.</p>



<p>Although some of the controversies that surrounded the game before launch were justified, and the choice of protagonist and historical inaccuracies can be a turn-off, Assassin's Creed: Shadows is not a bad game at all. You can learn how it refines the formula of its RPG predecessors by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Infantry Fighting Vehicle, which google reliably informs me is a vehicle that's supposed to carry fighting infantry, rather than fight infantry itself, has had its lock-on missiles taken away for the next little bit. Some problems with countermeasures have rendered them far too effective at their job of blowing stuff up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>EA have confirmed the temporary switching off of these missiles in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986379990624088520">post on the hellsite</a>, putting it down to a need to "address inconsistencies witnessed with this vehicle's countermeasures". That appears to be code for countermeasures designed to prevent the likes of jets and tanks being blown to bits a bit too often and from across the map <a href="https://x.com/NerosCinema/status/1979681088399393159">not always doing their job properly</a> to have a chance of stopping the IFV's missiles in their tracks.</p>
<p>So, no missiles for now, with EA aiming to fix the problem in an update set to drop next week. In the meantime, maybe make missile lock and firing noises with your mouth whenever you spot a plane or chopper you'd like to knock out of the sky.</p> 
<p>Based on a <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986043954106626391">post</a> from DICE lead producer David Sirland last night, that next patch will also include fixes for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355">rooftop exploits</a> on maps like Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, and Empire State. These have been seeing pesky players use drones to spirit themselves up to high ground they shouldn't be able to reach, by standing atop the tech and whacking it with a sledgehammer in a fashion that weirdly remind me of the hand-cranked mine carts you get in westerns.</p><p>All of this comes as the devs continue to fiddle around with how much XP is dished out and required by certain activities, with a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229">revamp of challenges and assignments</a> having arrived yesterday. "Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length," EA said of those tweaks.</p>
<p>We'll see how many of these sorts of ongoing issues and gripes end up being locked onto and wiped out by that upcoming patch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve played Battlefield 6 online and willingly attempted to complete challenges, you’ve probably come across a fair few with difficult requirements—borderline impossible ones. EA and Battlefield Studios have rectified this with over 90 tweaks.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has countless Initiation objectives and other challenges spread across the game. This relates to Classes, specific weapons, game modes, and much more. If you’ve spent a ton of time on one or more challenges to no avail, you might finally be in luck.</p>



<h2 id="h-say-goodbye-to-annoying-battlefield-6-challenge-requirements">Say Goodbye To Annoying Battlefield 6 Challenge Requirements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We can see the light. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Battlefield Comms message confirms that “A total of 90+ adjustments to Challenges and Assignments” have been made—and they are active in-game right now.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of the affected challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>“<strong>Assault 2: </strong>Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon. Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li>



<li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support. Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li>



<li><strong>Conquest 3: </strong>Objective kills in a round of Conquest. Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li>



<li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives. Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.”</li>
</ul>



<p>This list is exhaustive, to be quite honest. Engineers will be greatly pleased to hear that the infamous Engineer Specialist 3 challenge has been reduced. Repairing 6,000 Vehicle Health in one match has been slashed to just 1,000!</p>



<p>Also, many in the community are reporting that once matches are being completed, and challenges where you’ve now met the requirements (because of the reductions) are being unlocked automatically. Now’s the perfect time to start playing BF 6, and we have the best way to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/">buy Battlefield 6 for cheap</a>.</p>



<p>Expect to see a lot of challenges suddenly start being completed and popping up.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Should it have taken this long to make such adjustments? Or is it better late than never, as previous BF games might have done?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Where Winds Meet is right around the corner, offering hours of entertainment, and we’ve got all the details on multiplayer and co-op in the title.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet has already achieved huge success in China, where it initially launched in December 2024, and is poised to make a global debut on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on PC and as a console exclusive on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>



<p>Multiplayer is a huge component of modern gaming, though it isn’t always present, and we’ve got all the details on the multiplayer situation in Where Winds Meet.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-where-winds-meet-have-online-multiplayer">Does Where Winds Meet Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of options. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet offers various multiplayer modes, including PvP and campaign dungeons.</strong></p>



<p>The matchmaking social hub can host up to 30 players simultaneously, while campaign dungeons range in degrees of difficulty and support either five or 10 players.</p>



<p>There are also various multiplayer-only challenges spread across the map, though these are entirely optional and can be avoided.</p>



<p>In fact, all multiplayer in Where Winds Meet is entirely optional, and if you’d prefer a solely single-player adventure, there will still be over 100 hours of content to enjoy as a solo player.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-where-winds-meet-have-co-op">Does Where Winds Meet Have Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet supports online co-op for up to four players, while campaign dungeons raise that figure to either five or 10 players working together, depending on the difficulty of the dungeon.</strong></p>



<p>Co-op mode allows players to explore the world together, searching for historic traces, defeating bosses, solving puzzles, and participating in events.</p>



<p>All players in the session will receive rewards for first-time completion of side story or campaign tasks, while players within a certain range will receive rewards for solving puzzles.</p>



<p>There are some restrictions, however, as only certain quest items owned by the host are visible and usable, but all items will be restored to normal when you return to your own world.</p>



<p>Like all multiplayer in Where Winds Meet, co-op is optional and isn’t required, with the game offering plenty to solo players who don’t want to join up with others to tackle the world—though it can help to open a co-op lobby if you’re struggling with a specific boss.</p>

<p>Are you planning on playing Where Winds Meet solo or grouping up with friends? Let us know in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <p>Good news: the second part of the Ark animated television show has reappeared, having once been promised for the latter part of 2024 but never materialising. The bad news: it's been officially delayed.</p>
<p>However, it's not a ridiculous wait we're facing. Part 2 of the Ark: The Animated Series will apparently air sometime in 2026, <a href="https://x.com/survivetheark/status/1986271568406946168">according to the Ark X account</a>. "Thank you for your patience," the tweet ended.</p>

<p>palaeontologist Helena Walker, who suddenly found herself - like a player in the game - awake on an island filled with dinosaurs. Not a bad set of circumstances given her profession, although, you know, with the possible danger of death. The second part of the series will continue Helena's journey as she apparently "levels-up to learn the truth", said the Ark X account. (That it's all a game?)</p><p>The TV series had a surprisingly star-studded cast, including Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh, not-a-good-singer-but-a-great-gladiator Russell Crowe, Elliott Page, Karl Urban, David Tenant and many more. I haven't seen it myself but aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes tells me the series had a middling response.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-developer-acknowledges-missing-in-action-sequel">Delays have become something of a taint for the Ark series in general</a>, the most notable being for the big game-sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>, which was once promised for 2023 but then disappeared. A recently released expansion, Ark: Lost Colony - which follows Michelle Yeoh's character from the TV series - was released in June as a way to bridge the gap until the sequel reappears.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-review.1345429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Painkiller is a series I’ve certainly heard of, but I couldn’t tell you either way whether or not I’ve played it. I must have at some point, I’m sure, because I played every single thing I could get my hands on, but I can’t actually remember doing so. What I do remember that it’s similar to Doom, including all the hellish monsters and environments. You enter a room, kill a legion of monsters, then move onto the next room, where another legion awaits your bullets. This co-op reboot of this two decade old series gets this right, at least, but it’s a bit uninspired because of this.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQjQKqzSssk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will start with the good stuff. Painkiller looks pretty good, the environments are cool in that heavy metal album cover sort of way, full of large ominous bits that trigger the imagination. The music, whilst perhaps a little on the generic side of metal background tunes, does its job of getting the blood pumping whilst you’re wading through demons well enough.</p>


<p>The best part of the game is the gunplay, gun customisation, and traversal though. There are a few guns here, though not nearly as many as you’d hope, but the two starting weapons are real highlights. The first is a stake gun, which shoots a large wooden spike and can be upgraded to pierce through enemies or shoot three stakes at a time, both of which make it incredibly satisfying to use. The second gun fires shurikens that bounce off surfaces and can be upgraded to ricochet off enemies into others nearby and is, again, incredibly enjoyable once you’ve got an upgrade.</p>
<p>The unlockable weapons include slightly more standard weapons like a shotgun, an SMG, a handcannon, and a rocket launcher, but with similar, very powerful upgrades that make them enjoyable to use. That said, after using the stake thrower with the three stakes upgrade, it felt a lot like using the shotgun once I unlocked it, and the stake thrower with the impaling upgrade feels quite a bit like the handcannon.</p>


<p>These guns also have a secondary fire which, when used on bigger enemies with proper health bars, will fill up their stun meter. Once that’s full, you can charge over and completely obliterate them with your one remaining weapon: the Painkiller. It’s effectively a chainsaw, even if it’s more of a spinning shuriken on a stick, and in addition to shredding anything that comes near it, it also generates ammo from enemies it kills. This is handy, of course, because you’re in deep trouble if you run out of ammo when one of the bigger enemies turns up. Clever use of the Painkiller, which has a cooldown for use without stunning an enemy first, and secondary fire can very quickly shred through a bigger enemy’s health bar, which is very satisfying to do.</p>
<p>As for traversal, you can’t sprint, but you can slide. Functionally this works very similarly but is faster when going down hill, slower when going up hill, and knocks enemies out of the way in a comical fashion when there’s a lot of them around. You also have a dodge button, which has two charges that each have a cooldown, that also knocks enemies out of the way. The combination of this movement system and powerful, creative weapons is a great one, making you feel truly powerful even whilst you’re desperately fighting for your life against a horde of beasties. It really can be enjoyable whilst you’re in the thick of all the chaos. One issue in traversal is grapple points not triggering when they should, or sometimes missing your enemy with the Painkiller, which is strange and can catapult you off ledges.</p>

<p>It’s a shame, really, that nothing else in the game lives up to these features. Level design is dull and generic, relying strongly on the kind of mechanics you see in an MMO, like killing enemies within a certain area, or around a barrel that collects their blood that can be shoved into a socket to progress once filled. Or perhaps that <em>totally different</em> mechanic where the barrel collects souls instead. These mechanics even turn up in boss fights, which are messy to say the least and sometimes devolve into frustration.</p>
<p>There are the most basic of basic puzzles dotted through the levels that require two people to get through occasionally – i.e. one to stand on a button and one to go through the door it opens, which usually have a cache of “loot,” if you can call it that as there’s really only four options, gold, health, ammo, and a lure that attracts enemies until they’ve depleted its health.</p>
<p>There are four characters, but beyond their designs – especially Void who seems to have a starfield for a face – and some brief dialogues between them during gameplay, they’re not particularly interesting mechanically or storywise. They each have a particular stat boost that is small enough to be nearly irrelevant, and the story here is almost non-existent. You are in purgatory for various crimes, but Metatron (the biblical voice/scribe of god) offers you a way out, by stopping the fallen angel Azazel from unleashing his demonic hordes onto Earth. You do this by fighting them across three areas, each split into three levels with a boss, and then Azazel. That’s the whole game.</p>

<p>There’s also a tarot card system that mostly seems superfluous because, whilst you’re still unlocking and upgrading your weapons, you spend the resources on doing that, and once you’re done upgrading your weapons, you’ve got little-to-no game left to use them in. The cards can give you useful bonuses such as increased health, quicker secondary fire regen, but I barely used them because they use the same resources to unlock and, once you’ve used a card once, it’s burnt and you have to restore it using the same resources. Not if you died or failed a level whilst using it, just every single time you use it.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft have reportedly offered a corporate spin on the backlash <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> faced from right-wing grifters prior to release, with CEO Yves Guillemot framing it as "a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message". The company also seem to be trying to canonise the events as some kind of masterful marketing victory, which arguably isn't too surprising, even if the fact they're not trying to pretend the controversy never happened is. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, a marketing video about the backlash was shown during last week's Paris Games Week, with Guillemot subsequently making some comments further outlining how the corp - at least in terms of image they're aiming to present to industry event attendees - have chosen to interpret what happened in hindsight.</p>
<p>"We had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies," the video declared. "We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks," Guillemot said afterwards, according to Game File's translation. "And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</p>
<p>Aside from that, which <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">mirroring what the exec said</a> at the height of the controversy, the narrative being conveyed by the presentation looks to have been that Ubisoft scored a win by smartly opting to delay the game to polish it more and running a charm offensive along the lines of 'come on folks, this is just Assassin's Creed, you all like that'.</p><p>On one hand, it's exactly how you'd expect a company to paint a their response to what was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-warn-staff-not-to-celebrate-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-as-part-of-anti-harassment-plan">overwhelmingly a lot of online dickheads</a> being angry that Yasuke existed, was black, was a samurai, and was in a video game. On the other, it's sigh-inducing that this retelling seemingly left out or minimised elements like how Assassin's Creed lead Marc-Alexis Coté, who's since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">departed Ubisoft</a>, actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">defended his team's vision</a> for the game, in contrast to Guillemot's declaration that it was just a bit of brains-off entertainment.</p>
<p>There's also the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-an-assassins-creed-set-in-post-civil-war-america-due-to-us-politics-and-yasuke-backlash">reported cancellation</a> of an Assassin’s Creed set in post-Civil War America back in 2024, over execs' concerns about the US' current political climate. Apparently that was one battle in which Ubisoft didn't back themselves to "fire up allies" and defeat what the marketing video reportedly called "the loudest haters".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dante’s Inferno 2 was expected to be the successor to EA’s new hack-and-slash franchise at the time. For whatever reason, it never happened, and it’s been on the shelf for the last 15 years. While some bits and pieces have come out over the years, we’ve now gotten a proper look at the canceled ‘Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio’&nbsp;title.</p>



<p>Dante’s Inferno was touted as the next big hack-and-slash game to rival the likes of God of War and Devil May Cry—it also looked and played a lot like the former. We used it in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-to-play-like-ninja-gaiden-4-top-hack-and-slash-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best games to play like Ninja Gaiden 4 list</a>, and despite the God of War comparisons, Dante’s Inferno reviewed decently, sold respectably, before a potential Dante’s Inferno 2 disappeared off the face of the Earth…until now.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-s-inferno-2-would-have-been-the-second-game-in-a-trilogy">Dante’s Inferno 2 Would Have Been The Second Game In A Trilogy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dante of War. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Dante’s Inferno saw Dante—a Templar Knight—battle through horrible monsters and bosses through the Nine Circles of Hell. Its combat, nifty camera angles, puzzles, and bosses were reminiscent of God of War.</p>



<p>A full report from IGN has dug deep into history and uncovered many lost tidbits about Dante’s Inferno 2. It includes screenshots, concept drawings, and how the game’s story would unfold—as well as a third game!</p>



<p>‘<strong>Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio</strong>‘ was the official title for the second game. IGN says it had: “A 240-page script penned by Assassin’s Creed 2 co-writer Joshua Rubin that outlines every stage, boss battle, and plot point planned for Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio.”</p>



<p>The sequel would also have shifted away from the God of War influences and looked to forge its own identity.</p>



<p>IGN’s report outlines and details every single level throughout the game, with the Seven Sins being a huge aspect, and how Dante would climb Mount Purgatory. Furthermore: “Visceral planned for Dante’s Inferno 2 to include <strong>co-op and multiplayer modes</strong>.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>What a ride it could’ve been. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another document uncovered finds that the sequel’s conclusion would set up the events of “Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso.” You can check out more details and screenshots in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>‘s full findings.</p>

            <p>Set photos from the upcoming Resident Evil film from Weapons director Zach Cregger show a very snowy Raccoon City.</p>
<p>Filming for the adaptation kicked off earlier this year in Prague, and now thanks to <a href="https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2025/11/3/photos-resident-evil-blankets-pragues-karlin-neighborhood-in-snow-for-key-action-scene/">The Prague Reporter</a> we can all take a little peek at what Cregger is cooking up for us all. The snow dusting the streets on the set suggests that the film will be set during the winter season in Raccoon City, a key location in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">lends credence to an earlier rumour regarding the adaptation's plot</a> (I won't spoil it here).</p>

<p>As you can see in the images below, Cregger's take on Resident Evil features an establishment called Oak Street Diner. This could be a little nod to Tall Oaks, a town in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a>. One of the bus signs also points to Central Station, which pops up in the games.</p>
<p>"In the Karlín neighborhood of Prague 8, an action scene involving snow, gunfire, explosions, and fast driving was filmed from Oct. 29-Nov. 2," the publication wrote. "Residents and visitors passing through the area were greeted with a light cover of snow throughout the week as production on Resident Evil took place primarily during the night hours."</p>

<p>Cregger previously confirmed his take on the Resident Evil film will tell an original story, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-resident-evil-film-lives-in-the-world-of-re2-and-re3-but-with-the-tone-of-4">but will still be "true to the experience of the games"</a>. At this time, he added the film "lives" in the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 3. That being said, Cregger said his adaptation "adheres more to the tone of 4". The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">filmmaker has not seen any of the previous Resident Evil film adaptations himself</a>.</p>
<p>Cregger - whose other work includes 2022's Barbarian, which our Matt describes as "wonderfully unpredictable" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">was first announced to be helming the next Resident Evil movie in March of this year</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming Resident Evil film is expected to be released on 18th September, 2026.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/DAVE-THE-DIVER-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2957273.html">eShop listing</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition offers "higher resolution and improved frame rates", while the content of the game remains unchanged between the consoles. Dave's diving escapades didn't feel like they <em>needed</em> a boost in this department, but smoother swimming is always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>Those with Dave the Diver on Switch 1 can upgrade to this new version for free. Alternatively, you can pick up the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> (a discount on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> brings that down to $11.99 until 13th November).</p>
<p>Developer Mintrocket teased that the update would be coming "soon" back in June, so it's nice to see that promise finally materialise.</p>
<p>We awarded Dave the Diver an 'Excellent' 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dave-the-diver">our review</a>, calling it one of the few 2023 games "that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". If you still haven't dived in, now might be a good excuse to do so.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the biggest and most anticipated releases on the horizon in 2025, and we’ve got all the details on when you can preload the game to jump into the action.</p>



<p>After achieving vast success in China, Where Winds Meet <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases globally on November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC and PlayStation 5</a> as a console exclusive title, with millions of players already pre-registering for the game.</p>



<p>If you can’t contain your excitement and want to preload Where Winds Meet in advance so you can dive straight into the game on launch, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-where-winds-meet">When Can You Preload Where Winds Meet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nearly there. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available from November 12 at 2 PM PT, NetEase has confirmed to Insider Gaming.</strong></p>



<p>This gives you plenty of time to download Where Winds Meet in advance for launch, and preloading is recommended due to the large file size and the fact that servers will likely be stretched by an influx of players the moment the game goes live.</p>



<p>The table below shows when preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Where Winds Meet Preload Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Nov. 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-winds-meet-file-size-explained">Where Winds Meet File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Exact file sizes for Where Winds Meet depend on your platform, with PC users having several options to download, while PlayStation 5 has a single version.</strong></p>



<p>Users on PC have three different versions to choose from, with the Lite version clocking in at 68 GB, the Standard version requiring around 100 GB of space, and the Ultimate version requiring 120 GB—though the Ultimate version of the game may not be available immediately.</p>



<p>For PlayStation 5 players, the download size is around 108 GB total, and there are no other options for the download. </p>



<p>Bear in mind that these sizes are subject to change and could increase with day-one patches.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-where-winds-meet">How to Preload Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to preload Where Winds Meet, you can do so by visiting your platform store once the preload has been made available.</strong></p>



<p>On Steam, simply search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the store and find the preload option, which is available without needing to spend any additional cash due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title’s free-to-play status</a>.</p>



<p>The approach on PlayStation 5 is similar, requiring you to search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the PS Store, though make sure you click the right version, as there is a paid-for pre-order edition that provides additional rewards. If you just want the free-to-play version, make sure you select it.</p>
